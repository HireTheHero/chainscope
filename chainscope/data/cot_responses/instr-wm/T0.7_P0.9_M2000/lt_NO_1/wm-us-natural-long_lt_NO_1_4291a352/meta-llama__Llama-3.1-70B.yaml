      and Garnet Lake are located. Marlboro Mountains are located in Ulster County,
      New York, while Garnet Lake is situated in the Adirondack Mountains, also in
      New York.


      2. **Geographical Context**: The Adirondack Mountains are generally north of
      Ulster County, where Marlboro Mountains are located. Garnet Lake, being part
      of the Adirondacks, is also in the northern part of New York.


      3. **Comparative Location**: Given that Garnet Lake is in the Adirondack Mountains,
      which are north of Marlboro Mountains, it''s unlikely that Marlboro Mountains
      would be directly west of Garnet Lake. However, without specific coordinates,
      we can''t be absolutely certain.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography, it''s unlikely that Marlboro
      Mountains are west of Garnet Lake. Instead, they are more likely to be south
      or southwest of Garnet Lake.

      is located west of Horseshoe Lake (Washington), WA, let''s break it down into
      steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to know where both lakes are located.
      Packwood Lake is situated in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Lewis County,
      Washington. Horseshoe Lake (Washington) is located in Pierce County, Washington,
      near the town of Eatonville.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Washington State is situated in the Pacific Northwest
      region of the United States. It''s generally understood that the western part
      of the state is closer to the Pacific Ocean, while the eastern part is closer
      to the Cascade Range and Idaho.


      3. **Comparative Location**: Now, let''s compare the locations of the two lakes.
      Packwood Lake is in the southern part of Washington, close to the Cascade Range.
      Horseshoe Lake is also in the southern part of the state but is further west,
      closer to the Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general understanding of Washington''s geography
      and the locations of the two lakes, Packwood Lake is more to the east of the
      state, while Horseshoe Lake is more to the west. Therefore, Packwood Lake is
      not located west of Horseshoe Lake (Washington).


      In summary, the answer to the question "Is Packwood Lake, WA located west of
      Horseshoe Lake (Washington), WA?" is: $\boxed{NO}$

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand where the Iowa River
      in Iowa and the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas are located. The Iowa River flows
      through the state of Iowa, while the Ouachita Mountains are located in the state
      of Arkansas.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Iowa is a Midwestern state, and Arkansas is a Southern
      state. Generally, states in the Midwest are located to the west of states in
      the South.


      3. **Compare Directions**: To determine if the Iowa River is west of the Ouachita
      Mountains, we need to consider their relative positions. The Iowa River flows
      eastward, while the Ouachita Mountains are located in the western part of Arkansas.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Iowa is a Midwestern state and Arkansas is a Southern
      state, and considering the directions in which the Iowa River flows and the
      location of the Ouachita Mountains, we can infer that the Iowa River is indeed
      west of the Ouachita Mountains.

      Trillium Lake and Rattlesnake Lake. Trillium Lake is located in Oregon, specifically
      in the Mount Hood National Forest. Rattlesnake Lake is located in Washington,
      specifically in the Cascade Mountains.


      2. **Understand Geography**: The geography of the Pacific Northwest region is
      crucial. Both Oregon and Washington are located in the Pacific Northwest region
      of the United States. Generally, Washington is north of Oregon.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Now, we need to compare the positions of Trillium
      Lake and Rattlesnake Lake. Trillium Lake is in Oregon, which is south of Washington,
      where Rattlesnake Lake is located. Since west is the direction left on a map
      when facing north, and Oregon is south of Washington, Trillium Lake would be
      more to the east of Rattlesnake Lake.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the geography of the Pacific Northwest and the relative
      positions of Oregon and Washington, Trillium Lake is not west of Rattlesnake
      Lake. Instead, Trillium Lake is more to the east of Rattlesnake Lake.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Trillium Lake, OR is located west of Rattlesnake
      Lake, WA is: **NO**'

      body of water that once covered much of southern Wisconsin, we can infer its
      general location was in the southern part of the state.


      3. **Lake Delton''s Location**: Lake Delton is situated in the Wisconsin Dells
      area, which is more towards the central part of Wisconsin but leans towards
      the southern half of the state.


      4. **Comparative Location**: To determine if Lake Delton is west of the area
      once covered by Glacial Lake Wisconsin, we need to consider the geography of
      Wisconsin. Glacial Lake Wisconsin''s boundaries would have varied, but it generally
      covered areas that are now in the southern and central parts of the state. Wisconsin
      Dells, where Lake Delton is located, is west of the areas that would have been

      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Lake Delton is in the Wisconsin Dells area and
      considering the prehistoric extent of Glacial Lake Wisconsin, Lake Delton would
      indeed be located west of where Glacial Lake Wisconsin once was, especially
      when considering the lake''s eastern boundaries.

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Lake
      Verret in Louisiana and Lake Wissota in Wisconsin. Lake Verret is situated in
      south-central Louisiana, specifically in the Atchafalaya Basin. Lake Wissota,
      on the other hand, is located in northwestern Wisconsin, near the city of Chippewa
      Falls.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Louisiana is located in the southern part of the
      United States, while Wisconsin is in the northern part. Within their respective
      states, Lake Verret is in the southern part of Louisiana, and Lake Wissota is
      in the northwestern part of Wisconsin.


      3. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Lake Verret is west of Lake Wissota,
      we need to consider the general west-east positioning of the states. Since Louisiana
      is to the south of Wisconsin, and the lakes are in the southern and northwestern
      parts of their states, it''s unlikely that Lake Verret would be directly west
      of Lake Wissota.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations of both lakes and the
      states they are in, Lake Verret in Louisiana is likely not west of Lake Wissota
      in Wisconsin. However, without specific coordinates, we can''t say for sure
      without a map.


      Given these steps and the general geography, the answer would be: **NO**'

      the process step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: Christmas Mountains are located in the Trans-Pecos
      region of Texas, specifically in the western part of the state. Horse Thief
      Lake is situated in Custer County, South Dakota, in the western part of the
      state.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Texas is located in the southern part of the
      United States, while South Dakota is in the northern central part.


      3. **Directional Comparison**: Since Texas is south of South Dakota, any location
      in Texas would be south of a location in South Dakota.


      4. **Westward Direction**: The question specifically asks if Christmas Mountains
      are west of Horse Thief Lake. Since they are in different states and Christmas
      Mountains are south of Horse Thief Lake, it''s unlikely that they are also west
      of each other.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations and the fact that Texas
      is south of South Dakota, Christmas Mountains in Texas are not located west
      of Horse Thief Lake in South Dakota.

      the other hand, is also in the Presidential Range, situated between Mount Monroe
      and Mount Eisenhower.


      3. **Consider Mountain Orientation**: Since Mount Franklin is situated between
      Mount Monroe and Mount Eisenhower, it implies that Mount Franklin is closer
      to Mount Eisenhower and slightly east of Mount Monroe.


      4. **Compare Directions**: Given that Mount Franklin is closer to Mount Eisenhower,
      which is east of Mount Monroe, we can infer that Mount Franklin is also east
      of Mount Monroe.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the above steps, it is clear that Mount Monroe,
      NH is not located west of Mount Franklin, NH. Instead, Mount Franklin is located
      east of Mount Monroe.

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Mount Monroe and
      Mount Franklin are located. Both are located in the state of New Hampshire in
      the northeastern United States.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: New Hampshire is generally an east-west oriented
      state. It''s important to note that the state''s mountains, including the Presidential
      Range where these peaks are located, generally run in a north-south direction.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Mount Monroe is located in the White Mountains region
      of New Hampshire. Mount Franklin is also in the White Mountains, but it''s slightly
      south of Mount Monroe.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Given that both mountains are in the same mountain
      range and in the same state, their relative positions are key. Mount Monroe
      is to the north of Mount Franklin.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since New Hampshire''s geography is generally east-west,
      and the mountains run north-south, being north of a peak means it''s also west
      of it (since north is to the left when facing west). Therefore, Mount Monroe
      is indeed located west of Mount Franklin.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Mount Monroe, NH is located west

      is located west of Indian Valley Reservoir, CA, we need to break down the problem
      step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Gravelly Lake and
      Indian Valley Reservoir are located. Gravelly Lake is in Washington state, specifically
      in Pierce County. Indian Valley Reservoir is in California, located in Lake
      County.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: California and Washington are neighboring states
      on the West Coast of the United States. Washington is generally north of California.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Gravelly Lake is in the western part of Washington
      state, near the city of Tacoma. Indian Valley Reservoir is in the northern part
      of California, near the town of Clearlake Oaks.


      4. **Comparative Analysis**: Considering the geographical orientation and the
      specific locations of Gravelly Lake and Indian Valley Reservoir, we can infer
      that Gravelly Lake is indeed west of Indian Valley Reservoir. Washington, where

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand where Wapack Range,
      NH, and Brooks Pond (Massachusetts), MA are located. Wapack Range is a mountain
      range in southern New Hampshire, while Brooks Pond is a lake in western Massachusetts.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Knowing that Wapack Range is in southern New Hampshire
      and Brooks Pond is in western Massachusetts, we can infer their general locations
      relative to each other.


      3. **Determine Directions**: To determine if Wapack Range is west of Brooks
      Pond, we need to consider their geographical positions. Wapack Range is in the
      southern part of New Hampshire, while Brooks Pond is in the western part of
      Massachusetts. New Hampshire is generally north of Massachusetts.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on their geographical locations, Wapack Range is generally
      north of Brooks Pond, not west of it. However, without precise coordinates,
      we can''t be 100% sure without a map. But considering the general geography,
      Wapack Range is more likely to be north or northeast of Brooks Pond rather than
      directly west.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand what and where Canada
      Lake and Tupper Lake (New York) are. Canada Lake is a lake located in the Adirondack
      Mountains in upstate New York. Tupper Lake (New York) is a village and a lake
      in the same region.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Knowing that both Canada Lake and Tupper Lake are
      in the Adirondack Mountains, we can infer their general locations within the
      state of New York.


      3. **Comparative Location**: To determine if Canada Lake is west of Tupper Lake,
      we need to consider the geography of the Adirondack Mountains. Without precise
      coordinates, we can''t be 100% sure, but we can make a reasonable guess based
      on the general knowledge of the region.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both Canada Lake and Tupper Lake are in the Adirondack
      Mountains and considering the general orientation of the region, it is unlikely
      that Canada Lake is located west of Tupper Lake. The Adirondacks are oriented
      more north-south than east-west, so it''s more likely that Canada Lake is either
      north or south of Tupper Lake.


      Therefore, based on the geographical locations and the general knowledge of
      the Adirondack region, the answer to whether Canada Lake, NY is located west
      of Tupper Lake (New York), NY is: **NO**'

      the Adirondack Park in New York. Tupper Lake (New York) is a larger lake also
      located in the Adirondack Park.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Both Canada Lake and Tupper Lake are situated within
      the Adirondack Park, which is in northern New York State. The Adirondack Park
      is a vast area of mountains and forests.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Canada Lake is located in the southern part of the
      Adirondack Park, while Tupper Lake is in the central part. Tupper Lake is considered
      one of the larger lakes in the Adirondacks.


      4. **Comparative Location**: To determine if Canada Lake is west of Tupper Lake,
      we need to consider their positions within the Adirondack Park. Canada Lake
      is to the south of Tupper Lake, which means it''s not directly west.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Canada Lake is south of Tupper Lake and not directly
      west, we can conclude that Canada Lake is not located west of Tupper Lake (New

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand the locations of Boundary
      Pass, WA, and Henry Hagg Lake, OR. Boundary Pass is a strait located in the
      Pacific Northwest, between the United States and Canada. Henry Hagg Lake is
      a reservoir located in Washington County, Oregon.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Since Boundary Pass is a strait between the US
      and Canada, it''s on the northern border of Washington state. Henry Hagg Lake
      is in Oregon, which is south of Washington.


      3. **Comparative Location**: To determine if Boundary Pass is west of Henry
      Hagg Lake, we need to consider their relative positions on the map. Oregon is
      generally west of Washington, but we need to consider the specific locations.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Boundary Pass is located in the northernmost part
      of Washington, while Henry Hagg Lake is in the western part of Oregon. The two
      locations are separated by the Cascade Range, which runs north-south.
