      - It''s on the western edge of Rocky Mountain National Park


      2. Next, I''ll locate Never Summer Mountains:

      to south:

      - Mount Franklin is located between Mount Monroe and Mount Pleasant

      - Mount Monroe is located between Mount Washington and Mount Franklin


      4. Therefore, Mount Monroe is located NORTH of Mount Franklin.


      5. Since the range runs north-south, and Mount Monroe is north of Mount Franklin,
      Mount Monroe cannot be west of Mount Franklin.

      change the overall east-west relationship between them


      4) Since Ohio is west of Georgia, and the lakes'' specific locations within
      their states don''t change this relationship, Indian Lake must be west of Lake
      Winfield Scott.
