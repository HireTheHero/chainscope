    549710dd-7b7c-4f69-ba30-2b9d18d90773: '1. **Locate Wellsville Mountains, UT**:
      The Wellsville Mountains are in northern Utah, near the city of Logan. They
      are part of the Wasatch Range and are located in Cache County.


      2. **Locate Otter Creek Reservoir, UT**: Otter Creek Reservoir is in central
      Utah, in Piute County. It is situated southeast of the town of Richfield.


      3. **Compare their relative positions**: The Wellsville Mountains are in the
      northern part of the state, while Otter Creek Reservoir is farther south. Since
      the Wellsville Mountains are much farther north, we now check their east-west
      relationship.


      4. **Determine east-west positioning**: The Wellsville Mountains are located
      in northern Utah, near the Idaho border, while Otter Creek Reservoir is in central
      Utah. Given that the Wasatch Range tends to run north-south and the Wellsville
      Mountains are on the western side of the range, they are positioned west of
      most of central Utah.

      \ Lake is located in Lewis County, Washington, near the town of Packwood.\n\
      \   - It lies in the Cascade Mountain range, east of the town of Packwood.\n\

      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Vermont is generally located to the
      north of Massachusetts. More specifically, Camel''s Hump is in central Vermont,
      and Otis Reservoir is in western Massachusetts.


      4. **Relative west-east positioning**: Camel''s Hump, VT, is farther west compared
      to Otis Reservoir, MA, because the Green Mountains run north-south through Vermont,
      and Camel''s Hump is located in the central-western part of the state. Meanwhile,
      Otis Reservoir, though in western Massachusetts, is still east of the Green
      Mountains.
