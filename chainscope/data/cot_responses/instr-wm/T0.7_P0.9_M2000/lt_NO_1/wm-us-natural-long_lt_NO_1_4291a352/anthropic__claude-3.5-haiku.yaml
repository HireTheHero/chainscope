      1. First, let''s locate Siltcoos Lake, OR:

      - Siltcoos Lake is located on the Oregon coast

      - Specifically, it''s in Lane County, near Florence, Oregon

      - It''s west of the Coast Range, close to the Pacific Ocean


      2. Next, let''s locate Ozette Lake, WA:

      - Ozette Lake is located in Olympic National Park in Washington state

      - It''s on the Olympic Peninsula

      - It''s also near the Pacific coast, but further north than Siltcoos Lake


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Siltcoos Lake is in Oregon, south of the Washington border

      - Ozette Lake is in Washington, north of the Oregon border

      - Oregon is south of Washington along the Pacific coast


      4. Determining their relative west/east positions:

      - Since Siltcoos Lake is further south along the coast, it would be east of
      Ozette Lake


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Siltcoos Lake, OR is NOT located west of Ozette
      Lake, WA.'

      1. First, I''ll locate the Southern Rocky Mountains in Colorado

      2. Then, I''ll locate the Park Range in Colorado

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: The Southern Rocky Mountains are a mountain region in southern Colorado,
      covering parts of central and southern Colorado.


      Step 2: The Park Range is located in northwestern Colorado, in the northern
      part of the state.


      Step 3: Since the Southern Rocky Mountains are in southern Colorado and the
      Park Range is in northwestern Colorado, the Southern Rocky Mountains are located
      EAST of the Park Range.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO


      The Southern Rocky Mountains are NOT located west of Park Range (Colorado),

      1. First, locate Soap Lake, WA:

      - Soap Lake is in central Washington state

      - It is located in Grant County, in the eastern part of Washington


      2. Next, locate Mirror Lake, CA:

      - Mirror Lake is in California

      - However, I would need to verify its specific location within California


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Washington state is north of California

      1. First, I''ll locate Baldwin Lake in Los Angeles County, California

      2. Then, I''ll locate Diaz Lake

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: Baldwin Lake is located in the Mojave Desert region of San Bernardino
      County, California (not Los Angeles County as the question suggests)


      Step 2: Diaz Lake is located in Inyo County, California, near Lone Pine


      Step 3: Comparing their geographic positions:

      - Baldwin Lake is in the eastern part of California

      - Diaz Lake is also in eastern California, but further north and west of Baldwin
      Lake


      Therefore, Baldwin Lake is EAST of Diaz Lake, not west.


      The answer is: NO'
