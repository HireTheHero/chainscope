      3. **West vs. East:** Since Wrights Lake is southwest of Lake Tahoe and Donner
      Lake is north/northeast of Lake Tahoe, Wrights Lake is indeed west of Donner

      Lake and Donner Lake are in the Tahoe region of California.

      2. **Relative positions:**  Donner Lake is north of Lake Tahoe, and generally
      to the west of the main Sierra Nevada crest. Wrights Lake is south-west of Lake
      Tahoe and also west of the crest.  This makes the east/west comparison a bit
      trickier.

      3. **More precise location:** Thinking about the highway system, Donner Lake
      is right off I-80. To reach Wrights Lake, you go further south on Highway 50
      and then turn off towards Desolation Wilderness.  This places Wrights Lake further
      south AND west of Donner Lake.

      is located on the Colorado River, where it forms the border between California
      and Arizona, near the town of Topock, Arizona.


      2. **Locate Imperial Reservoir:** Imperial Reservoir is also on the Colorado
      River, but further south, near Yuma, Arizona.


      3. **Determine relative positions:**  Since Yuma (and therefore Imperial Reservoir)
      is south of Topock, the question of west/east is more relevant.  Looking at
      a map shows Topock Gorge is slightly west of Imperial Reservoir.


      **YES**

    20928be4-bdb7-4f5b-bc5d-b6ca57489ee0: '1. **Locate Topock Gorge:** Topock Gorge
      is located on the Colorado River where it forms the border between California
      and Arizona.  It''s near the town of Topock, Arizona.


      2. **Locate Imperial Reservoir:** Imperial Reservoir (also known as Imperial
      Dam) is further south on the Colorado River, also on the California-Arizona
      border.


      3. **Determine relative positions:**  Since the Colorado River generally flows
      south in this area, and Topock Gorge is upstream/north of Imperial Reservoir,
      Topock Gorge is *not* west of Imperial Reservoir. It''s more accurately described
      as north or northwest.


      **Answer:** NO

    4346f0e4-afb7-4359-ad63-531d7268ce33: '1. **Locate Topock Gorge:** Topock Gorge
      is located on the Colorado River, on the border between California and Arizona,
      near the town of Topock, Arizona.


      2. **Locate Imperial Reservoir:** Imperial Reservoir is also on the Colorado
      River, but further south, along the border between California and Arizona.


      3. **Relative Position:** Topock Gorge is upstream (north) of Imperial Reservoir
      on the Colorado River.  Generally, north corresponds to eastward progression
      of longitude lines, but since the river flows roughly south-southeast in this
      region, Topock Gorge is actually slightly *west* of Imperial Reservoir.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

    44ad8b4d-67f7-4228-bb10-85bd49217019: '1. **Locate Topock Gorge:** Topock Gorge
      is on the Colorado River where it forms the border between California and Arizona,
      near Needles, California, and Lake Havasu City, Arizona.


      2. **Locate Imperial Reservoir:** Imperial Reservoir is on the Colorado River
      along the California-Arizona border, south of Yuma, Arizona.


      3. **Relative Positions:**  Yuma and the Imperial Reservoir are significantly
      south of Needles and Lake Havasu City. Therefore, Topock Gorge is north/northwest
      of the Imperial Reservoir.


      4. **West vs. Northwest:** While Topock Gorge is northwest of Imperial Reservoir,
      the question asks if it''s *west*.  Northwest is a combination of north and
      west.


      5. **Conclusion:** Topock Gorge is northwest but not strictly west of the Imperial
      Reservoir.


      NO

    59f2bc26-093a-4e98-9b08-ab581894b046: '1. **Locate Topock Gorge, AZ:** Topock
      Gorge is located on the Arizona/California border along the Colorado River.


      2. **Locate Imperial Reservoir, AZ:** Imperial Reservoir is also on the  Arizona/California
      border along the Colorado River.


      3. **Determine the direction of the Colorado River''s flow:** The Colorado River
      flows generally from east to west in this area. Topock Gorge is downstream from
      Imperial Reservoir.


      4. **Downstream on a West-flowing river:**  Downstream on a west-flowing river
      means further west.


      Therefore, Topock Gorge is west of Imperial Reservoir.

    9cd1bdda-b0c6-4e70-ba0a-f69deb01ee68: '1. **Locate Topock Gorge:** Topock Gorge

      and Arizona, near the town of Topock, Arizona.


      2. **Locate Imperial Reservoir:** Imperial Reservoir is also located along the
      Colorado River, but further south, near the city of Yuma, Arizona.


      3. **Relative Positions:** Yuma and Imperial Reservoir are south and slightly
      east of Topock, AZ.


      4. **West/East Determination:** Since Topock Gorge is further north along a
      roughly north-south flowing river than Imperial Reservoir, Topock Gorge is not
      west of the Reservoir.

    a21233c9-0662-4409-8ac4-fdd67882572c: '1. **Locate Topock Gorge:** Topock Gorge

      2. **Locate Imperial Reservoir:** Imperial Reservoir is also located along the
      Colorado River, but further south, mostly within California and extending slightly
      into Arizona.


      3. **Relative Position:**  Since the Colorado River generally flows south, and
      Topock Gorge is north of Imperial Reservoir along the river, Topock Gorge is
      *east* of Imperial Reservoir, not west.

    a3955015-9ed6-4eee-b9f3-adfee1ebf54f: '1. **Locate Topock Gorge:** Topock Gorge
      is located on the Colorado River where it forms the border between California
      and Arizona.  It is generally considered to be near the town of Topock, Arizona.


      2. **Locate Imperial Reservoir:** Imperial Reservoir is also located on the
      Colorado River, but further south, essentially straddling the border between
      California and Arizona.


      3. **Relative Positions:** Thinking of a map, or visualizing the flow of the
      Colorado River, Topock is upstream (north) of the Imperial Reservoir.  Since
      north is generally associated with upward on a map, and west is leftward, Topock
      Gorge would need to be significantly angled to be west of the reservoir.  Given
      that the river flows roughly south-southeast in this region, Topock Gorge is
      northeast of Imperial Reservoir.


      **NO**

    b6fac234-5c52-44be-a759-9f0068037dac: '1. **Locate Topock Gorge, AZ:** Topock
      Gorge is located on the Colorado River where it forms the border between California
      and Arizona, just north of Lake Havasu.


      2. **Locate Imperial Reservoir, AZ:** Imperial Reservoir is located on the Colorado
      River along the border between California and Arizona, south of Yuma, AZ.


      3. **Compare their positions relative to each other along the Colorado River:**
      The Colorado River flows roughly south-to-north in this section. Since Yuma
      is south of Lake Havasu, Imperial Reservoir is south of Topock Gorge.


      4. **West/East vs. North/South:** While the river bends, the general direction
      from Imperial Reservoir to Topock Gorge is north.  The question asks about West/East.
      Topock Gorge is slightly west, but mostly north of the Imperial Reservoir.


      5. **Answer the Question:** The question is specifically about west. Though
      mostly north, Topock Gorge *is* also west of Imperial Reservoir.


      **YES**

      4. **West or East?:** Since Lake Delton is near the *eastern* edge of the former
      Glacial Lake Wisconsin, it cannot be west of it.


      **NO**

      2. **Locate Glacial Lake Wisconsin:** Glacial Lake Wisconsin was a prehistoric
      proglacial lake.  Its remnants are most prominently seen in the Wisconsin Dells
      area, also in Sauk County.


      3. **Relative Positions:**  While both are associated with the same general
      area, Lake Delton is essentially *within* the footprint of what *was* Glacial
      Lake Wisconsin.  It''s not west of it.

      with the westernmost part of North Carolina.  However, Watauga Lake and the
      Black Mountains are not situated in these extreme locations.

      border.


      2. **Locate Luna Lake:** Luna Lake is in Apache County, Arizona.


      3. **Determine relative position:**  New Mexico is east of Arizona.  Therefore,
      something in New Mexico would generally be east of something in Arizona.  While
      the Peloncillo Mountains are *on* the border, the prompt specifies the New Mexico
      portion.


      4. **Consider border complexities:**  While the border generally runs north-south,
      it can have variations.  However, even with variations, the New Mexico portion
      of the Peloncillos would still be east of something entirely within Arizona.
