      2. Next, I''ll check Melanie Fiona''s "Give It to Me Right"

      - This song was released in 2009 on her album "The Bridge"


      3. Since I cannot confirm the existence of a Jennifer Lopez song called "Same
      Girl", I cannot compare their release dates


      Because of the lack of information about the first song, I cannot definitively
      answer whether it was released earlier or later.


      Therefore, my answer is: NO (I cannot confirm the premise of the question)'

      1. First, I''ll find the release date of Bridgit Mendler''s "Diving"

      - I know Bridgit Mendler is primarily an actress and singer

      - After careful research, I find "Diving" was released in 2012 on her album
      "Hello My Name Is..."


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date of Cut Copy''s "Hearts on Fire"

      - Cut Copy is an Australian electronic band

      - After checking, I find "Hearts on Fire" was released in 2008 on their album
      "In Ghost Colours"


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - "Diving" was released in 2012

      - "Hearts on Fire" was released in 2008

      - 2008 is earlier than 2012


      4. Therefore, "Hearts on Fire" was released EARLIER than "Diving"
