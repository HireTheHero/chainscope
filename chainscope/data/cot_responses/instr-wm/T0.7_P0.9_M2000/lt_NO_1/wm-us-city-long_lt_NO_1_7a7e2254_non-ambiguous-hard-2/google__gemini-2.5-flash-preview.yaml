      generally east of Michigan, a specific city in New Jersey is likely to be east
      of a specific city in Michigan.

      4.  **Consider potential exceptions:** Could a city in Western New Jersey be
      west of a city in Eastern Michigan? While possible in theory for states that
      share a border running north-south, NJ and MI are far apart. The general west-to-east
      orientation of the US and the relative positions of the states make this highly
      improbable.

      5.  **Confirm with a map or coordinate check (mental or actual):** Summit, NJ
      is near the eastern edge of the US. Essexville, MI is further inland. Summit,
      NJ is clearly east of Essexville, MI.

      6.  **Formulate the answer to the question:** The question asks if Summit, NJ
      is *west* of Essexville, MI. Since Summit, NJ is east of Essexville, MI, the
      answer is no.

      5.  **Consider specific locations:** Lake Panorama is in west-central Iowa.
      Crowell is in northern Texas. Even considering these more specific locations
      within their states, Iowa remains generally northeast of Texas.

      6.  **Compare longitudes:** Lake Panorama, IA is roughly around 94.5 degrees
      West longitude. Crowell, TX is roughly around 99.8 degrees West longitude.

      7.  **Compare longitudes to determine East/West:** A larger West longitude number
      means a location is further west. 99.8 is greater than 94.5. Therefore, Crowell,
      TX is west of Lake Panorama, IA.

      8.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Lake Panorama, IA is *west*
      of Crowell, TX. Based on the longitude calculation (and the general geography),

      2.  **Determine the states:** Quentin is in Pennsylvania (PA). Portageville
      is in Missouri (MO).

      3.  **Visualize/Recall the geography of the US:** Pennsylvania is located in
      the northeastern part of the United States. Missouri is located more centrally
      in the United States, west of the Mississippi River.

      4.  **Compare relative positions:** States in the Northeast are generally located
      significantly east of states in the Midwest like Missouri. Therefore, any location
      in Pennsylvania will be east of any location in Missouri, assuming the locations
      are roughly within their respective state''s latitudinal range (which is the
      case here).

      \ the question: \"Is Cedar Crest, MA located west of Stirling, NJ?\"\n\n1. \
      \ **Identify the core question:** The question asks about the relative east-west\
      \ position of two specific locations: Cedar Crest, MA, and Stirling, NJ.\n\n\
      2.  **Identify the key locations:**\n    *   Cedar Crest, MA\n    *   Stirling,\
      \ NJ\n\n3.  **Determine the need for location data:** To answer if one place\
      \ is west of another, I need to know their approximate geographic locations,\
      \ specifically their longitudes.\n\n4.  **Recall/Look up the location of Stirling,\
      \ NJ:**\n    *   Stirling is a census-designated place (CDP) in Long Hill Township,\
      \ Morris County, New Jersey.\n    *   Its approximate coordinates are around\
      \ 40.64\xB0 N, **74.49\xB0 W**.\n\n5.  **Recall/Look up the location of Cedar\
      \ Crest, MA:**\n    *   Cedar Crest is likely a specific community, development,\
      \ or facility within Massachusetts. A quick search reveals that \"Cedar Crest\"\
      \ is a common name, but the most prominent *residential community* named Cedar\
      \ Crest in Massachusetts is an assisted living/retirement community in *East\
      \ Longmeadow, MA*.\n    *   Let's assume the question refers to Cedar Crest\
      \ in East Longmeadow, MA, as it's the most likely prominent location by that\
      \ name in MA.\n    *   East Longmeadow is in Hampden County, Massachusetts.\n\
      \    *   Its approximate coordinates are around 42.05\xB0 N, **72.53\xB0 W**.\n\
      \n6.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *   Stirling, NJ: ~74.49\xB0 W\n    *\
      \   Cedar Crest (East Longmeadow), MA: ~72.53\xB0 W\n\n7.  **Understand the\
      \ relationship between longitude and east/west:**\n    *   Lines of longitude\
      \ (meridians) run north-south.\n    *   Longitude values increase as you move\
      \ *west* from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0).\n    *   A location with a *larger*\
      \ West longitude value is *further west* than a location with a *smaller* West\
      \ longitude value.\n\n8.  **Perform the comparison:**\n    *   Is 72.53\xB0\
      \ W larger than 74.49\xB0 W? No, 72.53 is smaller than 74.49.\n    *   Therefore,\
      \ Cedar Crest, MA (at ~72.53\xB0 W) is *east* of Stirling, NJ (at ~74.49\xB0\
      \ W).\n\n9.  **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:** The question\
      \ asks if Cedar Crest, MA is *west* of Stirling, NJ. Since Cedar Crest, MA is\
      \ *east* of Stirling, NJ, the answer is NO.\n\n10. **Final Answer Check:**\n\
      \    *   Did I compare the correct locations? Yes (assuming Cedar Crest refers\
      \ to the one in East Longmeadow, MA, which is the most likely candidate).\n\
      \    *   Did I compare the correct geographic property (longitude) for east/west\
      \ determination? Yes.\n    *   Did I correctly interpret the longitude values\
      \ (larger W = further west)? Yes.\n    *   Does the comparison lead to the correct\
      \ answer (is 72.53 W west of 74.49 W)? No, 72.53 W is east of 74.49 W.\n   \
      \ *   Is the final answer a clear YES or NO? Yes.\n\nThis step-by-step process,\
      \ including the crucial step of identifying the specific location of \"Cedar\
      \ Crest, MA\" and looking up coordinates, leads directly to the correct comparison\
      \ and the final YES/NO answer.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{NO}$."

      2.  **Determine the state for each:** Noel is in Missouri (MO). Clint is in
      Texas (TX).

      3.  **Recall or find the general geographical relationship between MO and TX:**
      Missouri is generally north and east of Texas.

      4.  **Consider the specific locations within their states:** While general state
      locations are helpful, specific city locations are more precise. We need to
      compare their longitudes.

      5.  **Find the approximate longitude of Noel, MO:** Noel is in the southwest
      corner of Missouri. Its longitude is roughly -94.4 degrees West.

      6.  **Find the approximate longitude of Clint, TX:** Clint is in West Texas,
      near El Paso. Its longitude is roughly -106.2 degrees West.

      7.  **Compare the longitudes:** -94.4 is greater than -106.2.

      8.  **Interpret longitude in terms of East/West:** Smaller (more negative) longitudes
      are further West. Larger (less negative) longitudes are further East.

      9.  **Conclusion:** Since Noel''s longitude (-94.4) is greater than Clint''s
      longitude (-106.2), Noel is *east* of Clint.

      1.  **Locate Ellenboro, NC:** Ellenboro is in western North Carolina. Its approximate
      longitude is around 81.7 degrees West.

      2.  **Locate Pickensville, AL:** Pickensville is in western Alabama. Its approximate
      longitude is around 88.3 degrees West.

      3.  **Compare Longitudes:** West longitude values increase as you move further
      west from the Prime Meridian (0 degrees).

      4.  **Determine Relative Position:** Since 88.3 is a larger number than 81.7
      (in terms of west longitude), Pickensville, AL is further west than Ellenboro,
      NC.

      5.  **Answer the Question:** The question asks if Ellenboro, NC is *west* of
      Pickensville, AL. Since Pickensville is further west, Ellenboro is *east* of
      Pickensville.


      Therefore, the answer is the opposite of what the question asks.


      The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$.'
