      of New Tazewell, Tennessee and Zavalla, Texas.


      Step 1: Let me recall the general locations of Tennessee and Texas.

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern United States, bordering Kentucky to the
      north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama,
      and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west.

      - Texas is in the south-central United States, bordering Oklahoma to the north,
      Arkansas and Louisiana to the east, Mexico to the southwest, and New Mexico
      to the west.


      Step 2: Comparing the states'' positions, Tennessee is east of Texas.


      Step 3: Since New Tazewell is in Tennessee and Zavalla is in Texas, and Tennessee
      is east of Texas, New Tazewell must be east of Zavalla.


      Step 4: The question asks if New Tazewell is west of Zavalla, which is the opposite
      of what I determined.

      Step 1: I need to determine the geographical locations of Old Miakka, FL and
      Turley, OK.


      Step 2: Old Miakka, Florida is located in Sarasota County in western Florida,
      near the Gulf of Mexico. Florida is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Turley, Oklahoma is located in Tulsa County in northeastern Oklahoma.
      Oklahoma is in the central United States.


      Step 4: To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their
      longitudes. Places with more negative (or less positive) longitude values in
      the Western Hemisphere are further west.


      Step 5: Florida is significantly east of Oklahoma in the United States. The
      entire state of Florida is east of Oklahoma.


      Step 6: Therefore, Old Miakka, FL (in western Florida) is still east of Turley,
      OK (in eastern Oklahoma).

      is further east.

      - The eastern United States generally follows a pattern where northeastern states
      like Rhode Island are actually further east than southeastern states like Georgia.

      - Rhode Island is one of the easternmost states in the US, while Georgia is
      set slightly more to the west.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of Pike Creek Valley, DE and Pennington
      Gap, VA.

      - Pike Creek Valley is in Delaware (DE), which is a state on the eastern seaboard
      of the US.

      - Pennington Gap is in Virginia (VA), which is southwest of Delaware.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Delaware and Virginia.

      - Delaware is located on the Atlantic coast.

      - Virginia is southwest of Delaware, with Maryland in between.


      Step 3: Determine the relative east-west positioning.

      - States on the eastern US coast generally follow a north-south arrangement.

      - Delaware is entirely east of Virginia.

      - Any location in Delaware would be east of locations in Virginia.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific cities.

      - Since Pike Creek Valley is in Delaware, and Pennington Gap is in Virginia,
      Pike Creek Valley must be east of Pennington Gap.

      - Therefore, Pike Creek Valley cannot be west of Pennington Gap.

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of Noank, CT and Vander, NC.

      - Noank is in Connecticut (CT), which is in the northeastern United States.

      - Vander is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the eastern seaboard, south
      of Connecticut.


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning of these states.

      - Connecticut is located in New England, on the east coast.

      - North Carolina is also on the east coast, but further south.

      - When comparing states on the same coast, the east-west relationship depends
      on how the coastline curves.


      Step 3: Analyze the specific east-west positioning.

      - The US eastern coastline curves such that locations further north (like Connecticut)
      tend to be further east than locations in the south (like North Carolina).

      - Connecticut is generally east of the same longitudinal lines that pass through
      North Carolina.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on longitude.

      - Noank, CT is positioned further east than Vander, NC.

      - Therefore, Noank is NOT west of Vander.

      - Minnesota is in the upper Midwest, bordering Canada to the north.

      - Michigan consists of two peninsulas in the Great Lakes region, east of Minnesota.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Michigan cities are generally east of Minnesota cities due to the states''
      relative positions.

      - Fowlerville, MI is likely in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.

      - Biwabik, MN is likely in northeastern Minnesota (based on my knowledge of
      Minnesota geography).
