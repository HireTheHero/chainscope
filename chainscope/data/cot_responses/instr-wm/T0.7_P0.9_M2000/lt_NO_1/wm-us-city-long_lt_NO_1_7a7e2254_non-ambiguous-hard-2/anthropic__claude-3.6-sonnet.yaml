      - Arley is in the western part of Alabama


      3. When comparing states:

      - Alabama is significantly west of Ohio

      - Crittenden is in Kentucky


      2. For east-west positioning, I can use state locations:

      - New York is on the east coast

      - Kentucky is more inland, in the eastern part of the Midwest


      3. Comparing their rough coordinates:

      - Spackenkill, NY is in the Hudson Valley region of eastern New York

      - Crittenden, KY is in northern Kentucky

      - Kentucky lies entirely west of New York state


      4. Therefore, since Spackenkill is in New York, and Kentucky is west of New
      York, Spackenkill must be east of Crittenden.


      NO (Spackenkill is not west of Crittenden)'

      1. First, I need to locate both cities:

      - Spackenkill is in New York state, near Poughkeepsie in the Hudson Valley

      - Crittenden is in Kentucky, located between Cincinnati and Lexington


      2. To determine relative east/west positions, I can use these reference points:

      - New York state is in the eastern US

      - Kentucky is more centrally located, but still in the eastern half of the US

      - The Hudson Valley region of NY is in the eastern part of New York state

      - Crittenden, KY is in the northern part of Kentucky


      3. Looking at their approximate coordinates:

      River

      - Crittenden, KY is significantly further west than the Hudson River area

      Since Spackenkill is in eastern New York while Crittenden is in Kentucky (much
      further west), Spackenkill cannot be west of Crittenden.

      1) First, I need to locate both cities:

      - Minnesota is west of Michigan

      - Michigan is entirely east of Minnesota


      3) Therefore:

      - Any city in Minnesota must be west of any city in Michigan

      - Since Biwabik is in Minnesota and Fowlerville is in Michigan, Biwabik must
      be west of Fowlerville


      4) The question asks if Fowlerville is west of Biwabik

      - This is the opposite of what we determined
