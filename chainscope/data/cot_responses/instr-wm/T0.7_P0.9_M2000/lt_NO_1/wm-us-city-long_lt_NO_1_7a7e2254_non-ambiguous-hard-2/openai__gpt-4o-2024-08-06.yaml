      States, generally around the longitude of approximately 72-73 degrees West.


      2. **Identify the longitude of Vineyards, FL:** Vineyards is located in Florida,
      which is also on the east coast of the United States. It is situated in the
      Naples area, which is around the longitude of approximately 81-82 degrees West.


      3. **Compare the longitudes:** Since 72-73 degrees West (Wading River, NY) is
      less than 81-82 degrees West (Vineyards, FL), Wading River is actually east
      of Vineyards.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Wading River, NY is not located west of Vineyards,
