      1. Identify the geographic locations (specifically, the longitudes) of both
      places.

      2. Compare their longitudes to determine which is farther west.


      **Step 1: Find the longitude of Schall Circle, FL**

      - Schall Circle is a census-designated place in Palm Beach County, Florida.

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States, generally east of most other
      states.

      - Palm Beach County is on the eastern coast of Florida.

      - The approximate longitude of Schall Circle is around **-80.1 degrees**.


      **Step 2: Find the longitude of Florissant, MO**

      - Florissant is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri.

      - Missouri is located in the central United States.

      - The approximate longitude of Florissant is around **-90.3 degrees**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      - Longitude increases as you go west (i.e., becomes more negative in the Western
      Hemisphere).

      - -90.3 (Florissant) is farther west than -80.1 (Schall Circle).


      **Conclusion:**

      Schall Circle, FL is **east** of Florissant, MO.

      **Step 1: Identify the location of Cape May, NJ**

      - Cape May is located at the southern tip of New Jersey.

      - Its approximate coordinates are: Latitude 38.935112, Longitude -74.9060


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Pleasant Run, OH**
