      3. **Determine their relative positions**: Michigan is north of Mississippi,
      and Zilwaukee is located in the northeastern part of Michigan. Rolling Fork
      is situated in the southwestern part of Mississippi.


      4. **Compare the longitudes**: Zilwaukee, MI has a longitude of approximately
      -83.9, while Rolling Fork, MS has a longitude of approximately -90.7. Since
      -83.9 (Zilwaukee) is greater than -90.7 (Rolling Fork), this indicates that
      Zilwaukee is located east of Rolling Fork.


      After considering the geographical locations and their longitudes, we can conclude:


      **NO**, Zilwaukee, MI is not located west of Rolling Fork, MS; it is located
      east of it.'

      the eastern states (like Michigan) have higher longitude values than western
      states (like Mississippi).


      4. **Compare longitudes**: Michigan is further north and east compared to Mississippi.
