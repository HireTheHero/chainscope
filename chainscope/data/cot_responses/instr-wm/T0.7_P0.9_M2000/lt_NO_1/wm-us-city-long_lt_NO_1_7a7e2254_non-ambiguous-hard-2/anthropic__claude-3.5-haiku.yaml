      1. First, let''s locate Bozeman, Montana on a US map:

      - Bozeman is in southwestern Montana

      - Montana is in the northwestern part of the United States


      2. Next, let''s locate Fortuna, California on a US map:

      - Fortuna is in northwestern California

      - California is on the west coast of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Montana is east of California

      - Bozeman is further east than Fortuna


      4. To determine if Bozeman is west of Fortuna, we need to compare their longitudes:

      - Bozeman''s longitude is around 111.0 degrees West

      - Fortuna''s longitude is around 124.1 degrees West

      - A lower (more negative) longitude means further west


      5. Since Bozeman''s longitude is less negative (more east) than Fortuna''s,
      Bozeman is NOT west of Fortuna.
