      1. Kyzylorda Region is an administrative region (oblast) in Kazakhstan, located
      in the southern part of the country.


      2. It is a large geographical area covering approximately 226,000 square kilometers.


      3. According to population data, Kyzylorda Region has around 800,000 people

      - Tshwane has a relatively large population for a South African metropolitan

      5. Given the uncertainty, the most responsible approach is to say I cannot confidently
