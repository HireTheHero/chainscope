      1.  **Understand what the question is asking:** We need to compare the *geographic
      location* of two specific zip codes, 85132 in Arizona and 90021 in California,
      to determine if the first is west of the second.


      2.  **Recall the general pattern of US zip codes:** Lower zip codes generally
      correspond to areas further east, and higher zip codes generally correspond
      to areas further west. This is a very broad generalization, but it''s a starting
      point.


      3.  **Locate 85132, AZ:** This zip code is in Arizona. Arizona is a state in
      the southwestern US.


      4.  **Locate 90021, CA:** This zip code is in California. California is a state
      on the Pacific coast, west of Arizona.


      5.  **Compare the relative positions of Arizona and California:** On a map of
      the United States, Arizona is to the east of California. California is to the
      west of Arizona.


      6.  **Apply this to the specific zip codes:** Since 85132 is in Arizona and
      90021 is in California, and California is geographically west of Arizona, it
      logically follows that any point in California (like 90021) will be west of

      The question asks if one point (21220, MD) is geographically west of another
      point (62521, IL).


      **Step 2: Determine the location of 21220, MD.**

      21220 is a zip code in Maryland. A quick search reveals it corresponds to Essex,
      MD, which is on the eastern side of Maryland, near Baltimore. Its approximate
      longitude is around -76.4 degrees.


      **Step 3: Determine the location of 62521, IL.**

      62521 is a zip code in Illinois. A quick search reveals it corresponds to Decatur,
      IL, which is in central Illinois. Its approximate longitude is around -89.0
      degrees.

      **Step 1: Understand what "west of" means in this context.**

      When comparing two locations, "west of" means the location in question (11419,
      NY) has a lower longitude value than the reference location (47834, IN).


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of 11419, NY.**

      *   A quick search for "longitude of 11419 NY" reveals it''s approximately **-73.80
      degrees W**.


      **Step 3: Find the approximate longitude of 47834, IN.**

      *   A quick search for "longitude of 47834 IN" reveals it''s approximately **-87.38
      degrees W**.


      **Step 4: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   Longitude of 11419, NY: -73.80

      *   Longitude of 47834, IN: -87.38


      **Step 5: Determine if 11419, NY is west of 47834, IN.**

      For 11419, NY to be west of 47834, IN, its longitude (-73.80) would need to
      be *less than* the longitude of 47834, IN (-87.38).


      However, -73.80 is *greater than* -87.38. This means 11419, NY is actually *east*

      A quick search reveals that 11419 is a zip code in Queens, New York. Queens
      is located on Long Island, and its longitude is roughly around **-73.8 degrees
      West**.


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate longitude of 47834, IN.**

      A quick search reveals that 47834 is a zip code for Clinton, Indiana. Clinton,
      Indiana is located in the western part of Indiana. Its longitude is roughly
      around **-87.4 degrees West**.

      *   Oro Grande, NM (88048) is approximately at **-106.6 degrees longitude**.


      **Step 4: Interpret the longitude comparison.**

      *   The more negative the longitude, the further west the location.

      *   -106.6 is a smaller number (more negative) than -94.7.


      **Step 5: Conclude based on the comparison.**

      Since -106.6 (Oro Grande, NM) is further west than -94.7 (Longview, TX), it
      means Longview, TX is *east* of Oro Grande, NM.


      Therefore, 75604, TX is NOT located west of 88048, NM.

      determine the answer.


      **Step 1: Understand what the question is asking.**

      The question wants to know if the *location* corresponding to zip code 38834
      in Mississippi is geographically to the west of the *location* corresponding
      to zip code 74105 in Oklahoma.


      **Step 2: Determine the general location of each state.**

      *   Mississippi (MS) is in the southeastern United States.

      *   Oklahoma (OK) is in the south-central United States, generally west of Arkansas
      and north of Texas.


      **Step 3: Visualize the relative positions of MS and OK.**

      If you look at a map of the US, Oklahoma is clearly to the west of Mississippi.
      Mississippi is further east.


      **Step 4: Consider if specific zip codes within the states could change this
      general relationship.**

      While zip codes can cover small areas, the states themselves are large. It''s
      highly improbable that a specific location within Mississippi, which is inherently
      an eastern state relative to Oklahoma, would be further west than a specific
      location within Oklahoma. Geographically, all of Oklahoma is west of all of
      Mississippi.


      **Step 5: Formulate the conclusion.**

      Since Oklahoma is geographically west of Mississippi, any location within Oklahoma
      will be west of any location within Mississippi.

      determine if 38834, MS is located west of 74105, OK.


      **Step 1: Understand Zip Code Geography**

      US zip codes generally increase from east to west within a state or region.
      This means a lower zip code typically indicates a more easterly location, and
      a higher zip code indicates a more westerly location. However, this is a very
      broad generalization and **does not hold true across state lines.** A lower
      zip code in one state does not automatically mean it''s east of a higher zip
      code in another state.


      **Step 2: Determine Geographic Location of 38834, MS**

      *   38834 is a zip code for **Corinth, Mississippi**.

      *   Corinth is located in the **northeastern corner of Mississippi**.


      **Step 3: Determine Geographic Location of 74105, OK**

      *   74105 is a zip code for **Tulsa, Oklahoma**.

      *   Tulsa is located in the **northeastern part of Oklahoma**.


      **Step 4: Compare the Locations**

      *   Mississippi is a state in the **southeastern United States**.

      *   Oklahoma is a state in the **south-central United States**, significantly
      west of Mississippi.


      Visually, if you look at a map of the United States:

      *   Corinth, MS, is near the Mississippi-Tennessee-Alabama border.

      *   Tulsa, OK, is much further west, past Arkansas.


      Therefore, any location in Mississippi will be east of any location in Oklahoma.


      **Step 5: Formulate the Answer**

      Since Corinth, MS (38834) is in Mississippi and Tulsa, OK (74105) is in Oklahoma,
      and Mississippi is geographically east of Oklahoma, 38834, MS cannot be west
      of 74105, OK. It is, in fact, to the east.

    a59caf3d-397b-4f3d-9f5e-d8431e045623: 'Let''s break this down step-by-step to
      determine if 38834, MS is located west of 74105, OK.


      **Step 1: Understand Zip Code Geography**

      Zip codes are generally assigned in a way that the first digit represents a
      broad geographical area of the US, moving from east to west.

      *   0xxxx, 1xxxx, 2xxxx, 3xxxx: East Coast and Southeast

      *   4xxxx, 5xxxx, 6xxxx: Midwest

      *   7xxxx: South Central (including Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana)

      *   8xxxx: Mountain West

      *   9xxxx: Pacific West


      **Step 2: Locate 38834, MS**

      *   The first digit is ''3''. This places it in the southeastern US.

      *   Specifically, 388xx zip codes are in northern Mississippi.


      **Step 3: Locate 74105, OK**

      *   The first digit is ''7''. This places it in the south-central US.

      *   Specifically, 741xx zip codes are in Oklahoma, and 74105 is a zip code for
      Tulsa, Oklahoma.


      **Step 4: Compare the Locations**

      *   Mississippi (MS) is an eastern state in the Southern US.

      *   Oklahoma (OK) is a central state in the Southern US.


      When you look at a map, Mississippi is clearly to the east of Oklahoma.


      Therefore, 38834, MS is located to the east of 74105, OK.

      The question wants to know if a specific zip code in Mississippi (38834) is
      geographically located *west* of a specific zip code in Oklahoma (74105).


      **Step 2: Determine the general location of Mississippi and Oklahoma.**

      *   Mississippi (MS) is generally in the southeastern United States.

      *   Oklahoma (OK) is generally in the south-central United States, to the west
      of Arkansas.


      **Step 3: Consider the relative positions of Mississippi and Oklahoma.**

      Geographically, Oklahoma is situated to the west of Mississippi. While both
      states span a range of longitudes, the *entirety* of Oklahoma is west of the
      *entirety* of Mississippi.


      **Step 4: Apply this general understanding to specific zip codes.**

      If Oklahoma is generally west of Mississippi, then any point in Oklahoma will
      inherently be west of any point in Mississippi, assuming we''re talking about
      their primary landmasses.


      **Step 5: Formulate the conclusion.**

      determine if 38834, MS is located west of 74105, OK.


      **Step 1: Understand Zip Code Geography**

      Zip codes are assigned geographically. Generally, lower zip codes in the US
      are further east, and higher zip codes are further west within a broad regional
      context. However, this is a *very general* rule and can be easily broken when
      comparing states far apart or even within the same state due to the way zip
      code boundaries are drawn (e.g., population density, post office routes).


      **Step 2: Determine Approximate Location of 38834, MS**

      *   "MS" stands for Mississippi.

      *   Mississippi is in the southeastern United States.

      *   A quick search for "38834 MS" reveals it''s a zip code for **Corinth, Mississippi**.


      **Step 3: Determine Approximate Location of 74105, OK**

      *   "OK" stands for Oklahoma.

      *   Oklahoma is in the south-central United States, west of Mississippi.

      *   A quick search for "74105 OK" reveals it''s a zip code for **Tulsa, Oklahoma**.


      **Step 4: Compare Geographical Positions**

      *   Mississippi (Corinth) is clearly to the east of Oklahoma (Tulsa).

      *   Therefore, Corinth, MS, is **not** west of Tulsa, OK. It is east of Tulsa,
      OK.

      **Step 1: Find the approximate coordinates for each ZIP code.**


      *   **45449, OH (Dayton, OH area):** Looking up this ZIP code, it''s near Dayton,
      Ohio. We can estimate its longitude. Ohio is generally around 80-85 degrees
      West longitude. Let''s say roughly **84 degrees West**.

      *   **63109, MO (St. Louis, MO area):** Looking up this ZIP code, it''s in St.
      Louis, Missouri. We can estimate its longitude. Missouri is generally around
      90-95 degrees West longitude. Let''s say roughly **90 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Compare the longitudes.**


      *   West longitude values *increase* as you go further west. So, a location
      at 90 degrees West is *further west* than a location at 84 degrees West.


      **Step 3: Determine if 45449, OH is west of 63109, MO.**


      *   84 degrees West (45449, OH) is *less* than 90 degrees West (63109, MO).

      *   Therefore, 45449, OH is *east* of 63109, MO.

      **Step 1: Understand the Question**

      We need to compare the *east-west* position of two locations based on their
      zip codes.


      **Step 2: Determine the State for Each Zip Code**

      *   07852 is in New Jersey (NJ).

      *   60626 is in Illinois (IL).


      **Step 3: Recall/Determine the General East-West Position of the States**

      *   New Jersey (NJ) is a state on the *east coast* of the United States.

      *   Illinois (IL) is a state in the *Midwest*, located significantly *west*
      of the east coast.


      **Step 4: Compare the Locations**

      Since New Jersey is an eastern state and Illinois is a midwestern state, any
      location within New Jersey will be *east* of any location within Illinois (barring
      extremely rare and specific geographic anomalies that wouldn''t apply here and
      aren''t relevant to the general question).


      Therefore, 07852, NJ is located **east** of 60626, IL.


      The question asks: "Is 07852, NJ located west of 60626, IL?"


      Since 07852, NJ is *east* of 60626, IL, the answer to the question is the opposite.

      **Step 1: Determine the approximate longitude of 06250, CT.**

      06250 is Putnam, CT. A quick search or map check shows Putnam, CT is in eastern
      Connecticut. Its approximate longitude is around **-71.9 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate longitude of 17970, PA.**

      17970 is Schuylkill Haven, PA. A quick search or map check shows Schuylkill
      Haven, PA is in eastern Pennsylvania. Its approximate longitude is around **-76.1
      degrees West**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   -71.9 degrees West (CT)

      *   -76.1 degrees West (PA)


      On a number line, -71.9 is to the right of (greater than) -76.1. In terms of
      West longitude, a smaller negative number means you are further east. Conversely,
      a larger negative number (further from zero) means you are further west.


      Therefore, -71.9 (CT) is **east** of -76.1 (PA).


      **Step 4: Answer the question.**

      The question is: "Is 06250, CT located west of 17970, PA?"

      answer.


      **Step 1: Understand the nature of zip codes and their relation to geography.**

      US zip codes are generally assigned in a way that the first digit corresponds
      to a broad geographical area, moving from East to West.

      * 0 (Northeast)

      * 1 (Northeast)

      * 2 (South Atlantic)

      * 3 (Southeast/Mid-Atlantic)

      * 4 (Midwest)

      * 5 (Midwest)

      * 6 (Midwest)

      * 7 (South Central)

      * 8 (Mountain West)

      * 9 (Pacific West)


      **Step 2: Analyze the first digit of each zip code.**

      * For 39530, MS, the first digit is **3**. This places it in the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic
      region.

      * For 77340, TX, the first digit is **7**. This places it in the South Central
      region.


      **Step 3: Compare the general geographical regions based on the first digit.**

      A zip code starting with ''3'' is generally *east* of a zip code starting with
      ''7''.


      **Step 4: Formulate the answer based on the comparison.**

      Since 39530 (starting with 3) is in a region generally to the east of 77340
      (starting with 7), 39530, MS is *not* located west of 77340, TX.

      * 27604 is a zip code for Raleigh, North Carolina.

      * North Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States.


      **Step 2: Determine the general location of 38611, MS.**

      * 38611 is a zip code for Byhalia, Mississippi.

      * Mississippi is in the southeastern United States, west of Alabama and Georgia.


      **Step 3: Compare the relative longitudes.**

      * North Carolina is generally further east than Mississippi.

      * To be "west of" another location, its longitude would need to be a larger
      negative number (or smaller positive number if using 0-360 scale).

      \ east to west within a state, and from east to west across the country. The\
      \ first digit of a 5-digit zip code often indicates a broad geographical area\
      \ of the US.\n\n    *   0-1: Northeast\n    *   2-3: Southeast\n    *   4-5:\
      \ Midwest\n    *   6-7: Central/South Central\n    *   8-9: West\n\n2.  **Analyze\
      \ the First Zip Code (70712, LA):**\n    *   The first digit is '7'. This places\
      \ it in the South Central region of the US.\n    *   LA is Louisiana, a state\
      \ in the South Central US.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Zip Code (77388, TX):**\n\
      \    *   The first digit is '7'. This also places it in the South Central region\
      \ of the US.\n    *   TX is Texas, a state in the South Central US, generally\
      \ located to the west of Louisiana.\n\n4.  **Compare States:** Louisiana (LA)\
      \ is geographically to the east of Texas (TX).\n\n5.  **Compare Zip Codes within\
      \ the Region:** Even though both start with '7', the higher the subsequent digits\
      \ within a given region or state, the more likely the location is further west.\n\
      \    *   70712: Lower within the '7' region, consistent with Louisiana.\n  \
      \  *   77388: Higher within the '7' region, consistent with Texas being west\
      \ of Louisiana, and specifically with a zip code further west within that state.\n\
      \n6.  **Conclusion based on State and Zip Code Progression:** Since Louisiana\
      \ is east of Texas, a zip code in Louisiana is highly likely to be east of a\
      \ zip code in Texas, especially when both fall within the same broad geographical\
      \ zip code '7' area and the Texas zip code starts with a higher second digit.\n\

      answer.


      **Step 1: Understand what "west of" means in this context.**

      When comparing two locations, "west of" means the first location has a *lower*
      longitude (is further to the left on a map) than the second location.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude for 31636, GA.**

      Using a reliable source for ZIP code geographical data (like a mapping service
      or a ZIP code lookup tool), the approximate longitude for 31636, GA is around
      **-83.3 degrees**.


      **Step 3: Find the approximate longitude for 70062, LA.**

      Similarly, the approximate longitude for 70062, LA is around **-90.1 degrees**.


      **Step 4: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   Longitude of 31636, GA: -83.3

      *   Longitude of 70062, LA: -90.1


      For 31636, GA to be west of 70062, LA, -83.3 would need to be *less than* -90.1.


      **Step 5: Evaluate the comparison.**

      -83.3 is *greater* than -90.1. This means 31636, GA is actually *east* of 70062,
      LA.


      **Final Answer:** NO'

      *   15139, PA (Monroeville, PA)


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate location of each zip code.**

      *   **07432, NJ:** This zip code is in northern New Jersey, specifically Oakland,
      Bergen County.

      *   **15139, PA:** This zip code is in western Pennsylvania, specifically Monroeville,
      Allegheny County (a suburb of Pittsburgh).


      **Step 3: Visualize or refer to a map.**

      If you look at a map of the United States, particularly the Mid-Atlantic region:

      *   Pittsburgh (and its eastern suburb Monroeville) is located much further
      to the west than northern New Jersey.

      *   New Jersey is entirely to the east of Pennsylvania, particularly western
      Pennsylvania.


      **Step 4: Compare their relative east-west positions.**

      Since Monroeville, PA (15139) is near Pittsburgh, it is geographically to the
      west of Oakland, NJ (07432).


      **Step 5: Answer the question asked.**

      The question is: "Is 07432, NJ located west of 15139, PA?"

      Since 15139, PA is west of 07432, NJ, it means 07432, NJ is *east* of 15139,
      PA.
