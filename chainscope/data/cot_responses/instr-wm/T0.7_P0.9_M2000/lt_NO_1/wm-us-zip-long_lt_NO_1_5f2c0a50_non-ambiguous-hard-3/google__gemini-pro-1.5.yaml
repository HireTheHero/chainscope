      I need to find the longitude coordinates for 75025, TX and 88240, NM.  Online
      zip code lookups can provide this information.


      2. **Compare the longitudes:**  A location further west will have a *higher*
      longitude value (since longitude increases as you move west from the Prime Meridian).


      3. **Determine West/East based on comparison:** If the longitude of 75025, TX
      is greater than the longitude of 88240, NM, then 75025, TX is west of 88240,
      NM.


      75025 (Plano, TX) is approximately -96.7 longitude.

      88240 (Hobbs, NM) is approximately -103.2 longitude.



      Since -96.7 is *greater* than -103.2, 75025, TX is west of 88240, NM.

      is in the Eastern Time Zone.


      3. **47803, IN:** This zip code corresponds to a location in Indiana. Indiana
      is in the Eastern Time Zone and partially in the Central Time Zone. Regardless
