      near St. Augustine, which is on the northeastern coast of Florida.


      2. **Locate 70647, LA**: This zip code is in Iowa, Louisiana, which is in the
      southwestern part of the state, near Lake Charles.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: Florida is generally east of Louisiana.
      Specifically, northeastern Florida (where 32095 is located) is east of southwestern
      Louisiana (where 70647 is located).


      Based on these locations, 32095, FL is east of 70647, LA.
