      To determine this, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their relative east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 36107 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)

      - 76001 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Alabama and Texas.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Alabama is east of Texas on a map of the United States


      Step 3: Since these zip codes are in their respective states, we can conclude
      that 36107, AL (in Alabama) must be east of 76001, TX (in Texas).


      Therefore, 36107, AL is NOT located west of 76001, TX.

      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - NJ zip codes typically start with 0, and are located in the eastern part of
      the country

      - PA zip codes starting with 15 are typically in western Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      - Since 07440 is in New Jersey, and all of New Jersey is east of western Pennsylvania
      (where 15468 is located), the NJ location must be east of the PA location.

      - If the NJ location is east of the PA location, then it cannot be west of it.

      Step 4: Analyze the specific locations.

      - 07440 appears to be in northern New Jersey

      - 15468 appears to be in western Pennsylvania


      Since Pennsylvania is generally west of New Jersey, and specifically western

      - 97239 is a zip code in Oregon state (OR)


      Step 2: Consider what I know about US zip codes.

      - In the US zip code system, generally codes increase from west to east

      - The first digit broadly indicates geographic region (9 for west coast states,

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 51250 is in Iowa (IA)

      - 82609 is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Iowa is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Wyoming is in the Mountain West region of the United States

      - Generally, Wyoming is west of Iowa


      Step 3: In the US, zip codes generally follow geographic patterns where lower
      numbers tend to be in the eastern parts of the country and higher numbers in
      the western parts.

      - 51250 (Iowa) has a lower zip code number than 82609 (Wyoming)

      - This supports the general east-to-west pattern


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Wyoming is west of Iowa, and the zip code numbering pattern confirms this
      general relationship, 51250, IA would be east of 82609, WY, not west of it.

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 3: Looking at the first digits of these zip codes:

      - 28xxx zip codes are generally in eastern/central North Carolina

      - 29xxx zip codes are generally in South Carolina


      Step 4: North Carolina is generally north of South Carolina, but the question
      asks about east/west positioning.


      Step 5: Within the US zip code system, for areas in the eastern United States:

      - Lower first digits generally indicate more eastern locations

      - 28xxx is a lower number than 29xxx


      Step 6: This pattern means 28xxx zip codes tend to be east of 29xxx zip codes
      in this region.


      Step 7: Therefore, 28512 (NC) is likely east of 29067 (SC), not west of it.

      codes generally increase as you go from east to west within regions. However,
      this rule isn''t perfect for comparing across state lines, so I need to consider
      the actual locations.


      Step 3: Looking at the specific zip codes:

      - 28512 is in eastern North Carolina (likely in the coastal region)

      - 29067 is in South Carolina


      Step 4: Comparing the numbers, 28512 is a lower number than 29067. Within the
      Southeast region postal codes, lower numbers are typically further east.


      Step 5: North Carolina is generally positioned to the north and east of South

      - 10457 is a ZIP code in the Bronx, New York (NY)

      - 43207 is a ZIP code in Columbus, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the relative geographical positions of New York and Ohio.

      - New York is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New York


      Step 3: More specifically, the Bronx (10457) is in the eastern part of New York
      State, while Columbus (43207) is in central Ohio.


      Step 4: Compare the locations on an east-west axis.

      - Since Ohio is west of New York, and Columbus is in Ohio while the Bronx is
      in New York, 10457 (Bronx, NY) must be east of 43207 (Columbus, OH).

      - Conversely, 43207 (Columbus, OH) must be west of 10457 (Bronx, NY).

      if 75025, TX is west of 88240, NM.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 75025 is a ZIP code in Plano, Texas

      - 88240 is a ZIP code in Hobbs, New Mexico


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Texas and New Mexico.

      New Mexico is located west of Texas, as New Mexico borders Texas on Texas''s
      western side.


      Step 3: Since 75025 (Plano, TX) is in Texas, and 88240 (Hobbs, NM) is in New
      Mexico, and New Mexico is generally west of Texas, it would seem that 88240
      is west of 75025.


      Step 4: However, I need to check the specific locations, as Hobbs, NM (88240)
      is in eastern New Mexico near the Texas border, and Plano, TX (75025) is in
      north-central Texas.


      Step 5: Hobbs, NM is in the far eastern part of New Mexico, right along the
      Texas border. Plano, TX is in north-central Texas, significantly east of the
      Texas-New Mexico border.


      Therefore, 75025 (Plano, TX) is east of 88240 (Hobbs, NM), not west.

      - 70444 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)

      - 79762 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Louisiana and Texas.

      - Louisiana is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located to the west of Louisiana


      Step 3: More specifically, even the easternmost parts of Texas are generally

      - Generally, Kentucky is west of Virginia (KY borders VA on VA''s western side)

      - However, specific zip codes might have different relative positions depending
      on their exact locations within their states


      Step 4: Consider that Virginia has a western portion that extends significantly
      westward.

      - Some western parts of Virginia can be further west than eastern parts of Kentucky

      - But most of Kentucky is west of most of Virginia


      Step 5: For these specific zip codes:

      - 24486 appears to be in western Virginia (in the Shenandoah Valley region)

      - 40109 appears to be in northern Kentucky, likely near Louisville


      Step 6: Based on the general positions of these states and these specific zip

      west of 29388, SC. Let me think through this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 28403 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29388 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of North Carolina and South Carolina.

      - North Carolina and South Carolina are neighboring states on the US East Coast

      - North Carolina is generally located north of South Carolina

      - Both states extend from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Appalachian
      Mountains in the west


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase as you move from east
      to west

      - Lower zip codes in this region (2xxxx) tend to be more eastern than higher
      ones


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 28403 is a lower number than 29388

      - This suggests that 28403 is likely east of 29388, not west


      Step 5: Verify the specific locations.

      - 28403 is in Wilmington, NC, which is on the Atlantic coast (eastern part of
      NC)

      - 29388 is in Woodruff, SC, which is in the upstate region (western part of
      SC)


      Based on this analysis, 28403 (Wilmington, NC) is on the eastern coast, while
      29388 (Woodruff, SC) is in the western part of South Carolina. Therefore, 28403
      is east of 29388, not west.


      NO, 28403, NC is not located west of 29388, SC. It is located east of it.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 28403 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29388 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of NC and SC.

      North Carolina is directly north of South Carolina. They share a border that
      runs roughly east-west.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbers.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase as you move from east
      to west. However, this pattern is primarily true within continuous regions.
      Between states, the first digit is more important for regional grouping.


      Step 4: Look at the first digits.

      - 28403 starts with "2" (NC)

      - 29388 starts with "2" (SC)

      Same first digit means they''re in the same general region (East Coast).


      Step 5: Examine the second digits.

      - 28403 has "8" as second digit

      - 29388 has "9" as second digit

      In the East Coast region, lower second digits typically indicate locations further
      east.


      Therefore, 28403 (NC) is likely east of 29388 (SC), not west.

      North Carolina and South Carolina are neighboring states on the US East Coast.
      North Carolina is positioned north of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase as you move from east
      to west and from north to south.

      - 28403 (NC) has a lower number than 29388 (SC)

      - The first digit (2) indicates both are in the same general region

      - The second digit differs: 8 for NC vs 9 for SC, suggesting 29388 is further
      south/west


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations.

      - 28403 is in the Wilmington area of NC, which is in the southeastern part of
      North Carolina

      Step 2: Determine their relative geographic positions.

      - Texas is generally located east of New Mexico in the United States.

      - US zip codes tend to increase as you move from east to west.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 38834 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)

      - 74105 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Mississippi is in the southeastern part of the US

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central part of the US

      - Generally, Mississippi is east of Oklahoma


      Step 3: More specifically, Mississippi lies along the Mississippi River on the
      eastern side of the country, while Oklahoma is several states to the west.


      Step 4: In terms of longitude, locations in Mississippi typically have lower
      (more negative) longitude values than locations in Oklahoma. Since west is defined
      by increasing negative longitude in the Western Hemisphere, this means Mississippi
      is east of Oklahoma, not west.

      - 40175 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern coast of the United States.

      - Kentucky is located inland, west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Kentucky lies to the west of Virginia.

      - Therefore, locations in Virginia are generally east of locations in Kentucky.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since 23664, VA is in Virginia, and 40175, KY is in Kentucky, and Virginia
      is east of Kentucky, the Virginia zip code would be east of the Kentucky zip
      code, not west.

      code further west than the Texas zip code.

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 79838 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 85621 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Texas and Arizona in the
      US.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, bordering California
      to its west and New Mexico to its east.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering New Mexico
      to its west.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Arizona is generally west of Texas.

      - Since Texas is east of Arizona, a zip code in Texas (79838) would typically
      be east of a zip code in Arizona (85621).


      Step 4: Check if there are any exceptions.

      - While some parts of western Texas might be at a similar longitude to eastern
      Arizona, the standard geographic arrangement places Arizona west of Texas.

      - Zip code 79838 is in Texas, and even if it''s in western Texas, it would still
      typically be east of an Arizona zip code.


      NO. 79838, TX is not located west of 85621, AZ. It is east of it.'

      Step 1: I''ll recall the general geographic layout of Texas and Arizona within
      the United States.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Texas is located to the east of Arizona


      Step 2: Consider the locations based on zip codes.

      - 79838 is a zip code in Texas

      - 85621 is a zip code in Arizona


      Step 3: Based on the general geography of the United States, locations in Texas
      are typically east of locations in Arizona, not west.

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Arizona is located west of Texas on the US map

      - Texas is east of Arizona


      Step 3: Since zip codes within each state follow regional patterns, a zip code
      in Texas (79838) would generally be east of a zip code in Arizona (85621).


      Step 4: To be more specific, I can note that zip codes starting with 798xx are
      typically in western Texas, and zip codes starting with 856xx are typically
      in southern Arizona. But even western Texas is still east of Arizona.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, east of Arizona.


      Step 2: Generally speaking, locations in Texas would be east of locations in
      Arizona, not west.


      Step 3: To be more precise, I should consider that some parts of western Texas
      could potentially be west of eastern parts of Arizona. However, zip code 79838
      is in Texas, and zip code 85621 is in Arizona.


      Step 4: Looking at the zip code patterns:

      - Arizona zip codes typically begin with 85-86

      - Texas zip codes typically begin with 75-79, with western Texas generally using
      the higher numbers in that range

      - The zip code 79838 being in the 798xx range suggests it''s in western Texas

      - The zip code 85621 being in the 856xx range suggests it''s in southern Arizona


      Step 5: Even the westernmost parts of Texas are still east of most of Arizona.
      The location 79838 in Texas, even if in western Texas, would be east of 85621

      NO. The zip code 79838, TX is not located west of 85621, AZ. It is located east

      - 10993 is in New York (NY)

      - 15062 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these zip

      - In the US zip code system, lower numbers generally appear in the eastern parts
      of the country, while higher numbers appear in the western parts.

      - The first digit is particularly important: codes starting with 1 are in the
      Northeast region.


      Step 3: Since both zip codes start with 1, I need to look at the second digit.

      - 10993 starts with "10" (New York)

      - 15062 starts with "15" (Pennsylvania)

      - Within the first digit region, lower second digits are typically further east
      than higher second digits.


      Step 4: Since 10993 (NY) has a lower second digit (0) than 15062 (PA) with second
      digit (5), and considering the general pattern that New York is east of Pennsylvania,
      10993 would be east of 15062, not west.

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is in the south-central United States

      - The Florida Panhandle extends westward along the Gulf Coast


      Step 4: Compare the relative east-west positions.

      - The Florida Panhandle is actually quite far west, extending almost to Alabama
      and the longitude of western Georgia

      - 32579 (Navarre, FL) is in the western part of Florida

      - 77362 (near Houston, TX) is in the eastern part of Texas

      - Texas extends much further west than Florida, but this specific zip code is
      in eastern Texas


      Step 5: Make the final comparison of these specific locations.

      - 32579 (Navarre, FL) is indeed west of 77362 (near Houston, TX)

      if 32095, FL is located west of 70647, LA.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 32095 is in Florida (FL)

      - 70647 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Louisiana is located along the Gulf Coast, west of Florida


      Step 3: Looking at the relative positions of these states on a map:

      - Louisiana is positioned to the west of Florida

      - This means that locations in Florida are generally east of locations in Louisiana


      Step 4: Therefore, 32095, FL would be east of 70647, LA (not west of it)


      NO, 32095, FL is not located west of 70647, LA. It is located east of it.'

      - 32095 is in Florida (FL)

      - 70647 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Florida and Louisiana.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Louisiana is located west of Florida, along the Gulf Coast


      Step 3: Determine the relative east-west positioning.

      - Since Louisiana is west of Florida, generally any location in Louisiana would
      be west of locations in Florida.

      - 32095 (FL) would be east of 70647 (LA)

      - Conversely, 70647 (LA) would be west of 32095 (FL)


      Step 4: Answer the specific question asked: "Is 32095, FL located west of 70647,
      LA?"

      - No, it''s the opposite. 32095, FL is located east of 70647, LA.

      - 70647 is a ZIP code in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic Ocean
      and Gulf of Mexico.

      - Louisiana is located in the south-central United States, along the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      Step 3: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - Louisiana is west of Florida on the U.S. map.

      - Florida extends eastward into the Atlantic, while Louisiana is further west
      along the Gulf Coast.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific ZIP codes.

      - Since 32095 is in Florida and 70647 is in Louisiana, and Louisiana is west
      of Florida, the ZIP code 32095 in Florida would be east of ZIP code 70647 in
      Louisiana.

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 29072 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Recall the general geographic positions of these states.

      - South Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arkansas is in the south-central part of the United States, west of the Mississippi
      River


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Arkansas is significantly west of South Carolina

      - All locations in South Carolina are east of all locations in Arkansas


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since 29072 is in South Carolina and 72023 is in Arkansas, and South Carolina
      is east of Arkansas, then 29072 must be east of 72023, not west.

      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: SC is South Carolina and AR is Arkansas.


      2) In the US geographic layout, Arkansas is located west of South Carolina.
      South Carolina is on the east coast, while Arkansas is more centrally located
      but east of the Mississippi River.


      3) US zip codes are generally organized so that lower numbers tend to be in
      the eastern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western
      parts.


      4) The zip code 29072 (in SC) starts with "2", while 72023 (in AR) starts with
      "7".


      5) This pattern confirms the general geographic relationship - South Carolina
      zip codes typically start with "2", which is assigned to the southeastern region,
      while Arkansas zip codes typically start with "7", assigned to a more central-western
      region.


      Since South Carolina is east of Arkansas, and 29072 is in South Carolina while
      72023 is in Arkansas, 29072 is located east (not west) of 72023.


      NO'

      To determine this, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their positions on an east-west axis.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 29072 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - South Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Arkansas is in the South-Central United States, significantly west of South
      Carolina


      Step 3: Confirm the relative positions.

      - All of South Carolina, including zip code 29072, lies east of Arkansas

      - All of Arkansas, including zip code 72023, lies west of South Carolina


      Therefore, 29072 in South Carolina cannot be west of 72023 in Arkansas. It must
      be east of it.

      - 19363 appears to be in southeastern Pennsylvania (likely near the Maryland
      border)

      - 26330 is somewhere in West Virginia


      Step 4: In the United States, lower zip codes in the same region typically indicate
      more eastern locations, while higher zip codes tend to be more western. The
      first digit of 1 for the PA zip code versus 2 for the WV zip code suggests the
      PA location is further east.

      in West Virginia.


      Step 4: However, since zip codes can be irregularly distributed, I need to consider
      the specific locations. Pennsylvania has some western portions that could potentially
      be west of some eastern portions of West Virginia.


      Step 5: 19363 appears to be in southeastern Pennsylvania (likely in the Oxford
      area), which is in the eastern part of the state.
