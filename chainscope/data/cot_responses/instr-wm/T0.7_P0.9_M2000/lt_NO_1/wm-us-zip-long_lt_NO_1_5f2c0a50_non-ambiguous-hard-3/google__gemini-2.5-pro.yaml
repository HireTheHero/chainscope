      \ I've started the research, confirming 99324 is in Washington, and 97239 in\
      \ Oregon. Next, I'll use this knowledge to perform a comparison based on longitudes.\n\
      \n\n**Evaluating Coordinates and Reasoning**\n\nI've now reached the critical\
      \ phase of comparing longitudes, and am preparing the final answer. I'm checking\
      \ the comparison: 99324's longitude (~118.3\xB0 W) is less than 97239's (~122.6\xB0\
      \ W). This indicates that 99324 is indeed east of 97239, which means my conclusion\
      \ must be \"NO.\" I am now crafting a structured, easy-to-follow explanation\

      \nI've started by focusing on the user's core query: determining if 99324 is\
      \ west of 97239. My approach involves simplifying the location comparison to\
      \ a binary \"YES\" or \"NO\" answer. Next, I'll develop a suitable method for\
      \ comparing their geographical coordinates.\n\n\n**Evaluating State Locations**\n\
      \nI've now pinpointed the locations tied to the ZIP codes. 99324 is in College\

      I''ve focused on identifying the user''s core question, which is a direct geographical
      comparison. It''s clear that the final output must be either "YES" or "NO".
      Now I''m deconstructing the request to determine the best approach to get that
      simple binary answer.



      **Mapping ZIP Code Positions**


      I''ve located both ZIP codes now. Next, I will determine how their positions
      relate to each other. Knowing 99324 is near the WA/OR border in Eastern WA,
      and 97239 is in Portland, OR, which is in the Northwest, should allow for an
      accurate relative positioning determination. The final answer should be straightforward,
      based on that relative geography.



      **Confirming Relative Positioning**


      I''ve formulated a step-by-step process. Now I have the cities for each ZIP
      code. The goal is to compare the longitudes. I know that 99324, College Place,
      WA, is in Eastern Washington and 97239, Portland, OR, is further west.



      **Refining Step-by-Step Reasoning**


      I''ve finalized the step-by-step explanation for clarity. I''ve clearly defined
      the locations of the ZIP codes. The logic of comparing longitudes is also in
      place to verify the final answer. I''m confident the solution is both correct
      and easy to follow. Now to formulate a final response to the user.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of the first ZIP code:** 99324 is the ZIP code for
      College Place, Washington, which is located in the Walla Walla area in the southeastern
      part of the state.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second ZIP code:** 97239 is a ZIP code for
      Portland, Oregon, specifically covering areas like the South Waterfront. Portland
      is in the northwestern part of Oregon.

      3.  **Compare the geographical positions:** Southeastern Washington (where College
      Place is) is significantly further east than northwestern Oregon (where Portland
      is). Portland is much closer to the Pacific coast. Therefore, 99324, WA is located
      east of 97239, OR.

      I''ve zeroed in on the essential query: pinpointing the west/east relationship
      between the two zip codes. My next move is to ascertain the geographical location
      associated with each. Specifically, I need to know the longitude of 51250, IA
      and 82609, WY, to make the comparison.



      **Mapping Geographical Locations**


      I''ve moved beyond simply identifying the states. Now, I''m delving into their
      relative positions on a broader scale. By comparing Iowa and Wyoming on a map
      of the U.S., the east/west relationship between them is clear. This establishes
      a key foundation for addressing the central inquiry.



      **Deliberating Logical Flow**


      I''ve consolidated my approach and I''m creating a step-by-step explanation
      for the user, to ensure clarity and accuracy. I''ve double-checked the initial
      assumption regarding relative geographical positions. Now I''m ready to move
      forward with a formal response, structured for maximum impact. The answer is
      definite, so I am ready to deliver my conclusion.

      state of Wyoming (WY).

      3.  Finally, compare the geographical locations of the two states. The state
      of Wyoming is located entirely to the west of the state of Iowa on a map of
      the United States.

      4.  Therefore, any location in Iowa is east of any location in Wyoming.

      the question, focusing on locating each zip code''s geographical coordinates.
      This will require finding their respective longitudes and latitudes.



      **Mapping the Longitudes**


      I''ve confirmed that both zip codes are linked to cities, Sheldon, IA, and Casper,
      WY. My focus now shifts towards determining the longitudes of both cities. I''ll
      need to retrieve the precise latitude and longitude coordinates for each. With
      those coordinates, I can determine the relative geographical positions and answer
      the user''s question.



      **Synthesizing the Geographical Answer**


      I''ve moved beyond individual coordinates and am now focused on the relative
      positioning. After determining the cities and states, I realized that a map
      would reveal their relationship. Iowa is east of Wyoming; therefore, Sheldon,
      IA, is east of Casper, WY. I''m confidently preparing the final response: NO.

      I''ve identified the core question: Determining the relative geographical position
      of ZIP codes 39367 and 75150. I''m breaking down this problem into distinct
      steps for a precise solution. The initial step focuses on defining the exact
      question and its associated parameters. I''ll need to define how to interpret
      "west" in relation to ZIP codes.



      **Evaluating Longitudes Now**


      I''m now in the process of comparing longitudes. I''ve pinpointed Waynesboro,
      MS, and Seagoville, TX, as the relevant locations. Determining which longitude
      is more negative (or larger in absolute terms, representing West longitude)
      will give me the answer. The next step is to find the exact longitudes and then
      determine if Waynesboro is West of Seagoville.



      **Pinpointing Relative Positions**


      I''ve just compared the longitudes and formulated the final answer. The longitude
      of Seagoville, TX, is more west than Waynesboro, MS. Therefore, the answer is
      no, 39367 is not west of 75150. I''ve successfully completed the step-by-step
      reasoning.

      \nMy initial assessment is that the user's core question focuses on determining\
      \ the relative geographical positions of two US zip codes. I've begun to break\
      \ down this problem. First, it requires me to locate and verify the specific\
      \ geographical coordinates, or the latitudinal and longitudinal values, associated\
      \ with zip code 10927.\n\n\n**Comparing Longitudes Geographically**\n\nI've\
      \ located the zip code 10927 in Highland Falls, NY, with a longitude of roughly\
      \ -73.96\xB0 W. Now, I'm moving on to pinpoint the location of zip code 46016\
      \ in Anderson, IN, and will find its corresponding longitude value. This will\
      \ allow me to accurately determine the relative geographical position of these\
      \ two US zip codes. I'm focusing on longitude as the key differentiator in answering\
      \ the user's core question.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Zip Code Locations**\n\nHaving\
      \ pinpointed the longitude of Highland Falls, NY (10927) as approximately -73.96\xB0\
      \ W, I'm now comparing it with Anderson, IN (46016), which has a longitude of\
      \ approximately -85.68\xB0 W. This confirms that the New York location is indeed\
      \ east of the Indiana location, due to the more negative longitude value of\
      \ the latter. My work here is complete.\n\n\n**Determining Geographical Relationships**\n\
      \nI've outlined the step-by-step reasoning needed to answer the user's core\
      \ question. I've pinpointed the locations and longitudes associated with the\
      \ provided zip codes, Highland Falls, NY (10927) and Anderson, IN (46016). My\

      \ code corresponds to Highland Falls, New York.\n2.  **Identify the location\
      \ of zip code 46016, IN.** This zip code corresponds to Anderson, Indiana.\n\
      3.  **Compare the geographic locations.** On a map of the United States, New\
      \ York is located to the east of Indiana. To be more precise, we can compare\
      \ their longitudes.\n    *   Highland Falls, NY (10927) is at approximately\
      \ 74\xB0 West longitude.\n    *   Anderson, IN (46016) is at approximately 85.7\xB0\
      \ West longitude.\n4.  **Determine the direction.** A location with a higher\
      \ West longitude value is further west. Since 85.7\xB0 W is a higher value than\
      \ 74\xB0 W, the location in Indiana is west of the location in New York. Therefore,\
      \ 10927, NY is located **east** of 46016, IN.\n\nNO"

      groundwork for a comparative analysis of their respective locations.



      **Mapping Locational Data**


      I''ve now gathered the locations, establishing that 07871 (Stanhope, NJ) resides
      in northwestern New Jersey, and 15057 (McKees Rocks, PA) is situated in western
      Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. My next step involves definitively comparing
      their longitudes to answer the core question.



      **Reasoning the Geographic Question**


      I''ve methodically broken down the problem, starting with identifying the geographical
      question and deconstructing the inputs, specifically the zip codes and the comparison
      needed. Then, I located each zip code using city/town data and their respective

      My initial assessment focused on the core question: Determining the relative
      east-west positions of zip codes 07871 and 15057. I''ve begun to deconstruct
      the query, identifying the need for location data (city/state) associated with
      each zip code. This preliminary step is crucial to establish a geographical
      context for further comparison. My subsequent focus will be on efficiently acquiring
      and processing this data for accurate analysis.



      **Establishing Relative Locations**


      I''ve successfully identified the locations for both zip codes: Sparta, NJ (07871)
      and Leetsdale/Pittsburgh area, PA (15057). Now, I''m focusing on comparative
      analysis. I''m leveraging the general geographical positioning of New Jersey
      (east coast) versus Pennsylvania (east coast, but west of NJ). Considering Leetsdale
      is in western Pennsylvania, and Sparta in New Jersey, the former is definitively
      west of the latter.



      **Finalizing Geographical Conclusion**


      I''ve meticulously worked through the geographical positioning. Determining
      that New Jersey is entirely east of Pennsylvania solidified my conclusion. Given
      Sparta, NJ''s location in New Jersey and Leetsdale, PA''s in Western Pennsylvania,
      it''s clear 07871 is east of 15057. My final analysis confirms that the user''s
      question has been accurately and comprehensively answered.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of 07871, NJ:** This zip code is for Sparta, which
      is in northern New Jersey.

      2.  **Identify the location of 15057, PA:** This zip code is for Leetsdale,
      which is in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations:** The entire state of New Jersey is
      located to the east of the state of Pennsylvania. Therefore, any location in
      New Jersey is east of a location in western Pennsylvania.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since Sparta, NJ (07871) is east of Leetsdale, PA (15057),
      it is not west of it.

      \nI'm currently focusing on the core task: determining the relative geographic\
      \ locations of two ZIP codes. I'm deconstructing the initial question to understand\
      \ the precise geographic coordinates needed. First, the location of 85132 and\
      \ then 90021. Then, I must compare their longitude to provide an answer.\n\n\
      \n**Comparing Longitude Values**\n\nI've now calculated the longitudes for both\
      \ ZIP codes, and have a solid understanding of \"west of\" in this context,\
      \ which is a smaller longitude value. Using the identified longitudes, the longitude\
      \ of Eloy, AZ is -111.5 degrees, and the longitude of Los Angeles, CA is -118.2\
      \ degrees.\n\n\n**Confirming Relative Positioning**\n\nI've progressed through\
      \ the core logical steps, successfully determining the longitudes, and now I'm\
      \ in the final stages, confirming the answer and formulating a concise, logical\
      \ explanation. I am structuring a step-by-step reasoning to clearly illustrate\
      \ the relationship between the ZIP codes based on the \"west of\" definition.\
      \ I will finalize the answer based on the longitude comparison, ensuring that\
      \ the answer precisely addresses the user's specific query.\n\n\n**Refining\
      \ Logical Structure**\n\nI'm now fine-tuning the final answer. I've outlined\
      \ all steps, and will now write the definitive answer, which will be \"no.\"\
      \ My focus is on synthesizing the findings, making sure the answer is a direct\
      \ response to the prompt, and presenting the clear reasoning steps. I am also\
      \ making sure the answer is in a concise format for optimal usability.\n\n\n\
      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the location of\
      \ ZIP code 85132, AZ.** This ZIP code corresponds to the city of Eloy, Arizona.\n\
      2.  **Identify the location of ZIP code 90021, CA.** This ZIP code corresponds\
      \ to a part of downtown Los Angeles, California.\n3.  **Compare the geographic\
      \ positions.** Geographically, the state of Arizona is located to the east of\
      \ the state of California.\n4.  **Confirm with longitude.** To be \"west of\"\
      \ a location in the US, a place must have a more negative longitude.\n    *\
      \   Eloy, AZ (85132) has a longitude of approximately -111.5\xB0 W.\n    * \
      \  Los Angeles, CA (90021) has a longitude of approximately -118.2\xB0 W.\n\
      5.  **Conclusion.** Since -111.5\xB0 is less negative than -118.2\xB0, Eloy,\
      \ AZ is east of Los Angeles, CA. Therefore, 85132, AZ is not located west of\
      \ 90021, CA.\n\nNO"

      \ ready to find reliable data sources for these coordinates.\n\n\n**Comparing\

      W. Now, I will confirm the direction by interpreting these figures relative\

      \ code 35954 is for Boaz, Alabama.\n\n2.  Next, we need to determine their relative\
      \ geographical positions, specifically their longitudes.\n    *   Leland, North\
      \ Carolina, has a longitude of approximately 78.0\xB0 West.\n    *   Boaz, Alabama,\
      \ has a longitude of approximately 86.2\xB0 West.\n\n3.  Finally, we compare\
      \ the longitudes. In the Western Hemisphere, a location with a higher longitude\
      \ number (e.g., 86.2\xB0 W) is farther west than a location with a lower longitude\
      \ number (e.g., 78.0\xB0 W).\n\n4.  Since Boaz, AL (86.2\xB0 W) has a higher\
      \ west longitude than Leland, NC (78.0\xB0 W), Boaz, AL is located west of Leland,\

      My goal is a definitive "YES" or "NO" response. I''ve begun deconstructing the
      request, identifying the specific geographical comparison needed. My next step
      will be to devise a reliable method to determine the geographical relationship
      between these two zip codes.



      **Analyzing Geographical Positions**


      I''ve successfully identified the locations of the zip codes. 11704 is South
      Farmingdale, NY, and 45439 is Dayton, OH. I''m now comparing their longitudes.
      I''ve determined that South Farmingdale is significantly east of Dayton.  Therefore,
      I can confidently conclude that 11704 is *not* west of 45439.

      I''m now fully confident in my line of reasoning, which confirms 11704 is not
      west of 45439. I''ve broken the user''s question into manageable steps. I first
      determined the cities and states of each zip code. I then compared New York''s
      location with Ohio''s, and confidently concluded that since 11704 is in New
      York, which is east of Ohio, it cannot be west of 45439.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, identify the location associated with zip code 11704, NY. This zip

      2.  Next, identify the location associated with zip code 45439, OH. This zip
      code corresponds to Dayton, Ohio.

      3.  Finally, compare the geographical locations of these two places. New York
      State is located to the east of Ohio. Therefore, South Farmingdale, NY is east
      of Dayton, OH.

      rationale. I''ve walked through the geographical locations, comparing their
      positions on the map. The conclusion is now crystal clear: zip code 11419, NY
      is located east of zip code 47834, IN. Therefore, the definitive answer to the
      question is "NO".



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the city and state for each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 11419 is located in Richmond Hill, a neighborhood in Queens,
      New York.

      3.  The zip code 47834 is located in Brazil, Indiana.

      4.  Next, we compare the geographical locations of New York and Indiana.

      5.  New York is an East Coast state, while Indiana is a Midwestern state.

      6.  Geographically, Indiana is located to the west of New York.

      7.  Therefore, 11419, NY is located *east* of 47834, IN.

      \nI'm zeroing in on the core request: determining the relative geographic positions\
      \ of the two zip codes. The crux of the problem is translating zip codes into\
      \ geographic coordinates. I'll need a database or API to find the latitude and\
      \ longitude for each, then I can compare the longitudes to establish which is\
      \ farther west.\n\n\n**Determining Zip Code Locations**\n\nOkay, I've found\
      \ the approximate longitudes. Now I'm ready to compare the longitudes. Queens,\
      \ NY has a longitude of roughly -73.8\xB0 W. Brazil, IN, has a longitude of\
      \ approximately -87.1\xB0 W. Since -87.1\xB0 W is further west than -73.8\xB0\
      \ W, I now know that the zip code 47834 is further west than 11419.\n\n\n**Confirming\
      \ Final Answer**\n\nI've methodically stepped through the reasoning, confirming\
      \ that 11419 is in Queens, NY, and 47834 is in Brazil, IN. I compared the longitudes,\
      \ concluding that Brazil, IN, is west of Queens, NY. So, answering the core\
      \ question, I'm prepared to confidently provide the final response. The final\
      \ answer is: NO.\n\n\n**Structuring the Response**\n\nI've broken down the problem\
      \ into a set of logical steps to ensure I have clear reasoning. I've documented\
      \ the location of both zip codes (11419 and 47834) and compared their longitudes.\
      \ I now have the answer to the question of relative position and have confirmed\
      \ all steps. The final answer is ready for presentation.\n\n\n</think>Here is\

      3.  The zip code 47834 is located in Brazil, Indiana.\n4.  Geographically, the\
      \ state of New York is on the East Coast of the United States, while the state\
      \ of Indiana is in the Midwest.\n5.  Therefore, any location in New York is\
      \ east of any location in Indiana. This means 11419, NY is *east* of 47834,\

      of two zip codes. Currently, I''m deconstructing the input to isolate the individual
      zip codes for comparison. I need to extract the numerical values.



      **Comparing Zip Code Geographies**


      I''ve pinpointed the core challenge and broken down the input to get the zip
      codes and states. I then looked up cities associated with both zip codes: Milwaukee,
      WI and Rochester, MN. Now, I''m ready to compare their longitudes for the definitive
      answer. The knowledge of US geography does suggest the answer, but I''ll confirm
      using longitude coordinates for accuracy.

      I''ve zeroed in on the core question: Is 63670, MO located west of 67218, KS?
      I''ve broken down the user''s input, identifying the two zip codes and their
      corresponding states. Now, I''m mapping out the next steps to determine their
      relative positions, keeping in mind the need for geographical accuracy.



      **Mapping Spatial Coordinates**


      I''ve verified the state locations for each zip code: 63670 (Sainte Genevieve,
      MO) and 67218 (Wichita, KS). Sainte Genevieve is in eastern Missouri, near the
      Mississippi River. Wichita is in south-central Kansas. Since Missouri is generally
      east of Kansas, and Sainte Genevieve is in the eastern part of Missouri, I''ve
      concluded that 63670 is east of 67218.



      **Analyzing Relative Positioning**


      I''ve detailed my steps. I''ve pinpointed that zip code 63670, MO (Sainte Genevieve)
      lies east of 67218, KS (Wichita). Missouri is generally east of Kansas. Since
      Sainte Genevieve is in eastern Missouri and Wichita is in central Kansas, it
      confirms the initial assessment: Sainte Genevieve is east of Wichita.



      **Formulating a Concise Response**


      After refining my reasoning, I''ve consolidated the key points for a clear and
      concise answer. My process began with dissecting the input, then I looked up
      the locations, followed by spatial reasoning. Now, I''m ready to craft a precise,
      step-by-step response that leads to the definitive "No" answer.

      1.  **Identify the location of the first zip code:** 63670 is the zip code for
      Sainte Genevieve, Missouri (MO).

      2.  **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 67218 is a zip code for
      Wichita, Kansas (KS).

      3.  **Compare the locations:** The state of Missouri is located entirely to
      the east of the state of Kansas. Therefore, any location in Missouri will be
      east of any location in Kansas.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since Sainte Genevieve, MO is east of Wichita, KS, it is
      not west of it.

      I''ve homed in on the core question: Determining the relative east/west positioning
      of two US zip codes. I''ve successfully deconstructed the initial input, isolating
      the zip codes (63670 and 67218) and their associated states (MO and KS). My
      next move is to find the longitude of each location.



      **Analyzing Geographic Positions**


      I''ve realized the core issue is determining if 63670, MO is west of 67218,
      KS. I''ve broken down the input, isolating the zip codes and states. My initial
      knowledge check confirms MO and KS are in the Midwest. Further investigation
      pinpointed St. Genevieve, MO, and Wichita, KS. This is shaping up nicely!



      **Evaluating Spatial Relationships**


      Now, I''m working through the logic. I''ve broken down the input, determined
      state locations, and associated zip codes with cities. After realizing Kansas
      is generally west of Missouri, I identified St. Genevieve, MO, and Wichita,
      KS. This is the crux: I must precisely compare their relative longitude. I''ve
      concluded that St. Genevieve, being east of Wichita, is not west of it, addressing
      the user''s inquiry directly.



      **Evaluating Relationships Logically**


      I''m now zeroing in on the precise spatial relationship, having established
      the cities: St. Genevieve, MO, and Wichita, KS. By deconstructing the question,
      I''ve confirmed Kansas is generally west of Missouri. However, analyzing the
      east Missouri location of St. Genevieve against central Kansas'' Wichita, I''ve
      logically determined St. Genevieve isn''t west of Wichita, addressing the core
      question clearly. The final NO answer stems from the east-west positional comparison.

      My initial assessment is that the user''s core question focuses on determining
      the relative geographical positions of two US zip codes. I''ve begun to break
      down this question by identifying the need to pinpoint the geographical location
      of zip code 19032. This deconstruction will allow me to compare it with the
      location of 61801, ultimately leading to a determination of relative east-west
      positioning.



      **Assessing State Positioning**


      I''m now zeroing in on the relative locations of Pennsylvania and Illinois.
      I''ve pinpointed Drexel Hill, PA, and Champaign/Urbana, IL. Pennsylvania lies
      in the Northeast, and Illinois is in the Midwest. This suggests a straightforward
      answer, which I''ll now articulate concisely.



      **Synthesizing Relative Positions**


      I''ve completed the analysis, determining the relative locations and synthesizing
      the answer. Specifically, I identified the locations of both zip codes: Drexel
      Hill, PA and Champaign/Urbana, IL. By comparing their state locations, I confirmed
      that Champaign/Urbana is west of Drexel Hill. Consequently, since the question
      asks if Drexel Hill is west of Champaign, the answer is no. I''m now ready to
      articulate the solution clearly.



      **Formulating a Concise Response**


      I''ve completed the analysis, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the
      spatial relationship between the zip codes. I''ve broken down the question into
      manageable parts, pinpointing each zip code''s location. By examining the locations

      like a straightforward approach at this stage.



      **Determining State Orientations**


      I''m currently pinpointing the relative east-west positions of the given states.
      Pennsylvania is on the eastern seaboard, and Illinois resides in the Midwest.
      This spatial understanding now requires me to consider the longitude lines for
      each state to definitively say whether Illinois is east or west of Pennsylvania.



      **Confirming Spatial Relationships**


      I''ve now finished processing the location data. Considering the locations,
      Flourtown, PA, and Urbana, IL, I''ve determined the east-west positions. This
      led me to the core of the question. I''ve confirmed that, definitively, 19032,

      coordinates associated with each zip code.



      **Mapping the Geographic Data**


      I''m now identifying the geographic locations linked to each zip code. 19032
      leads to Flourtown, PA, near Philadelphia in eastern Pennsylvania. Meanwhile,
      61801 points to Urbana/Champaign, IL, situated in central Illinois. My next
      step will be comparing these locations on a US map.



      **Analyzing State Positions**


      I''ve clarified the relative positions of the states in question. After mapping
      zip codes, I determined Flourtown, PA, is near Philadelphia, in eastern PA.
      Urbana/Champaign, IL, is in central Illinois. Consulting a US map, I see Illinois
      is west of Pennsylvania, so 19032 is not west of 61801. My response will be

      \nI'm currently trying to establish whether zip code 75604 in Texas lies west\
      \ of 88048 in New Mexico. I started by zeroing in on finding the longitude of\
      \ both locations, which is the key information to determine their relative geographical\
      \ positioning. Once I determine the longitudinal data, I can simply compare\
      \ the values to ascertain the relative geographical positioning.\n\n\n**Pinpointing\
      \ Longitude Values**\n\nI've successfully identified the longitudes for both\
      \ zip codes. Longview, TX (75604) is at approximately 94.7\xB0 W, and Hatch,\
      \ NM (88048) is at approximately 107.1\xB0 W. Now, by comparing these longitude\
      \ values, I am ready to determine whether the Texas zip code lies west of the\
      \ New Mexico zip code, which is the ultimate goal.\n\n\n**Concluding Geographical\
      \ Comparison**\n\nThe analysis is complete! I've determined that the zip code\
      \ 75604 in Texas is located east of the zip code 88048 in New Mexico. The key\
      \ was comparing the longitude values. Longview, TX (75604) has a longitude of\
      \ approximately 94.7\xB0W, while Hatch, NM (88048) has a longitude of approximately\
      \ 107.1\xB0W.  Since a larger west longitude value means a location is farther\
      \ west, and 107.1 is greater than 94.7, the New Mexico zip code is west of the\
      \ Texas zip code.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Comparative Analysis**\n\nI'm now revisiting\
      \ the question to ensure clarity and precision. Initially, I found the necessary\
      \ longitude values for both locations. Now I've revisited the values, ensuring\
      \ that the Longview, Texas zip code is in East Texas, and that the Hatch, New\

      \ West.\n2.  **Identify the location of 88048, NM:** This zip code corresponds\
      \ to the village of Hatch, which is in Southern New Mexico. Its approximate\

      I''m currently focusing on the fundamental need: determining the precise location
      of the Michigan zip code. I''m drilling down to gather the latitude and longitude
      data necessary to compare it later against Nebraska''s zip code, after I find
      its coordinates. This is where the actual comparison will take place.



      **Defining Zip Code Positions**


      I''ve moved on to the second crucial phase, and am now defining what I need.
      I''ve realized I need to find the cities linked to each zip code. After a quick
      lookup, it''s revealed that 48219, MI is linked to Detroit, and 68152, NE is
      in Omaha. The central question has become: Is Detroit, MI located west of Omaha,
      NE?



      **Evaluating the Locations**


      I''ve broken down the central question of which zip code is located further
      west into manageable steps. I''ve outlined the need to find the cities for each
      zip code, which I have done, and then formulated the geographical comparison.
      Now, I''m going through those cities to check and confirm their positions, working
      toward a final yes or no answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the locations associated with each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 48219 is located in Detroit, Michigan.

      3.  The zip code 68152 is located in Omaha, Nebraska.

      4.  Next, we need to compare the geographical locations of Detroit, Michigan,
      and Omaha, Nebraska.

      5.  On a map of the United States, Michigan is located to the east of Nebraska.

      6.  Therefore, Detroit, Michigan (48219) is east of Omaha, Nebraska (68152),
      not west of it.

      of zip code 68152, NE. Now, I''m breaking down the input to isolate the zip
      codes and the comparison required. The next step is to select a strategy to
      solve the question.



      **Mapping Out a Plan**


      I''m now fleshing out the approach. I''m thinking of looking up the cities and
      states associated with the zip codes. Then, I can determine their general locations,
      possibly using state locations as a starting point. The next step is to find
      the cities within each state to ensure accuracy. Finally, a re-evaluation to
      confirm the answer.



      **Outlining the Solution**


      I''ve broken down the problem into a series of logical steps. Identifying the
      zip codes and their associated locations, followed by determining their relative
      positions using state and city locations. The states'' general placement provides
      a framework for comparing the cities. I''ve finalized a structured, step-by-step

      **Revisiting the Question**


      I''ve realized the original question isn''t about comparing states but the specific
      locations tied to the zip codes. I now know that 84010 is Bountiful, Utah, and
      95503 is Eureka, California. My next step is to obtain longitude values for
      both cities to make a spatial comparison.



      **Analyzing Relative Position**


      I''ve determined the zip codes'' locations: Bountiful, Utah, and Eureka, California.
      My latest task is confirming their relative positions. Visualizing a US map,
      Eureka is clearly west of Bountiful. My reasoning, therefore, is: Eureka, CA

      this geographical question.



      **Pinpointing Geographical Relations**


      I''ve got the data points in place and am evaluating the geographical relationship
      between the two zip codes. I now know that 84010, UT corresponds to Bountiful
      and 95503, CA to Eureka. Eureka is on the West Coast, and Bountiful is in Utah.
      Now, I need to compare their longitudes to definitively determine the spatial
      relationship. A location is "west of" another when its longitude is higher (more
      negative in the Western Hemisphere). Utah is east of California.



      **Refining the Spatial Conclusion**


      I''ve just finalized the reasoning and determined the definitive answer. My
      analysis has led me to pinpoint the exact locations for both zip codes: Bountiful,
      UT, and Eureka, CA. After a careful comparison of their longitude values, it''s
      irrefutable that Eureka, CA, is positioned west of Bountiful, UT. Therefore,
      the answer to the original query is no; 84010, UT is not west of 95503, CA.

      To confirm, I pinpointed Bountiful, Utah, and Eureka, California. Comparing
      their longitudes, I''m analyzing the east-west positions to reach a conclusion.



      **Refining the Logical Steps**


      I''ve revised the logic. Now, I''m focusing on refining the steps. Initially,
      I identified the states involved and their relative positions. Then, I found

      I''ve zeroed in on the core question: whether zip code 38834 in Mississippi
      is west of 74105 in Oklahoma. I''m now deconstructing the request, identifying
      each input and its corresponding geographical information to determine the correct
      location relative to each other. I''ll need to figure out what type of spatial
      analysis might be involved next.



      **Comparing Longitudes Geographically**


      I''ve located both zip codes: 38834 in Tupelo, MS and 74105 in Tulsa, OK. The
      core task involves analyzing longitudes to determine relative positions. My
      initial US geography knowledge suggests Oklahoma is west of Mississippi. However,
      I need precise longitudinal data for confirmation. I''m now looking up the longitudes
      of Tupelo and Tulsa to finalize the comparison.



      **Pinpointing Geographical Coordinates**


      I''m now zeroing in on the precise longitudes: Tupelo, Mississippi, and Tulsa,
      Oklahoma. I''ve found their approximate longitudes. I''m confirming that a larger
      longitude value (West) signifies a location further west. I plan to refine the
      comparison and prepare a concise, reasoned answer, starting with the city and
      state for each zip code, and moving toward the longitude.



      **Finalizing Geographical Deduction**


      My reasoning is now complete. I''ve pinpointed Tupelo, Mississippi, and Tulsa,
      Oklahoma, and confirmed Oklahoma''s position further west. By comparing longitudes,
      and carefully deconstructing the prompt, I''ve concluded that Tupelo, MS is
      east of Tulsa, OK. The final answer, in response to the user''s question, is
      unequivocally NO. All steps are clear.

      1.  First, let''s identify the location associated with the zip code 38834,
      MS. This zip code corresponds to the city of Tupelo, Mississippi.

      2.  Next, let''s identify the location associated with the zip code 74105, OK.
      This zip code corresponds to the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

      3.  Now, we compare the geographical positions of these two locations. On a
      map of the United States, the state of Oklahoma is located to the west of the
      state of Mississippi.

      4.  Therefore, Tulsa, Oklahoma is west of Tupelo, Mississippi. The question
      asks if Tupelo, MS is west of Tulsa, OK, which is the opposite of the actual
      geographical relationship.

      \ degree of the difference. I anticipate gathering and analyzing longitude values\
      \ will provide an irrefutable answer.\n\n\n**Finalizing Geographic Comparison**\n\
      \nI've verified that Lansdowne, PA, is near Philadelphia, which is in eastern\
      \ Pennsylvania. Spring Valley, OH, is in southwestern Ohio. I've now confirmed\
      \ the geographical relationship: Ohio is west of Pennsylvania. Moreover, using\

      I''ve identified the core question: Determining the relative east-west positioning
      of two US ZIP codes, specifically 18037 and 44116. The final output must be
      a simple "YES" or "NO." This requires geographical data analysis to compare
      their longitudinal coordinates effectively. I''m focusing on the specific goal
      of delivering a straightforward binary answer.



      **Determining East vs. West**


      I''ve located both ZIP codes. 18037 is Easton, PA (-75.2 degrees), and 44116
      is Rocky River, OH (-81.8 degrees). Now, I need to compare their longitudes.
      Since -81.8 is more negative than -75.2, 44116 is further west. Therefore, I
      can determine the final "YES" or "NO" answer, and I''m ready to formulate it.



      **Refining the Response**


      I''ve finalized my response. The user''s query asks if 18037 is west of 44116.
      Through direct comparison of their calculated longitudes (-75.2 for Easton,
      PA, and -81.8 for Rocky River, OH), I''ve concluded that 18037 is not west of
      44116. Therefore, the definitive answer is "NO". I''m confident in this conclusion.



      **Confirming the Final Answer**


      I''ve completed the reasoning and arrived at the final answer. The core question
      was whether ZIP code 18037 (Easton, PA) is west of ZIP code 44116 (Rocky River,
      OH).  By comparing their geographical positions (Pennsylvania is east of Ohio),
      the answer is a definitive "NO". This simplified approach ensures clarity for
      any user. I am now confident that my response is both accurate and easily understood.



      **Reframing for Simplicity**


      I''ve streamlined the approach, shifting from longitude comparison to a more
      accessible state-based analysis. Easton, PA, is undeniably east of Rocky River,
      OH. The core question directly asks if 18037 is west of 44116. Thus, I''m ready
      to definitively state the answer.


      I''ve refined the process, using state geography for clarity. Since Pennsylvania
      lies east of Ohio, the final response is readily attainable. This method simplifies
      the reasoning, ensuring the answer''s precision and user-friendliness.


      I''ve re-evaluated for clarity, opting for a simpler geographic explanation.
      Pennsylvania''s eastern placement relative to Ohio means Easton is east of Rocky
      River. With that, the answer is imminent. I''m ready to provide the solution.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the general location of the zip code 18037, PA.
      This zip code is for Easton, Pennsylvania, which is in the eastern part of the
      state, right on the border with New Jersey.

      2.  Next, we identify the general location of the zip code 44116, OH. This zip
      code is for Rocky River, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland in the northeastern part
      of the state.

      3.  Finally, we compare the two locations. The state of Pennsylvania is located
      to the east of the state of Ohio. Therefore, any location in eastern Pennsylvania
      will be east of any location in northeastern Ohio.

      4.  Since Easton, PA (18037) is east of Rocky River, OH (44116), it is not west
      of it.

      I''ve determined that the user is essentially asking about the relative geographical
      positions of two US zip codes. I''ll need to pinpoint the city and state for
      each. After that, I will need to devise a concise method to determine a west-east
      relationship, such as longitude comparison.



      **Comparing Geographical Positions**


      I''ve successfully identified the cities and states associated with each zip
      code: Dayton, Ohio (45449) and St. Louis, Missouri (63109). Initial geographical
      knowledge strongly suggests Missouri is west of Ohio. Further examination confirms
      this, even when considering the specific cities, as Dayton is in western Ohio
      and St. Louis is on the eastern border of Missouri.



      **Confirming East-West Positions**


      I''ve clarified the user''s intent: to determine the relative east-west positions
      of two zip codes. I''ve broken down the steps, finding city/state pairs (Dayton,
      OH; St. Louis, MO). I know Missouri is west of Ohio, but I decided to review
      my understanding. I concluded that the statement "45449, OH is west of 63109,
      MO" is incorrect; instead, it is the reverse. My response will be: No.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the locations associated with each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 45449 is for Miamisburg/Dayton, Ohio.

      3.  The zip code 63109 is for St. Louis, Missouri.

      4.  Next, we compare the geographical locations of Ohio and Missouri. The state
      of Missouri is located to the west of the state of Ohio.

      5.  Therefore, St. Louis, Missouri is west of Dayton, Ohio. The question asks
      if Dayton, OH is west of St. Louis, MO, which is incorrect.

      \nI've homed in on the core question: Is 79838, TX west of 85621, AZ? My focus\
      \ now is on pinpointing the geographical locations associated with each ZIP\

      \ some geodata. Finding the cities and states for the provided zip codes, which\
      \ are 79838 and 85621, is my next step.\n\n\n**Refining Geographic Data**\n\n\
      I've located both ZIP codes: 79838 is in Fabens, TX, and 85621 is in Nogales,\
      \ AZ. Now I need the exact longitudes.  I'm ready to find the coordinates to\
      \ accurately compare them. A new plan is forming around using a reliable geographic\
      \ data source for accuracy.  This data will provide an informed result.\n\n\n\
      **Comparing Longitudes Accurately**\n\nI've determined the longitudes: Fabens,\
      \ TX is around -106.2\xB0 W, and Nogales, AZ is around -110.9\xB0 W.  Since\
      \ -110.9 is a larger negative number than -106.2, I conclude that Nogales is\
      \ further west than Fabens. This indicates that 79838, TX is *not* located west\
      \ of 85621, AZ. The answer is clear, so I've finalized my analysis.\n\n\n**Confirming\
      \ Final Answer**\n\nI've meticulously reviewed the logic, and my confidence\
      \ is high. I've broken the question into steps, and systematically identified\
      \ and compared the longitudes. The careful longitude comparison establishes\
      \ Nogales, AZ, as west of Fabens, TX. Therefore, 79838, TX is *not* west of\
      \ 85621, AZ. The answer is clearly NO.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step\
      \ reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the location of the first zip code:** 79838 is\

      \ of Texas, in El Paso County.\n2.  **Identify the location of the second zip\
      \ code:** 85621 is the zip code for Nogales, Arizona. Nogales is located in\
      \ the southern part of Arizona, on the border with Mexico.\n3.  **Compare their\
      \ geographical positions:** To determine which location is further west, we\
      \ need to compare their longitudes.\n    *   The longitude of Fabens, TX (79838)\
      \ is approximately 106.2\xB0 West.\n    *   The longitude of Nogales, AZ (85621)\
      \ is approximately 110.9\xB0 West.\n4.  **Conclusion:** A higher West longitude\
      \ value means a location is farther west. Since 110.9\xB0 W is a higher value\
      \ than 106.2\xB0 W, Nogales, AZ is located west of Fabens, TX. Therefore, 79838,\
      \ TX is located *east* of 85621, AZ.\n\nNO"

      \ (and thus more westward) value than -106.4\xB0, Naco, AZ is indeed located\
      \ west of El Paso, TX.  This aligns with my initial assessment.\n\n\n**Formulating\

      \ Naco, AZ (109.9\xB0 W) has a greater West longitude value than El Paso, TX\

      \ 79838 in Texas corresponds to El Paso, with a longitude of approximately 106.49\xB0\
      W. Next, I identified that 85621 in Arizona is Nogales, Arizona, with a longitude\

      \ identified the longitudes of El Paso (106.49\xB0W) and Nogales (110.94\xB0\
      W). Then I correctly noted that a larger West longitude means farther West.\
      \ Therefore, Nogales is farther west than El Paso, which means zip code 85621\
      \ (Nogales) is west of zip code 79838 (El Paso). My final answer and conclusion\
      \ have been updated.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.\
      \  **Identify the location of the first zip code:** 79838 is a zip code for\
      \ El Paso, Texas.\n2.  **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 85621\
      \ is a zip code for Nogales, Arizona.\n3.  **Determine the relative longitude:**\
      \ To determine which location is further west, we need to compare their longitudes.\n\
      \    *   El Paso, TX is at a longitude of approximately 106.5\xB0 West.\n  \
      \  *   Nogales, AZ is at a longitude of approximately 110.9\xB0 West.\n4.  **Compare\
      \ the longitudes:** A larger West longitude value means a location is farther\
      \ to the west. Since 110.9\xB0 is greater than 106.5\xB0, Nogales, AZ is west\
      \ of El Paso, TX. Therefore, El Paso, TX (79838) is east of Nogales, AZ (85621).\n\

      \nI'm now focused on gathering the necessary geographical coordinates. I've\
      \ decided to locate the latitude and longitude for each ZIP code. Once I have\
      \ that data, I can compare the longitudes. If the longitude of 20032 is less\
      \ than that of 46203, it confirms it's geographically west.\n\n\n**Evaluating\
      \ Longitude Differences**\n\nI've gathered the longitude data for both ZIP codes,\
      \ estimating 77\xB0 W for 20032 and 86\xB0 W for 46203. My understanding is\
      \ that a greater magnitude of longitude indicates being further west. Thus,\
      \ since 86\xB0 W > 77\xB0 W, I'm now certain that 46203 is west of 20032.\n\n\
      \n**Determining Relative Positions**\n\nI've structured my reasoning. Firstly,\
      \ I've identified the essential need to compare longitudes. Secondly, I verified\
      \ that 20032 corresponds to Washington, D.C., and 46203 to Indianapolis, Indiana.\

      \ longitude is further west. Since 86\xB0 W is a greater longitude than 77\xB0\
      \ W, Indianapolis, IN is located west of Washington, D.C.\n5.  **Answer the\

      I''m now gathering the longitudes to compare. I''ve located Goodyear, AZ (85396)
      and determined it''s near Phoenix, roughly -112 degrees longitude. I''ve also
      pinpointed Temple City, CA (91780) for longitude comparison to ascertain the
      "west of" relationship.



      **Outlining Solution Steps**


      I''ve finalized the strategy. I''ll locate each ZIP code''s city, determine
      their longitudes, and compare them. The "west of" comparison hinges on longitude
      values: the more negative the longitude, the further west. I''ve also prepped
      to carefully re-read the question and provide a clear, concise answer.



      **Formulating a Clear Answer**


      The solution is complete! I''ve double-checked all steps: Identifying the cities,
      their longitudes, and the comparison logic. I have also incorporated my step-by-step
      process into a final answer that directly addresses the question. I am now prepared

      \nMy initial assessment focused on the core question: Determining the relative\
      \ geographical position of two zip codes. The task is straightforward: to determine\
      \ if 10993 (NY) lies west of 15062 (PA).  I've already begun to deconstruct\
      \ the request, aiming for a simple \"YES\" or \"NO\" response, but I plan to\
      \ elaborate on the reasoning.\n\n\n**Determining Relative Longitude**\n\nI've\
      \ moved on to determining the relative longitude. I've found that West Nyack,\
      \ NY (10993) has a longitude of approximately -73.96 degrees, while Monaca,\
      \ PA (15062) has a longitude of roughly -80.28 degrees. Now, I need to compare\
      \ these values to determine the answer.  It appears West Nyack is east of Monaca,\
      \ according to my quick calculations.\n\n\n**Summarizing the Logic**\n\nI'm\
      \ now fully immersed in the comparison process. I've broken down the steps,\
      \ finding that West Nyack, NY, has an approximate longitude of -73.96 degrees,\
      \ while Monaca, PA, sits at roughly -80.28 degrees. Comparing these, I've concluded\

      **Outlining Final Answer**\n\nI'm solidifying my approach to presenting the\
      \ solution. I've broken down the steps and reasoning thoroughly. I'll begin\
      \ by identifying the city each zip code corresponds to and then comparing their\
      \ longitudes. I'll make sure to state that a higher longitude value means the\
      \ location is further west, with clear explanations. The final output will be\

      \ code 15062 corresponds to Monaca, Pennsylvania.\n\n2.  **Determine the geographic\
      \ position:** To determine if one location is west of another, we need to compare\
      \ their longitudes.\n    *   The longitude of West Nyack, NY (10993) is approximately\
      \ 73.96\xB0 West.\n    *   The longitude of Monaca, PA (15062) is approximately\
      \ 80.28\xB0 West.\n\n3.  **Compare the longitudes:** A location with a larger\
      \ West longitude value is further west.\n    *   Since 80.28\xB0 is a larger\
      \ value than 73.96\xB0, Monaca, PA is located further west than West Nyack,\
      \ NY.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The question asks if West Nyack, NY (10993) is\
      \ west of Monaca, PA (15062). Based on the comparison, West Nyack is east of\
      \ Monaca.\n\nNO"

      I''ve determined the core question: whether ZIP code 06379 is west of 18218.
      My next step is to break down this question. I''ll need to know the geographical
      locations associated with each ZIP code. I need to be sure I understand what
      data I must acquire and how.



      **Evaluating Relative Locations**


      I''ve determined the locations are Stonington, CT, and Coaldale, PA. Knowing

      Problem solved.



      **Determining the Relative Position**


      I''ve gathered the locations: Stonington, CT, and Coaldale, PA.  My initial
      assessment aligns with US geography, placing PA west of CT.  I''ve double-checked
      my findings with longitude data, confirming Coaldale''s more negative longitude,
      therefore solidifying its western position. I''m now certain that the answer
      to the user''s question is "No."

      ways to compare the locations and determine which is most efficient.



      **Formulating a Concise Response**


      I''ve streamlined the answer. My analysis now clearly identifies Huntington,
      WV and Shawnee, KS. After locating them geographically, I confirmed Kansas lies
      west of West Virginia, implying Huntington''s location is east of Shawnee. I''m
      now ready to craft a precise, user-friendly response, encompassing all the necessary
      steps for clarity.



      **Synthesizing the Response**


      I''ve refined the approach.  I''ve systematically located the cities, Huntington
      and Shawnee. I''ve confirmed that since Kansas is west of West Virginia, Shawnee
      is west of Huntington.  I am ready to formulate a clear, step-by-step response
      that the user requested, ending with a definitive ''no'' answer.  I''ll start
      with the city identification and progress to the geographic comparison.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, identify the location of the zip code 25701, WV. This zip code corresponds
      to Huntington, West Virginia.

      2.  Next, identify the location of the zip code 66217, KS. This zip code corresponds
      to Shawnee, Kansas.

      3.  Finally, compare the geographical locations of these two places on a map
      of the United States. West Virginia is an eastern state, while Kansas is a midwestern
      state.

      4.  Kansas is located geographically to the west of West Virginia. Therefore,
      Huntington, WV is east of Shawnee, KS.

      \ the first zip code with its state, and the second zip code with its state.\
      \ This lays the groundwork for further investigation.\n\n\n**Mapping the Coordinates**\n\
      \nI've determined the approximate longitudes. Huntington, WV, is roughly at\

      and consider the geographic coordinates associated with each zip code to allow
      me to establish their relative positions.



      **Evaluating Zip Codes'' Locations**


      Okay, I''m on to determining the longitude for each zip code now. I''ve successfully
      pinpointed Bristol, VA, at approximately -82.18 degrees. The next step: finding
      the longitude of Madisonville, KY, by leveraging its zip code. I''ll use the

      to the city of Madisonville, Kentucky. The longitude of Madisonville, KY is
      approximately -87.50 degrees.

      3.  **Compare the longitudes:** For locations in the Western Hemisphere, a more
      negative longitude value means the location is further west. Since -87.50 is
      more negative than -82.18, Madisonville, KY (42431) is located west of Bristol,
      VA (24201).

      \nI'm currently focused on defining the geographic locations within the question.\
      \  It's clear I need to determine the latitude and longitude for each ZIP code.\
      \  Once I have that, I'll compare the longitudes.  The goal is to provide a\

      \ This seems the most logical path forward.\n\n\n**Determining Longitudes &\
      \ Comparison**\n\nI've successfully identified the cities associated with the\
      \ ZIP codes: Hebron, CT (06250), and Ringtown, PA (17970). Now, I've secured\
      \ their longitudes: -72.36\xB0 for Hebron and -76.22\xB0 for Ringtown. The next\
      \ step is a simple comparison to determine which is further west.\n\n\n**Concluding\
      \ the Comparison**\n\nI've determined that Hebron, CT, at approximately -72.36\xB0\
      , has a less negative longitude than Ringtown, PA, which is around -76.22\xB0\
      . Therefore, Ringtown, PA, is further west than Hebron, CT, making the ZIP code\

      2.  **Identify the location of the second ZIP code:** 17970 is the ZIP code\
      \ for Ringtown, Pennsylvania.\n3.  **Determine the relative geographical position:**\
      \ To determine if one location is west of another, we compare their longitudes.\
      \ Locations with a higher western longitude (e.g., 80\xB0 W) are west of locations\
      \ with a lower western longitude (e.g., 75\xB0 W).\n4.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n\
      \    *   Hebron, CT is at approximately 72.4\xB0 W longitude.\n    *   Ringtown,\
      \ PA is at approximately 76.2\xB0 W longitude.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since Ringtown,\
      \ PA's longitude (76.2\xB0 W) is a larger western number than Hebron, CT's longitude\
      \ (72.4\xB0 W), Ringtown, PA is located west of Hebron, CT. Therefore, Hebron,\
      \ CT (06250) is located east of Ringtown, PA (17970).\n\nNO"

      I''ve started by focusing on the user''s question, which is deceptively simple.
      My initial step involves clearly defining the user''s query: determining the
      relative geographical positions of two US zip codes. I will need to translate
      the zip code values into something spatial to produce a meaningful answer.



      **Assessing Geographical Coordinates**


      I''ve now executed steps 1 and 2, successfully identifying the cities associated
      with each zip code: Daytona Beach, Florida (32129), and Houston, Texas (77012).
      Step 3 is underway; I''m analyzing the relative positions of these cities, visualizing
      them geographically. I have determined that Houston is indeed west of Daytona
      Beach, a key element in forming my final response.



      **Confirming Geographical Relationship**


      I''ve now clearly defined the user''s question, deconstructed the process, and
      confirmed the locations of the zip codes. My next step involved comparing the
      cities'' geographical positions, confirming Houston, TX is west of Daytona Beach,
      FL. With this, I formulated the final answer, confirming the user''s query.



      **Refining Final Output**


      I''ve now finalized the answer by constructing a comprehensive response that
      includes all of my reasoning. This involved confirming locations, determining
      their geographical relationship using a map, comparing longitudes for precision,
      and finally delivering a clear, concise "NO" answer to the user''s original
      question. The rationale is presented logically, making the process easily understandable.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 77012 is a zip code for
      Houston, Texas.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations:** On a map of the United States, the
      state of Florida is located to the east of the state of Texas. Therefore, Daytona
      Beach, Florida, is east of Houston, Texas.

      4.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Daytona Beach, FL
      (32129) is *west* of Houston, TX (77012). Since Daytona Beach is to the east
      of Houston, the statement is false.

      positioning of two US zip codes. The initial step is identifying the geographical
      coordinates of the areas in question. I am currently researching methods to
      efficiently access and compare these coordinates.



      **Evaluating Relative Locations**


      I''ve successfully located both Raleigh, NC, and Byhalia, MS. Now, the challenge
      is establishing their relative east-west positions. My current approach involves
      visualizing the US map to determine where North Carolina and Mississippi fall
      within the broader geographical context. I am using that map to inform my conclusion.



      **Pinpointing the East-West Dynamics**


      I''ve now meticulously dissected the problem, breaking it down into actionable
      steps. I''ve identified the cities associated with the zip codes and compared
      the states'' general longitudinal placement, concluding North Carolina is east
      of Mississippi. I''ve used longitude values to verify my conclusions. My next
      step will be to formulate the definitive answer.



      **Reaching a Clear Conclusion**


      Now, I''ve methodically processed the information, clearly defining the answer''s
      structure. I''m structuring the final response, confirming that Raleigh, NC,
      isn''t west of Byhalia, MS, thus providing a definitive "NO" to the original
      question. I''m confident in my conclusion.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of the first zip code:** 27604 is a zip code for
      Raleigh, North Carolina.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 38611 is a zip code for
      Byhalia, Mississippi.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations:** The state of North Carolina is located
      to the east of the state of Mississippi. Therefore, Raleigh, NC is east of Byhalia,
      MS.


      NO'

      I''ve started by formulating the key inquiry: determining the relative geographic
      positioning of the two zip codes. I am currently breaking down the question
      to gather the necessary locational data for each zip code.



      **Defining Zip Code Locations**


      I''ve now established the locations of both zip codes. Raleigh, NC, is at 27604,
      and Byhalia, MS, is at 38611. My next step involves comparing their east-west
      positions to address the core question. I''m confident I have the necessary
      data for this comparison.



      **Answering the Geographical Question**


      I''ve just finalized the solution. I''ve broken down the initial query, pinpointed
      the cities linked to each zip code, and assessed their relative east-west positioning.
      My conclusion confirms the answer is "no" because Raleigh, NC, is not west of
      Byhalia, MS. The step-by-step reasoning is now fully articulated.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of 27604, NC:** This zip code corresponds to the
      city of Raleigh, North Carolina.

      2.  **Identify the location of 38611, MS:** This zip code corresponds to the
      town of Byhalia, Mississippi.

      3.  **Compare their geographical positions:** The state of Mississippi is located
      to the west of the state of North Carolina. Therefore, Byhalia, MS is west of
      Raleigh, NC.

      4.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Raleigh, NC (27604) is located
      west of Byhalia, MS (38611). Since Raleigh is to the east, the statement is
      incorrect.

      of zip codes 70712 and 77388. My current focus is deconstructing this question.  I
      realize that I will need the city and state associated with each zip code to
      determine the geographical coordinates necessary for comparison.



      **Analyzing Longitude Data**


      I have determined that 70712 is Batchelor, LA, and 77388 is Spring, TX. My next
      step is to accurately compare their longitudinal positions. I can confirm through
      readily available geographical information that Texas is to the west of Louisiana,
      implying that Spring is indeed west of Batchelor. While I could calculate exact
      coordinates, a general understanding of US geography confirms my conclusion.



      **Refining Geographical Comparisons**


      I''m now certain that the core issue is establishing the directional relationship
      between Batchelor, LA, and Spring, TX. My focus has shifted to the most efficient
      way to articulate this comparison. I have concluded that comparing longitude
      values is the most precise method to validate my initial analysis. I can now
      confidently state my reasoning. I''ll need to verify whether the initial question
      used West correctly, as I can now confirm my findings.



      **Formulating a Clear Response**


      I''ve organized the reasoning into a step-by-step format. The crucial component
      is articulating that Batchelor, LA, lies east of Spring, TX. My next step will
      be to finalize the answer with a decisive "NO" while ensuring clarity throughout.
      I''ve re-reviewed all my findings, and I am ready to convey this information.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of the first zip code:** 70712 is the zip code for
      Batchelor, Louisiana.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 77388 is the zip code
      for Spring, Texas.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations:** The state of Louisiana is located
      to the east of the state of Texas. Therefore, Batchelor, Louisiana is east of
      Spring, Texas.

      4.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if 70712, LA is located *west*
      of 77388, TX. Since it is to the east, the answer is no.

      \nI'm currently focused on the core question: Determining if zip code 70712\
      \ is west of zip code 77388. My initial step involves identifying the necessary\
      \ information, which includes the geographical locations (city/state) of both\
      \ zip codes.\n\n\n**Determining Longitudes and Locations**\n\nI've successfully\
      \ identified the geographical locations and approximate longitudes for both\

      I've determined the answer: 70712 (Batchelor, LA) is *east* of 77388 (Spring,\
      \ TX). My reasoning, leveraging longitude values (-91.6\xB0 W vs. -95.4\xB0\

      \ 77388, TX.** This zip code is for Spring, Texas.\n3.  **Compare their geographical\
      \ longitudes.** Batchelor, Louisiana, is at approximately 91.6\xB0 W longitude.\
      \ Spring, Texas, is at approximately 95.4\xB0 W longitude.\n4.  **Determine\
      \ which is further west.** A location with a higher West longitude number is\
      \ farther west. Since 95.4\xB0 W is a higher value than 91.6\xB0 W, Spring,\
      \ TX is located west of Batchelor, LA. Therefore, 70712, LA is located *east*\
      \ of 77388, TX.\n\nNO"

      \ -83.98\xB0, and Oklahoma City, OK (73142) has a longitude of approximately\
      \ -97.52\xB0. Because -97.52 is more negative than -83.98, Oklahoma City is\

      \  **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 73142 is a zip code for\
      \ Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n3.  **Determine the relative geographical position:**\
      \ Geographically, the state of Georgia is located to the east of the state of\
      \ Oklahoma.\n4.  **Compare the longitudes:** Dahlonega, GA is at a longitude\
      \ of approximately 84\xB0 West. Oklahoma City, OK is at a longitude of approximately\
      \ 97.5\xB0 West. A larger western longitude value means the location is further\
      \ west.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since Oklahoma City (97.5\xB0 W) has a larger western\
      \ longitude than Dahlonega (84\xB0 W), Oklahoma City is west of Dahlonega. Therefore,\
      \ Dahlonega, GA is *east* of Oklahoma City, OK.\n\nNO"

      is indeed located west of Fitchburg, Massachusetts. I''m considering consulting
      a map to verify the relative longitudes for absolute precision, though I''m
      confident in my initial assessment.

      I''m currently focused on the core question: Determining the relative geographical
      position of zip codes 07432 and 15139. My approach involves first identifying
      the corresponding cities or towns for each zip code. This preliminary step is
      crucial for accurate comparison.



      **Confirming Geographical Relation**


      Now, I''ve confirmed that 07432 is in Oakland, NJ, and 15139 is in Plum, PA.
      My next step involves comparing their longitudes to definitively determine which
      is further west. While Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey generally, precise
      coordinates will solidify the answer to our core question.



      **Refining the Solution**


      The geographical comparison is now complete. I''ve pinpointed that Plum, PA
      is west of Oakland, NJ. The longitude data provided a precise verification of
      this fact.  Therefore, I''ve concluded that the answer to the core question
      is negative. This information is ready for presentation.



      **Confirming the Conclusion**


      I''ve thoroughly checked my work. I started by breaking down the core question
      into manageable steps: identifying the locations, comparing their geographical
      positions using longitude data, and then forming an answer. After identifying
      Oakland, NJ, and Plum, PA, I verified their relative positions, solidifying
      that Plum is indeed west of Oakland. My final answer, "NO," is sound. I''m ready
      to present my findings.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the locations associated with each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 07432 is for Oakland, New Jersey.

      3.  The zip code 15139 is for Plum, Pennsylvania.

      4.  Next, we compare the geographical locations of these two places. The entire
      state of Pennsylvania is located to the west of the entire state of New Jersey.

      5.  Therefore, Plum, Pennsylvania (15139) is west of Oakland, New Jersey (07432).


      The question asks if 07432, NJ is west of 15139, PA. Based on the reasoning,
      it is not.

      My initial thought was to determine if zip code 07432 (NJ) is west of 15139
      (PA). To do this, I started by thinking I need to find the city and state for
      each zip code. This would provide a foundation for comparison.



      **Evaluating Geographical Positions**


      I''ve made significant progress by determining the cities and states associated
      with each zip code. I established that 07432 is in Oakland, NJ, and 15139 is
      in Plum, PA. My geographical knowledge suggests New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania,
      so Oakland is likely east of Plum. I''m now cross-referencing this with coordinate
      data to confirm my assessment.



      **Finalizing Geographical Conclusion**


      I''ve now reached the final stages of this analysis. Having identified the city
      and state for each zip code, I confirmed my initial geographical intuition that
      New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania. Furthermore, coordinate comparisons solidified
      this, showing Plum, PA, with a greater west longitude, is west of Oakland, NJ.
      Thus, the original proposition, that 07432 is west of 15139, is false; my final
      answer is no.

      for Plum, Pennsylvania.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations:** The state of New Jersey is located
      entirely to the east of the state of Pennsylvania. Therefore, any location in
      New Jersey (like Oakland) will be east of any location in Pennsylvania (like
      Plum).

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since Oakland, NJ is east of Plum, PA, it is not west of
      it.

      \nI'm focusing on pinpointing the geographic relationship between two specific\
      \ zip codes, 19363 and 26330. My goal is to determine, with certainty, whether\
      \ the former is situated west of the latter. The answer must be definitive and\
      \ concise, a simple yes or no. The core challenge is to accurately represent\
      \ the geographical location of each zip code.\n\n\n**Assessing Geographic Coordinates**\n\
      \nI've determined that 26330, WV, is assigned to Bridgeport. Its approximate\
      \ coordinates are Latitude ~39.31\xB0 N, Longitude ~80.25\xB0 W. Now, I need\
      \ to compare longitudes. Oxford, PA, at ~75.98\xB0 W, is indeed east of Bridgeport,\
      \ WV, at ~80.25\xB0 W. Therefore, the definitive answer is NO: 19363, PA is\
      \ *not* west of 26330, WV.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Question**\n\nI've re-examined\
      \ the user's query and the geographical locations I've identified. My conclusion\
      \ now is a definitive \"NO\". Upon comparison, I confirmed that 19363 is not\
      \ situated west of 26330; the opposite is true. I'm now certain of the final\
      \ answer.\n\n\n**Refining the Logical Flow**\n\nI've streamlined the logic by\
      \ solidifying the step-by-step reasoning for generating the final answer. First,\
      \ I identify the city and state for each zip code. Then, the longitude is determined.\
      \ The longitudes are compared, and then the final conclusion is derived. Given\
      \ that Clarksburg, WV, with its more negative longitude, is west of Oxford,\
      \ PA, the answer is NO.\n\n\n**Formulating Final Output**\n\nI've crafted a\
      \ comprehensive response with clear reasoning to address the user's question,\
      \ including identifying locations, determining longitudes, and comparing positions.\
      \ After carefully reviewing the reasoning steps, I'm confident in the final\
      \ \"NO\" answer. The output is formatted with explicit steps, and concludes\
      \ the reply with the requested one-word answer.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step\

      \ with each zip code.\n    *   The zip code 19363 is for Oxford, Pennsylvania.\n\
      \    *   The zip code 26330 is for Clarksburg, West Virginia.\n\n2.  Next, we\
      \ determine the approximate longitude for each location. In the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ a location with a larger longitude value is further west.\n    *   Oxford,\
      \ PA (19363) is located at a longitude of approximately **75.98\xB0 W**.\n \
      \   *   Clarksburg, WV (26330) is located at a longitude of approximately **80.34\xB0\
      \ W**.\n\n3.  Finally, we compare the two longitudes.\n    *   Since 80.34\xB0\
      \ W is a larger value than 75.98\xB0 W, Clarksburg, WV (26330) is located west\
      \ of Oxford, PA (19363).\n    *   This means that 19363, PA is located **east**\
      \ of 26330, WV.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is 19363, PA located\
      \ west of 26330, WV?\" is no.\n\n**NO**"

      \nI've made significant progress by comparing the longitudes: -75.98\xB0W for\
      \ Oxford, PA (19363) and -80.34\xB0W for Clarksburg, WV (26330). I've successfully\
      \ concluded that since -80.34 is more negative, Clarksburg is further west.\
      \ Therefore, my answer is now refined to specifically address the initial query.\n\
      \n\n**Refining the Answer**\n\nI've just refined my reasoning to clarify the\
      \ final answer. I've concluded that since Clarksburg, WV has a more negative\
      \ longitude (-80.34\xB0 W) than Oxford, PA (-75.98\xB0 W), Clarksburg is indeed\
      \ further west. Therefore, the original question, \"Is 19363, PA located west\
      \ of 26330, WV?\" can be definitively answered with a \"No.\" My step-by-step\
      \ reasoning is clear and complete, now.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step\
      \ reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the location of the first zip code:** The zip\
      \ code 19363 corresponds to Oxford, Pennsylvania.\n2.  **Find its longitude:**\
      \ The longitude of Oxford, PA is approximately -75.98\xB0 W.\n3.  **Identify\
      \ the location of the second zip code:** The zip code 26330 corresponds to Clarksburg,\
      \ West Virginia.\n4.  **Find its longitude:** The longitude of Clarksburg, WV\
      \ is approximately -80.34\xB0 W.\n5.  **Compare the longitudes:** For locations\
      \ in the Western Hemisphere, a more negative longitude value means the location\
      \ is farther west. Since -80.34 is more negative than -75.98, Clarksburg, WV\
      \ (26330) is west of Oxford, PA (19363). Therefore, Oxford, PA is east of Clarksburg,\
      \ WV.\n\nNO"
    f1032985-7ed1-43a1-b7be-4231bea3c0b2: "<think>**Assessing the Location**\n\nI'm\
      \ currently focused on determining whether zip code 19363 is west of 26330.\
      \ I've begun to break down the problem. Finding the geographical coordinates\
      \ is the first step, and I'm figuring out how to obtain these coordinates accurately.\
      \ My plan is to use those coordinates to make a solid comparison.\n\n\n**Determining\
      \ Longitudes**\n\nI've successfully identified the coordinates for Oxford, PA\
      \ (19363) and Clarksburg, WV (26330). My focus has shifted to pinpointing the\
      \ longitudes. I've found Oxford's longitude is -75.98\xB0 W, and Clarksburg's\
      \ is -80.34\xB0 W.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've reviewed the longitudes\
      \ of both locations: Oxford, PA's longitude is -75.98\xB0W, and Clarksburg,\
      \ WV's is -80.34\xB0W. After careful consideration, I have concluded that Oxford,\
      \ PA, is to the east of Clarksburg, WV. I've broken down the problem systematically\
      \ to ensure accuracy in this final judgment.\n\n\n**Refining My Analysis**\n\
      \nI'm now consolidating my findings into a clear, step-by-step breakdown. I've\
      \ re-examined the longitude comparison, ensuring the logic is airtight. The\
      \ crucial point is confirming that -75.98 is not more negative than -80.34,\
      \ thus cementing my conclusion about the relative locations of Oxford and Clarksburg.\n\
      \n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  First, we need to identify\
      \ the primary city or region for each zip code.\n    *   The zip code 19363\
      \ is for Oxford, Pennsylvania.\n    *   The zip code 26330 is for Clarksburg,\
      \ West Virginia.\n\n2.  Next, we need to find the approximate longitude for\
      \ each location to determine their east-west relationship.\n    *   Oxford,\
      \ PA (19363) is located at a longitude of approximately **-75.98\xB0 W**.\n\
      \    *   Clarksburg, WV (26330) is located at a longitude of approximately **-80.34\xB0\
      \ W**.\n\n3.  Finally, we compare the longitudes. A location is \"west of\"\
      \ another if it has a more negative longitude value.\n    *   -75.98 is a less\
      \ negative number than -80.34.\n    *   This means that Oxford, PA (19363) is\
      \ located to the **east** of Clarksburg, WV (26330).\n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ to the question \"Is 19363, PA located west of 26330, WV?\" is:\n\nNO"
