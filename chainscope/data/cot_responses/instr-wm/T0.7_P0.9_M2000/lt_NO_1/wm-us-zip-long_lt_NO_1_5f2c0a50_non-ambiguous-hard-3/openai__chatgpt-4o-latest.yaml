      Step 2: Understand US geography.

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern part of the United States.

      - Ohio is located to the west of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Consider longitude.

      - Longitude increases as you move west in the United States.

      - Westport, MA (02790) is approximately at longitude -71.1.

      - Conneaut, OH (44030) is approximately at longitude -80.6.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      - -71.1 (MA) is east of -80.6 (OH), because -71.1 is a higher (less negative)
      number on the longitude scale.


      Therefore, 02790, MA is located EAST of 44030, OH.
