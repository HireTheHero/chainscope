      To solve this, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip codes.
      In general, Illinois is east of Iowa. Iowa borders Illinois on the east, meaning
      Iowa is west of Illinois.


      So generally speaking, a location in Illinois (60137) would be east of a location
      in Iowa (50703), not west of it.


      However, I should be careful with specific zip codes, as states can have unusual
      shapes. Let me think about these specific zip codes:


      60137 is likely in the Chicago metropolitan area in Illinois, which is in the
      northeastern part of the state.

      50703 is likely in Iowa, which is entirely west of Illinois.

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 50703 is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Illinois and Iowa

      - Iowa is located directly west of Illinois

      - Illinois shares its western border with Iowa''s eastern border


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      - 60137 is in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, in the northeastern part of the state

      - 50703 is in Waterloo, Iowa, in the eastern part of Iowa


      Step 4: Determine relative position

      - Since Iowa is west of Illinois, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states'' normal territories (not in unusual border areas), the Illinois zip
      code (60137) must be east of the Iowa zip code (50703)

      2. 50703, IA - This is a zip code in Iowa (IA)


      I need to determine if the first location is west of the second location.


      In the US, states are generally positioned relative to each other as follows:

      So 60137, IL is likely east of 50703, IA, not west.

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL)

      ## Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Looking at the US map, Iowa (IA) is located west of Illinois (IL). Illinois
      borders Iowa on Iowa''s eastern side.


      ## Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the zip codes

      Since Iowa is west of Illinois, a zip code in Iowa (50703) would be west of

      to determine whether the ZIP code 35749 in Alabama (AL) is located west of ZIP
      code 73505 in Oklahoma (OK).


      First, I need to recall the geographic positions of Alabama and Oklahoma within
      the United States:

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is west of Alabama in the United States. This means
      that locations in Alabama are typically east of locations in Oklahoma, not west.


      Let me be more specific about the ZIP codes:

      - 35749 is a ZIP code in Alabama

      - 73505 is a ZIP code in Oklahoma


      Since Alabama is east of Oklahoma, ZIP code 35749 in Alabama would be east of
      ZIP code 73505 in Oklahoma, not west of it.


      So, 35749, AL is NOT located west of 73505, OK. It''s located east of it.</think>#
      Is 35749, AL located west of 73505, OK?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 35749 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 73505 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Looking at a US map, Alabama is positioned to the east of Oklahoma. The entire
      state of Alabama is east of Oklahoma, regardless of the specific ZIP codes within
      each state.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Alabama is east of Oklahoma, ZIP code 35749 in Alabama must be east of
      ZIP code 73505 in Oklahoma, not west of it.

      35749 is a zip code in Alabama (AL).

      73505 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK).


      Generally speaking, Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, while
      Oklahoma is in the south-central United States. Looking at a map of the US,
      Oklahoma is generally west of Alabama.


      Since longitude decreases as you move west, if 35749, AL is west of 73505, OK,
      then the longitude of 35749 would be less than the longitude of 73505.


      However, based on the typical geographic positions of these states, Alabama
      is east of Oklahoma, not west. So I would expect that 35749, AL is NOT west
      of 73505, OK.


      To be completely sure, I would need the exact longitude coordinates of these

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on the map.

      - On a US map, Oklahoma is positioned west of Alabama

      - Alabama is to the east of Oklahoma, not to the west


      Step 4: Apply directional logic.

      - For 35749, AL to be west of 73505, OK, Alabama would need to be west of Oklahoma

      - But the opposite is true - Oklahoma is west of Alabama


      Therefore, 35749, AL is NOT located west of 73505, OK.

      positions of two zip codes: 07440 in New Jersey (NJ) and 15468 in Pennsylvania
      (PA).


      To figure out if one zip code is west of another, I need to know their geographic
      coordinates or at least their relative positions.


      In the US, zip codes generally follow patterns where lower numbers are in the
      eastern parts of the country and higher numbers in the western parts. But this
      is a very general pattern and might not help for comparing specific zip codes
      across state lines.


      07440 is in New Jersey, which is generally east of Pennsylvania on the US map.

      15468 is in Pennsylvania.


      The first digit of zip codes roughly divides the US from east to west:

      - 0 typically covers areas in the northeastern US, including NJ

      - 1 typically covers areas in the mid-Atlantic and parts of the northeast, including
      PA


      So just from the first digit, 07440 (starting with 0) would be expected to be
      east of 15468 (starting with 1).


      Given these facts:

      1. New Jersey is generally east of Pennsylvania

      2. The zip code 07440 (in NJ) starts with 0, which is typically more eastern
      than zip codes starting with 1

      3. The zip code 15468 (in PA) starts with 1

      Determining if 07440, NJ is west of 15468, PA


      I need to analyze the geographic locations of these zip codes based on their
      numbers and states.


      ## Step 1: Understand zip code numbering patterns

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern
      parts of the country and higher numbers are in the western parts.


      ## Step 2: Examine the first digits

      - 07440 starts with ''0'', which corresponds to the northeastern region

      - 15468 starts with ''1'', which corresponds to areas west of the ''0'' region


      ## Step 3: Consider state positions

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the eastern seaboard

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located west of New Jersey


      ## Step 4: Combine zip code and state information

      Since 07440 is in New Jersey (an eastern state) and has a lower first digit
      than 15468 in Pennsylvania, 07440 is east of 15468, not west.

      west of 15468, PA, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative east-west positioning


      For zip codes in the US:

      - Lower numbers generally appear in the eastern US

      - Higher numbers generally appear in the western US


      07440 is in New Jersey (NJ), which is on the east coast

      15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is west of New Jersey


      Additionally, the first digit gives us important information:

      - 0xxxx zip codes are in the northeastern region

      - 1xxxx zip codes are also in the northeastern region, but generally more western
      than 0xxxx


      So 07440 (NJ) should be east of 15468 (PA), not west of it.</think>I need to
      determine the relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify what the zip codes tell us about location.

      US zip codes are organized geographically, with the first digit generally increasing
      as you move west across the country. The lower numbers (0, 1) are in the eastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare the first digits of the zip codes.

      - 07440 begins with "0" (New Jersey)

      - 15468 begins with "1" (Pennsylvania)


      Step 3: Consider the states'' geographical positions.

      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania (PA) is
      immediately to its west.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on both the zip code system and state locations.

      Since 07440 has a lower first digit (0) than 15468 (1), and New Jersey is generally
      east of Pennsylvania, 07440 NJ is east of 15468 PA, not west of it.

      Let me think about the structure of US zip codes. Generally:

      - First digit: Represents a group of states (from 0 in the Northeast to 9 in
      the West)

      - Next two digits: Sectional center or region

      - Last two digits: Specific post office or delivery area


      From the zip codes:

      - 07440 has first digit 0, which corresponds to the Northeast (typically NJ,

      Since both are in the Northeast (NJ and PA), I need to think about their relative

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is inland, to

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me think about the general pattern of US zip codes. The first digit generally
      indicates a region, moving from east (0, 1) to west (9). But this is a rough
      guideline and not precise enough for comparing two specific zip codes, especially
      when they''re in neighboring states.


      Let''s look at these specific zip codes:

      - 99324 is in Washington state (WA)

      - 97239 is in Oregon state (OR)


      Geographically, Washington is north of Oregon. So the north-south position is
      clear (WA is north of OR), but that doesn''t tell us about east-west positioning.


      Looking at the zip codes:

      - 99xxx zip codes are typically in eastern Washington

      - 99324 is in Washington state (WA)

      - 97239 is in Oregon state (OR)

      Portland (97239) is located near the western edge of Oregon, while Waitsburg

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me analyze:


      99324 is in Washington state (WA)

      97239 is in Oregon state (OR)


      Generally, Washington is north of Oregon, but their east-west positioning depends
      on the specific locations within each state.


      Washington is mostly north of Oregon, and both states are on the west coast
      of the US. Oregon borders the Pacific Ocean on its western edge, and Washington
      is north of Oregon.


      The specific zip codes:

      in the eastern part of the state

      - 97239: This appears to be in western Oregon, likely in or near Portland, as
      972xx zip codes are typically in the Portland area


      Eastern Washington would be east of western Oregon. Portland is on the western
      side of Oregon, while the 993xx zip codes typically cover the southeastern part

      - 97239 is in Oregon state (OR)


      Step 2: Determine more specific locations.

      - 99324 appears to be in the eastern part of Washington, as 993xx zip codes
      typically cover the eastern portion of the state. Specifically, 99324 is in
      Walla Walla County in the southeastern part of Washington.

      - 97239 is in the Portland area of Oregon, in the northwestern part of the state.
      Portland is located near the western side of Oregon.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions.

      - Even though Washington is north of Oregon, eastern Washington (where 99324
      is) extends farther east than northwestern Oregon (where 97239 is).

      - Portland (97239) is close to the Pacific coast, while Walla Walla area (99324)

      99324 in Washington (WA) is located west of zip code 97239 in Oregon (OR).


      First, let me think about the geography of Washington and Oregon:

      - Washington is north of Oregon

      - Both states are on the west coast of the United States

      - Within these states, generally lower zip codes tend to be in the western parts
      and higher zip codes in the eastern parts


      Now, let''s analyze the specific zip codes:

      - 99324 is in Washington. Zip codes in the 993xx range are typically in eastern
      Washington

      - 97239 is in Oregon. Zip codes in the 972xx range are typically in the Portland
      area, which is in the northwestern part of Oregon


      Given that 99324 is likely in eastern Washington and 97239 is likely in northwestern
      Oregon, 99324 is probably east of 97239, not west.


      To be more precise:

      - 99324 appears to be for Burbank/Walla Walla area in eastern Washington

      - 97239 appears to be in Portland, Oregon, which is in the northwestern part
      of the state near the Columbia River


      So 99324 (eastern Washington) would be east of 97239 (northwestern Oregon),
      not west.</think>To determine if 99324, WA is located west of 97239, OR, I need
      to identify the locations of these zip codes and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 99324 is in Washington state, specifically in the Burbank/Walla Walla area
      in the southeastern part of the state.

      - 97239 is in Oregon, specifically in the Portland area in the northwestern
      part of Oregon.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      - Washington is north of Oregon.

      - Both states border the Pacific Ocean on their western sides.

      - Zip codes in the 990-994 range typically cover eastern Washington.

      - Zip codes in the 970-979 range typically cover western Oregon, including Portland.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions.

      - Portland (97239) is located in northwestern Oregon, close to the Pacific coast.

      - Walla Walla/Burbank area (99324) is in the southeastern part of Washington,
      near the Idaho border.

      - On a map, the Walla Walla area is significantly east of Portland.

      west of 97239, OR, I need to identify the locations corresponding to these zip
      codes and compare their geographic positions (specifically their longitude).


      First, let me figure out what cities these zip codes represent:

      - 99324, WA is in Washington state

      - 97239, OR is in Oregon state


      In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the
      east and higher numbers in the west, but there are many exceptions. So I need
      to determine the exact locations.


      99324, WA corresponds to the Burbank/Walla Walla area in eastern Washington.

      97239, OR corresponds to an area in Portland, Oregon, which is in the northwestern
      part of Oregon.


      Geographically, Washington state is north of Oregon. However, the question is
      about east-west positioning.


      Eastern Washington (where 99324 is) is generally east of Portland, Oregon (where
      97239 is). Portland is located in the western part of Oregon near the border
      with Washington, while Walla Walla area is in the eastern part of Washington.


      So 99324, WA (Walla Walla area) should be EAST of 97239, OR (Portland area),
      not west.</think># Is 99324, WA located west of 97239, OR?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 99324 is in Washington state (WA)

      - 97239 is in Oregon state (OR)


      ## Step 2: Determine more specific locations

      - 99324 corresponds to the Walla Walla area in eastern Washington

      - 97239 corresponds to an area in Portland, which is in northwestern Oregon


      ## Step 3: Compare their geographic positions

      While Washington is north of Oregon, I need to focus on east-west positioning:

      - Portland (97239) is located near the western edge of Oregon, close to the
      Pacific coast

      - Walla Walla (99324) is located in the eastern part of Washington


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Eastern Washington is east of Portland, not west of it. On a map, 99324 would
      be to the right (east) of 97239.

      I need to determine if 99324, WA (Washington) is located west of 97239, OR (Oregon).


      First, I need to understand the geography of these zip codes:

      - 99324 is a zip code in Washington state

      - 97239 is a zip code in Oregon state


      In general, Washington is north of Oregon. However, to determine if one location
      is west of another, I need to consider their longitudes.


      In the US zip code system:

      - Lower zip codes in the first 3 digits generally correspond to areas in the
      eastern US

      - Higher zip codes in the first 3 digits generally correspond to areas in the
      western US


      Looking at these:

      - 993xx (for WA) is higher than 972xx (for OR)


      However, this general pattern isn''t reliable for determining east/west positioning
      between neighboring states, especially since both are western states with relatively
      high zip codes.


      Instead, I should think about the specific areas. Let me try to recall:

      - 97239 is likely in the Portland area of Oregon (northwestern Oregon)

      - 99324 is likely in eastern Washington


      Washington is north of Oregon, but eastern Washington would be east of northwestern
      Oregon. So it''s likely that 99324, WA is EAST of 97239, OR - not west.</think>#
      Is 99324, WA located west of 97239, OR?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 99324 is in Washington state (WA)

      - 97239 is in Oregon state (OR)


      ## Step 2: Analyze zip code patterns

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the east
      and higher numbers in the west. Here, 99324 (WA) has a higher number than 97239
      (OR), which might suggest it''s further west.


      ## Step 3: Consider regional geography

      However, the first digits (9) indicate both are in the far western US. More
      specifically:

      - The 972xx range typically covers the Portland metropolitan area in northwestern
      Oregon

      - The 993xx range typically covers eastern Washington


      ## Step 4: Compare actual positions

      Eastern Washington is located to the EAST of northwestern Oregon, not to the
      west. Despite Washington being north of Oregon, the specific regions these zip
      codes represent have a different east-west relationship than their states overall.

      First, let me think about the states themselves:

      - IA (Iowa) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - WY (Wyoming) is in the Western United States


      Generally speaking, Wyoming is west of Iowa. The entire state of Wyoming lies
      west of Iowa.


      Now, let''s think about the specific zip codes. US zip codes generally follow
      a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the eastern parts of the country,
      and higher numbers tend to be in the western parts.


      51250 (Iowa) - starts with 5, which is generally in the central part of the
      US

      82609 (Wyoming) - starts with 8, which is in the western part of the US


      Based on the standard ZIP code numbering system, 82609 (Wyoming) would be further
      west than 51250 (Iowa).

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Wyoming is located in the Western United States

      - Wyoming is entirely west of Iowa


      Step 3: Consider the ZIP code numbering system

      - US ZIP codes generally increase as you move from east to west

      - 51250 (starts with 5) is a lower number than 82609 (starts with 8)

      - This confirms that Wyoming''s zip code is further west

      ## Conclusion

      NO - 51250, IA is not west of 82609, WY. It is east of it.'
    f093a49d-b320-4810-b798-c4743fbdb680: '<think>Let''s break this down:


      1. We have two ZIP codes: 51250, IA and 82609, WY.

      2. IA is the abbreviation for Iowa, and WY is the abbreviation for Wyoming.

      3. We need to determine if 51250, IA (in Iowa) is located west of 82609, WY
      (in Wyoming).


      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to know their relative
      positions geographically. In the US, states further west have a higher longitude
      (in negative numbers, so closer to the Pacific Ocean).


      Wyoming is located in the western part of the United States, while Iowa is in
      the Midwest. Geographically speaking:

      - Wyoming is west of Iowa

      - Therefore, Iowa is east of Wyoming


      Since 51250, IA is in Iowa, and 82609, WY is in Wyoming, and Iowa is east of
      Wyoming, it means that 51250, IA is east of 82609, WY, not west.


      So, is 51250, IA located west of 82609, WY? No, it''s located east of it.</think>#
      Is 51250, IA located west of 82609, WY?


      I need to determine the geographic relationship between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 51250 is in Iowa (IA)

      - 82609 is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Wyoming is located in the western United States

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest, east of Wyoming

      - Looking at a U.S. map, Wyoming is clearly west of Iowa


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      - Since 51250 is in Iowa, and 82609 is in Wyoming

      - And Iowa is east of Wyoming

      - Therefore, 51250, IA must be east of 82609, WY

      - This means 51250, IA cannot be west of 82609, WY

      1) I need to determine if the zip code 51250, IA (Iowa) is located west of 82609,
      WY (Wyoming).


      2) First, I should consider the general geography of these two states. Wyoming
      is in the western part of the United States, while Iowa is in the Midwest. Generally,
      Wyoming is west of Iowa.


      3) Since the question is asking if Iowa''s zip code is west of Wyoming''s zip
      code, I need to consider if there''s any way this could be true. Since Wyoming
      is west of Iowa geographically, it''s very unlikely that any location in Iowa
      would be west of a location in Wyoming.


      4) While ZIP codes aren''t perfectly aligned with longitude, they generally
      follow geographical patterns where western states have higher first digits than
      eastern states in the US zip code system. Wyoming''s zip code starts with 82,
      while Iowa''s starts with 51. The higher first digits for Wyoming (82 vs 51)
      further supports that Wyoming is west of Iowa.


      So based on the general geography of the United States, with Wyoming being west
      of Iowa, I can conclude that 51250, IA is NOT west of 82609, WY. Instead, 51250,
      IA would be east of 82609, WY.</think># Is 51250, IA located west of 82609,
      WY?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the geographic locations of Iowa (IA) and Wyoming
      (WY).


      2) Wyoming is located in the western United States, while Iowa is in the Midwest
      region.


      3) Looking at a map of the US, Wyoming is clearly west of Iowa. Iowa borders
      the Mississippi River to the east, while Wyoming is several states to the west.


      4) If we consider the general pattern of US zip codes, the first digit often
      increases as you move from east to west. The zip code 51250 (starting with 5)
      suggests an eastern location compared to 82609 (starting with 8).


      5) Since Wyoming is geographically west of Iowa, any location in Wyoming (including
      82609) would be west of locations in Iowa (including 51250).


      Therefore, 51250, IA is NOT located west of 82609, WY. It is east of it.

      The question is whether 85013, AZ is located west of 92672, CA.


      To answer this, I need to know the east-west orientation of these locations.
      In the US, generally speaking, California is west of Arizona. California borders
      the Pacific Ocean on its western side, while Arizona is inland to the east of
      California.


      Since 85013 is in Arizona and 92672 is in California, and California is generally
      west of Arizona, the answer would be NO - 85013, AZ is NOT located west of 92672,
      CA. Instead, 85013, AZ would be east of 92672, CA.


      Let me just double-check this reasoning:

      - California is on the west coast of the US

      - Arizona is inland, east of California

      - Therefore, any point in Arizona would be east of most points in California


      So the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine whether zip code 85013 in Arizona

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Arizona
      is inland and east of California.


      Step 2: California borders the Pacific Ocean, making it the westernmost of the
      two states in question.


      Step 3: Since 85013 is in Arizona and 92672 is in California, the Arizona zip
      code must be east of the California zip code, not west.


      Step 4: While there might be some areas where state borders have irregular shapes,

      To determine this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these
      ZIP codes. Generally speaking, California is on the west coast of the United
      States, while Arizona is located inland to the east of California. This would
      suggest that the Arizona ZIP code is east of the California ZIP code, not west.


      Let me think about the general layout of these states:

      - California is the westernmost contiguous US state, bordering the Pacific Ocean

      - Arizona borders California to the east

      - Moving from California to Arizona means moving eastward


      So 85013, AZ (which is likely in the Phoenix area) would be east of 92672, CA

      - Arizona is located directly east of California


      ## Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the ZIP codes

      - Since 85013 is in Arizona, and Arizona is east of California

      - And 92672 is in California, which is west of Arizona

      - The Arizona ZIP code must be east of the California ZIP code, not west

      step.


      I need to determine if zip code 85013 in Arizona is located west of zip code
      92672 in California.


      First, I need to recall the general geographical relationship between Arizona
      and California:

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is located east of California


      Based on this general knowledge, most locations in Arizona would be east of
      locations in California, not west.


      However, I should consider the specific zip codes:

      - 85013 is in Arizona (specifically in Phoenix)

      - 92672 is in California (I believe this is in Southern California)


      Since California is west of Arizona, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, it would be highly unlikely for the Arizona zip code to be west of the
      California one.

      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' positions

      California is located on the western coast of the United States, while Arizona
      is located directly east of California.


      ## Step 2: Consider the specific zip codes

      - 85013 is in Arizona (Phoenix area)

      - 92672 is in California (San Clemente area in Southern California)


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      Since California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west, and Arizona is inland
      to the east of California, any location in Arizona would be east of (not west
      of) locations in California.


      Therefore, 85013 in Arizona is east of 92672 in California, not west of it.

      Therefore, 85013 in Arizona would be east of 92672 in California, not west of
      it.


      This is true regardless of the specific locations within each state, since Arizona
      as a whole is east of California.</think>To answer this question, I need to

      Since Arizona is east of California geographically, any location in Arizona
      (including 85013) must be east of any location in California (including 92672).


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since 85013, AZ is east of 92672, CA (not west of it), the answer is:

      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Louisiana and Texas.

      - Louisiana is positioned to the east of Texas on the US map

      - Texas forms the western border of Louisiana


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Kenner is in southeastern Louisiana, near New Orleans

      - Houston is in southeastern Texas


      Step 4: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these locations are in comparable parts
      of their respective states, Kenner (70065) would be east of Houston (77008)

      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Vermont is positioned far to the east of Michigan on a U.S. map.

      First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of the states:

      - NH stands for New Hampshire, which is in the northeastern United States

      - MI stands for Michigan, which is in the Midwest region


      In terms of relative longitude:

      - New Hampshire is on the east coast of the United States

      - Michigan is much more inland and further west


      The cardinal directions on a standard map of the United States have west on
      the left and east on the right. So if something is west of something else, it
      means it''s positioned to the left of it on the map.


      New Hampshire is definitely east of Michigan, not west of it. So any zip code
      in New Hampshire would be east of a zip code in Michigan, not west of it.


      Therefore, 03784, NH is NOT west of 49453, MI. Rather, it would be EAST of it.

      - NH refers to New Hampshire, located in the northeastern United States.

      - MI refers to Michigan, located in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - New Hampshire is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Michigan is located further inland and to the west of New Hampshire.


      Step 3: Apply directional logic.

      - "West of" means being located to the left (more westward) on a standard US
      map.

      - Since New Hampshire is east of Michigan, any location in New Hampshire would
      be east (not west) of any location in Michigan.

      states:

      - 03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 49453 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)


      Now I need to think about the relative geographic positions of New Hampshire
      and Michigan:


      New Hampshire is a state in the northeastern United States, part of the New
      England region. It''s located on the east coast.


      Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes region of the upper Midwest. It consists
      of two peninsulas (Upper and Lower) and is more centrally located in the northern
      US.


      When comparing east-west positions in the US, we can use longitude. Places with
      lower longitude numbers are more eastern, while higher longitude numbers are
      more western.


      New Hampshire is definitely east of Michigan on a US map. New Hampshire borders
      the Atlantic Ocean on the East Coast, while Michigan is in the Midwest region.


      So if 03784 is in New Hampshire, and 49453 is in Michigan, then 03784 would

      In the United States, we know that:

      Looking at a mental map of the US, Michigan is definitely west of New Hampshire.

      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think># Is 03784, NH located west of 49453, MI?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      2) 49453 is in Michigan (MI), which is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      4) On a west-to-east orientation, Michigan is west of New Hampshire


      Since the zip code 03784 is in New Hampshire, and the zip code 49453 is in Michigan,

      I need to determine if the first zip code is located west of the second one.


      Generally speaking, in the US:

      - Lower zip codes in the same region tend to be further east

      - North Carolina is generally north of South Carolina

      - But the question is asking about east/west positioning, not north/south


      Since these zip codes are relatively close (both in the Carolinas), the first
      digit is the same (2), which represents the same general region. The second
      digit differs (8 vs 9). In the US zip code system, within a region, lower second
      digits typically represent areas further east.


      So, 28xxx would generally be east of 29xxx in the same region.

      Is 28512, NC located west of 29067, SC?


      I need to analyze the geographical relationship between these two zip codes.


      First, let me consider what zip codes tell us about location:

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where codes increase as you move from
      east to west

      - The first digit represents a broad region (2 covers the eastern US including
      both Carolinas)

      - The second digit provides more specific location information within that region


      For these specific zip codes:

      - 28512 (North Carolina) starts with "285"

      - 29067 (South Carolina) starts with "290"


      Since 285 is a lower number than 290, and within the same first-digit region
      (2), this means 28512 is generally located EAST of 29067, not west.


      This follows the pattern of the US zip code system where lower numbers in the

      1. 28512, NC is a zip code in North Carolina

      2. 29067, SC is a zip code in South Carolina

      3. I need to determine their relative east-west positioning


      To solve this, I need to know the geographic locations of these zip codes. In
      general, North Carolina is north of South Carolina. But that doesn''t tell us
      about east-west positioning.


      Looking at US zip codes more generally: zip codes tend to start with lower numbers
      in the northeast and increase as you go south and west. So generally:

      - Northeast (like Maine): lower numbers (e.g., 00xxx-04xxx)

      - Southeast: higher numbers than Northeast but still relatively low

      - Midwest and West: higher numbers (e.g., 8xxxx-9xxxx for western states)


      28xxx suggests North Carolina, which is in the southeast

      29xxx suggests South Carolina, which is also in the southeast


      Since these are neighboring states and both in the 2xxxx range, it''s harder
      to use the general pattern. However, North Carolina (28xxx) has a slightly lower
      prefix than South Carolina (29xxx), which might suggest NC is slightly more
      eastern according to the general zip code pattern.


      Additionally, North Carolina is generally east of South Carolina on the east
      coast (both states touch the Atlantic, but NC extends further east).


      So based on this reasoning, 28512, NC is likely EAST of 29067, SC, not west.</think>#
      Is 28512, NC located west of 29067, SC?

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic orientation

      North Carolina and South Carolina are neighboring states on the east coast.
      Looking at their general geographic arrangement:

      - North Carolina is positioned to the north and east of South Carolina

      - South Carolina is positioned to the south and west of North Carolina


      ## Step 3: Analyze zip code patterns

      US zip codes generally follow patterns where:

      - North Carolina zip codes typically begin with 27-28

      - South Carolina zip codes typically begin with 29


      ## Step 4: Make determination

      Based on the standard geographic arrangement of these states, 28512 (NC) would
      be located to the east of 29067 (SC), not to the west.

      - SC is South Carolina


      Generally, North Carolina is north of South Carolina, but they''re both on the
      eastern seaboard of the United States. The western parts of both states extend
      inland.


      For the specific zip codes, I''d need to look up their exact locations. I don''t
      have the ability to search the internet, but I can reason through what the zip
      code numbers might tell us.


      In the US zip code system, the first digit generally indicates a geographical
      region, with lower numbers often (but not always) being further east. The first
      digits here are 2 for both, which suggests they''re in the same general region
      (the eastern US).


      The second digits (8 for NC and 9 for SC) might give us a clue. Within a first-digit
      region, lower second digits are often (but not always) further east.


      So based just on the zip code numbers, 28512 (NC) might be east of 29067 (SC),
      but this is not a reliable method. Without specific geographic coordinates,
      I can''t give a definitive answer.</think># Is 28512, NC located west of 29067,
      SC?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)


      ## Step 2: Consider the US zip code system

      In the US postal code system, the first three digits of a zip code generally
      indicate geographic regions. Lower numbers in the first three digits typically
      (though not always) indicate locations further east within the same region.


      ## Step 3: Compare the zip codes

      - 28512 (NC) starts with 285

      - 29067 (SC) starts with 290


      Since 285 is less than 290, this suggests that 28512 is likely east of 29067.


      ## Step 4: Consider state geography

      North Carolina and South Carolina are both on the east coast, with their eastern
      portions touching the Atlantic Ocean and western portions extending inland.
      North Carolina is generally north of South Carolina, but their borders have
      some complexity.


      Given the zip code pattern and the general layout of these states, 28512 (NC)
      is almost certainly located east of 29067 (SC), not west.

    f17fa7cc-4215-4f49-8e64-a48624bd8ea1: '<think>To determine if 28512, NC is located
      west of 29067, SC, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their longitudes. In the US, locations with smaller longitude values are further
      west.


      First, let''s identify these locations:

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)


      North Carolina is generally north of South Carolina, but that doesn''t tell
      us about east/west positioning. I need to find the specific locations of these
      zip codes.


      Since I don''t have direct access to a zip code database, I need to reason based
      on what I know about zip code patterns:


      - Zip codes starting with 285xx would be in eastern North Carolina

      - Zip codes starting with 290xx would be in eastern South Carolina


      Generally, zip codes increase as you go from east to west. So a 285xx zip code
      would typically be east of a 290xx zip code. However, there could be exceptions
      based on how zip codes are assigned.


      Actually, I realize I need to be careful here. While zip codes generally follow
      geographic patterns, the first digit increases from east to west across the
      US (0/1 in Northeast, 9 on West Coast). But within states, the pattern can be
      more complex.


      In this case, both zip codes start with 2, which covers the southeastern US.
      But 285xx vs 290xx doesn''t necessarily tell us about east/west positioning
      within the Southeast.


      Given the information I have, I can''t give a definitive answer about which
      zip code is further west without checking specific geographic coordinates.</think>#
      Is 28512, NC located west of 29067, SC?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Understanding zip code geography

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow geographic patterns. The
      first digit increases as you move west across the country (1 in the Northeast
      to 9 on the West Coast).


      ## Step 2: Analyzing these specific zip codes

      - 28512 is in North Carolina with first three digits 285

      - 29067 is in South Carolina with first three digits 290


      ## Step 3: Comparing the numbers

      Within the same region (both start with 2), lower zip codes are typically further
      east than higher zip codes. Since 28512 has a lower number than 29067, this
      suggests 28512 is further east.


      ## Step 4: Verifying with state geography

      North Carolina''s eastern areas have lower zip codes than South Carolina''s
      central regions. 28512 is in eastern NC (coastal region), while 29067 is in
      a more central part of SC.


      NO - 28512, NC is not west of 29067, SC. It is actually east of it.'

      to determine if the ZIP code 10598 in New York is located west of ZIP code 44627
      in Ohio.


      In the United States, generally:

      - Eastern states are on the right side of a map

      - Western states are on the left side of a map


      New York (NY) is located in the northeastern part of the United States, while
      Ohio (OH) is in the midwestern part.


      Geographically, Ohio is actually west of New York. This is a general fact about
      the states.


      To be more precise about these specific ZIP codes:

      - 10598 is a ZIP code in New York (likely in the southeastern part of the state)

      - 44627 is a ZIP code in Ohio (likely in the eastern part of Ohio)


      Since Ohio is west of New York, and these specific ZIP codes don''t change the
      general geographic relationship between the states, 10598 NY would be east of
      44627 OH, not west.


      Therefore, 10598 NY is NOT located west of 44627 OH. It''s located EAST of it.</think>I
      need to determine whether ZIP code 10598 in New York is west of ZIP code 44627

      Step 1: Consider the geographic locations of New York and Ohio states.

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while Ohio is in the
      midwestern United States.


      Step 2: Determine the general directional relationship between these states.

      Ohio is positioned west of New York on a map of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider if specific ZIP codes might change this relationship.

      Even though ZIP codes within each state vary in location, no ZIP code in New
      York would be west of a ZIP code in Ohio because the entirety of New York state
      is east of Ohio.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific ZIP codes in question.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 10457, NY: This is a zip code in New York state

      - 43207, OH: This is a zip code in Ohio state


      In the United States, New York is located to the east of Ohio. Generally speaking,

      Let me double check to make sure these are valid zip codes in the states mentioned:

      - 10457 appears to be a zip code in the Bronx, New York City, NY

      - 43207 appears to be a zip code in Columbus, Ohio


      Given that New York is east of Ohio on the US map, a location in New York (10457)
      would not be west of a location in Ohio (43207). Instead, it would be east of
      it.</think># Is 10457, NY located west of 43207, OH?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10457 is in New York (NY)

      - 43207 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - New York state is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio state is located in the Midwest, west of New York


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - 10457 is in the Bronx, New York City, in eastern New York

      - 43207 is in Columbus, Ohio

      - Any location in New York would be east of, not west of, a location in Ohio

      First, let''s identify these zip codes:

      - 10457 is in New York (NY)

      - 43207 is in Ohio (OH)


      Now, I need to think about the geographic positions. In the United States:

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the country

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern part of the country


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Ohio is generally west of New York. This

      - 10457 is in New York (NY)

      - 43207 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern United States, west of New York


      Step 3: Consider direction.

      - When moving from New York to Ohio, you travel westward

      - When moving from Ohio to New York, you travel eastward


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since New York is east of Ohio, zip code 10457 in NY would be east of zip code
      43207 in OH, not west of it.

      zip code 39367 in Mississippi (MS) is located west of the zip code 75150 in
      Texas (TX).


      To solve this problem, I need to:

      1. Determine the geographical locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their longitudes (west-east position)


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Mississippi (MS) is in the southeastern United States, along the Mississippi
      River

      - Texas (TX) is in the south-central United States, bordering Mexico


      In terms of west-east positioning:

      - Texas is generally west of Mississippi

      - Mississippi is east of Texas


      Since 39367 is in Mississippi and 75150 is in Texas, and Mississippi is east
      of Texas, it''s likely that 39367, MS is EAST of 75150, TX (not west).


      To be sure though, we should consider that Texas is a very large state that
      extends quite far east, and Mississippi is immediately east of Louisiana, which
      borders Texas. So the comparison depends on the exact locations within these
      states.


      Based on general US geography, Mississippi is east of Texas, so a Mississippi
      zip code would typically be east of a Texas zip code, not west of it.</think>I
      need to determine if 39367, MS is located west of 75150, TX by comparing their
      geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 39367 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 75150 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - When looking at a map, Mississippi is positioned to the EAST of Texas


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      - Since 39367 is in Mississippi and 75150 is in Texas

      - And Mississippi is east of Texas

      - Therefore, 39367, MS must be east of 75150, TX (not west)

      - 07092 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 44012 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      To answer this question, I need to consider the relative geographic positions
      of these two states in the US.


      Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest region of the United States, while New Jersey (NJ)
      is on the East Coast.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania, which
      itself is west of New Jersey. So Ohio is west of New Jersey.


      If Ohio is west of New Jersey, then a zip code in New Jersey (07092) cannot
      be west of a zip code in Ohio (44012). Instead, the New Jersey zip code would
      be east of the Ohio zip code.

      - 44012 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, which itself
      is west of New Jersey. Therefore, Ohio is west of New Jersey.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Step 2: Consider the east-west orientation of these states.

      New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Ohio
      is more inland and further west. In the general west-to-east arrangement of
      US states, Ohio lies west of Pennsylvania, which itself is west of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Determine the relative position of the specific zip codes.

      Since New Jersey as a state is entirely east of Ohio, any zip code in New Jersey
      (including 07092) must be east of any zip code in Ohio (including 44012).


      NO - 07092, NJ is not located west of 44012, OH. It is located east of it.'

      First, let''s think about the general geographic positions of these two states:

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is more inland, in what''s sometimes called the Midwest or Great Lakes

      Since 07092 is a zip code in New Jersey, and 44012 is a zip code in Ohio, and
      Ohio is generally west of New Jersey, it would seem that 07092, NJ is NOT west

      1. Find the geographic locations (roughly) of both zip codes

      2. Compare their longitudes - west is a lower longitude in the US


      Let me think about the rough locations:

      - 10927 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States

      - 46016 is in Indiana (IN), which is in the midwestern United States


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Indiana. States in the eastern US have
      higher longitude values than states in the midwest.


      New York is definitely east of Indiana on a map of the United States. Therefore,
      10927, NY would be east of 46016, IN, not west of it.


      So the answer should be NO, 10927, NY is not located west of 46016, IN.</think>I
      need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 10927 is in New York (NY)

      - 46016 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Recall the general geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Indiana is located in the midwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - On a US map, Indiana is significantly west of New York

      - Moving from New York to Indiana, you would travel westward

      - Moving from Indiana to New York, you would travel eastward


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since New York is east of Indiana, zip code 10927 in NY must be east of zip
      code 46016 in IN, not west of it.

      TX is located west of 88240, NM. Let me think about this.


      To determine this, I need to know the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      75025 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      88240 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)


      I need to compare their east-west positions, which means comparing their longitudes.
      Lower (more negative) longitudes in the US are further west.


      Geographically speaking, New Mexico is generally west of Texas. Texas is in
      the south-central part of the US, while New Mexico is in the southwestern part.


      So my intuition is that 88240, NM would be west of 75025, TX.


      Let me be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 75025 is likely in the eastern or central part of Texas

      - 88240 is somewhere in New Mexico


      Since New Mexico is west of Texas, and these zip codes don''t appear to be in
      unusual border areas that might create exceptions, 75025, TX should be east
      of 88240, NM.


      Therefore, 75025, TX is NOT west of 88240, NM.</think># Is 75025, TX located
      west of 88240, NM?


      Let me determine the relative positions of these zip codes by analyzing their
      locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 75025 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 88240 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico

      New Mexico is located to the west of Texas in the United States. Texas is in
      the south-central part of the country, while New Mexico borders Texas on its
      western side.


      ## Step 3: Determine specific zip code locations

      - 75025 is in Plano, which is in the northeastern part of Texas

      - 88240 is in Hobbs, which is in the southeastern part of New Mexico (near the
      Texas border)


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      Even though 88240 is in eastern New Mexico near the Texas border, New Mexico
      is still positioned west of Texas geographically. The eastern edge of New Mexico
      (including Hobbs) is still west of northeastern Texas (including Plano).


      NO, 75025, TX is not located west of 88240, NM. It is located east of it.'
    667b8130-47be-4714-acad-bc7d6af8fffb: '<think>To solve this problem, I need to:

      2. Determine which one is further west (has a more westerly longitude)

      3. Answer YES if 75025, TX is west of 88240, NM, or NO if it''s not


      Let me identify these locations:


      75025 is a zip code in Texas (TX). It appears to be in Plano, Texas, which is
      in the northern part of Texas, near Dallas.


      88240 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM). It appears to be in Hobbs, New Mexico,
      which is in the southeastern part of New Mexico.


      Now, let''s think about the geography of the United States. Texas is generally
      east of New Mexico. New Mexico borders Texas on Texas''s western side. So in
      general, locations in New Mexico would be west of locations in Texas.


      However, I need to be careful because these specific zip codes could be in unusual
      parts of their states. Let''s think about this more carefully.


      Plano, TX (75025) is in the Dallas area, which is in north-central Texas.

      Hobbs, NM (88240) is in southeastern New Mexico, quite close to the Texas border.


      Given that New Mexico is west of Texas, and that Hobbs is in the eastern part
      of New Mexico (close to Texas), while Plano is not in the westernmost part of
      Texas, it''s very likely that 75025 (Plano, TX) is east of 88240 (Hobbs, NM).


      Therefore, 75025, TX is NOT located west of 88240, NM.</think># Is 75025, TX
      located west of 88240, NM?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 75025 is a zip code in Plano, Texas, which is in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan
      area in north-central Texas.

      - 88240 is a zip code in Hobbs, New Mexico, which is in the southeastern corner
      of New Mexico.


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico

      - New Mexico is located directly west of Texas on the US map.

      - Texas shares its western border with New Mexico.


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state

      - Plano (75025) is located in north-central Texas, not in the western part of
      Texas near the New Mexico border.

      - Hobbs (88240) is in southeastern New Mexico, close to the Texas border.


      ## Conclusion

      Since New Mexico is west of Texas, and the specific cities maintain this general
      east-west relationship (even though Hobbs is in eastern NM and Plano isn''t
      in westernmost TX), 75025 is east of 88240, not west of it.

      Let me break down the zip codes:

      - 75025, TX (a zip code in Texas)

      - 88240, NM (a zip code in New Mexico)


      In the United States, generally speaking:

      - New Mexico (NM) is located west of Texas (TX)

      - Looking at the geography of the US, New Mexico borders Texas on Texas''s western
      side


      Since 75025 is in Texas and 88240 is in New Mexico, and New Mexico is generally
      west of Texas, it would seem that 75025, TX would be EAST of 88240, NM - not
      west of it.


      However, I should be careful about the exact locations of these zip codes, as
      Texas is a large state and the specific zip codes could be in different relative
      positions than the states overall.


      75025 appears to be a zip code for Plano, Texas, which is in the northeastern
      part of Texas.

      88240 appears to be a zip code for Hobbs, New Mexico, which is in the southeastern

      - 88240 is a zip code in Hobbs, New Mexico


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico.

      New Mexico is generally located to the west of Texas. They share a border, with
      New Mexico on Texas''s western side.


      Step 3: Examine the specific locations within their states.

      - Plano, TX (75025) is in the northeastern part of Texas

      - Hobbs, NM (88240) is in the southeastern part of New Mexico, near the Texas
      border


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      Even though Hobbs is in the eastern part of New Mexico and Plano is not in the
      westernmost part of Texas, the overall geography of the United States means
      that locations in New Mexico are generally west of locations in Texas.

      First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of Texas and New Mexico
      in the United States. New Mexico is located to the west of Texas. Texas borders
      New Mexico on New Mexico''s eastern side.


      However, zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with state boundaries, and we need
      to be more specific about these particular zip codes.


      Let me recall what I know about these specific zip codes:

      - 75025 is likely in the eastern half of Texas, as lower zip codes tend to be
      in the eastern parts of the country

      - 88240 is likely in the eastern part of New Mexico, as higher zip codes tend
      to be in the western parts of the country


      Given these general patterns:

      - 75025 (TX) is likely in eastern Texas

      - 88240 (NM) is likely in eastern New Mexico


      Since New Mexico is west of Texas, and these zip codes follow the general east-west

      of 75025, TX.</think># Is 75025, TX located west of 88240, NM?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 75025 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 88240 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico.

      - New Mexico is located to the west of Texas

      - Texas shares New Mexico''s eastern border


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - 75025 is in Plano, which is in the northeastern part of Texas

      - 88240 is in Hobbs, which is in the southeastern part of New Mexico


      Step 4: Determine their east-west relationship.

      Since New Mexico as a whole is west of Texas, and these specific locations follow

      \ United States. \nNew Mexico is located west of Texas. Texas borders New Mexico\
      \ on New Mexico's eastern side.\n\nSince 75025 is in Texas and 88240 is in New\
      \ Mexico, the general expectation would be that the Texas zip code is east of\
      \ the New Mexico zip code.\n\nHowever, I should be careful because states have\
      \ irregular shapes, and there could be exceptions depending on the specific\
      \ locations within each state.\n\nLet me think about the zip code numbering\
      \ system. In the US, zip codes generally increase from east to west. Lower numbers\
      \ tend to be in the eastern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend\
      \ to be in the western parts.\n\n75025 is a lower number than 88240, which suggests\

      \ States. New Mexico is located directly west of Texas.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze\
      \ zip code patterns\nIn the US postal system, zip codes generally follow a pattern\
      \ where lower numbers are assigned to the eastern parts of the country, while\
      \ higher numbers are assigned to the western parts.\n\n## Step 3: Compare the\
      \ zip codes\n- 75025 (TX) has a lower zip code number\n- 88240 (NM) has a higher\
      \ zip code number\n\nThis pattern confirms the general geographic relationship\

      \ zip code, while the New Mexico zip code (88240) is in the western state with\
      \ a higher zip code.\n\n## Conclusion\nNO, 75025, TX is not located west of\

    ad7131a8-84b9-44f0-ac60-f50de2abdf5c: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to:

      1. Determine where 75025, TX is located

      2. Determine where 88240, NM is located

      3. Compare their relative east-west positions to determine if 75025, TX is west
      of 88240, NM


      Let me break this down:


      For 75025, TX:

      - This is a zip code in Texas

      - 75xxx zip codes are generally in the eastern part of Texas

      - Specifically, 75025 is likely in the Dallas-Fort Worth area (northeastern
      Texas)


      For 88240, NM:

      - This is a zip code in New Mexico

      - 88xxx zip codes are generally in the southern part of New Mexico

      - New Mexico is entirely west of Texas


      Since New Mexico is west of Texas, and these specific zip codes don''t change
      that fundamental geographic relationship (75025 is in eastern Texas, which is
      definitely east of any part of New Mexico), I can conclude that 75025, TX is
      NOT west of 88240, NM. It''s east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 75025 is a zip code in Plano, Texas, which is in the northeastern part of
      Texas.

      - 88240 is a zip code in Hobbs, New Mexico, which is in the southeastern part
      of New Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico.

      - New Mexico is located directly west of Texas.

      - Specifically, eastern New Mexico borders western Texas.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Since 75025 is in northeastern Texas, and 88240 is in southeastern New Mexico,
      we need to consider their positions carefully.

      - Even though 75025 is in the "west" relative to many other places in the US,
      it is still east of the Texas-New Mexico border.

      - 88240 in Hobbs, NM is just across the western border of Texas.

      3) To determine which is west of the other, I need to consider the geographic

      I''ll approach this by thinking about the general geographic positions of these

      Generally speaking, New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania on the US map. Pennsylvania
      borders New Jersey on New Jersey''s western edge.


      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 07871 is in New Jersey

      New Jersey''s western side.


      Step 2: Looking at the zip code patterns, lower numbers in the first three digits

      07871 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      15057 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      First, I should think about the general geography of NJ and PA. Pennsylvania
      is west of New Jersey, as New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast and Pennsylvania
      is inland from it. So generally speaking, locations in NJ tend to be east of
      locations in PA.


      However, I need to be careful because the states have irregular shapes, and
      it''s possible that some parts of NJ could be west of some parts of PA, especially
      near their border.


      Let me try to be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 07871 appears to be in northern New Jersey

      - 15057 appears to be in western Pennsylvania


      Given that Pennsylvania is generally west of New Jersey, and 15057 is in western
      PA, it''s very likely that 15057, PA is west of 07871, NJ.


      Actually, I think I made a mistake. If 15057 is in western PA, then it would
      be farther west than a location in NJ. So 07871, NJ would be EAST of 15057,

      Step 1: Identify the states'' general positions.

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located west of New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is on the Atlantic
      coast, while Pennsylvania is inland.


      Step 2: Consider the specific zip codes.

      07871 is in New Jersey (specifically in Sparta Township in northern NJ)

      15057 is in Pennsylvania (in McDonald, which is in western PA near the West
      Virginia border)


      Step 3: Determine relative positioning.

      Since Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, and 15057 is in western Pennsylvania,
      this means 15057 is significantly west of any point in New Jersey, including
      07871.


      Step 4: Formulate the answer to the question.

      The question asks if 07871, NJ is west of 15057, PA. Since 07871 is in NJ (east)

      zip code 64701 in Missouri is located west of zip code 80130 in Colorado.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic positions of Missouri and Colorado.

      Missouri is located in the Midwestern United States, while Colorado is in the
      Western/Mountain region.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions on a map.

      Colorado is positioned west of Missouri. The western border of Missouri is still
      east of Colorado.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 64701 is in Missouri and 80130 is in Colorado, the Missouri zip code must
      be east of the Colorado zip code, not west.

    369dee72-9472-4018-86ea-e989ee4b2403: '<think>This question requires me to determine
      the geographic locations of two zip codes and then figure out if one is west
      of the other.


      Let me identify each zip code:


      1. 64701, MO - This is a zip code in Missouri (MO)

      2. 80130, CO - This is a zip code in Colorado (CO)


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these states and these specific zip codes.


      Generally speaking, Colorado is west of Missouri. The continental United States
      is arranged such that moving from east to west, you''d encounter Missouri before
      Colorado.


      Missouri is in the Midwest region, while Colorado is in the Mountain West region.
      So generally, locations in Colorado would be west of locations in Missouri.


      Since 64701 is in Missouri and 80130 is in Colorado, and Colorado is west of
      Missouri, we can conclude that 64701, MO is NOT west of 80130, CO. Rather, 80130,
      CO is west of 64701, MO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 64701 is in Missouri (MO)

      - 80130 is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Missouri is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Colorado
      is in the Mountain West region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      When looking at a US map, Colorado is clearly west of Missouri. The continental
      US generally progresses from east to west, and Missouri comes before Colorado
      when moving westward.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since Colorado is west of Missouri, and these zip codes are within their respective
      states, 64701 (MO) cannot be west of 80130 (CO). Instead, 80130 (CO) is west
      of 64701 (MO).

      GA (Georgia) is located west of 76114, TX (Texas).


      First, let me think about the general geographic locations of Georgia and Texas
      in the United States:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Texas is generally west of Georgia. The entire
      state of Georgia is east of most of Texas.


      To be more precise, I should consider the specific zip codes:

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 76114 is in Texas (TX)


      Given the general geography of the United States, a location in Georgia would
      be east of a location in Texas, not west of it.


      Therefore, 31210, GA is NOT located west of 76114, TX. It is actually east of
      it.</think>To determine if 31210, GA is located west of 76114, TX, I need to
      examine the geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States.

      Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning of these states.

      On a U.S. map, Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas. The entire state
      of Georgia lies east of Texas.


      Step 3: Since zip code 31210 is in Georgia and zip code 76114 is in Texas, the
      relative positioning follows the states'' positions.


      Step 4: Therefore, 31210, GA must be east of 76114, TX, not west of it.

      west of 76114, TX, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative east-west positioning


      31210 is a zip code in Georgia (GA), while 76114 is a zip code in Texas (TX).


      Geographically, Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while
      Texas is in the south-central United States. In general, Georgia is east of
      Texas.


      To be more specific:

      - Georgia is on the Atlantic coast

      - Texas extends from the center of the southern US to the west, bordering Mexico


      Since Georgia is east of Texas on the map of the United States, and these zip
      codes are in their respective states, 31210 GA would be east of 76114 TX, not
      west of it.


      So the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine if 31210, GA is located west
      of 76114, TX by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 31210 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      - 76114 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the states'' positions.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States on the Atlantic coast,
      while Texas is in the south-central United States extending toward the west.


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      On a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas. All
      of Georgia is east of all of Texas.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 31210 is in Georgia and 76114 is in Texas, the Georgia zip code must be
      east of the Texas zip code, not west of it.

      - 76114 is in Texas (TX)


      Now, I need to think about the geographical locations of these states. In the
      United States:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the country

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the country


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Texas is generally west of Georgia. Georgia
      borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Texas extends much further west
      and borders Mexico.


      So if we''re comparing the states in general, Georgia is east of Texas, not
      west of it.


      Since the zip code 31210 is in Georgia, and the zip code 76114 is in Texas,
      and Georgia is east of Texas, it follows that 31210, GA would be east of 76114,

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 76114 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Georgia and Texas.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in the
      south-central/southwestern part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      If you look at a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned to the east
      of Texas. The entire state of Georgia is east of Texas.


      Step 4: Since 31210 is in Georgia and 76114 is in Texas, the same relationship

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Consider the general geographic locations of New Jersey (NJ) and Indiana
      (IN)

      2. Determine which is further west


      The United States is oriented such that the east coast (including New Jersey)
      is on the eastern side of the country, while states like Indiana are located
      more centrally in the Midwest region.


      New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast, on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      The United States generally runs from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west).

      New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast.

      Indiana is in the Midwest, significantly west of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Indiana is in the Midwest, any location
      in New Jersey (including 08221) would be EAST of any location in Indiana (including
      46222), not west of it.

      I need to figure out which one is further west. In the US, locations further
      west have larger (negative) longitude values.


      Let me think about the general geographic position of Arizona and California:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is directly east of California


      Generally speaking, any location in California would be west of any location
      in Arizona. This is because California extends further west than Arizona.


      To be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 85132 is in Arizona

      - 90021 is in California


      Based on the general geography of the United States, a California zip code (90021)
      would be west of an Arizona zip code (85132).

      Step 3: Determine the relative positions

      Since California is west of Arizona, and these zip codes are in their respective

      - 85132 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 90021 is a zip code in California (CA)


      To determine which is more westerly, I need to consider the geographic locations.
      In the United States:

      - California is located on the west coast

      - Arizona is located inland, to the east of California


      Generally speaking, locations in California will be west of locations in Arizona.
      This is because California extends all the way to the Pacific Ocean, which is
      the western boundary of the contiguous United States, while Arizona is entirely
      inland.


      So geographically speaking, 90021 in California would be west of 85132 in Arizona.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean. Arizona is located inland, directly east of California.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west relationship.

      In the continental US, lower longitude numbers indicate more western locations.
      However, I don''t need specific longitude coordinates to solve this.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since California (CA) is west of Arizona (AZ), and 90021 is in California while
      85132 is in Arizona, the California zip code must be west of the Arizona zip
      code.


      NO, 85132, AZ is not located west of 90021, CA. It is actually east of it.'

      Generally speaking, California is located west of Arizona on the US map. California
      borders the Pacific Ocean on its western edge, while Arizona is an inland state

      6. Therefore, 07016, NJ is located east of 45801, OH, not west of it.</think>To
      determine if 07016, NJ is located west of 45801, OH, I need to consider the
      geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 07016 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 45801 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Ohio is
      in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Determine the directional relationship.

      On a map of the United States, New Jersey is positioned to the east of Ohio.
      This means that any location in New Jersey would be east of (not west of) any
      location in Ohio.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 07016 is in New Jersey, and 45801 is in Ohio, the New Jersey zip code
      must be east of the Ohio zip code.

      I need to consider the geographical locations of these zip codes:


      1. 70444 is in Louisiana (LA)

      2. 79762 is in Texas (TX)


      Let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Louisiana is located in the southeastern United States, bordering Texas to
      the east

      - Texas is located to the west of Louisiana


      Generally speaking, locations in Louisiana would be east of locations in Texas,
      not west. However, I should be careful because we''re talking about specific
      zip codes, and states can have irregular shapes.


      Let''s check the specific zip codes:

      - 70444 appears to be in Louisiana, which is entirely east of Texas

      - 79762 appears to be in Texas, which is entirely west of Louisiana


      Given the general geography of the United States, a location in Louisiana (70444)
      would be east of a location in Texas (79762), not west of it.

      Louisiana is located in the southeastern United States, while Texas is situated
      to the west of Louisiana. The entire state of Louisiana is east of most of Texas.


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      - Zip code 70444 is in Louisiana

      - Zip code 79762 is in Texas (likely in the western part of Texas based on the
      higher first digits)

      (TX).


      To solve this, I need to find the geographical location of both zip codes:


      1. First, 70444 in LA (Louisiana): Louisiana is generally in the southeastern
      part of the United States, bordering Texas on the east.


      2. Second, 79762 in TX (Texas): Texas is west of Louisiana, extending much further
      west than Louisiana does.


      However, the specific zip codes matter because Louisiana could potentially have
      some western parts that are west of some eastern parts of Texas.


      Looking at the zip code patterns:

      - Louisiana zip codes generally start with 70-71

      - Texas zip codes generally range from 75-79 and 88


      The 79xxx series in Texas tends to be in the western part of Texas. The 70xxx
      series in Louisiana tends to be in the eastern part of Louisiana.


      Since 79762 is likely in western Texas, and 70444 is likely in eastern Louisiana,
      it''s very unlikely that 70444 is west of 79762. Louisiana as a state is entirely
      east of western Texas.

      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      - Louisiana is located east of Texas

      - Texas extends much further west than Louisiana does


      ## Step 3: Analyze specific zip codes

      - 70444 would be in eastern/central Louisiana

      - 79762 would be in western Texas (specifically Odessa area)


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Louisiana is entirely east of western Texas, and 70444 is in Louisiana

      Texas zip code, not west.

      Step 2: I need to think about the general geography of these states.

      - Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Kentucky is more inland, west of Virginia


      Step 3: Since Virginia is generally east of Kentucky, a zip code in Virginia
      (24486) would typically be east of a zip code in Kentucky (40109), not west
      of it.

      positions of these zip codes.

      Virginia is located on the eastern side of the United States, while Kentucky
      is positioned to the west of Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Kentucky borders Virginia on Virginia''s western side. The entire state of Kentucky
      is generally west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 24486 is in Virginia and 40109 is in Kentucky, and Kentucky is west of
      Virginia, the Virginia zip code would be east of the Kentucky zip code, not
      west of it.

      Let me break this down:

      1. 28457 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      2. 35954 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)

      3. I need to determine if the North Carolina location is west of the Alabama

      Geographically, North Carolina is generally east of Alabama. Alabama is in the

      a US map, Alabama is to the west of North Carolina.


      Since zip codes within each state can vary in position, I should be precise,
      but the general geographic relationship between these states is that Alabama
      is west of North Carolina, not the other way around.


      Therefore, it''s very unlikely that a NC zip code would be west of an AL zip

      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      North Carolina (NC) and Alabama (AL) are both southeastern states, but North
      Carolina is positioned to the east of Alabama on the US map.


      Step 2: Examine the general pattern of zip codes.

      While specific zip codes can be in different parts of each state, North Carolina
      as a whole lies east of Alabama. North Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on
      the east coast, while Alabama is more inland and further west.


      Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge to these specific zip codes.

      Since 28457 is in North Carolina and 35954 is in Alabama, and North Carolina
      is east of Alabama, it follows that 28457, NC would be east (not west) of 35954,

    d74199af-bef4-42d0-ad57-c2e3e821b864: '<think>Let me think step by step about
      this question.


      First, I need to determine the locations of these two zip codes:

      - 28457, NC (North Carolina)

      - 35954, AL (Alabama)


      Then I need to determine which one is located more to the west.


      To do this, I''ll need to think about the relative geographical positions of
      North Carolina (NC) and Alabama (AL) in the United States.


      North Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States, while Alabama is in
      the southeastern region but more inland and to the west of North Carolina.


      In general, Alabama is west of North Carolina. So if we''re comparing a zip
      code in NC with a zip code in AL, the AL zip code would typically be west of
      the NC zip code.


      Therefore, 35954, AL would be west of 28457, NC - not the other way around.


      So, is 28457, NC located west of 35954, AL? The answer would be NO, because
      Alabama is west of North Carolina.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 35954 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Alabama
      is in the southeastern region but more inland.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Alabama is positioned to the west of North Carolina on a map of the United States.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since Alabama is west of North Carolina, a zip code in Alabama (35954) would
      be west of a zip code in North Carolina (28457), not the other way around.


      NO'

      11704 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is a state on the east coast
      of the United States.

      45439 is a zip code in Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the midwest, west of New York.


      Specifically:

      - 11704 appears to be in Babylon, NY on Long Island

      - 45439 appears to be in Dayton, Ohio


      Since Ohio is west of New York, and these specific zip codes follow that general
      state positioning, 11704 NY is east of 45439 OH, not west of it.


      So the answer would be NO, 11704 NY is NOT located west of 45439 OH. It''s actually
      east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of
      these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 11704 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in the Babylon area of
      Long Island.

      - 45439 is a zip code in Ohio (OH), in the Dayton area.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New York.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      Since New York is east of Ohio on a map of the United States, zip code 11704
      in NY would be east of zip code 45439 in OH, not west of it.


      NO, 11704, NY is not located west of 45439, OH. It is located east of it.'

      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 11704 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)

      - 45439 is a ZIP code in Ohio (OH)


      To determine which is more westerly, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these states and these specific ZIP codes.


      Geographically in the US:

      - New York is on the East Coast

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, west of New York


      Generally speaking, locations in Ohio tend to be west of locations in New York.
      But I should check the specific ZIP codes to be sure.


      11704 appears to be in Babylon, Long Island, New York.

      45439 appears to be in the Dayton area of Ohio.


      Looking at a map of the US, Ohio is definitely west of New York, and specifically
      Dayton, OH would be west of Long Island, NY.


      However, the question asks if 11704 (NY) is west of 45439 (OH), which would
      be the opposite of the actual geography. New York is east of Ohio, not west
      of it.


      So 11704, NY is east of 45439, OH, not west of it.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these ZIP codes.

      - 11704 is in New York (NY)

      - 45439 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      New York is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Ohio is in
      the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Looking at a US map, Ohio is positioned west of New York. All New York ZIP codes
      (including 11704) are east of Ohio ZIP codes (including 45439).


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since 11704 (NY) is east of 45439 (OH), it cannot be west of it.

      - 11704 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 45439 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of New York and Ohio states.

      In the United States, Ohio is located west of New York. New York is on the eastern
      seaboard, while Ohio is more inland and to the west of New York.


      Step 3: Since we''re comparing specific zip codes, let me think about their
      relative positions.

      Even though Ohio as a state is west of New York as a state, I need to consider
      the specific locations of these zip codes within their states.


      However, the general geography of the US makes it virtually impossible for any
      part of New York to be west of any part of Ohio. This is because Ohio is entirely

      Ohio (OH) is located inland, west of New York.


      Step 2: Consider the specific zip codes.

      11704 is a zip code in New York, specifically in the Long Island area.

      45439 is a zip code in Ohio, in the Dayton area.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      In general, North Carolina is north of South Carolina, but that doesn''t tell
      us about the east-west positioning.


      Looking at zip code patterns:

      - Zip codes starting with 284xx are in the southeastern part of NC

      - Zip codes starting with 293xx are in the upstate/western part of SC


      Based on the general zip code patterns in the US (which increase from east to
      west):

      - The lower number (28403) suggests it''s more eastern than 29388

      - 28xxx codes are generally more eastern than 29xxx codes


      Specifically, 28403 is likely in the Wilmington area of NC (eastern coast),
      while 29388 is likely in the western part of SC.


      So based on this analysis, 28403 NC is likely EAST of 29388 SC, not west.</think>#
      Is 28403, NC located west of 29388, SC?


      Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to understand the geography of these zip codes.


      2) In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers tend to be in the eastern
      parts of the country, with numbers increasing as you go west.


      3) Zip code 28403 is in North Carolina (NC) and starts with 284, while 29388
      is in South Carolina (SC) and starts with 293.


      4) Since 284xx is a lower number than 293xx, this suggests that 28403 is likely
      EAST of 29388.


      5) More specifically, 28403 is in the Wilmington area on the eastern coast of
      North Carolina, while 29388 is in the upstate/western region of South Carolina.


      6) Therefore, 28403 in NC is positioned to the east of 29388 in SC, not to the
      west.

    f7bfd2eb-906c-45d4-89f8-5b632f540b0d: '<think>To determine if 28403, NC is located
      west of 29388, SC, I need to identify the geographical locations of both zip
      codes and compare their longitudes. Western locations have a higher longitude
      value (more negative in the western hemisphere).


      Let me identify the locations:


      1. 28403 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      2. 29388 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Actually, that''s not correct about longitude. Western locations have a LOWER
      longitude value in the western hemisphere (more negative). For example, California
      is around -120 degrees longitude while New York is around -74 degrees longitude.


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of these states. Generally
      speaking:

      - North Carolina is east of South Carolina (NC is on the Atlantic coast, while
      SC is immediately to its southwest)

      - However, zip codes can be in different parts of their states


      Let me reason through this carefully:

      - Both NC and SC are on the eastern coast of the US

      - NC is generally north and slightly east of SC

      - However, I need to check the specific zip codes</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 28403 is a zip code in Wilmington, North Carolina

      - 29388 is a zip code in Woodruff, South Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the states.

      North Carolina and South Carolina are neighboring states on the east coast,
      with North Carolina being north of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Examine the specific locations within their states.

      - Wilmington (28403) is located on the southeastern coast of North Carolina.

      - Woodruff (29388) is located in the northwestern part of South Carolina, in
      the upstate region.


      Step 4: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Wilmington is on the Atlantic coast, which places it quite far east. Woodruff
      is inland and in the western portion of South Carolina, making it significantly
      more western than coastal Wilmington.


      NO - 28403, NC is NOT located west of 29388, SC. It is east of it.'

      west of 47834, IN, I need to find the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 11419 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the East Coast of the
      United States.

      - 47834 is a zip code in Indiana (IN). Indiana is in the Midwest of the United
      States.


      Generally speaking, states on the East Coast (like New York) are east of Midwestern
      states (like Indiana). So in general, locations in New York would be east of
      locations in Indiana, not west of them.


      To be more precise:

      - New York is approximately around 74-80 degrees west longitude

      - Indiana is approximately around 85-88 degrees west longitude


      Since lower values of west longitude indicate more eastern locations (closer
      to the prime meridian), and New York has lower west longitude values than Indiana,
      New York is east of Indiana, not west.


      Therefore, 11419, NY would be east of 47834, IN, not west of it.</think>I need
      to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - States on the East Coast (like New York) are generally east of Midwestern
      states (like Indiana)

      - On a map of the United States, New York is to the right (east) of Indiana

      - In terms of longitude, New York has lower west longitude values than Indiana


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since New York is east of Indiana, zip code 11419 in NY must be east of zip
      code 47834 in IN, not west of it.

      To be more specific:

      - New York longitudes typically range from around -73 to -79 degrees

      - Indiana longitudes typically range from around -84 to -88 degrees


      Lower (more negative) longitude numbers in the western hemisphere indicate more

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Indiana is west of New York

      - Therefore, New York is east of Indiana

      - This means any location in NY would be east of, not west of, a location in
      IN

      Minnesota, this further confirms that 53209, WI is east of 55904, MN, not west.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.

      - 53209 is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 55904 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Minnesota is located to the west of Wisconsin.

      - Wisconsin borders Minnesota on Minnesota''s eastern side.


      Step 3: Look at the specific locations.

      - 53209 is in the Milwaukee area in eastern Wisconsin

      - 55904 is in the Rochester area in southeastern Minnesota


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Since Minnesota is west of Wisconsin, and these specific zip codes maintain
      that same east-west relationship, 53209 (WI) is east of 55904 (MN), not west
      of it.

      by step:


      1. I need to determine if ZIP code 53209 in Wisconsin (WI) is located west of
      ZIP code 55904 in Minnesota (MN).


      2. First, I''ll recall the general geography of these states. Minnesota is located
      to the west of Wisconsin in the United States. Wisconsin borders Minnesota to
      the east.


      3. Since Minnesota is generally west of Wisconsin, a ZIP code in Wisconsin would
      typically be east of a ZIP code in Minnesota, not west of it.


      4. However, I should be careful because state borders aren''t perfectly straight
      lines, and there could be exceptions depending on the specific locations of
      these ZIP codes.


      5. 53209 is a ZIP code in the Milwaukee area of Wisconsin, which is in the eastern
      part of the state.


      6. 55904 is a ZIP code in the Rochester area of Minnesota, which is in the southeastern
      part of Minnesota.


      7. Given that Rochester, MN is in southeastern Minnesota, and Milwaukee, WI
      is in eastern Wisconsin, the Wisconsin ZIP code would still be east of the Minnesota
      ZIP code.</think>To determine if 53209, WI is located west of 55904, MN, I need
      to think about the relative positions of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' general positions.

      Minnesota (MN) is located to the west of Wisconsin (WI) on the US map. These
      states share a border, with Minnesota on the western side of that border.


      Step 2: Identify the specific ZIP code locations.

      - 53209 is in the Milwaukee area of Wisconsin, in the eastern part of the state

      - 55904 is in the Rochester area of Minnesota, in the southeastern part of that
      state


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Minnesota is west of Wisconsin, and these ZIP codes are not in unusual
      border areas that might create exceptions, the ZIP code in Wisconsin (53209)
      would be east of the ZIP code in Minnesota (55904), not west of it.

      zip codes.


      First, let''s think about the general locations:

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)

      - 85735 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Geographically, Texas is east of Arizona in the United States. Arizona borders
      California on the west and New Mexico on the east, while Texas is located east
      of New Mexico.


      So generally speaking, any location in Texas would be east of any location in
      Arizona, not west.


      To verify this for these specific zip codes:

      - 76008 appears to be in Texas, likely in the eastern or central part of the
      state

      - 85735 appears to be in Arizona, likely in the southern part


      Since Texas is east of Arizona, zip code 76008 in TX would be east of zip code
      85735 in AZ, not west of it.</think>To determine if 76008, TX is located west
      of 85735, AZ, I need to consider the geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of these states.

      - Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States.

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - Arizona borders California to its west and New Mexico to its east.

      - Texas is east of New Mexico, which is east of Arizona.

      - Therefore, Texas is east of Arizona on a map of the United States.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 76008 is in Texas and 85735 is in Arizona, the Texas zip code must be
      east of the Arizona zip code, not west of it.


      NO, 76008, TX is not located west of 85735, AZ. It is located east of it.'

      values are further west in the United States.


      76008 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      85735 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)


      Generally speaking, Arizona is west of Texas in the United States. Arizona borders
      California on its western side, while Texas is in the south-central part of
      the country.


      Since Arizona is generally west of Texas, it''s likely that a zip code in Arizona
      (85735) would be west of a zip code in Texas (76008). This means that 76008,
      TX would be EAST of 85735, AZ, not west of it.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO, 76008, TX is not located west of 85735, AZ.
      Rather, it would be east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)

      - 85735 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      In the continental US, Arizona is located in the southwestern part of the country,
      while Texas is in the south-central region.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Arizona is positioned to the west of Texas. The entire state of New Mexico sits
      between them.


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions of the specific zip codes.

      Since Arizona as a whole is west of Texas, a zip code in Arizona (85735) would
      generally be west of a zip code in Texas (76008).


      Therefore, 76008, TX would be EAST of 85735, AZ, not west of it.

      To answer this, I need to know the relative east-west positions of these zip
      codes. In the US, locations are generally considered "west" of other locations
      if they have a lower longitude value (since longitude decreases as you move

      - Texas is located in the south-central US

      - Generally, Arizona is west of Texas


      Without specific longitude coordinates for these zip codes, I can rely on this
      general geographic knowledge. Arizona is west of Texas, which means Texas (including
      76008) would be east of Arizona (including 85735).

      76008 is a zip code in Texas (TX).

      85735 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ).


      In terms of general geography in the United States:

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the country

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern part of the country


      Usually, locations in Arizona are west of locations in Texas, because Arizona
      is further west in the country than Texas.


      To be precise:

      - Western locations have a higher (more negative) longitude value than eastern
      locations in the US

      - If 76008, TX has a higher (less negative) longitude value than 85735, AZ,
      then 76008 is EAST of 85735

      - If 76008, TX has a lower (more negative) longitude value than 85735, AZ, then
      76008 is WEST of 85735


      Based on the general geography of the United States, Arizona is west of Texas,
      so 85735, AZ is very likely west of 76008, TX. This means 76008, TX is likely
      EAST of 85735, AZ, not west of it.


      So the answer is likely "NO" - 76008, TX is not west of 85735, AZ. But let me
      double-check my reasoning about the relative positions of Texas and Arizona.</think>#
      Is 76008, TX located west of 85735, AZ?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes
      by examining their locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states and their general positions

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX), which is in the south-central United States

      - 85735 is in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern United States


      ## Step 2: Compare the geographical positions

      - In the US, states are generally arranged with lower zip code numbers in the
      east and higher numbers in the west

      - Arizona (85xxx) has higher zip codes than Texas (76xxx)

      - Arizona borders California and is one of the westernmost states in the continental
      US

      - Texas is located east of Arizona in the standard US map layout


      ## Step 3: Conclusion based on geography

      Given that Arizona is west of Texas in the United States, a zip code in Arizona
      (85735) would be west of a zip code in Texas (76008), not the other way around.

      (Missouri) is located west of 67218, KS (Kansas).


      First, I need to think about the relative positions of Missouri and Kansas.
      In the US, Kansas is generally west of Missouri. Missouri borders Kansas on
      Kansas''s eastern border.


      Now, zip codes in the US tend to increase from east to west, but they''re organized
      by postal regions, so I need to be careful about making assumptions based just
      on the numbers.


      Let''s look more closely at these specific zip codes:

      - 63670 is in Missouri (MO)

      - 67218 is in Kansas (KS)


      Since Missouri is east of Kansas, it would generally mean that 63670, MO is
      east of 67218, KS. However, I should consider that these states have irregular
      shapes and there could be exceptions depending on the specific locations.


      But given that Missouri is firmly east of Kansas geographically, and these zip
      codes don''t appear to be in unusual border areas (based on their numbers),
      it''s very likely that 63670, MO is east of 67218, KS, not west of it.</think>#
      Is 63670, MO located west of 67218, KS?


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographical relationship between
      Missouri (MO) and Kansas (KS).


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Missouri is located directly east of Kansas on the US map. Kansas and Missouri
      share a border, with Kansas to the west and Missouri to the east.


      Step 2: Consider zip code patterns.

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with longitude, they generally follow
      regional patterns. The zip codes in question (63670 in MO and 67218 in KS) are
      standard codes for their respective states.


      Step 3: Apply geographical knowledge.

      Since 63670 is in Missouri, and Missouri is east of Kansas (where 67218 is located),
      the Missouri zip code must be east of the Kansas zip code, not west.

      Looking at US geography, Kansas is located directly west of Missouri. The entire

      - The ZIP code for MO is 63670, which starts with 636

      - The ZIP code for KS is 67218, which starts with 672


      Based on the general geography of the US and the fact that Missouri is east
      of Kansas, I would say that 63670, MO is NOT west of 67218, KS.</think>To determine
      if 63670, MO is west of 67218, KS, I need to understand the relative locations
      of these ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 63670 is in Missouri (MO)

      - 67218 is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Kansas is located directly west of Missouri

      - Missouri shares its western border with Kansas


      Step 3: Consider the specific ZIP codes.

      - ZIP codes in the US generally follow patterns where lower numbers tend to
      be in the eastern regions

      - 63670 (Missouri) has a lower number than 67218 (Kansas)

      - This aligns with the general west-to-east pattern of ZIP codes


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on state boundaries.

      - Since Missouri is east of Kansas, a location in Missouri (63670) would be
      east of a location in Kansas (67218)

      - Therefore, 63670, MO is not west of 67218, KS


      NO'
    918c40b4-1f86-435e-9571-a176cd8a6500: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine if the zip code 63670 in Missouri (MO) is located west of the zip
      code 67218 in Kansas (KS).


      In the US, longitude determines east-west positioning, with lower longitude
      numbers being further east and higher longitude numbers being further west.


      Let me reason through this:


      1. First, I need to consider the general geographic positions of Missouri and
      Kansas. Kansas is generally west of Missouri, as Missouri borders Kansas on
      Kansas''s eastern side.


      2. But I need to be more specific about these particular zip codes, as they
      could be in different parts of their respective states.


      3. Zip code 63670 is in Missouri. Missouri zip codes typically begin with 630-658.

      4. Zip code 67218 is in Kansas. Kansas zip codes typically begin with 660-679.


      5. Looking at the patterns of zip codes in the US, lower numbers within a state''s
      range are typically in the eastern part of the state, while higher numbers are
      in the western part.


      6. So 63670 is in the higher range of Missouri zip codes, suggesting it might
      be in western Missouri.

      7. 67218 is in the middle to lower range of Kansas zip codes, suggesting it
      might be in eastern or central Kansas.


      Given that Kansas is west of Missouri, and these specific zip codes don''t suggest
      an unusual arrangement that would contradict the general state positions, it''s
      likely that 63670, MO is east of 67218, KS.</think># Determining if 63670, MO
      is west of 67218, KS


      I need to analyze the geographic locations of these zip codes to determine their
      east-west relationship.


      ## Step 1: Consider state locations

      Missouri (MO) and Kansas (KS) are neighboring states, with Kansas located directly
      west of Missouri.


      ## Step 2: Analyze zip code patterns

      - US zip codes generally follow geographic patterns

      - Lower zip codes in the eastern US, higher in the western US

      - Missouri zip codes typically start with 63-65

      - Kansas zip codes typically start with 66-67


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes

      - 63670 is in Missouri (eastern state)

      - 67218 is in Kansas (western state)

      - Even if 63670 is in western Missouri, it would still be east of most Kansas
      locations including 67218


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 63670, MO is not west of 67218, KS. It is east of it, following the general
      geography of these two states.'
    cdf231ff-6b6e-4aec-8f5a-6ed6fdce545c: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of these two zip codes and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 63670, MO is a zip code in Missouri (MO)

      - 67218, KS is a zip code in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of Missouri and Kansas.

      Kansas is directly west of Missouri in the United States. The entire state of
      Kansas lies west of Missouri.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      The US zip code system generally follows a pattern where codes increase as you
      go from east to west. However, this is not perfectly consistent across state
      boundaries, so I need to be careful.


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      63670 is a lower number than 67218, which is consistent with the general pattern
      that zip codes increase as you go west. Since 63670 is in Missouri and 67218
      is in Kansas, and Missouri is east of Kansas, this matches the expected pattern.


      Step 5: Determine the answer.

      Since 63670, MO is in Missouri, and 67218, KS is in Kansas, and Kansas is west
      of Missouri, 63670, MO would be EAST of 67218, KS (not west).</think>I need

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 63670 is in Missouri (MO)

      - 67218 is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      Kansas is located directly west of Missouri in the United States. The entire
      state of Kansas lies to the west of Missouri''s western border.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions of the zip codes.

      Since 63670 is in Missouri and 67218 is in Kansas, and Missouri is east of Kansas,
      this means that 63670 is east of 67218 (not west).

      14206 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      60060 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      Generally speaking, New York is located in the eastern part of the United States,
      while Illinois is in the Midwest. Looking at a map of the US, Illinois is west
      of New York.

      not west of it.


      To be more specific:

      - 14206 appears to be in Buffalo, NY

      - 60060 appears to be in Mundelein, IL (northern Illinois)


      Buffalo is in western New York near the Canadian border, but even western New
      York is still east of Illinois.

      - 14206 is a zip code in Buffalo, New York, which is in the eastern United States.

      - 60060 is a zip code in Mundelein, Illinois, which is in the midwestern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of New York and Illinois.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest, west of New York.

      - Even the westernmost parts of New York are still east of Illinois.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Buffalo (14206) is in western New York, but even western New York is east
      of any part of Illinois.

      - Mundelein (60060) is in northeastern Illinois, but all of Illinois is west

      14206 is a zip code in New York state (NY).

      60060 is a zip code in Illinois state (IL).


      The United States generally has states arranged from west to east, with the
      west coast states like California, Oregon, and Washington being the westernmost,
      and the east coast states like Maine, New Hampshire, New York, etc. being the
      easternmost.


      Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      New York (NY) is in the Northeast region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Illinois is west of New York. Therefore, a zip code in Illinois
      would typically be west of a zip code in New York.

      - Illinois is west of New York

      - Therefore, any location in Illinois would generally be west of locations in
      New York


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison of these zip codes.

      - Since 14206 is in New York (eastern state) and 60060 is in Illinois (more
      western state), 14206 is east of 60060, not west of it

      - 12549 is in New York (NY)

      - 60136 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Illinois is west of New York

      - Therefore, any location in New York would be east of Illinois, not west of
      it


      Step 4: Draw conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 12549 is in NY and 60136 is in IL, the NY zip code must be east of the
      IL zip code, not west of it


      NO (12549, NY is not located west of 60136, IL; it''s located east of it)'

      75604 is a zip code in Texas (TX).

      Let me think about the general geographical positions:

      - Texas is generally east of New Mexico in the United States. New Mexico borders
      Texas on Texas''s western border.

      - So most Texas zip codes would be east of most New Mexico zip codes.


      But I should be more specific about these particular zip codes:

      - 75604 appears to be in the eastern part of Texas (7xxxx zip codes tend to
      be in eastern Texas)

      - 88048 appears to be in southern New Mexico (based on NM zip code patterns)


      Given that Texas is east of New Mexico, and 75604 is in eastern Texas, while
      88048 is in New Mexico, it''s very likely that 75604, TX is east of 88048, NM

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      New Mexico (NM) is located directly west of Texas (TX) in the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the zip code patterns.

      - The 756xx range is located in eastern Texas (specifically in the Longview
      area)

      - The 880xx range is located in southern New Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Since Texas is east of New Mexico, and these specific zip codes don''t change
      this general relationship (75604 is not in far western Texas, and 88048 is not
      in far eastern New Mexico), we can determine that 75604, TX must be east of
      88048, NM - not west.

      2. 88048, NM (New Mexico)


      First, I need to think about the general geography of Texas and New Mexico.
      New Mexico is located west of Texas in the United States.


      ZIP codes in the US tend to follow some geographic patterns. Lower numbers are
      generally in the eastern part of the country, while higher numbers are in the
      western parts. So just from the numbers, 75604 is lower than 88048, which might
      suggest that 75604 is east of 88048.


      Given that:

      - 75604 is in Texas

      - 88048 is in New Mexico

      - New Mexico is west of Texas


      It would follow that 75604, TX is east of 88048, NM, not west.


      So 75604, TX is NOT located west of 88048, NM. Instead, it''s located east of
      it.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 75604 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 88048 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico.

      - New Mexico is located to the west of Texas on the US map

      - Texas shares its western border with New Mexico


      Step 3: Consider the general pattern of US zip codes.

      - Lower zip code numbers tend to be assigned to eastern areas

      - Higher zip code numbers tend to be assigned to western areas

      - 75604 (TX) is a lower number than 88048 (NM), consistent with this pattern


      Step 4: Combine this information to determine the relative positions.

      - Since 75604 is in Texas, and 88048 is in New Mexico

      - And New Mexico is west of Texas

      - Therefore, 75604 must be east of 88048, not west of it

      Let me think about the general geography of Texas and New Mexico:

      - Texas is generally east of New Mexico

      - New Mexico is on the western side of Texas


      Based on this general geographic knowledge, it''s likely that a zip code in
      Texas would be east of a zip code in New Mexico, not west of it. This would
      mean 75604, TX is likely east of 88048, NM.


      Let me think more specifically about these zip codes:

      - 75604 appears to be in eastern Texas (based on the "756" prefix)

      - 88048 appears to be in southern New Mexico (based on the "880" prefix)


      So it''s very likely that 75604, TX is east of 88048, NM, not west of it.</think>I

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 75604 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 88048 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico.

      New Mexico is located directly west of Texas in the United States. The entire
      state of New Mexico lies west of most of Texas.


      Step 3: Examine the specific zip codes.

      - 75604 is in the Longview area in eastern Texas

      - 88048 is in the Sunland Park area in southern New Mexico


      Step 4: Compare their longitudes.

      Since New Mexico is west of Texas, and these zip codes don''t fall in any unusual

      - Zip code 88048 is in New Mexico

      - New Mexico is west of Texas

      - Therefore, any location in Texas (including 75604) would be EAST of any location

      - 75604 is in Texas (TX)

      - 88048 is in New Mexico (NM)

      - New Mexico is located directly west of Texas on the US map


      Step 2: Consider the zip code locations.

      - Texas zip codes generally increase from east to west, with lower numbers in
      the eastern part of the state

      - New Mexico zip codes follow similar patterns

      - 75604 appears to be in eastern Texas (based on the 756xx range)

      - 88048 appears to be in southern New Mexico


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      First, let me think about the general geography of Texas (TX) and New Mexico
      (NM). New Mexico is west of Texas - Texas borders New Mexico on New Mexico''s
      eastern border. This gives me an initial hint that a Texas zip code is likely
      east of a New Mexico zip code, but I should verify with the specific zip codes.


      For US zip codes, generally:

      - Lower numbers tend to be in the eastern US

      - Higher numbers tend to be in the western US


      75604 is in Texas, and 88048 is in New Mexico.

      - 75xxx suggests eastern or central Texas

      - 88xxx suggests southern New Mexico


      Based on the zip code numbering pattern, 75604 (a lower number) would likely
      be east of 88048 (a higher number). This aligns with the general geography that
      Texas is east of New Mexico.

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Consider the states. Texas (TX) is located east of New Mexico (NM).
      New Mexico borders Texas on Texas''s western side.


      Step 2: Look at the zip code patterns. In the US postal system, generally lower
      numbers are assigned to the eastern parts of the country, while higher numbers
      are assigned to the western parts.


      Step 3: Compare the zip codes. 75604 (TX) has a lower number than 88048 (NM),
      which supports the general geographic relationship between these states.


      Step 4: Conclude based on both state location and zip code patterns. Since Texas

      longitude values in the western hemisphere.


      Let me think about where these zip codes might be located:


      75604 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is generally in the central/southern
      part of the US.

      88048 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM). New Mexico is in the southwestern US,
      bordering Texas on the west.


      Generally speaking, New Mexico is west of Texas. So my initial expectation is
      that 88048, NM would be west of 75604, TX, not the other way around.


      But let me be more precise. The numbers themselves are quite different - 75xxx
      vs 88xxx. In the US postal system, zip codes aren''t strictly assigned by geography
      in a perfect west-to-east pattern, but there are some regional patterns.


      Given that New Mexico is generally west of Texas, and the question is asking

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico.

      - New Mexico is located to the west of Texas in the United States

      - Texas shares its western border with New Mexico


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      10162 in New York is located west of the zip code 44095 in Ohio.


      In the US, generally speaking:

      - New York is on the east coast

      - Ohio is in the midwest, east of the Mississippi but west of New York


      The way zip codes work in the US, they generally increase as you go from east
      to west (with some exceptions due to population patterns). However, we shouldn''t
      rely on the zip code numbers alone.


      Instead, I need to compare the actual geographical locations:


      - 10162 is in New York (NY)

      - 44095 is in Ohio (OH)


      Geographically, Ohio is west of New York. Therefore, a location in New York
      would be east of a location in Ohio, not west of it.


      So 10162, NY is located EAST of 44095, OH, not west of it.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the geographic relationship between these
      two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - 10162 is in New York (NY)

      - 44095 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      New York is located on the eastern coast of the United States, while Ohio is
      in the Midwest region. Ohio is west of New York.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific zip codes.

      Since Ohio is west of New York, a zip code in Ohio (44095) would be west of
      a zip code in New York (10162).


      Step 4: Determine the answer to the specific question asked.

      The question asks if 10162, NY is west of 44095, OH. Since New York is east
      of Ohio, not west, the zip code in New York cannot be west of the zip code in
      Ohio.

      - Kansas is significantly west of West Virginia on the map

      - All of West Virginia lies east of Kansas


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since 26041 is in West Virginia and 66220 is in Kansas, zip code 26041 must

      01604 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA).

      18704 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Now I need to determine the specific locations:


      01604 is likely in eastern Massachusetts, possibly near Boston or Worcester
      area.

      18704 is in Pennsylvania, which is west of Massachusetts.


      Actually, I''m making assumptions here. Let me think more carefully. Massachusetts
      is generally east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States. So typically,
      any location in MA would be east of any location in PA, not west.


      So if 01604 is in MA and 18704 is in PA, then 01604 would be east of 18704,
      not west.


      However, I should be careful about unusual geographical situations. Let me double
      check my understanding of the geography.


      Massachusetts is entirely east of Pennsylvania. There''s no part of Massachusetts
      that extends west of any part of Pennsylvania. So any zip code in MA must be
      east of any zip code in PA.


      So 01604, MA is not located west of 18704, PA. It''s located east of it.</think>#

      - 01604 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 18704 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider the general geography
      of these states:


      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, on the east coast.
      Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern United States, but is located inland
      and west of Massachusetts.


      Generally speaking, locations in Pennsylvania tend to be west of locations in

      Therefore, it''s unlikely that a location in Massachusetts would be west of
      a location in Pennsylvania. The typical geography would place Massachusetts

      - 01604 is a zip code in Worcester, Massachusetts (MA)

      - 18704 is a zip code in Kingston/Forty Fort area, Pennsylvania (PA)

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania. Since Worcester (01604) is

      Let me break this down:

      1. 01604 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      2. 18704 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      3. I need to determine if the MA location is west of the PA location


      First, I''ll think about the general geographic relationship between Massachusetts
      and Pennsylvania. Massachusetts is in New England, in the northeastern United
      States. Pennsylvania is south and west of Massachusetts.


      In general, locations in Massachusetts would be east of locations in Pennsylvania,
      not west. However, I should be more precise since we''re dealing with specific
      zip codes that could be near state borders.


      01604 appears to be in Worcester, Massachusetts (based on the leading "016"
      which indicates central Massachusetts).


      18704 appears to be in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, possibly in or near
      Wilkes-Barre (based on the "187" prefix which is in eastern PA).


      Since Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, and these zip codes don''t appear

      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of these
      zip codes and compare their east-west positions.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Zip code 01604 is in Massachusetts (MA), specifically in Worcester.


      2) Zip code 18704 is in Pennsylvania (PA), specifically in the Wilkes-Barre
      area.


      3) Looking at the geographic arrangement of states, Massachusetts is located
      in New England, in the northeastern United States.


      4) Pennsylvania is situated southwest of Massachusetts.


      5) Worcester, MA (01604) is in the central part of Massachusetts.


      6) Wilkes-Barre, PA (18704) is in eastern Pennsylvania.


      7) Even though 18704 is in eastern Pennsylvania, it''s still west of Worcester,
      Massachusetts.


      Therefore, 01604 (Worcester, MA) is NOT west of 18704 (Wilkes-Barre, PA). It''s

      First, let me identify these locations:

      - 01604 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 18704 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Now I need to determine their specific locations:

      - 01604 appears to be in Worcester, Massachusetts

      - 18704 appears to be in the Wilkes-Barre area of Pennsylvania


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. The eastern United

      the Northeast, and higher numbers as you move south and west.


      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, while Pennsylvania
      is south and west of Massachusetts. However, since these are specific zip codes,
      I need to be more precise.

      - 01604 is a zip code in Worcester, Massachusetts (MA)

      - 18704 is a zip code in the Wilkes-Barre area, Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider relative positions

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located southwest of Massachusetts

      - Worcester (01604) is in central Massachusetts

      - Wilkes-Barre (18704) is in eastern Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      Looking at a map of the northeast US, Worcester, MA is located to the east of
      Wilkes-Barre, PA. Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania, and these

    a8ef2bb1-d6a8-40ce-84ea-0c391687d2e9: '<think>This question asks about the relative
      locations of two US zip codes. Let me break this down step by step:


      1. 48219, MI refers to a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      2. 68152, NE refers to a zip code in Nebraska (NE)


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to think about the geographical
      locations of these states and their zip codes.


      The United States roughly has:

      - East Coast states on the right (eastern part)

      - West Coast states on the left (western part)

      - Central states in the middle


      Michigan (MI) is in the Great Lakes region, in the upper Midwest/northeastern
      part of the United States.

      Nebraska (NE) is in the Great Plains region, in the central United States.


      Generally speaking, Nebraska is west of Michigan. The entire state of Michigan
      is east of Nebraska.


      Therefore, a zip code in Michigan (48219) would be EAST of a zip code in Nebraska
      (68152), not west of it.</think>To determine if 48219, MI is located west of
      68152, NE, I need to examine the geographic locations of these zip codes and
      their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 48219 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 68152 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region in the eastern portion of the
      Midwest. Nebraska is located in the Great Plains region in the central United
      States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis

      Nebraska is positioned significantly west of Michigan. On a map of the United
      States, Nebraska sits to the west of Michigan.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 48219 is in Michigan and 68152 is in Nebraska, and Michigan is east of
      Nebraska, zip code 48219 must be east (not west) of zip code 68152.


      NO'
    ac0f54ea-7f99-46ee-acd6-63c17d25afa7: '<think>This question asks whether the zip
      code 48219 in Michigan (MI) is located west of the zip code 68152 in Nebraska
      (NE).


      To determine this, I need to know the relative positions of these locations
      on the east-west axis. In the US, locations further west have higher longitude
      numbers.


      However, that''s not quite right. Actually, in the US, locations further west
      have *lower* longitude numbers, since longitude in the Western Hemisphere is
      measured in negative degrees from the Prime Meridian.


      So to determine if 48219, MI is west of 68152, NE, I need to know which state
      is further west.


      Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, while Nebraska is in the Great
      Plains region. Nebraska is generally west of Michigan.


      Since Nebraska is west of Michigan, the zip code 68152 in Nebraska would be
      west of the zip code 48219 in Michigan.


      So 48219, MI is NOT west of 68152, NE. Rather, 48219, MI is EAST of 68152, NE.</think>To

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the Great Lakes region in the eastern part of
      the Midwest.

      - Nebraska (NE) is located in the Great Plains region, further west in the central
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Nebraska is positioned significantly west of Michigan on the US map.

      - Michigan''s western border doesn''t extend as far west as Nebraska''s eastern
      border.


      Step 3: Since zip code 48219 is in Michigan and zip code 68152 is in Nebraska,
      their relative positions follow the same pattern as their states.


      NO - 48219, MI is not located west of 68152, NE. It is located east of it.'

      Nebraska is located in the central part of the United States, in the Midwest/Great

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Michigan is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region, surrounding

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States, in the Great Plains region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a west-east axis.

      - Nebraska is significantly west of Michigan

      - On a map of the United States, Nebraska is positioned to the west of Michigan


      Step 4: Make the comparison for the specific zip codes.

      - Since 48219 is in Michigan and 68152 is in Nebraska, the Michigan zip code

      11361 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      46567 is a zip code in Indiana (IN). Indiana is in the Midwest of the United
      States.


      Generally speaking, locations in New York are east of locations in Indiana,
      not west of them. This is because New York is on the east coast, while Indiana
      is more centrally located in the US.


      The direction "west" means having a longitude that is numerically lower (more
      negative in the Western Hemisphere). If 11361, NY is west of 46567, IN, then
      11361 would have a lower longitude value than 46567.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, New York is east of Indiana,
      not west. So 11361, NY should be east of 46567, IN, which means the answer is
      likely "NO".


      However, to be absolutely certain, I should consider the exact locations of
      these specific zip codes, not just the states they''re in. But the general geography
      of the US makes it highly unlikely that a NY zip code would be west of an IN

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by identifying

      - 11361 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - 46567 is a zip code in Indiana (IN), which is in the Midwest region of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - New York is located significantly east of Indiana on the US map.

      - All New York zip codes, including 11361, are east of Indiana zip codes.

      - On a map of the United States, we would need to move east (not west) to travel
      from Indiana to New York.


      Step 3: Consider longitude (the geographic coordinate that measures east-west
      position).

      - Locations in New York have greater (more easterly) longitude values than locations
      in Indiana.

      - For a location to be west of another, it would need to have a smaller longitude
      value.


      NO - 11361, NY is not located west of 46567, IN. It is located east of it.'

      11361 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the United

      Generally speaking, states on the east coast (like New York) are east of midwestern
      states (like Indiana). In other words, New York is east of Indiana, not west
      of it.


      So if 11361 is in New York, and 46567 is in Indiana, then 11361, NY would be
      east of 46567, IN, not west of it.


      To be absolutely sure, I''d need the exact longitudes of these zip codes, but

    fdd45356-0f26-4b69-81be-840a2c230405: '<think>To determine if one zip code is
      west of another, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their longitudes. Western locations have a higher (more negative) longitude
      value in the western hemisphere.


      Let me identify each location:


      11361 is a zip code in New York (NY).

      46567 is a zip code in Indiana (IN).


      Now, I need to think about their general locations:


      New York is on the east coast of the United States.

      Indiana is in the Midwest, which is west of New York but east of the western
      states.


      Since New York is on the east coast and Indiana is in the Midwest, New York
      would be east of Indiana, not west. Therefore, 11361, NY would be east of 46567,
      IN, not west.


      So the answer should be "NO" - 11361, NY is NOT located west of 46567, IN.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by finding their
      locations and comparing their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 11361 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 46567 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - States on the East Coast (like New York) are generally east of Midwestern
      states (like Indiana)

      - Moving from east to west across the US, you would encounter New York before
      Indiana

      - Therefore, New York is east of Indiana, not west of it


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 11361 is in New York and 46567 is in Indiana, the New York zip code
      must be east of the Indiana zip code


      NO - 11361, NY is not located west of 46567, IN. It is located east of it.'

      84010 is a zip code in Utah (UT).

      95503 is a zip code in California (CA).

      84010 appears to be in Bountiful, Utah, which is in the northern part of Utah
      near Salt Lake City.

      95503 appears to be in Eureka, California, which is on the northern California

      - California is located along the western coast of the United States

      - Utah is an inland state, located east of California

      - The entire state of California is west of Utah


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      - Even though 95503 is in northern California, all of California''s territory

      Let me consider what I know about US geography:


      - NY (New York) is a state in the northeastern United States

      - IL (Illinois) is a state in the midwestern United States

      - Generally, Illinois is west of New York


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - New York is further east (higher longitude numbers when expressed as negative
      values)

      - Illinois is further west (lower longitude numbers when expressed as negative
      values)


      So a zip code in NY would typically be east of a zip code in IL, not west of

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Illinois is located in the midwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - On a US map, Illinois is west of New York

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 27705 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 37341 is a zip code in Tennessee (TN)


      To determine which is more westerly, I need to consider the general geography
      of these states and the specific locations of these zip codes.


      North Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Tennessee
      is located more inland and to the west of North Carolina. Generally speaking,
      Tennessee is west of North Carolina.


      So based on the general state locations, a zip code in Tennessee (37341) would
      typically be west of a zip code in North Carolina (27705).


      Let me double check this by considering that some parts of western NC could
      potentially be west of eastern TN, but given that zip code 27705 is in Durham,
      NC (in the central part of NC) and 37341 appears to be in the Chattanooga area

      - 37341 is a zip code in the Chattanooga area of Tennessee


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between North Carolina
      and Tennessee.

      North Carolina is on the East Coast, while Tennessee is an inland state that
      borders North Carolina on its western side.


      Step 3: Look at the specific locations within their states.

      Durham (27705) is in the central/eastern part of North Carolina.

      The Chattanooga area (37341) is in the southeastern part of Tennessee.


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      Even though 37341 is in eastern Tennessee, Tennessee as a whole is west of North
      Carolina. The Chattanooga area of Tennessee is still west of Durham, North Carolina.

      Step 1: I need to identify the general locations of these zip codes.

      - 19043 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      Ohio is entirely west of Pennsylvania, sharing a border on Pennsylvania''s western

      However, I should be careful here because zip codes near the border could potentially
      defy the general state positioning. Let me think more specifically about these
      zip codes.


      19043 appears to be a zip code in the eastern part of Pennsylvania (zip codes
      in PA generally start with 15-19, with higher numbers in the east).


      45371 appears to be in Ohio (zip codes 43-45 are Ohio), likely not right at
      the PA border.


      Given this information, 19043 PA is almost certainly east of 45371 OH, not west
      of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - 19043 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 45371 is in Ohio (OH)

      - Geographically, Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania


      Step 2: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Pennsylvania zip codes generally start with 15-19, with the higher numbers
      (like 19xxx) typically in the eastern part of the state

      - Ohio zip codes range from 43-45

      - 19043 is likely in eastern Pennsylvania based on its prefix

      - 45371 is in Ohio, which is entirely west of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since 19043 is in Pennsylvania (and likely eastern PA based on its prefix),
      and 45371 is in Ohio (which is west of Pennsylvania), the Pennsylvania zip code
      is east of the Ohio zip code, not west of it.

      First, let me understand where these zip codes are located:

      - 08028 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 45204 is in Ohio (OH)


      In general, the United States is arranged with states on the East Coast (like
      New Jersey) being east of states in the Midwest (like Ohio). New Jersey is on
      the Atlantic coast, while Ohio is more inland.


      Geographically:

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      In terms of longitude, which determines east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally farther east (higher longitude numbers in the Western
      Hemisphere are actually farther west)

      - Ohio is generally farther west than New Jersey

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positioning of these states.

      - New Jersey is located east of Ohio on the map of the United States.

      - Ohio is west of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Since zip codes 08028 and 45204 are in NJ and OH respectively, they
      follow the same geographic relationship as their states.

      - Zip code 08028 in NJ must be east of zip code 45204 in OH.

      - It cannot be west of the Ohio zip code.

      - 45204 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Looking at the geography of the United States, Ohio is located west of New Jersey.
      The eastern border of Ohio is west of the western border of New Jersey.

      1. 08028 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      2. 45204 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. In the United States, states
      that are more western have higher longitude values (though they''re typically

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States, extending farther
      west than Florida.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states relative to each other.

      - Texas is positioned west of Florida on a map of the United States.

      - Moving from Texas to Florida, you would travel eastward.


      Step 3: Since these zip codes are in their respective states, their relative
      positions follow the same pattern.

      - 32603 (in Florida) must be east of 77045 (in Texas).

      - Therefore, 32603, FL cannot be west of 77045, TX.

      32603, FL is a zip code in Florida. Let me think about where in Florida this
      is. Florida is in the southeastern United States, with the Gulf of Mexico to
      its west and the Atlantic Ocean to its east.


      77045, TX is a zip code in Texas. Texas is located in the south-central part
      of the United States, with the Gulf of Mexico to its southeast.


      Geographically, Texas is to the west of Florida. This means that generally,
      locations in Florida are east of locations in Texas.


      So if 32603 is in Florida and 77045 is in Texas, then 32603 is likely east of
      77045, not west.


      Let me verify by thinking about the specific locations:

      - 32603 is likely in the Gainesville area in north-central Florida

      - 77045 is likely in the Houston area in southeastern Texas


      Given these specific locations, 32603 in Florida is still east of 77045 in Texas.</think>I

      - 77045 is in Texas (TX), which is in the south-central United States


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Florida is positioned to the east of Texas on the US map

      - Texas is west of Florida


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations of these zip codes.

      - 32603 is in the Gainesville area of north-central Florida

      - 77045 is in the Houston area of southeastern Texas


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Even though 32603 is in northern Florida and 77045 is in southeastern Texas,
      all of Florida lies east of the eastern portions of Texas

      ## Step 3: Apply geographical knowledge about state positions

      Virginia''s eastern position means that locations in VA generally have more

      in the eastern part of the state), it is very likely that 23664, VA is EAST
      of 40175, KY, not west.</think># Is 23664, VA located west of 40175, KY?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geographic positions of Virginia (VA)
      and Kentucky (KY) in the United States.


      2) Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the US, while Kentucky is
      more inland and to the west of Virginia.


      3) Virginia zip codes that begin with 236xx are typically in the eastern part
      of the state, often in the Hampton Roads/Norfolk area.


      4) Kentucky zip codes starting with 401xx are generally in the central to eastern
      portion of Kentucky.


      5) Even the westernmost parts of Virginia are generally east of most of Kentucky.


      6) Since 23664 is likely in eastern Virginia, and 40175 is in Kentucky, the
      Virginia location would be east of the Kentucky location.


      To be west of something, you need to be further toward the Pacific Ocean side
      of the US. In this case, the Virginia zip code is further toward the Atlantic
      Ocean side compared to the Kentucky zip code.

      - PA is Pennsylvania, which is in the eastern part of the United States

      - IL is Illinois, which is in the Midwest


      Generally speaking, Illinois is west of Pennsylvania. However, I need to check
      the specific zip codes to be certain.


      Zip code 18240 is in Pennsylvania. Since Pennsylvania is in the eastern US,

      is west of 61611, IL (Illinois), I need to know the geographical locations of
      these zip codes and compare their positions on a map.


      First, let''s recall the general geographic positions of Pennsylvania and Illinois:

      - Pennsylvania is located in the eastern part of the US

      - Illinois is located in the midwest, which is west of Pennsylvania


      Since 18240 is in Pennsylvania and 61611 is in Illinois, we can already make
      an initial assessment that 18240, PA is likely to be east of 61611, IL, not
      west.


      But to be sure, let''s think about the organization of US zip codes. While zip
      codes aren''t perfectly aligned with longitude, in general:

      - Lower zip code numbers tend to be in the eastern US

      - Higher zip code numbers tend to be in the western and central US


      18240 is a lower number than 61611, which also suggests that 18240 PA is east
      of 61611 IL.


      Given both the state locations and the zip code pattern, I can conclude that
      18240, PA is east of 61611, IL, not west of it.</think>I need to determine if
      18240, PA is west of 61611, IL by examining their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider the general geographic locations of the states.

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the eastern United States.

      Illinois (IL) is located in the Midwest region, west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Examine the zip code patterns.

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with longitude, there is a general
      pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the eastern US and higher numbers
      tend to be in the central and western US.

      18240 (in PA) is a lower number than 61611 (in IL).


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on state locations.

      Since Pennsylvania is entirely east of Illinois on the US map, any location
      in Pennsylvania (including 18240) must be east of any location in Illinois (including
      61611).


      Therefore, 18240, PA is NOT west of 61611, IL. It is east of it.

      45449 is a zip code in Ohio (OH).

      63109 is a zip code in Missouri (MO).


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider their relative positions.
      The US generally has states arranged so that lower numbers are in the eastern
      part of the country, and higher numbers are in the western part.


      Missouri (MO) is generally west of Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the Midwest/Eastern
      part of the US, while Missouri is further west in the Midwest.


      Zip codes within a state don''t necessarily follow a strict west-to-east numbering
      system, but the state locations themselves are definitive here. Since Missouri
      is west of Ohio, a zip code in Missouri (63109) would be west of a zip code
      in Ohio (45449).


      So 45449, OH is NOT west of 63109, MO. In fact, it''s the opposite - 63109,

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region, while Missouri is
      located in the western part of the Midwest region. On a US map, Missouri is
      positioned to the west of Ohio.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      Since Missouri is west of Ohio, zip codes in Missouri (including 63109) are
      generally west of zip codes in Ohio (including 45449).


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since 63109, MO is west of 45449, OH (not the other way around), the answer

      Generally, Missouri is west of Ohio. But I should verify the specific zip codes

      45449 is a zip code in Ohio, likely in the western part of the state.

      63109 is a zip code in Missouri, which could be in any part of that state.


      Since states generally span a range of longitudes, I need to be careful. However,
      in this case, the entire state of Ohio is east of Missouri. The westernmost

      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 45449 is in Ohio and 63109 is in Missouri, and Ohio is entirely east of
      Missouri, the zip code 45449 must be east of zip code 63109.

      Since 45449 is in Ohio and 63109 is in Missouri, and Ohio as a state is entirely

      2) To determine this, I need to know the relative east-west positioning of these
      two zip codes.


      3) In the US, zip codes generally follow patterns based on geography. The first

      - Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States

      - Generally, Arizona is west of Texas


      ## Step 2: Look at the zip code patterns

      - US zip codes are organized geographically, with first digits generally increasing

      - 79838 has a first digit of 7 (Texas)

      - 85621 has a first digit of 8 (Arizona)

      - The higher first digit for Arizona aligns with its more western position


      ## Step 3: Confirm with geographic knowledge

      east

      - All locations in Arizona are west of most locations in Texas

      Generally speaking, Arizona is west of Texas, since Arizona is in the southwestern
      US while Texas is in the south-central US. However, I need to be more specific
      about these particular ZIP codes, since states have irregular shapes.


      Let me think about the general layout of these states:

      - Texas is east of New Mexico, which is east of Arizona

      - So most of Texas is east of most of Arizona


      Now, for specific ZIP codes:

      - 79838 is in Texas. Texas ZIP codes typically start with 75-79, with 79 being
      in western Texas

      - 85621 is in Arizona. Arizona ZIP codes typically start with 85-86


      79838 being in western Texas could potentially be closer in longitude to Arizona,

      - TX (Texas) is in the south-central United States

      - AZ (Arizona) is in the southwestern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Arizona is generally west of Texas. The entire

      - 85621 is in Arizona (ZIP codes starting with 85 are in Arizona)


      Even though 79838 is in western Texas, it would still be east of any point in
      Arizona because of the states'' relative positions. The western border of Texas
      is still east of the eastern border of Arizona.

      to determine if the zip code 79838 in Texas is located west of the zip code
      85621 in Arizona.


      In the US, zip codes generally increase from east to west, so a lower zip code
      usually suggests an eastern location compared to a higher zip code. However,
      there are many exceptions to this pattern, especially across different states.


      Let me think about the states first:

      - Texas (TX) is generally east of Arizona (AZ)

      - Arizona borders California to the west and New Mexico to the east

      - Texas is east of New Mexico


      So geographically, Texas is east of Arizona. This suggests that 79838, TX would
      be east of 85621, AZ.


      However, I should verify this by considering the specific zip codes:

      - 79838 is in Texas, likely in western Texas given the "79" prefix

      - 85621 is in Arizona, likely in southern Arizona

      Step 2: Let''s look at these specific zip codes. Zip code 79838 appears to be
      in western Texas, while 85621 is in Arizona.


      Step 3: Even though 79838 is in western Texas, Arizona as a whole state is still
      west of Texas. Since 85621 is in Arizona, it would be west of any location in
      Texas.


      Step 4: The question asks if the Texas zip code is west of the Arizona zip code,

      79838 in Texas is located west of zip code 85621 in Arizona.


      First, let me think about the geography of the United States. Generally:

      - Texas is east of Arizona (Arizona is in the southwest, while Texas is in the
      south-central part of the US)

      - Most of Texas is east of Arizona


      However, I need to be more precise since we''re comparing specific zip codes,
      and Texas is a very large state that extends quite far west.


      Let me think about zip code patterns:

      - In the US, zip codes generally (though not perfectly) follow a west-to-east
      pattern where lower numbers are in the east and higher numbers in the west

      - The first digit of zip codes ranges from 0 (northeast) to 9 (west coast)

      - 7xxxx zip codes are typically in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana area

      - 8xxxx zip codes are typically in western states like Arizona, Colorado, New
      Mexico, Nevada, Utah, etc.


      Since 79838 starts with 7 and 85621 starts with 8, this pattern suggests that
      79838 would be east of 85621.


      But let me be more specific about these particular zip codes:

      - 79838 is in TX, and since it starts with 79, it''s likely in western Texas

      - 85621 is in AZ, and since it starts with 85, it''s in Arizona


      Even though 79838 is in western Texas, Arizona is still generally west of Texas.
      So the zip code in Arizona (85621) should be west of the zip code in Texas (79838).


      Wait, I need to double-check my reasoning. Looking at the zip code pattern again:

      - Higher first digits generally indicate more western locations

      - 8xxxx (Arizona) is higher than 7xxxx (Texas)


      This suggests that Arizona''s 85621 would be WEST of Texas''s 79838.


      Actually, I might be confused about the exact question. Let me re-examine it.
      The question asks if 79838, TX is located west of 85621, AZ.


      If 85621, AZ is west of 79838, TX, then the answer would be NO.

      If 79838, TX is west of 85621, AZ, then the answer would be YES.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, Arizona is west of Texas,
      so 85621, AZ should be west of 79838, TX, not the other way around. Therefore,
      the answer should be NO.</think># Is 79838, TX located west of 85621, AZ?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      Texas (TX) is generally located to the east of Arizona (AZ) in the United States.
      Arizona borders California to the west, while Texas is in the south-central
      part of the country.


      ## Step 2: Analyze the zip codes

      - 79838 is in Texas, and based on the first digit (7), it''s in the western
      part of Texas

      - 85621 is in Arizona, and based on the first digit (8), it follows the general
      pattern of western states


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      Even though 79838 might be in western Texas, Arizona as a state lies entirely
      west of Texas. The westernmost point of Texas is still east of the easternmost
      point of Arizona.

      07852 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ).

      60626 is a ZIP code in Illinois (IL).


      Now, in terms of general geography of the United States:

      - New Jersey is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - Illinois is located in the midwest of the United States, west of New Jersey.


      Since Illinois is west of New Jersey, it follows that a ZIP code in New Jersey
      (07852) would NOT be west of a ZIP code in Illinois (60626). Instead, 07852,
      NJ would be EAST of 60626, IL.


      So the answer is NO, 07852, NJ is not located west of 60626, IL. It''s located
      east of it.</think># Is 07852, NJ located west of 60626, IL?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographical relationship between
      these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 07852 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 60626 is a ZIP code in Illinois (IL)


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      ## Step 3: Determine directional relationship

      - Illinois is west of New Jersey in terms of U.S. geography

      - Therefore, any ZIP code in New Jersey would be east of any ZIP code in Illinois


      Since 07852, NJ is east of 60626, IL (not west of it), the answer is:

      - 20032 is in DC (District of Columbia)

      - 46203 is in IN (Indiana)


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to know their relative positions
      on the US map.


      The United States generally runs with lower longitude numbers (more western
      points) on the left/west side of the map, and higher longitude numbers (more
      eastern points) on the right/east side of the map.


      Washington DC is located on the eastern coast of the United States.

      Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Geographically, Indiana is west of Washington DC. Since 20032 is in DC and 46203
      is in Indiana, 46203 (IN) would be west of 20032 (DC), not the other way around.

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Washington DC is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Washington DC is significantly east of Indiana

      - The eastern border of Indiana is approximately 500 miles west of Washington
      DC


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on these geographic facts.

      - Washington, DC is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - The Midwest (including Indiana) is positioned west of the East Coast (where
      DC is located)

      - Therefore, Washington DC is EAST of Indiana, not west of it


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      First, let me consider the geography of these two states:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is located to the east of California


      In general, locations in California tend to be west of locations in Arizona.
      However, there could be exceptions depending on the specific locations within
      each state, especially since California extends quite far to the east in some
      areas, and Arizona extends quite far to the west in some areas.


      To be more precise, I need to know the specific locations of these zip codes:

      - 85396 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 91780 is in California (CA)


      Without looking up the exact longitude coordinates, I know that:

      1. California is generally west of Arizona

      2. Zip codes in the western part of the US typically have lower numbers in the
      western areas and higher numbers in the eastern areas


      Since 85396 (AZ) has a lower number than 91780 (CA), this might suggest that
      85396 is actually further west. However, the zip code numbering system doesn''t
      always perfectly correlate with east-west positioning, especially across state
      lines.


      Given that California is west of Arizona as a general rule, and without specific

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Arizona
      is directly east of California.


      Step 2: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      While the US zip code system generally has lower numbers in the east and higher
      numbers in the west, this pattern applies within regions but doesn''t necessarily
      work when comparing across state boundaries.


      Step 3: Examine these specific zip codes.

      85396 is in Buckeye, Arizona, in the western part of Arizona.

      91780 is in Temple City, California, which is in the Los Angeles area.


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Even though 85396 is in western Arizona, it''s still east of 91780 because all

      if a zip code in New Jersey (07640) is west of a zip code in Pennsylvania (17202).


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify where 07640, NJ is located

      2. Identify where 17202, PA is located

      3. Determine their relative east-west positions


      Let me think about the general geography of New Jersey and Pennsylvania first.
      New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast and Pennsylvania is inland, west of New
      Jersey. So generally speaking, locations in NJ tend to be east of locations
      in PA.


      However, the specific zip codes could be exceptions to this pattern, especially
      since NJ extends westward at its northern border and PA extends eastward in
      certain areas. I need to check the specific locations.


      07640 is a zip code in Harrington Park, NJ, which is in the northeastern part
      of New Jersey.

      17202 is a zip code in Chambersburg, PA, which is in south-central Pennsylvania.


      Given that New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and 07640 is in northeastern

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 07640 is in Harrington Park, New Jersey, located in the northeastern part
      of the state

      - 17202 is in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, located in the south-central region
      of that state


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of NJ and PA

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is inland and
      generally west of New Jersey. The states share a border along the Delaware River,
      with New Jersey to the east and Pennsylvania to the west.


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      Given their positions within their respective states, Harrington Park, NJ (07640)
      is in the eastern part of the region, while Chambersburg, PA (17202) is west

      07640 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      I need to determine which is more westerly. In general, the eastern United States
      has lower zip codes and the western United States has higher zip codes, but
      that''s not a reliable rule for comparing specific locations, especially in
      neighboring states.


      Let me try to recall the specific locations:


      07640 would be in northern New Jersey. New Jersey zip codes beginning with 07
      are typically in the northeastern part of the state.


      17202 would be in southern Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania zip codes beginning with
      17 are generally in the south-central part of the state.


      Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey. So if we''re comparing a location in NJ
      to one in PA, the NJ location would typically be east of the PA location.


      However, New Jersey wraps around the eastern part of Pennsylvania, and the specific
      locations matter. Let me think about where these specific zip codes are:


      07640 is likely in northeastern NJ

      17202 is likely in south-central PA


      Looking at the geography, northeastern NJ is definitely east of south-central

      - 07640 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 17202 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between NJ and PA.

      - New Jersey is generally located east of Pennsylvania on the US map.


      Step 3: Identify the specific regions.

      - 07640 appears to be in northern New Jersey (Bergen County area)

      - 17202 is in south-central Pennsylvania (Franklin County area)


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Even though these are specific locations within their states, northern NJ
      is still east of south-central PA.

      - The entire state of New Jersey is generally east of central Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, 07640, NJ is located EAST of 17202, PA, not west of it.

      07640 corresponds to Harrington Park, NJ, which is in northeastern New Jersey,

      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.
      In the US, locations further west have more negative longitude values (since
      the US is in the western hemisphere where longitudes are negative).


      Let me consider what I know about US geography:

      - NY (New York) is generally east of PA (Pennsylvania)

      - Zip codes starting with 10xxx are typically in New York City area

      - Zip codes starting with 15xxx are in western Pennsylvania


      Based on the general geography of the US, New York is east of Pennsylvania.
      So a zip code in NY would typically be east of a zip code in PA, not west.


      Furthermore, the numeric pattern of zip codes in the US generally follows a
      west-to-east pattern, with lower numbers in the northeast and higher numbers
      as you move west and south. The 10xxx range is for the NYC area (eastern NY),

      Since 10993 is in New York (which is east of Pennsylvania) and zip code patterns

      10993 is in New York, which is typically in the eastern part of the US. Pennsylvania
      is west of New York, but depending on the specific locations within these states,
      there could be exceptions.


      However, since we''re dealing with standard US zip codes, and New York is generally
      east of Pennsylvania, it''s unlikely that a NY zip code would be west of a PA
      zip code. The state borders don''t weave back and forth that much.</think>#
      Is 10993, NY located west of 15062, PA?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geographic positions of New York (NY)
      and Pennsylvania (PA) states.


      2) New York state is positioned to the east of Pennsylvania state on the US
      map.


      3) Zip codes starting with "109" are typically in the eastern part of New York
      (around the New York City area).


      4) Zip codes starting with "150" are typically in the western part of Pennsylvania
      (around the Pittsburgh area).


      5) Even the westernmost parts of New York are generally east of the Pittsburgh
      area of Pennsylvania.


      6) Since 10993 is in NY and 15062 is in PA, and based on the standard geographic
      arrangement of these states and their zip code distributions, 10993 would be
      east of 15062, not west.

    b5420d08-80b3-44f8-9533-54817806c7ea: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to:

      1. Determine the geographic coordinates of 10993, NY

      2. Determine the geographic coordinates of 15062, PA

      3. Compare their longitudes - if the longitude of 10993, NY is greater (more
      negative in the western hemisphere) than 15062, PA, then 10993, NY is west of
      15062, PA.


      Let me think about where these zip codes are located:


      10993 is a zip code in New York state (NY). New York is in the northeastern
      United States.

      15062 is a zip code in Pennsylvania state (PA). Pennsylvania is also in the
      northeastern United States, but generally southwest of New York.


      In general, locations in New York tend to be east of locations in Pennsylvania.
      However, since Pennsylvania is to the south of New York and has an irregular
      shape, there could be exceptions depending on the specific locations.


      Let me consider the specific zip codes:

      - 10993 is likely in the southern part of New York

      - 15062 is likely in the western part of Pennsylvania


      Based on the general geography of the northeastern US, I would expect that 10993,
      NY is east of 15062, PA, not west. Pennsylvania generally extends further west
      than New York.</think># Is 10993, NY located west of 15062, PA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10993 is in New York (NY)

      - 15062 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between NY and PA

      New York state is generally located to the east and north of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
      extends further west than most of New York state.


      ## Step 3: Examine these specific zip codes

      - 10993 is in the Hudson Valley region of New York

      - 15062 is in western Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh)


      ## Step 4: Compare their positions

      The western Pennsylvania zip codes (15xxx series) are typically further west
      than New York zip codes (10xxx series). Western Pennsylvania extends significantly
      further west than any part of New York state.


      NO'

      10993, NY is located west of 15062, PA. Let me break this down into steps.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10993 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 15062 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      In the United States, New York is generally east of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
      borders New York to the west, which means New York is to the east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      ZIP codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the
      east and higher numbers in the west, but there are many exceptions to this pattern,
      especially within states. However, the first digit often indicates a broad geographical
      region.


      - 10993 starts with "1", which typically represents areas in the northeastern
      US

      - 15062 starts with "1" as well, but the "5" as second digit typically represents
      western PA


      Given the state information is more reliable than trying to interpret the zip
      code patterns precisely, I should rely on the fact that NY is east of PA.


      Therefore, 10993, NY would be east of 15062, PA, not west of it.</think>I need
      to determine if 10993, NY is located west of 15062, PA.


      Step 1: Identify the states these zip codes are in.

      - 10993 is in New York (NY)

      - 15062 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      New York is located to the east of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania shares its eastern
      border with New York, which means New York is positioned to the east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      While zip codes can sometimes vary in their exact geographical arrangement within
      states, the state locations are the determining factor here. Since any location
      in New York would be east (not west) of Pennsylvania, a New York zip code would
      be east of a Pennsylvania zip code.

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Determine the geographic locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their east-west positions (longitude)


      First, I need to consider the general geographic position of Connecticut and
      Pennsylvania:

      - Connecticut (CT) is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is also in the northeastern United States


      Looking at their relative positions, Connecticut is generally east of Pennsylvania.
      Connecticut borders New York to its west, while Pennsylvania is further west
      of New York.


      The standard numbering of zip codes in the US also provides a hint: lower numbers
      generally correspond to the northeastern states, with numbers increasing as
      you go south and west. The fact that the CT zip code starts with 06 while the
      PA zip code starts with 18 suggests the CT location is further east (lower numbers
      in the northeast).

      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states.

      Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, while Pennsylvania
      is also in the northeast but positioned to the west of Connecticut. Connecticut
      borders New York to its west, while Pennsylvania is even further west than New

      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      The U.S. zip code system generally assigns lower numbers to the northeastern

      boundaries. However, in this case, the states are not adjacent in a way that
      would cause edge cases - Connecticut doesn''t wrap around Pennsylvania or anything
      unusual.


      So 06379, CT is east of 18218, PA, not west of it.</think>To determine if 06379,
      CT is located west of 18218, PA, I need to analyze the geographic relationship
      between these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 06379 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 18218 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Connecticut is located on the east coast of the United States, while Pennsylvania
      is located west of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes

      Since Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania, zip codes in Connecticut (including
      06379) would generally be east of zip codes in Pennsylvania (including 18218).


      Step 4: Check for any possible exceptions

      There are no unusual geographic arrangements between these states that would
      create exceptions to this rule. Connecticut does not extend west of Pennsylvania
      at any point.


      NO - 06379, CT is not located west of 18218, PA. It is located east of it.'

      First, let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - West Virginia (WV) is located in the eastern part of the United States, in

      The key fact is that Kansas is clearly west of West Virginia in terms of geography.
      Kansas is in the central part of the country, while West Virginia is in the
      eastern part.


      So, 25701, WV would be EAST of 66217, KS (not west of it).</think>To determine

      - West Virginia is a state in the eastern part of the United States

      - Kansas is a state in the central part of the United States

      - Generally, states to the east have lower zip codes, and states to the west

      - 25701 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 66217 is in Kansas (KS)


      Geographically, Kansas is west of West Virginia. The United States generally
      runs from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west. West
      Virginia is closer to the Atlantic, while Kansas is more inland and further
      west.

      To solve this, I need to know the relative positions of West Virginia and Kansas
      in the United States.


      In the US, states are positioned as follows (going from east to west):

      - The East Coast states (including West Virginia) are in the eastern part of
      the country

      - The Midwest states (including Kansas) are in the central part of the country


      West Virginia is located in the Appalachian region in the eastern United States.

      Kansas is located in the Midwest/Great Plains region, significantly west of

      Therefore, West Virginia (and any zip code within it, including 25701) is east
      of Kansas (and any zip code within it, including 66217).


      Since West Virginia is east of Kansas, 25701, WV is east of 66217, KS.

      To determine this, I need to know the geographical positions of these zip codes.


      In the United States, generally:

      - Eastern states are on the right side of the map

      - Western states are on the left side of the map


      Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States.

      Kentucky (KY) is located inland, west of Virginia.


      So generally, locations in Kentucky tend to be west of locations in Virginia.
      However, the specific zip codes might be in unusual parts of their respective
      states, particularly if they''re near the border between the states.


      Virginia is entirely east of Kentucky. The two states don''t share a border
      - West Virginia separates them. So any location in Virginia would be east of
      any location in Kentucky.


      So if 24201 is in Virginia, and 42431 is in Kentucky, then 24201 must be east
      of 42431, not west.

      To solve this, I need to analyze the geographical relationship between these

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 24201 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 42431 is in Kentucky (KY)


      ## Step 2: Understand the geographical relationship between these states

      Virginia is located on the eastern side of the United States, while Kentucky
      is situated to the west of Virginia. In fact, Virginia doesn''t even directly
      border Kentucky - West Virginia sits between them.


      ## Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the zip codes

      Since all of Virginia is east of all of Kentucky, any zip code in Virginia (including
      24201) must be east of any zip code in Kentucky (including 42431).

      ## Step 1: Consider the general geographic relationship between Virginia and
      Kentucky

      Virginia is generally east of Kentucky on a US map. Kentucky borders Virginia''s
      western side.


      ## Step 2: Examine the specific zip codes

      - 24201 is in the Bristol area of Virginia, located in the far southwestern
      corner of the state

      - 42431 is in western Kentucky, roughly in the central-western portion of the
      state


      ## Step 3: Determine their relative positions

      While Virginia is mostly east of Kentucky, the westernmost parts of Virginia
      (where 24201 is) are actually east of the central and western portions of Kentucky
      (where 42431 is located).


      Kentucky extends further west than Virginia does, and zip code 42431 is in a
      part of Kentucky that is west of even the westernmost part of Virginia (24201).


      # NO


      24201, VA is NOT located west of 42431, KY. It is east of it.'
    42bd956e-8fe0-4269-a899-736ad3f4619c: '<think>I need to determine if the US zip
      code 24201 in Virginia (VA) is located west of the zip code 42431 in Kentucky
      (KY).


      To solve this, I''ll need to determine the approximate locations of these zip
      codes and compare their relative east-west positions.


      1) Let''s think about the general geography of Virginia and Kentucky:

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the US

      - Kentucky is inland, west of Virginia


      So generally, most of Kentucky is west of most of Virginia. But since we''re
      dealing with specific zip codes, I need to be more precise.


      2) Zip code 24201, VA:

      This is likely in western Virginia, since lower zip codes in VA tend to be in
      the western part of the state. Virginia zip codes generally start with 22, 23,
      and 24, with 24xxx being the western portion.


      3) Zip code 42431, KY:

      Kentucky zip codes generally start with 4, with 42xxx being in the western part
      of Kentucky.


      Since 24201 is in VA (which is east of KY) and 42431 is in KY (which is west
      of VA), the general trend would suggest that 24201, VA is EAST of 42431, KY,
      not west.


      However, Virginia has a western portion that extends quite far west, so I need
      to be careful. Without specific longitude coordinates, I can''t be 100% certain,
      but based on the state locations and zip code patterns, 24201 in VA is most
      likely EAST of 42431 in KY.</think># Determining if 24201, VA is west of 42431,
      KY


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' general positions

      - Virginia (VA) is located on the eastern side of the United States

      - Kentucky (KY) is located inland, generally west of Virginia


      ## Step 2: Analyze zip code patterns

      - Virginia zip codes start with 22-24, with 24xxx typically being in the western
      portion of Virginia

      - Kentucky zip codes start with 40-42, with 42xxx being in the eastern portion
      of Kentucky


      ## Step 3: Determine specific locations

      - 24201 is in the far southwestern corner of Virginia (likely Bristol area)

      - 42431 is in western Kentucky (likely Webster or Hopkins County)


      ## Step 4: Compare east-west positions

      Even though 24201 is in western Virginia, Kentucky as a whole lies west of Virginia.
      The eastern portion of Kentucky (where 42431 is located) is still west of the
      Virginia border.


      NO, 24201, VA is not located west of 42431, KY. It is east of it.'

      this question.


      The question asks whether 24201, VA is located west of 42431, KY.


      To determine this, I need to know the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      US zip codes generally follow some geographic patterns, with the first digit
      representing a large region of the US. However, I need to be more precise to
      answer this question correctly.


      In general:

      - Virginia (VA) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Kentucky (KY) is more inland and west of Virginia


      Based on general geography, Virginia is east of Kentucky, not west. So typically
      a location in VA would be east of a location in KY.


      But I should verify more specifically for these zip codes, since border areas
      could be exceptions.


      Zip code 24201 is in Bristol, Virginia, which is in the southwestern part of
      Virginia.

      Zip code 42431 is in Kentucky, likely in the eastern part of Kentucky.


      Virginia is generally east of Kentucky, and even the westernmost parts of Virginia
      tend to be east of most of Kentucky. So it''s likely that 24201, VA is east
      of 42431, KY, not west.</think># Is 24201, VA located west of 42431, KY?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 24201 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 42431 is in Kentucky (KY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship

      Virginia is located to the east of Kentucky on the US map. Kentucky borders
      Virginia on Virginia''s western side.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific zip code regions

      - Zip codes beginning with 242xx are in the western part of Virginia

      - Zip codes beginning with 424xx are in the western part of Kentucky


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Even though 24201 is in western Virginia, Virginia as a whole is east of Kentucky.
      The westernmost point of Virginia is still generally east of most of Kentucky,
      including its western regions where 42431 would be located.


      NO, 24201, VA is not located west of 42431, KY. It is located east of it.'

      to determine the geographic locations of these zip codes and compare them.


      24201 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).

      42431 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY).


      I need to determine if 24201, VA is located west of 42431, KY. This requires
      knowing their relative positions on the map.


      Virginia is generally located east of Kentucky. Kentucky is west of Virginia
      on a US map. This would suggest that 24201, VA would be east of 42431, KY, not
      west.


      However, I should be careful because specific zip codes near state borders might
      not follow the general state positioning. Let me reason more specifically about
      these zip codes.


      24201 is in the Bristol area of Virginia, which is in the southwestern part
      of Virginia, near the border with Tennessee.

      42431 is in Kentucky. I believe this is in the western or central part of Kentucky.


      Virginia''s westernmost areas are still generally east of most of Kentucky.
      Even Bristol, which is in southwestern VA, would typically be east of Kentucky
      zip codes.

      KY, not west of it.</think>I need to determine the geographic locations of these
      zip codes and compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both zip codes.

      - 24201 is a zip code in Bristol, Virginia (VA)

      - 42431 is a zip code in Hopkins County, Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Virginia and Kentucky.

      - Kentucky is positioned to the west of Virginia on the US map

      - Virginia borders Kentucky on Kentucky''s eastern side


      Step 3: Examine the specific locations of these zip codes.

      - 24201 (Bristol, VA) is located in the far southwestern part of Virginia

      - 42431 (Hopkins County, KY) is located in the western part of Kentucky


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Even though 24201 is in southwestern Virginia, it''s still east of most of
      Kentucky

      - Western Kentucky (where 42431 is located) is farther west than even the westernmost
      parts of Virginia

      to determine the geographical locations of these zip codes and then compare
      their longitudes to see which one is further west.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 32579, FL (Florida)

      - 77362, TX (Texas)


      Step 2: Generally speaking, Florida is in the southeastern US, while Texas is
      in the south-central/southwestern US. Texas is generally west of Florida.


      Step 3: But I need to be precise about these specific zip codes. Let me consider
      their relative positions:


      The first zip code (32579) is in Florida. Florida extends into the Gulf of Mexico
      as a peninsula, with its western part (the panhandle) extending along the Gulf
      Coast.


      The second zip code (77362) is in Texas. Texas is a large state that borders
      the Gulf of Mexico in the southeast and extends far to the west.


      The key question is whether this specific Florida zip code is in the western
      part of Florida (the panhandle) and whether it''s far enough west to be west
      of this specific Texas zip code, which might be in the eastern part of Texas.


      Without looking up the exact locations, I know that the westernmost part of
      Florida''s panhandle is indeed west of the easternmost parts of Texas. So it''s
      possible, depending on the exact locations.


      However, I need to know more specifically where these zip codes are located.
      Zip code 32579 is likely in the Florida panhandle, and 77362 is likely in eastern
      Texas, but I can''t be certain without more information.


      Let me use my knowledge of US geography. Florida''s panhandle zip codes often
      start with 32, while East Texas zip codes often start with 77. This suggests
      32579 is in the panhandle and 77362 is in East Texas.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s actually plausible that 32579, FL is west of
      77362, TX.</think># Is 32579, FL located west of 77362, TX?

      - 32579 is a zip code in Florida

      - 77362 is a zip code in Texas


      ## Step 2: Analyze their geographic positions

      - Zip code 32579 is located in the Florida Panhandle region, specifically in
      the northwestern part of Florida near the Gulf Coast

      - Zip code 77362 is located in southeastern Texas, in the eastern portion of
      the state


      ## Step 3: Compare their longitudes

      - The Florida Panhandle extends westward along the Gulf Coast

      - The westernmost parts of Florida are actually west of the easternmost parts
      of Texas

      - Zip code 32579 (in northwestern Florida) is indeed west of zip code 77362
      (in eastern Texas)

    024990b9-7813-484f-bafc-c94e3fed0889: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographical locations of the two zip codes and then compare
      their positions to see if 06250, CT is west of 17970, PA.


      First, let me identify what states these zip codes are in:

      - 06250 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 17970 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Now I need to think about the geographical relationship between these states
      and then the specific locations within them.


      Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, and Pennsylvania is
      also in the northeastern United States. Generally speaking, Connecticut is east
      of Pennsylvania, as Pennsylvania borders New Jersey to its east, and then New
      York, and then Connecticut.


      However, the question is about specific zip codes, so I need to be more precise.
      Let me think about where these zip codes might be located in their respective
      states:


      06250 is a zip code in Connecticut. Connecticut is a small state that lies entirely
      east of Pennsylvania.


      17970 is a zip code in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is west of Connecticut.


      Since Connecticut is entirely east of Pennsylvania, any location in Connecticut
      (including 06250) would be east of any location in Pennsylvania (including 17970),
      not west.


      Therefore, 06250, CT is not located west of 17970, PA. It is located east of
      it.</think>I need to determine whether the zip code 06250 in Connecticut is
      west of zip code 17970 in Pennsylvania.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic relationship between Connecticut (CT) and Pennsylvania
      (PA).

      Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, while Pennsylvania
      is also in the northeast but positioned west of Connecticut.


      Step 2: Think about the general orientation of these states.

      Pennsylvania shares its eastern border with New Jersey, which is followed by
      New York, and then Connecticut further east. The entire state of Connecticut
      lies east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Since 06250 is in Connecticut and 17970 is in Pennsylvania, and Connecticut
      is entirely east of Pennsylvania, the zip code in Connecticut must be east of
      the zip code in Pennsylvania, not west.

      east-west positions.


      1. 40219 is in Kentucky (KY)

      2. 62207 is in Illinois (IL)


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the US, locations
      further west have longer longitude values (when using negative numbers, they
      have smaller values).


      Looking at the general geography of the US:

      - Kentucky is generally east of Illinois

      - Illinois is on the Mississippi River, which forms part of its western border

      - Kentucky is southeast of Illinois


      Given these general geographical facts, I would expect that 40219, KY is east
      of 62207, IL, not west of it.


      Let me check more specifically. Zip code 40219 appears to be in Louisville,
      Kentucky, which is in the northern part of Kentucky along the Ohio River. Zip
      code 62207 appears to be near East St. Louis, Illinois, which is in the southwestern
      part of Illinois.


      Looking at the map of the US, Louisville, KY is definitely east of East St.

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 40219 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 62207 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is generally west of Kentucky

      - Illinois borders the Mississippi River on its western side

      - Kentucky is positioned to the southeast of Illinois


      Step 3: Get more specific about these zip codes.

      - 40219 appears to be in Louisville, Kentucky (northern Kentucky)

      - 62207 appears to be near East St. Louis, Illinois (southwestern Illinois)


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      Louisville, KY is east of East St. Louis, IL on a map. When looking at the United
      States, Illinois is west of Kentucky, not the other way around.


      NO, 40219, KY is not located west of 62207, IL. It''s located east of it.'

      whether 40219, KY (Kentucky) is located west of 62207, IL (Illinois).


      To solve this, I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these
      two ZIP codes.


      First, let me recall the general geography of Kentucky and Illinois:

      - Kentucky is south of Illinois

      - Illinois is generally west of Kentucky, especially in the southern parts


      Now, let''s think about these specific ZIP codes:

      - 40219 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 62207 is in Illinois (IL)


      To be more precise, I need to know where exactly these ZIP codes are located:

      - 40219 appears to be in the Louisville area of Kentucky, which is in the north-central
      part of the state

      - 62207 would be in southern Illinois


      Looking at a mental map, southern Illinois extends east of western Kentucky.
      Louisville is in the north-central part of Kentucky. Illinois is generally west
      and northwest of Kentucky, but parts of Kentucky can be west of parts of Illinois,
      especially when comparing western Kentucky to eastern Illinois.


      But without knowing the exact locations, I''m not completely certain. Let me
      consider what I know about US geography:


      Louisville (likely location of 40219) is in north-central Kentucky near the
      Indiana border. Southern Illinois (where 62207 likely is) is west of Kentucky.
      So most likely, 40219 is EAST of 62207, not west.</think># Is 40219, KY located
      west of 62207, IL?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 40219 is in Kentucky (KY), specifically in the Louisville area in the north-central
      part of the state

      - 62207 is in Illinois (IL), in the East St. Louis area in southwestern Illinois


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      - Illinois is generally west and northwest of Kentucky

      - However, due to the curved shape of the Mississippi River and state boundaries,
      some parts of Kentucky can be west of some parts of Illinois


      ## Step 3: Compare these specific locations

      - Louisville (40219) is in the north-central part of Kentucky

      - East St. Louis (62207) is in the southwestern tip of Illinois, near the Mississippi
      River

      - Looking at their positions on a map, Louisville is clearly east of East St.
      Louis

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 40219 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 62207 is in Illinois (IL)


      Now, I need to think about their east-west positioning. In the US:

      - Illinois is generally west of Kentucky

      - Kentucky is east of Illinois

      40219 is a ZIP code in Kentucky (KY).

      62207 is a ZIP code in Illinois (IL).


      Now I need to consider the relative positions of these states. Kentucky is generally
      south of Illinois. But the question is asking about east/west positioning.


      Illinois is typically west of Kentucky, with the Mississippi River forming part
      of the border between them. However, due to the curved nature of the river and
      state borders, some parts of Kentucky might be west of some parts of Illinois.


      For specific ZIP codes, I would need their exact locations. Without that specific
      data at hand, I''ll reason based on general state geography:


      Illinois is generally west of Kentucky. The western part of Kentucky touches
      the southeastern part of Illinois. So in general, a location in Kentucky would
      be east of a location in Illinois.


      However, Kentucky has a western portion that curves around and can be west of
      parts of southern Illinois. So I need to be careful.


      ZIP code 40219 appears to be in the Louisville area in north-central Kentucky.

      ZIP code 62207 appears to be in East St. Louis, which is in southwestern Illinois.


      Louisville is in the northern part of Kentucky, near the Indiana border. East

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      Illinois is generally west and northwest of Kentucky, with the Ohio River forming
      much of their border.


      Step 3: Locate the specific ZIP codes.

      - 40219 is in the Louisville area in north-central Kentucky

      - 62207 is in the East St. Louis area in southwestern Illinois


      Step 4: Compare their longitudes.

      East St. Louis (62207) sits on the western edge of Illinois, near the Mississippi
      River and the Missouri border, placing it quite far west in the state.

      Louisville (40219) is in the northern part of Kentucky, significantly east of

      (Georgia) is located west of 72207, AR (Arkansas).


      To figure this out, I need to consider the geographic locations of these states
      and zip codes. Let''s think about the general locations:


      - GA (Georgia) is a state in the southeastern United States

      - AR (Arkansas) is a state in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is west of Georgia. The continental United States
      has states arranged roughly so that moving west goes from the Atlantic Ocean
      (east coast) toward the Pacific Ocean (west coast).


      Georgia borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Arkansas is more inland
      and to the west.


      So if 30346 is in Georgia, and 72207 is in Arkansas, then 30346, GA would be
      EAST of 72207, AR - not west.


      To be thorough, let me make sure these are valid zip codes in the states I think
      they are:

      - 30346 is indeed a zip code in Georgia (likely in the Atlanta metro area)

      - 72207 is indeed a zip code in Arkansas (likely in or near Little Rock)


      The general geography of the US has Arkansas west of Georgia, so 30346, GA would
      be east of 72207, AR.</think>To determine if 30346, GA is located west of 72207,
      AR, I need to consider the geographical positions of these states and their
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 30346 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 72207 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States, west of the Mississippi
      River


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Looking at a US map, Arkansas is positioned to the west of Georgia

      - This means Georgia (where 30346 is located) is to the east of Arkansas (where
      72207 is located)


      Since 30346, GA is to the east of 72207, AR (not to the west), the answer is:


      NO'

      Let me think about the relative positions of Georgia and Arkansas within the
      United States:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States, west of the Mississippi

      Generally speaking, Arkansas is west of Georgia. The entire state of Georgia
      is east of Arkansas.


      Since 30346 is in Georgia, and 72207 is in Arkansas, then 30346 must be east
      of 72207, not west.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States, west of the Mississippi
      River


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      - Arkansas is clearly west of Georgia on a US map

      - All locations in Georgia (including zip code 30346) are east of Arkansas

      - All locations in Arkansas (including zip code 72207) are west of Georgia


      Therefore, 30346 in Georgia is EAST of 72207 in Arkansas, not west.

      To answer this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - 30346 is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United States

      - 72207 is in Arkansas (AR), which is in the south-central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Arkansas is generally west of Georgia. Georgia
      borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Arkansas is several states inland
      to the west.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, if we go from east to west, we would encounter:

      - The Atlantic Ocean

      - Georgia (and other eastern seaboard states)

      - Alabama

      - Mississippi

      - Arkansas (and other central states)

      - Then further western states


      So Georgia is east of Arkansas, which means that 30346, GA would be east of
      72207, AR, not west.</think>I need to determine if zip code 30346 in Georgia
      is located west of zip code 72207 in Arkansas.


      Step 1: Let me consider the general geographic positions of these states. Georgia
      (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, while Arkansas (AR) is in
      the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Looking at their relative positions on a map, Georgia is positioned
      on the Atlantic coast, while Arkansas is several states inland.


      Step 3: Moving from east to west across the southern United States, the order
      would be:

      - Atlantic Ocean

      - Georgia

      - Alabama

      - Mississippi

      - Arkansas

      - (then further western states)


      Step 4: Since Georgia is east of Arkansas on a map of the United States, zip
      code 30346 in Georgia would be east of zip code 72207 in Arkansas, not west.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States, west of the Mississippi
      River


      In terms of east-west orientation, Arkansas is generally west of Georgia. The
      entire state of Georgia is east of Arkansas.


      Since 30346 is in Georgia and 72207 is in Arkansas, and Georgia is east of Arkansas,
      this means that:

      30346, GA is located EAST of 72207, AR (not west).</think>To determine if 30346,
      GA is located west of 72207, AR, I need to consider the geographic positions

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States, west of the Mississippi
      River


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Arkansas is positioned to the west of Georgia

      - All of Georgia lies to the east of Arkansas


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 30346 is in Georgia and 72207 is in Arkansas, the zip code in Georgia

      First, I need to know which one is farther west. To do this, I need to consider

      Mississippi lies entirely east of Texas. Even the westernmost part of Mississippi

      2. 77340 is in Texas (TX)


      Generally speaking, Mississippi is east of Texas in the United States. Texas

      - 39530 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 77340 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' positions

      Mississippi is located east of Texas in the United States. This is a fundamental

      In the United States:

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern part of the country

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the country

      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 39530 is in MS (Mississippi)

      Therefore, 39530, MS is NOT located west of 77340, TX. It''s actually located
      east of it.</think>I need to determine if 39530, MS is located west of 77340,
      TX by looking at the geographical positions of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 39530 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 77340 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Mississippi and Texas.

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Looking at a map of the US, Mississippi is positioned to the EAST of Texas


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      - Since Mississippi is east of Texas, zip codes in Mississippi would generally
      be east of zip codes in Texas

      - Therefore, 39530 (MS) would be east of 77340 (TX), not west


      NO - 39530, MS is not located west of 77340, TX. It is located east of it.'

      (Mississippi) is located west of 77340, TX (Texas).


      First, let''s think about the geographic locations of Mississippi and Texas
      in the US. In general, Mississippi is located east of Texas. Texas is in the
      south-central part of the US, while Mississippi is in the southeastern part.


      However, I need to be specific about these particular zip codes since states
      can have irregular shapes and border areas might not follow the general east-west
      relationship.


      39530 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS).

      77340 is a zip code in Texas (TX).


      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      If the longitude of 39530, MS is greater (more negative in the Western Hemisphere)
      than the longitude of 77340, TX, then 39530 would be west of 77340.


      However, given that Mississippi is generally east of Texas, it''s likely that
      39530, MS is east of 77340, TX, not west.


      So my reasoning is:

      1. Texas is generally west of Mississippi

      2. Since 77340 is in Texas and 39530 is in Mississippi, it''s very likely that
      77340 is west of 39530

      3. Therefore, 39530, MS is likely NOT west of 77340, TX</think>To determine
      if 39530, MS is located west of 77340, TX, I need to consider the geographical
      positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 39530 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 77340 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states

      Mississippi is located to the east of Texas in the United States. Texas forms
      the western border of the Gulf Coast states, while Mississippi is further east
      along the Gulf Coast.


      Step 3: More specifically for these zip codes

      - 39530 is a zip code in the Biloxi/Gulfport area of Mississippi, on the Gulf
      Coast

      - 77340 is a zip code in Huntsville, Texas, which is in eastern Texas


      Step 4: Compare their positions

      Since Mississippi is entirely east of Texas, and these specific zip codes follow
      this general state positioning, 39530 (MS) must be east of 77340 (TX), not west
      of it.


      NO, 39530, MS is not located west of 77340, TX.'

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Illinois is significantly west of New Jersey

      - On a map of the United States, Illinois is to the west of New Jersey by several
      hundred miles


      Since 07070 is in New Jersey (east) and 60652 is in Illinois (west), the New

      Now I need to think about their geographical positions. In the United States:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the east coast

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest, significantly west of New Jersey


      Since New Jersey is on the east coast and Illinois is in the Midwest, New Jersey

      3. Determine which one is further west


      Let me work through this:


      Zip code 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is on the East Coast of the
      United States.


      Zip code 60652 is in Illinois (IL). Illinois is in the Midwest of the United
      States, significantly west of New Jersey.


      The continental United States generally follows a pattern where lower longitude
      numbers indicate more western locations. Since Illinois is west of New Jersey,
      zip code 60652 in Illinois would be west of zip code 07070 in New Jersey.

      - 60652 is in Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is significantly east of Illinois on the US map.

      - Illinois sits in the middle of the country, while New Jersey is on the Atlantic

      First, let''s recall the general geography of the United States:

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the East Coast


      Generally speaking, states on the East Coast like New Jersey are east of Midwestern
      states like Illinois. So New Jersey would be east of Illinois, not west.


      Since 07070 is in NJ and 60652 is in IL, the ZIP code in NJ (07070) would be
      east of the ZIP code in IL (60652), not west.

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter Illinois
      before reaching New Jersey

      - This means Illinois is west of New Jersey, and consequently, New Jersey is
      east of Illinois


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific ZIP codes

      Step 2: Recall the general geographic positions of Florida and Texas in the
      United States.

      Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States, on the east coast.

      Texas is in the south-central part of the United States, extending to the Gulf
      Coast.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning.

      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Florida is generally east of
      Texas. Texas extends further west than any part of Florida.


      Step 4: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Even without knowing the exact locations of these specific zip codes, I can
      use the general geographic knowledge that all of Florida is east of most of
      Texas, especially the parts of Texas that would have zip codes starting with
      77xxx, which would be in the eastern part of Texas.


      Therefore, 32129, FL would be east of 77012, TX, not west of it.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 32129 is in Florida (FL)

      - 77012 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Florida and Texas.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast.

      - Texas is in the south-central United States, extending from the center of
      the country to the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - All of Florida is east of most of Texas.

      - Texas extends much further west than any part of Florida.

      - Even the easternmost parts of Texas (which would include the Houston area
      where 77012 is located) are generally still east of Florida zip codes.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Florida is east of Texas, zip code 32129 in Florida must be east of
      zip code 77012 in Texas, not west of it.

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - All of Florida, including zip code 32129, lies east of Texas.

      located west of 38611, MS.


      To answer this, I need to know the relative east-west positioning of these locations.
      In the US, locations further west have higher longitude numbers.


      Let me think about the general geographical positions:

      - North Carolina (NC) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southern United States, west of North Carolina


      Generally speaking, Mississippi is west of North Carolina. This means that ZIP

      3. I need to determine if the NC location is west of the MS location


      To answer this, I need to know the relative positions of these states. The United

      (70647).


      To answer this, I need to determine the approximate geographical locations of
      these ZIP codes and compare their longitude.


      32095 is a ZIP code in Florida (FL). Florida is on the southeastern coast of
      the United States.

      70647 is a ZIP code in Louisiana (LA). Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast, west
      of Florida.


      In general, locations in Louisiana are west of locations in Florida because
      Louisiana is west of Florida in the United States. Looking at a mental map of
      the US:

      - Florida is in the southeastern corner of the US

      - Louisiana is along the Gulf Coast, to the west of Florida


      Since Louisiana is west of Florida, a ZIP code in Louisiana (70647) should be
      west of a ZIP code in Florida (32095), not the other way around.


      So 32095, FL should NOT be west of 70647, LA. Rather, 70647, LA should be west
      of 32095, FL.</think># Is 32095, FL located west of 70647, LA?

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 32095 is in Florida (FL)

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Louisiana is located along the Gulf Coast, west of Florida


      Step 3: Compare relative positions

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Louisiana is positioned to the
      west of Florida

      - Therefore, any location in Louisiana would generally be west of locations
      in Florida, not the other way around


      Step 4: Draw conclusion about the specific ZIP codes

      - Since 32095 is in Florida and 70647 is in Louisiana, the Florida ZIP code
      would be east of the Louisiana ZIP code

      to determine if the zip code 45342 in Ohio (OH) is located west of zip code
      61614 in Illinois (IL).


      First, I need to understand the general geographical relationship between Ohio
      and Illinois. Ohio is located east of Illinois in the United States. Illinois
      borders the Mississippi River on its western border, while Ohio is further east,
      bordered by Pennsylvania to its east.


      Since the question is asking about specific zip codes, let me be more precise:

      - 45342 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      - 61614 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      Given that Ohio as a state is east of Illinois as a state, generally any location
      in Ohio would be east of any location in Illinois. There might be some exceptions
      if we''re looking at the extreme western part of Ohio and the extreme eastern
      part of Illinois, but those would be edge cases.


      To be absolutely certain, I would need the exact coordinates of these zip codes,
      but the general geographic relationship between these states makes it very likely
      that 45342, OH is east of 61614, IL, not west.</think>I need to determine if
      zip code 45342 in Ohio is located west of zip code 61614 in Illinois.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic positions of Ohio and Illinois.

      Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region, while Illinois is
      located in the central Midwest.


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Illinois is positioned west of Ohio. The entire state of Ohio lies east of Illinois.


      Step 3: Since these zip codes are within their respective states, I can determine
      their relative positions.

      Zip code 45342 is in Ohio, which is east of Illinois.

      Zip code 61614 is in Illinois, which is west of Ohio.


      Step 4: Therefore, 45342 in Ohio cannot be west of 61614 in Illinois, because
      Ohio is east of Illinois.

      if one zip code location is west of another. Let me break this down:


      1. 45342, OH - This is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      2. 61614, IL - This is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      I need to figure out their relative east-west positions. For US geography, I
      know that Illinois (IL) is generally west of Ohio (OH). The states are arranged
      with Ohio being closer to the East Coast and Illinois being closer to the middle
      of the country.


      So generally speaking, locations in Ohio would be EAST of locations in Illinois,
      not west.


      Therefore, 45342, OH would be EAST of 61614, IL, not west of it.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 45342 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 61614 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      In the United States, Illinois is located west of Ohio. Ohio borders the eastern
      part of the United States, while Illinois is more centrally located.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      Since Ohio is east of Illinois, a zip code in Ohio (45342) would be east of
      a zip code in Illinois (61614), not west of it.

      if one US zip code location is west of another.


      Let me identify these locations:

      - 01719, MA (Massachusetts)

      - 49009, MI (Michigan)


      To answer this, I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these
      locations. On a US map, Massachusetts is on the east coast, while Michigan is
      in the Midwest.


      Massachusetts is significantly east of Michigan. The entire state of Massachusetts
      is east of Michigan on the US map.


      Given that 01719 is in Massachusetts and 49009 is in Michigan, the location

      I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 01719 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 49009 is in Michigan (MI)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographical positions of these states

      - Massachusetts is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      Massachusetts is significantly east of Michigan on the US map. The easternmost
      point of Michigan is still west of the westernmost point of Massachusetts.


      ## Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes

      Since 01719 is in Massachusetts and 49009 is in Michigan, the zip code 01719
      must be east of zip code 49009, not west of it.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Massachusetts is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      Michigan is located in the Midwest region, significantly west of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Since Massachusetts is on the East Coast and Michigan is in the Midwest, Massachusetts
      is east of Michigan, not west of it.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      Since 01719 is in Massachusetts and 49009 is in Michigan, the Massachusetts

      west of 77388, TX, I need to:


      1. Find the geographical location (longitude and latitude) of 70712, LA

      2. Find the geographical location of 77388, TX

      3. Compare their longitudes - if the longitude of 70712, LA is greater (more
      negative in the Western hemisphere), then it''s west of 77388, TX


      Let me think about the general locations:

      - LA is Louisiana, which is generally east of Texas

      - Texas (TX) is west of Louisiana


      In the US, locations further west have larger negative longitude values. So
      if LA is east of TX, then 70712, LA would have a smaller negative longitude
      (or be closer to 0) than 77388, TX.


      Based on general geography knowledge:

      - Louisiana (LA) is east of Texas (TX)

      - 70712 is a zip code in Louisiana

      - 77388 is a zip code in Texas


      So 70712, LA should be EAST of 77388, TX, not west of it.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Louisiana is located to the east of Texas. This is a fundamental geographic
      fact about the United States - Texas forms the western border of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Determine if there could be any exceptions based on the specific zip
      codes.

      While some states have complex shapes that could create exceptions, Louisiana
      and Texas have a relatively straight north-south border. Zip codes in Louisiana
      (starting with 70xxx) will be east of zip codes in Texas (starting with 77xxx).


      Step 4: Make the conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since 70712 is in Louisiana, and 77388 is in Texas, and Louisiana is east of
      Texas, the Louisiana zip code must be east of the Texas zip code, not west.

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 77388 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Louisiana and Texas share a border, with Louisiana positioned to the east of

      Step 3: While specific zip codes might have some variation, the general state
      positions are clear.

      Since 70712 is in Louisiana and 77388 is in Texas, and Louisiana is east of
      Texas, the Louisiana zip code would be east of the Texas zip code, not west.

      longitude value than locations that are east.


      Let me think about the states first:

      - LA is Louisiana, which is east of Texas (TX)

      - TX is Texas, which is west of Louisiana


      In general, Louisiana is east of Texas. However, I need to check the specific
      zip codes to be sure, as state borders aren''t perfect east-west lines.


      Zip code 70712 is in Louisiana. Louisiana is generally in the southeastern US.

      Zip code 77388 is in Texas. Texas is generally in the south-central US.


      Based on general geography, it''s likely that 70712, LA is east of 77388, TX,
      not west of it. But let me think more carefully.


      Texas is west of Louisiana along most of their border. There are some parts
      of Louisiana that might be west of some eastern parts of Texas, but those would
      be special cases. Looking at zip codes:


      70712 is likely in western Louisiana, since Louisiana zip codes generally start
      with 70-71.

      77388 is likely in eastern Texas, since Texas has multiple zip code ranges including
      75-79.


      Even with these considerations, it''s still most likely that 70712, LA is east
      of 77388, TX, not west of it.</think># Is 70712, LA located west of 77388, TX?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 77388 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Louisiana is located to the east of Texas in the United States. They share a
      border, with Texas on the west side and Louisiana on the east side.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific zip code locations

      - 70712 (LA) is likely in the western part of Louisiana, as Louisiana zip codes
      generally start with 70-71

      - 77388 (TX) is likely in the eastern part of Texas, based on its zip code pattern


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      Even though 70712 may be in western Louisiana and 77388 may be in eastern Texas,
      the state border geography still places Louisiana east of Texas. The easternmost
      parts of Texas are still west of the westernmost parts of Louisiana (with very
      few exceptions in their irregular border regions).

      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - GA is Georgia, which is in the southeastern United States

      - OK is Oklahoma, which is in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Oklahoma. The entire state of Georgia
      is east of Oklahoma.


      ZIP code 30534 is in Georgia, so it would be east of Oklahoma.

      ZIP code 73142 is in Oklahoma.

      To answer this, I need to determine the relative positions of these two places
      on a map of the United States.


      First, let me recall the general geography of the United States:

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Georgia is on the eastern side of the country, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Oklahoma is more centrally located, west of Georgia


      Since the question asks if 30534, GA is west of 73142, OK, I need to determine

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central United States


      Step 2: Consider their east-west positioning.

      - Georgia is positioned along the eastern side of the country, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean

      - Oklahoma is positioned more centrally in the country, well to the west of
      Georgia


      Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - Zip code 30534 is in Georgia, which is in the eastern part of the US

      - Zip code 73142 is in Oklahoma, which is more centrally located and west of

      - 30534, GA: This is in Georgia (GA)

      - 73142, OK: This is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Now, let''s think about the general geographic locations of these states:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is west of Georgia. The continental United States
      spans from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west.
      Georgia borders the Atlantic Ocean, while Oklahoma is much further inland toward
      the center of the country.


      Since 30534 is in Georgia and 73142 is in Oklahoma, and Georgia is east of Oklahoma,
      30534 GA must be east of 73142 OK, not west of it.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      31636 is a zip code in Georgia (GA).

      70062 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA).


      Step 2: Think about the general geography of the United States.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the United States.

      Louisiana is also in the southeastern US, but is west of Georgia.


      Step 3: More specifically, Georgia borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern
      side, while Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico to its south. Louisiana is
      definitely west of Georgia.


      Step 4: Since we''re comparing specific zip codes, I should be more precise.
      However, the general relationship holds - any zip code in Georgia will be east
      of any zip code in Louisiana because the entire state of Georgia is east of

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast.

      Louisiana is also in the southeastern US, but is positioned to the west of Georgia,

      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since Georgia as a whole is east of Louisiana, zip codes in Georgia will be
      east of zip codes in Louisiana. The specific zip codes don''t change this general
      geographic relationship.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 18951 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 47803 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the eastern part of the United States, while Indiana
      is in the Midwest.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      On a map of the United States, Indiana is positioned to the west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the zip codes.

      Since 18951 is in Pennsylvania (which is east of Indiana), and 47803 is in Indiana
      (which is west of Pennsylvania), zip code 18951 cannot be west of zip code 47803.

      1. I need to determine if zip code 18951 in Pennsylvania (PA) is located west
      of zip code 47803 in Indiana (IN).


      2. First, I need to recall the general geographical positions of these states.
      Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern United States, while Indiana
      (IN) is in the Midwest.


      3. Generally, Indiana is west of Pennsylvania. The continental United States
      has states arranged roughly with eastern states on the Atlantic coast (like
      Pennsylvania) and moving westward through the Midwest (including Indiana) toward
      the Pacific coast.


      4. Since Indiana as a state is west of Pennsylvania as a state, it''s very likely
      that any location in Indiana would be west of any location in Pennsylvania.


      5. Therefore, zip code 47803 in Indiana should be west of zip code 18951 in
      Pennsylvania.


      6. This means that 18951, PA is NOT located west of 47803, IN. Rather, it''s
      east of it.</think># Determining if 18951, PA is west of 47803, IN


      To solve this problem, I need to consider the geographic locations of Pennsylvania
      (PA) and Indiana (IN).


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, while Indiana is
      in the Midwest.


      ## Step 2: Compare east-west positioning

      Looking at a US map, Indiana is clearly west of Pennsylvania. The entire state
      of Indiana lies west of the entire state of Pennsylvania.


      ## Step 3: Apply to specific zip codes

      Since 18951 is in Pennsylvania and 47803 is in Indiana, the geographic relationship
      between the states applies to these zip codes as well.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 18951, PA is NOT located west of 47803, IN. It is located east of it.'

      18951 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).

      47803 is a zip code in Indiana (IN).


      Now I need to consider the relative positions of these states. The United States
      generally has states arranged where eastern states are on the right side of
      the map, and western states are on the left side of the map.


      Pennsylvania is an eastern state, located on the east coast.

      Indiana is in the Midwest, west of Pennsylvania.


      So generally speaking, locations in Indiana would be west of locations in Pennsylvania.


      Since 18951 is in Pennsylvania (an eastern state) and 47803 is in Indiana (a
      midwestern state that is west of Pennsylvania), 18951 is NOT west of 47803.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - Looking at a US map, Indiana is clearly west of Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, any location in Indiana would generally be west of any location

      if 18951, PA (Pennsylvania) is located west of 47803, IN (Indiana).


      To answer this, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      locations. In the US, states tend to be arranged with lower numbers on the east
      coast and higher numbers on the west coast in the general zip code distribution.


      Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the eastern part of the United States, while
      Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest. Generally speaking, Indiana is west
      of Pennsylvania.


      If we look at a map of the United States going from east to west, the ordering
      would roughly be:

      - Eastern Seaboard (including Pennsylvania)

      - Midwest (including Indiana)

      - Western states


      So based on the states alone, Pennsylvania is east of Indiana, which means Indiana
      is west of Pennsylvania. Therefore, 18951, PA would be east of 47803, IN, not
      west of it.</think>I need to determine if 18951, PA is west of 47803, IN by

      - 47803 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the eastern United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest, west of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Consider the relative positions.

      The entire state of Pennsylvania is east of Indiana on a U.S. map. Since 18951
      is in Pennsylvania and 47803 is in Indiana, the Pennsylvania zip code must be
      east of the Indiana zip code.


      Therefore, 18951, PA is NOT west of 47803, IN. It is east of it.

      Now, without knowing the exact locations of these zip codes within their states,
      I can still be confident that any zip code in Pennsylvania will be east of any
      zip code in Indiana, because the entirety of Pennsylvania is east of Indiana.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Indiana is clearly west of Pennsylvania.
      The entire state of Indiana lies west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Apply this to the zip codes.

      Since 18951 is in Pennsylvania and 47803 is in Indiana, and Pennsylvania is

      west of 15690, PA, I need to:


      1. Find the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their east-west positions (longitude)


      Let me recall what I know about US zip codes:

      - Lower zip codes generally correspond to the eastern United States

      - Higher zip codes generally correspond to the western and central United States


      Looking at the two zip codes:

      - 11783 is in New York (NY)

      - 15690 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Geographically, New York is generally east of Pennsylvania. Additionally, the
      lower zip code (11783) is likely to be more easterly than the higher zip code
      (15690).


      The first digit in US zip codes roughly divides the country from east to west:

      - 0-1: Northeast

      - 2: Mid-Atlantic

      - 3: Southeast

      - 4-5: Midwest

      - 6-7: Central/South

      - 8-9: West


      Both zip codes start with the digit 1, which puts them both in the Northeast
      region. But since 11783 starts with "117" and 15690 starts with "156", the 11783
      zip code is likely to be farther east.


      Also, New York is generally located east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United
      States. So 11783, NY is likely east of 15690, PA, not west.</think>I need to
      determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 11783 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 15690 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between NY and PA.

      New York state is generally located to the east of Pennsylvania on the US map.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      US zip codes are roughly organized geographically, with lower numbers typically
      in the eastern US and higher numbers moving westward. The first digits "11"
      for the NY zip code versus "15" for the PA zip code support this geographic
      arrangement.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on both state locations and zip code patterns.

      Since 11783 is in NY (which is east of PA) and has a lower zip code number than
      15690 in PA, the NY location would be east of the PA location, not west.

      Let me think about the general geography of New York (NY) and Pennsylvania (PA):

      - Pennsylvania is west of New York (when considering the main land masses of
      these states)

      - New York ZIP codes often start with 1, with lower numbers typically in the
      NYC area (east)

      - Pennsylvania ZIP codes often start with 1 or 2, with the state being entirely
      west of most of New York


      For 11783 in NY:

      - The "117xx" range is typically in Long Island, NY area

      - Long Island is in the eastern part of New York State


      For 15690 in PA:

      - The "156xx" range would be in western Pennsylvania


      Given that Pennsylvania is generally west of New York, and specifically Long
      Island (where 11783 is likely located) is on the eastern edge of New York, while
      15690 would be in western Pennsylvania, it''s very likely that 11783, NY is

      First, let me think about the general geographic locations of these states:

      - Virginia (VA) is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest


      In terms of east-west positioning, Illinois is generally west of Virginia. The

      Now, let''s confirm this by thinking about the specific zip codes:

      - 20121 is in VA (Virginia)

      - 62204 is in IL (Illinois)


      Since Virginia is east of Illinois, and these zip codes are in their respective

      west of 62204, IL, I need to:


      1. Identify where these zip codes are located

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions


      20121 is a zip code in Virginia (VA). Virginia is a state on the east coast
      of the United States.


      62204 is a zip code in Illinois (IL). Illinois is a state in the Midwest region
      of the United States.


      When looking at a map of the United States, Illinois is clearly west of Virginia.
      The United States generally has states arranged from east (Atlantic coast) to
      west (Pacific coast). Virginia is on the Atlantic coast, while Illinois is in
      the interior of the country, west of Virginia.


      Since 20121 is in Virginia, and 62204 is in Illinois, and Illinois is west of
      Virginia, that means 20121, VA is EAST of 62204, IL (not west of it).

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region, which is west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Since Illinois is west of Virginia, zip code 62204 in Illinois is west of zip
      code 20121 in Virginia.

      Therefore, 20121, VA is EAST of 62204, IL (not west of it).

      3. Compare their longitudes - places with more western locations have higher

      02790 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA). Massachusetts is a state in the northeastern
      United States.

      44030 is a zip code in Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the midwestern United States.


      Geographically, Massachusetts is located on the east coast of the United States,

      So the general geographic relationship is that Ohio is west of Massachusetts.
      This means that 44030, OH would generally be west of 02790, MA.


      Wait, I made a mistake. Places with more western locations have LOWER longitude

      - 44030, OH (Ohio)


      Now I need to think about their relative positions. The United States generally
      has lower zip codes in the eastern parts of the country and higher zip codes
      as you move west.


      Massachusetts (MA) is a state on the east coast of the United States. Ohio (OH)

      which of these zip codes has a more westerly position.


      Geographically, Ohio is west of Massachusetts. The entire state of Ohio is west
      of the entire state of Massachusetts.


      Since 02790 is in Massachusetts and 44030 is in Ohio, it follows that 02790,

      coast.

      Ohio is located in the midwestern United States, significantly inland from the

      west of 30354, GA, I need to find the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      29405 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      30354 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      To determine which is further west, I need to compare their longitudes. Western
      locations have larger negative longitudes (or smaller positive longitudes) in
      the Western hemisphere.


      South Carolina is generally located to the east of Georgia on the US map. Georgia
      borders the Atlantic Ocean, and South Carolina is to its northeast, also bordering
      the Atlantic.


      Looking more specifically at these zip codes:

      - 29405 appears to be in the Charleston area of South Carolina

      - 30354 appears to be in the Atlanta area of Georgia


      Charleston, SC is located on the Atlantic coast, while Atlanta, GA is inland
      and further west.


      Therefore, 29405, SC (Charleston area) should be EAST of 30354, GA (Atlanta
      area), not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 29405 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      - 30354 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      South Carolina is positioned to the east of Georgia on the US map.


      Step 3: Examine the specific zip codes.

      - 29405 is in the Charleston area of South Carolina, which is on the Atlantic
      coast

      - 30354 is in the Atlanta area of Georgia, which is inland


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Charleston (29405) is located on the eastern side of South Carolina near the
      coast, while Atlanta (30354) is in the northern central part of Georgia. Looking
      at their positions on a map, Charleston is clearly east of Atlanta.

      To solve this problem, I need to determine the locations of these zip codes
      and then compare their longitudes. Locations further west have lower (more negative)
      longitudes in the Western Hemisphere.


      Let me think about the general geography of SC and GA:

      - South Carolina is generally east of Georgia (GA is west of SC)

      - Georgia is on the Atlantic coast but South Carolina is even more directly
      on the Atlantic coast


      However, the specific zip codes might have a different relationship than the
      general state positions. Let me think about what these zip codes might be:


      29405 is in SC - this is likely in the eastern or central part of South Carolina

      30354 is in GA - this is likely in the eastern or central part of Georgia


      Looking at these zip codes more carefully:

      - 29xxx zip codes are typically in South Carolina

      - 30xxx zip codes are typically in Georgia, often in the Atlanta area


      29405 is likely in the Charleston area of South Carolina (eastern SC)

      30354 is likely in the Atlanta area of Georgia (northern central GA)


      If my geographic knowledge is correct, Charleston is east of Atlanta. So 29405
      (SC) would be east of 30354 (GA), not west.


      Therefore, 29405, SC is NOT located west of 30354, GA.</think># Is 29405, SC

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 29405 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      - 30354 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      ## Step 2: Analyze the geographic relationship

      - South Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast, east of Georgia

      - Georgia is west of South Carolina

      - Zip code 29405 is in the Charleston area of South Carolina (eastern SC)

      - Zip code 30354 is in the Atlanta area of Georgia (central GA)


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      - Charleston, SC (29405) is located to the east of Atlanta, GA (30354)

      - Moving from Atlanta to Charleston, you would travel eastward, not westward

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 29405 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      - 30354 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      To determine which is further west, I need to know their relative geographical
      positions. In the US, lower longitude numbers represent locations further west.


      South Carolina (SC) is generally located to the east of Georgia (GA) on the
      US map. Georgia borders the Atlantic Ocean, but South Carolina is even further
      east and also borders the Atlantic.


      So in general, locations in SC tend to be east of locations in GA, not west.


      Let''s consider the specific zip codes though:

      - 29405 appears to be in the Charleston area of South Carolina

      - 30354 appears to be in the Atlanta area of Georgia


      Charleston, SC is in the eastern part of South Carolina, close to the Atlantic
      coast.

      Atlanta, GA is in the northern part of Georgia, not on the coast but more inland.

      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 29405 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 30354 is in Georgia (GA)


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to figure out their geographical
      locations.


      South Carolina is generally located to the east of Georgia on the US map. Georgia
      borders the Atlantic Ocean, and South Carolina is to its northeast.


      However, zip codes near the border could have different relationships, so I

      29405 appears to be in the Charleston area of South Carolina, which is in the
      eastern part of the state along the Atlantic coast.


      30354 appears to be in the Atlanta area of Georgia, which is in the north-central
      part of the state.


      If we look at the general geography, Charleston (29405) is east of Atlanta (30354).
      Charleston is near the Atlantic coast, while Atlanta is more inland.


      So 29405 in SC would be EAST of 30354 in GA, not west.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.

      - 29405 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 30354 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Find the specific locations of these zip codes.

      - 29405 is in the Charleston area of South Carolina, which is on the eastern
      coast

      - 30354 is in the Atlanta area of Georgia, which is more inland


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Georgia generally lies to the west of South Carolina

      - Specifically, Atlanta (30354) is west of Charleston (29405)

      - Looking at a map confirms that Charleston is closer to the Atlantic coast,
      while Atlanta is more inland

      in South Carolina (SC) is located west of ZIP code 30354 in Georgia (GA).


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these ZIP codes

      2. Determine their east-west relationship


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - SC (South Carolina) is generally east of GA (Georgia)

      - Georgia is on the Atlantic coast, but west of South Carolina


      Now for the specific ZIP codes:

      - 29405 is in SC

      - 30354 is in GA


      Generally, ZIP codes in the eastern US follow a pattern where lower numbers
      tend to be more eastern. The first 3 digits of the ZIP code represent the sectional
      center facility.

      - 294xx is in South Carolina

      - 303xx is in Georgia


      Based on the standard ZIP code allocation, ZIP codes starting with 29 would
      typically be east of ZIP codes starting with 30. Since 29405 starts with 29
      and 30354 starts with 30, this suggests 29405 is east of 30354.


      Additionally, South Carolina is generally east of Georgia on the US map, which
      further supports this conclusion.</think># Determining if 29405, SC is west

      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions

      South Carolina (SC) is located on the Atlantic coast, and Georgia (GA) is directly
      to the west of South Carolina. The states share a border with Georgia being
      west of South Carolina.


      ## Step 2: Analyze the ZIP code numbering pattern

      In the US ZIP code system, generally lower numbers are assigned to areas further
      east (though there are exceptions to this pattern).

      - 29405 starts with 294 (South Carolina)

      - 30354 starts with 303 (Georgia)


      ## Step 3: Determine the specific locations

      29405 is in the Charleston area of South Carolina.

      30354 is in the Atlanta area of Georgia.


      Charleston is in eastern South Carolina, while Atlanta is in north-central Georgia.
      Looking at a map, Charleston is clearly east of Atlanta.

      1. Identify the location of 07432, NJ

      2. Identify the location of 15139, PA

      3. Compare their east-west positions (longitudes)


      Let me think about US zip code geography:


      07xxx zip codes are in New Jersey, which is on the east coast.

      15xxx zip codes are in Pennsylvania, which is also on the east coast but slightly
      more inland than New Jersey.


      Specifically:

      - 07432 is likely in northern New Jersey

      - 15139 is likely in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh


      Pennsylvania is generally west of New Jersey. So a Pennsylvania zip code would
      typically be west of a New Jersey zip code.


      However, Pennsylvania wraps around New Jersey on the north, so we need to be
      careful. But 15xxx codes are in western Pennsylvania, not the northern part
      that''s east of New Jersey.


      So 07432, NJ would be east of 15139, PA (not west).</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations.

      - 07432 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located inland, directly west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - 07xxx zip codes are in northern/eastern New Jersey

      - 15xxx zip codes are in western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area)


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Western Pennsylvania (where 15139 is located) is clearly west of northern New
      Jersey (where 07432 is located).


      NO, 07432, NJ is NOT located west of 15139, PA. It''s actually east of it.'

      - 15139 is a ZIP code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of NJ and PA.

      Pennsylvania is generally west of New Jersey. New Jersey is on the Atlantic
      coast, while Pennsylvania is inland from New Jersey.


      Step 3: But I need to be more specific about these particular ZIP codes.

      - 07432 appears to be in the northern part of New Jersey (since NJ ZIP codes
      starting with 0 are typically in the northern part of the state)

      - 15139 appears to be in western Pennsylvania (PA ZIP codes starting with 15
      are typically in the western part of the state, around Pittsburgh)


      Step 4: Considering the specific locations:

      If 15139 is in western PA, and 07432 is in northern NJ, then 15139 would be
      west of 07432, not the other way around.

      - 15139 is a ZIP code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between NJ and PA.

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is inland and
      to the west of New Jersey. This means that generally, locations in New Jersey
      are east of locations in Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Look at the specific ZIP codes.

      - The 074xx ZIP codes are in northern New Jersey

      - The 151xx ZIP codes are in western Pennsylvania (around the Pittsburgh area)


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions.

      - 15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Think about the general geography of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

      New Jersey is on the eastern coast of the United States.

      Pennsylvania is immediately west of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Consider the first digits of the zip codes.

      - Zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern

    fc5c52c0-30d3-4dc5-9850-e3b94594c617: '<think>Let me break down this question:


      1. We have two zip codes: 06770, CT and 46617, IN.

      2. We need to determine if 06770, CT is located west of 46617, IN.


      To solve this, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      06770 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT).

      46617 is a zip code in Indiana (IN).


      Now I need to determine their relative positions on the map. In the US, states
      are positioned as follows from west to east:

      - Western states (e.g., California, Oregon, Washington)

      - Mountain states (e.g., Colorado, Utah)

      - Midwestern states (e.g., Indiana, Illinois)

      - Eastern states (e.g., Connecticut, New York)


      Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest, while Connecticut (CT) is on the East Coast.


      Since Connecticut is on the East Coast and Indiana is in the Midwest, Connecticut
      is EAST of Indiana, not west of it.


      So, 06770, CT is NOT located west of 46617, IN. It''s located EAST of it.</think>#
      Is 06770, CT located west of 46617, IN?


      To answer this question, I need to identify the geographical locations of these
      zip codes and determine their east-west relationship.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 06770 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 46617 is in Indiana (IN)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographical positions

      Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Indiana
      is in the Midwest region.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter Indiana
      before reaching Connecticut. In other words, Indiana is west of Connecticut,
      which means Connecticut is east of Indiana.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 06770, CT is not located west of 46617, IN. It is located east of it.'

      is located west of 43160, OH.


      First, let me figure out what these zip codes correspond to:

      - 22150 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 43160 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of Virginia and Ohio. The United
      States has Virginia on the east coast, while Ohio is more inland but still in
      the eastern part of the country.


      Specifically:

      - Virginia is located east of Ohio

      - Ohio is located west of Virginia


      Since Virginia is east of Ohio, and 22150 is in Virginia while 43160 is in Ohio,

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 43160 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Determine geographic positions

      Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Ohio is located
      inland but still in the eastern portion of the country.


      ## Step 3: Compare positions

      Looking at a map of the United States, Virginia is positioned to the east of
      Ohio. The entire state of Virginia lies east of Ohio.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since 22150 is in Virginia, and Virginia is east of Ohio (where 43160 is located),
      the zip code 22150 must be east of 43160, not west.

      03303 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH), which is a state in the northeastern
      United States.

      49337 is a zip code in Michigan (MI), which is a state in the midwestern United
      States.


      Generally speaking, states in the Northeast (like New Hampshire) are east of
      states in the Midwest (like Michigan). To be more precise, I can think about
      their relative positions on the map of the United States.


      Michigan is bordered by Wisconsin to the west, Indiana and Ohio to the south,
      and the Great Lakes. New Hampshire is in New England, bordered by Maine to the
      east, Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, and Canada to the north.


      When looking at a map of the US, Michigan is definitely west of New Hampshire.
      This means that zip code 49337 in Michigan would be west of zip code 03303 in

      Is 19363, PA located west of 26330, WV?


      I''ll analyze this step by step by examining the geographic positions of these
      zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 26330 is in West Virginia (WV)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship

      Pennsylvania is located east of West Virginia on the US map. West Virginia borders
      the western part of Pennsylvania.


      ## Step 3: Analyze zip code patterns

      - Lower zip codes (10000-19999) in the northeastern US typically indicate more
      eastern locations

      - Higher zip codes (20000-29999) in this region typically indicate more western/southern
      locations


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      19363 is a lower zip code in eastern Pennsylvania, while 26330 is a higher zip
      code in West Virginia. Based on both the state locations and zip code patterns,
      19363 PA would be east of 26330 WV, not west of it.


      ## Answer: NO'
    25dc3b72-b809-4f02-a9ed-6efa402c9210: '<think>To determine if 19363, PA is located
      west of 26330, WV, I need to:


      1. Identify where 19363, PA is located

      2. Identify where 26330, WV is located

      3. Compare their longitudes (east-west positions)


      If the longitude of 19363, PA is less (more negative or less positive) than
      the longitude of 26330, WV, then 19363, PA is west of 26330, WV.


      I''ll try to recall the general locations of these zip codes:


      19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is in the northeastern US. The first
      digit "1" in zip codes typically represents the northeast region.


      26330 is in West Virginia (WV). West Virginia is also in the eastern US, but
      slightly to the west of Pennsylvania. The first digit "2" in zip codes typically
      represents mid-Atlantic states.


      Based on the general geography of the US, Pennsylvania is east of West Virginia,
      not west of it. West Virginia literally has "West" in its name because it is
      west of Virginia, and Pennsylvania is east of both.


      So my initial assessment is that 19363, PA is likely EAST of 26330, WV, not
      west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two zip codes.


      Step 1: Let me identify the general locations.

      - 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 26330 is in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, while West Virginia
      is positioned to the southwest of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Analyze the spatial relationship.

      Pennsylvania shares its western border with Ohio, and its southwestern border
      with West Virginia. This means that generally, West Virginia is west of Pennsylvania,
      not east of it.


      Step 4: Look at the zip code patterns.

      The first digit of zip codes generally follows a pattern from east (lower numbers)
      to west (higher numbers). 19xxx (PA) has a lower first digit than 26xxx (WV),
      which supports that Pennsylvania zip codes are typically east of West Virginia
      zip codes.


      NO (19363, PA is not located west of 26330, WV; it is east of it)'
    5c3aa799-f4c9-4e92-a416-4bbc4aa30648: '<think>This question asks if 19363, PA
      (Pennsylvania) is located west of 26330, WV (West Virginia).


      To solve this, I need to determine the geographic locations of these zip codes
      and compare their east-west positioning.


      First, let me think about the general geographic relationship between Pennsylvania
      and West Virginia. Pennsylvania is generally east of West Virginia. However,
      Pennsylvania is quite large, and we need to check the specific zip codes.


      Let''s analyze the zip codes:

      - 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 26330 is in West Virginia (WV)


      In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to
      be in the eastern part of the country, and higher numbers tend to be in the
      western part. East Coast zip codes often start with lower digits (0, 1, 2) while
      West Coast zip codes start with higher digits (8, 9).


      Since 19363 starts with "19" and 26330 starts with "26", that suggests that
      19363 might be further east, because lower numbers typically indicate more eastern
      locations.


      19363 is in the "193xx" range, which is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.

      26330 is in the "263xx" range, which is in West Virginia.


      Based on the zip code numbering pattern, 19363 PA is likely east of 26330 WV,
      not west of it.</think># Is 19363, PA located west of 26330, WV?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Understand zip code geography

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      tend to be assigned to the eastern regions of the country, while higher numbers
      are assigned to western regions.


      ## Step 2: Compare the zip codes

      - 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 26330 is in West Virginia (WV)


      Since 19363 has a lower number than 26330, this suggests that 19363 is likely
      further east.


      ## Step 3: Consider state positions

      Pennsylvania is generally located east of West Virginia on the US map, which
      reinforces the conclusion from the zip code pattern.


      ## Step 4: Reach conclusion

      19363, PA is almost certainly located east of 26330, WV - not west of it.

    7183f896-e51e-4862-8992-74778c5a9b97: '<think>I need to determine whether zip
      code 19363 in Pennsylvania is located west of zip code 26330 in West Virginia.


      Step 1: Let me think about the general geography of Pennsylvania (PA) and West
      Virginia (WV). Pennsylvania is generally east of West Virginia on the US map.


      Step 2: However, I need to be precise about these specific zip codes, since
      states can have irregular shapes and some parts of PA could potentially be west
      of some parts of WV.


      Step 3: US zip codes generally increase from east to west, with lower numbers
      in the eastern US and higher numbers in the western US. So, just based on the
      zip code numbers:

      - 19363 (PA) is a lower number than 26330 (WV)

      - This suggests that 19363 is likely east of 26330, not west of it


      Step 4: Additionally, PA zip codes typically start with 15-19, with 19xxx being
      in the eastern part of PA. West Virginia zip codes typically start with 24-26,
      with 26xxx being in the northern/eastern parts of WV.


      Based on this analysis, 19363 (PA) is very likely east of 26330 (WV), not west
      of it.</think>To determine if 19363, PA is located west of 26330, WV, I need
      to analyze the geographical positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Pennsylvania (PA) is generally located east of West Virginia (WV) on
      the US map. This gives us an initial hint, but we need to check these specific
      zip codes.


      Step 2: US zip codes are organized in a pattern where lower numbers are generally
      in the eastern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be further
      west.


      Step 3: The zip code 19363 (PA) has a lower number than 26330 (WV), which suggests
      that 19363 is more eastern, not western.


      Step 4: More specifically, zip codes beginning with "193xx" are located in southeastern
      Pennsylvania (near the Delaware border), while zip codes beginning with "263xx"
      are in the northeastern part of West Virginia.


      Step 5: Even though West Virginia has an irregular shape that curves around
      part of Pennsylvania, the southeastern part of PA (where 19363 is located) is
      firmly to the east of any part of WV.


      NO - 19363, PA is not located west of 26330, WV. It is located east of it.'
