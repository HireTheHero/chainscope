      \ - In the United States, locations with a more negative longitude (further\

      Gainesville (32603) is to the northeast of Houston (77045), which means it is
      east and slightly north of Houston.


      Based on this reasoning, since Gainesville, FL (32603) is east of Houston, TX
      (77045), it cannot be considered west of it.


      Thus, the answer to the question is: **NO**.'
