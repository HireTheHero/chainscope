      the recent vote by the UN Security Council regarding North Korea''s nuclear

      The question is about two articles from the New York Times. The first article
      is about a proposal to protect Antarctic waters, while the second article is
      about a fugitive Italian mobster.


      We need to consider the publication date of each article to answer the question.
      The passage does not specify the publication date of either article, so we cannot
      determine from the context whether "Proposal to Protect Antarctic Waters Is
      Scaled Back" was published earlier than "Suburban London Father Is Revealed
      as a Fugitive Italian Mobster."'

      Sure, here''s a step-by-step reasoning to answer the question:


      **Step 1:**

      "Proposal to Protect Antarctic Waters Is Scaled Back" is about a proposal to
      protect Antarctic waters, while "Suburban London Father Is Revealed as a Fugitive
      Italian Mobster" is about a specific individual''s case.

      Italian Mobster."


      **Answer: NO**

      is about a news story about a man who was revealed to be a fugitive Italian

      the U.N.''s efforts to press North Korea to allow a visit by international observers.


      **Step 2:** "Kerry Says Goal Is Mideast Peace Deal Within 9 Months." is about
      the U.S. goal of reaching a peace deal in the Middle East within 9 months.
