      9, 2013

      - "Suburban London Father Is Revealed as a Fugitive Italian Mobster" was published
      on March 30, 2023


      2. Now I can compare the dates:

      - September 2013 comes before March 2023

      - 2013 is earlier than 2023

      - Since we established the North Korea article came first

      - The Guatemala article was NOT published earlier
