      1. Sarai Alamgir Tehsil

      2. Tremadog


      And then determine if Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is west of Tremadog.


      Let me think about where these places are:


      Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is an administrative subdivision (tehsil) in Pakistan,
      specifically in the Gujrat District of Punjab province. Pakistan is in South
      Asia.


      Tremadog is a village in North Wales, United Kingdom. The UK is in Western Europe.


      Now, to determine if one is west of the other, I need to consider their relative
      positions on a map. In general:

      - Pakistan is to the east of Europe

      - Therefore, Sarai Alamgir Tehsil in Pakistan would be east of Tremadog in Wales

      Is Sarai Alamgir Tehsil located west of Tremadog?

      Step 1: Identify Sarai Alamgir Tehsil.

      Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is an administrative subdivision located in the Gujrat
      District of Punjab province in Pakistan. Pakistan is in South Asia.


      Step 2: Identify Tremadog.

      Tremadog is a village located in North Wales, United Kingdom. The UK is in Western
      Europe.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      When comparing their global positions:

      - Pakistan is located to the east of Europe

      - Therefore, Sarai Alamgir Tehsil (in Pakistan) is east of Tremadog (in Wales)

      - If Sarai Alamgir Tehsil is east of Tremadog, it cannot be west of it

      the United States of America. North Carolina is on the east coast of the United

      - Ireland (including Northern Ireland) is located east of the United States
      across the Atlantic Ocean.

      - The United States, including North Carolina, is located west of Europe.


      Therefore, Ballyronan (in Northern Ireland) is located east of Rowan County,

      Step 2: Identify where Rowan County, North Carolina is located.

      Rowan County is in the state of North Carolina in the United States, which is
      on the eastern side of North America.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      The United States is located west of Europe across the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore,
      North Carolina (in the United States) is west of Northern Ireland (in Europe).

      Gibson, Tennessee would be in the eastern United States, since Tennessee is
      an eastern state.

      Graeagle, California would be in the western United States, since California

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern/central United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - California is one of the westernmost states in the continental US, bordering
      the Pacific Ocean

      - Tennessee is much further east, approximately in the middle-eastern portion

      Step 3: Compare specific locations.

      - Regardless of the exact positions of Gibson within Tennessee and Graeagle

      California


      Since Gibson, Tennessee is east of Graeagle, California (not west), the answer

      Viqueque is a city/district in East Timor, which is a country in Southeast Asia,

      Now I need to identify where Ghasm is. I''m not immediately familiar with a

      - A location in Africa

      Without knowing where Ghasm is located, I cannot determine if Viqueque is west

      Asia), if Ghasm is in Africa, Europe, or the Americas, then Viqueque would be
      EAST of Ghasm, not west.


      But if Ghasm is in a country further east than East Timor, like Pacific island
      nations, then Viqueque could be west of it.


      I''m not confident about the location of Ghasm, so I''m having trouble giving

      Determining if Viqueque is west of Ghasm


      To answer this question, I need to identify the geographical locations of both
      places and determine their relative positions.


      **Step 1:** Identify Viqueque.

      Viqueque is a municipality located in East Timor (Timor-Leste), which is in
      Southeast Asia on the eastern half of Timor island.


      **Step 2:** Identify Ghasm.

      I don''t have a record of a major place called "Ghasm" in my knowledge base.
      The name suggests it might be in the Middle East or Arabic-speaking regions,
      but I cannot confirm its exact location.


      **Step 3:** Determine relative positions.

      Without knowing the precise location of Ghasm, I cannot make a definitive east-west
      comparison between these locations.


      Since one of the locations cannot be verified with certainty, I cannot provide
      a reliable YES or NO answer to whether Viqueque is west of Ghasm.'

      - Jincheon County is located in North Chungcheong Province in South Korea.

      - Bandikui is a town in Rajasthan state in India.


      Step 2: Comparing their geographical positions.

      - South Korea is in East Asia.

      - India is in South Asia.

      - Looking at their positions on a world map, South Korea is located to the east
      of India.


      Step 3: Making the east-west comparison.

      - Since Jincheon County is in South Korea and Bandikui is in India, Jincheon
      County is located to the east of Bandikui, not to the west.

      First, I need to identify where Borivali and Gicumbi District are located.


      Borivali is a suburb located in Mumbai, India. Mumbai is on the western coast
      of India, which is in South Asia.


      Gicumbi District is a district in the Northern Province of Rwanda, which is
      a country in East Africa.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions east-west.

      - India is located in Asia

      - Rwanda is located in East Africa

      - Geographically, East Africa is west of India


      Since Borivali is in India (Mumbai), and Gicumbi District is in Rwanda (East
      Africa), and India is east of East Africa, that means Borivali is located east
      of Gicumbi District, not west.


      So Borivali is NOT located west of Gicumbi District. It''s actually located
      east of it.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      First, I need to identify the locations of both places:


      1. Borivali is a suburb located in Mumbai, in the state of Maharashtra, on the
      western coast of India.


      2. Gicumbi District is a district in the Northern Province of Rwanda, a country
      in East Africa.


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions:


      3. India is located in South Asia, while Rwanda is in East Africa.


      4. Looking at a world map, Africa is west of India. East Africa, where Rwanda
      is located, is still west of India.


      5. Therefore, Borivali (in India) is located to the EAST of Gicumbi District
      (in Rwanda), not to the west.

      1. I need to identify the locations of Koraput district and Combe Down.

      2. Then I need to determine their relative positions to answer if Koraput is
      west of Combe Down.


      Koraput district is a district in the state of Odisha (formerly Orissa) in eastern
      India.


      Combe Down is a village on the southern edge of Bath, in Somerset, England,
      in the United Kingdom.


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positioning:

      - India is located in Asia, east of Europe (where the UK is located)

      - The UK (including England, where Combe Down is) is located in Western Europe


      Therefore, Koraput district in India is located east of Combe Down in England,
      not west of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic
      locations of both places and compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify Koraput district.

      Koraput district is located in the eastern Indian state of Odisha (formerly
      known as Orissa).


      Step 2: Identify Combe Down.

      Combe Down is a village on the southern edge of Bath in Somerset, England, United
      Kingdom.


      Step 3: Compare their global positions.

      India is located in South Asia, while the United Kingdom is in Western Europe.

      Looking at a world map, the UK (including England) is significantly west of
      India.


      Step 4: Determine the relative east-west positioning.

      Since Koraput is in eastern India and Combe Down is in the UK, Koraput is located
      to the east of Combe Down, not to the west.

      of Odisha (formerly Orissa).

      2. Combe Down - This appears to be a village/suburb area in Bath, which is in
      southwest England, UK.

      - India is located east of the United Kingdom on a world map

      - Koraput is in eastern India

      - Combe Down is in western England

      - Therefore, Koraput would be to the east of Combe Down, not to the west

      Step 2: Now I need to determine their relative positions on a global scale.

      - The United Kingdom is located in Western Europe.

      - India is located in South Asia.

      - Geographically, India lies to the east of the United Kingdom.


      Step 3: Since Koraput is in India and Combe Down is in the UK, Koraput must
      be to the east of Combe Down, not to the west.

      Since I don''t have enough information about Verd to make this determination,
      I cannot provide a definitive yes or no answer based on factual geographical
      information.</think># Determining if Phalut is west of Verd


      To answer this question, I need to identify the geographical locations of both
      places and compare their positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify Phalut

      Phalut is a mountain peak located in the Singalila Ridge on the border between
      India (West Bengal) and Nepal, in the eastern Himalayas.


      ## Step 2: Identify Verd

      I don''t have information about a significant place called "Verd" in my knowledge
      base. There might be:

      - A small town or village called Verd

      - An alternatively spelled place name

      - A renamed location

      - A fictional place


      ## Step 3: Compare locations

      Without being able to reliably identify Verd''s geographical coordinates, I
      cannot determine its position relative to Phalut on an east-west axis.


      NO - I cannot confirm that Phalut is west of Verd because I lack sufficient
      information about Verd''s location.'

      regarding the locations of Phalut and Verd.


      First, I need to identify where Phalut is. Phalut is a mountain peak in the
      Singalila Ridge of the Himalayas. It''s located in the Indian state of West
      Bengal, near the India-Nepal border.


      Now, I need to identify where Verd is. I''m not immediately familiar with a
      place called Verd. It could be a smaller location that I don''t have information
      about. Let me try to think about possible places named Verd:

      - It could be a town or city somewhere in the world

      - It could be a geographic feature like a mountain, lake, etc.

      - It could be an abbreviated or alternate name for a place


      Without having clear information about where Verd is located, I cannot determine
      whether Phalut is west or east of it. I need to know the geographic coordinates
      or at least the country/region of both places to make this comparison.</think>I

      - A geographic feature

      - An alternative name for a place

      - A place that might be spelled differently


      Without knowing the location of Verd, I cannot determine whether Phalut is located
      west of it or not.


      Since I don''t have the necessary information to make this comparison, I cannot
      provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this question.'

      First, I need to identify where these two places are located.


      Peterchurch is a village in Herefordshire, England, in the western part of England
      near the border with Wales.


      Mohadi - I need to identify where this is. There might be multiple places called
      Mohadi:

      - There''s a Mohadi in Maharashtra, India

      - There might be other places with this name


      If Mohadi refers to the place in India, then we need to compare the longitudes
      of these two locations.

      - India is east of England

      - Therefore, Mohadi in India would be east of Peterchurch, not west


      If there''s another Mohadi somewhere else, I''d need to know where it is located

      possibly another location with this name.


      2. Peterchurch: This is likely Peterchurch in Herefordshire, England, UK.


      If Mohadi is in India and Peterchurch is in the UK, then we need to compare

      - England (UK) is in Western Europe.

      - Quebec (Canada) is in Eastern North America.

      - Globally, North America is west of Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Places in England, including Shipley, are significantly east of places in
      Quebec, Canada.

      - Therefore, Mascouche (in Quebec) is west of Shipley (in England), not the
      other way around.

      Avalon, New Jersey is a borough in Cape May County, New Jersey, USA. It''s located

      When comparing locations across continents, I need to think about global geography.
      Wales (and thus Llangollen) is located in Western Europe, while Avalon, New
      Jersey is on the east coast of North America.


      If we look at a world map, moving west from Europe, we cross the Atlantic Ocean
      and reach the east coast of North America. This means that Avalon, New Jersey
      is west of Llangollen, not the other way around.

      is EAST of Avalon, New Jersey.</think>I need to determine the locations of both

      1. Find where La Vera is located

      2. Find where White County, Indiana is located

      3. Compare their east-west positions


      Let me first establish where White County, Indiana is. White County is a county
      in Indiana, which is a state in the midwestern United States. Indiana is roughly
      in the middle-eastern part of the US.


      Now I need to find where La Vera is. There might be multiple places called "La
      Vera":

      - La Vera could refer to a comarca (county) in Spain, in the Extremadura region

      - There might be places called La Vera in Latin America

      - There could be smaller towns or regions called La Vera elsewhere


      Let''s assume the most well-known La Vera, which is in Spain. Spain is in Europe,
      east of the Atlantic Ocean. The United States, including Indiana, is west of
      the Atlantic Ocean.


      So if La Vera is in Spain, it would be east of White County, Indiana, not west.


      Let me double-check if there are other significant places called La Vera. Without
      additional information specifying which La Vera is being referred to, I''ll
      go with the most prominent one in Spain.


      Since Spain is east of the United States, La Vera (in Spain) would be east of
      White County, Indiana, not west.</think>I need to determine the locations of
      both places and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify White County, Indiana.

      White County is a county located in the state of Indiana in the midwestern United
      States. Indiana is positioned in the eastern half of the continental United
      States.


      Step 2: Identify La Vera.

      La Vera (or "La Comarca de La Vera") is most prominently a region/county in
      the Extremadura autonomous community of western Spain, in Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Spain is located in Europe, which is east of the United States across the Atlantic
      Ocean. Since White County, Indiana is in the United States and La Vera is in
      Spain, La Vera is located to the east of White County, not to the west.

      - Missouri is in the central United States, in North America.

      - North America is west of Europe when looking at a global map.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since North America is west of Europe, and Clarence is in North America while
      Inishmore is in Europe, Inishmore must be east of Clarence, Missouri - not west
      of it.

      First, I need to identify where Bitterley and Salgar are located.


      Bitterley is a village located in Shropshire, England, UK. The UK is in Western
      Europe.


      Salgar is a municipality located in the Antioquia Department of Colombia, which
      is in South America.


      Now I need to determine if Bitterley is west of Salgar.


      Colombia is in northwestern South America, and the UK is in Western Europe.
      In terms of global positioning, South America is west of Europe. This means
      that Salgar (in Colombia) would be west of Bitterley (in the UK), not the other
      way around.


      So Bitterley is NOT west of Salgar. Instead, Bitterley is east of Salgar.</think>To
      determine if Bitterley is located west of Salgar, I need to identify where both
      places are located.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Bitterley is a village in Shropshire, England, United Kingdom.

      - Salgar is a municipality located in Antioquia Department, Colombia, South
      America.


      Step 2: Consider their positions on a world map.

      - The United Kingdom is located in Western Europe.

      - Colombia is located in northwestern South America.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - South America is located to the west of Europe when looking at a world map.

      - Colombia (where Salgar is) is significantly west of the United Kingdom (where
      Bitterley is).


      Step 4: Make the determination based on east-west positioning.

      - Bitterley is to the EAST of Salgar, not to the west.

      Geographically speaking, Bangladesh (and thus Manda Upazila) would be significantly

      - Manda Upazila is in Bangladesh. "Upazila" is a type of administrative region
      in Bangladesh.

      - Crookham Village is in Hampshire, England, United Kingdom.

      - Bangladesh is located in South Asia, east of India

      - The United Kingdom is located in Western Europe

      - Globally, Bangladesh is significantly east of the United Kingdom


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Since Manda Upazila (Bangladesh) is located to the east of Crookham Village
      (UK) on a world map, it cannot be west of Crookham Village.

    356080ee-d78b-4a4e-8107-2f65cda62632: '<think>Let me solve this step by step:


      1) I need to identify where Birur is located.

      2) I need to identify where Bui (a department in Cameroon) is located.

      3) Then I need to determine if Birur is west of Bui.


      For Birur:

      Birur is a town located in Karnataka state in southern India.


      For Bui:

      Bui is a department in the Northwest Region of Cameroon.


      Now for the directional comparison:

      India is in Asia, far to the east of Africa where Cameroon is located.

      Cameroon is in Central/West Africa.


      Since India (where Birur is) is east of Africa (where Bui department is), Birur
      cannot be west of Bui. In fact, Birur is far to the east of Bui.</think># Analyzing
      the locations of Birur and Bui


      To answer this question, I need to identify both locations and determine their
      relative positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify Birur

      Birur is a town located in Karnataka state in southern India, on the Asian continent.


      ## Step 2: Identify Bui

      Bui is a department (administrative division) in the Northwest Region of Cameroon,
      which is in Central/West Africa.


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      When we look at their global positions:

      - India is located in Asia, east of Africa

      - Cameroon is located in West/Central Africa

      - Therefore, Birur (in India) is located to the east of Bui (in Cameroon)


      Since Birur is to the east of Bui, not to the west, the answer is:


      NO'

      1. First, let me identify Bui. Bui is a department in Cameroon, which is a country
      in Central Africa.


      2. Now I need to find Birur. Birur could be a town or city, but I need to determine
      which country it''s in.


      I think Birur might be a town in India, specifically in Karnataka state. If
      this is the case, then India is located in Asia, which is east of Africa.


      If Birur is indeed in India, and Bui is in Cameroon (Africa), then Birur would
      be located east of Bui, not west.


      However, I should verify these locations to be certain. Without being able to
      check a map right now, I''m basing this on my knowledge that:

      - Cameroon is in Central Africa

      - India is in South Asia

      - Africa is west of Asia


      So if Birur is indeed in India as I recall, then the answer would be NO, Birur
      is not located west of Bui (Cameroon department).</think>I need to determine
      the locations of both Birur and Bui to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Bui is a department in Cameroon, which is located in Central Africa.

      - Birur is a town in Karnataka state in India, which is in South Asia.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Cameroon is in Africa, which is west of Asia.

      - India is in Asia, which is east of Africa.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Moving from Bui (Cameroon) to Birur (India) would mean traveling eastward.

      - Therefore, Birur is located east of Bui, not west.

      step:


      1. First, I need to identify where Huntington County, Indiana is located. Indiana
      is a state in the United States, in the Midwest region. It''s located in the
      eastern half of the US.


      2. Next, I need to identify where Crofton, British Columbia is located. British
      Columbia is the westernmost province of Canada, located on the west coast of
      North America.


      3. Now I need to determine their relative positions. Since British Columbia
      is on the west coast of North America, and Indiana is in the Midwest of the
      United States (and not on the west coast), Huntington County, Indiana would
      be east of Crofton, British Columbia.


      4. The question asks if Huntington County, Indiana is west of Crofton, British
      Columbia. Since Indiana is east of British Columbia, not west, the answer is
      NO.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Huntington County, Indiana is located.

      Huntington County is in the state of Indiana, USA. Indiana is located in the
      Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Crofton, British Columbia is located.

      Crofton is in British Columbia, which is the westernmost province of Canada,
      located on the Pacific coast of North America.


      Step 3: Compare their locations on a map.

      British Columbia is on the western edge of North America, while Indiana is much
      further east in the middle of the continent. Looking at a map of North America,
      British Columbia is significantly west of Indiana.


      Step 4: Determine the answer to the question.

      Since British Columbia is west of Indiana, Huntington County (which is in Indiana)
      must be east of Crofton, British Columbia, not west of it.

      \ at longitude around 115\xB0E\n- Lebanon, where Jezzine District is located,\
      \ is approximately at longitude around 35\xB0E\n\nSince lower longitude numbers\

      \ is EAST of Jezzine District, not west.\n\nSo the answer should be NO.\n\n\
      Wait, let me double-check my reasoning. When comparing longitudes:\n- Western\
      \ locations have smaller longitude numbers (going west from the Prime Meridian\
      \ at 0\xB0)\n- Eastern locations have larger longitude numbers (going east from\
      \ the Prime Meridian at 0\xB0)\n\nHowever, Australia is actually EAST of Lebanon\
      \ when you go eastward across the Prime Meridian. But longitude numbers wrap\
      \ around the globe, so we need to consider the shortest distance.\n\nFrom Lebanon\
      \ (~35\xB0E) to Western Australia (~115\xB0E) going eastward is 115 - 35 = 80\
      \ degrees.\nGoing westward would be 360 - 115 + 35 = 280 degrees.\n\nSince the\
      \ eastward path is shorter, Gascoyne is EAST of Jezzine District, not west.</think>#\

      the locations of Rukum District and Ramsey Island.


      1. First, I need to identify where Rukum District is located. Rukum District
      is a district in Nepal, which is in South Asia. Nepal is located in the northern
      part of the Indian subcontinent.


      2. Next, I need to identify where Ramsey Island is located. Ramsey Island is
      a small island located off the coast of Wales, United Kingdom. It''s in Western
      Europe, specifically off the western coast of Great Britain.


      3. Now I need to determine their relative positions. Nepal is in Asia, while
      Wales is in Europe. Looking at a world map, Asia is to the east of Europe.


      4. Since Rukum District is in Nepal (Asia) and Ramsey Island is off the coast
      of Wales (Europe), and Asia is east of Europe, Rukum District would be to the
      east of Ramsey Island, not to the west.


      So the answer is NO, Rukum District is not located west of Ramsey Island. It''s

      I need to determine the locations of both places and their relative positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Rukum District is located in Nepal, which is in South Asia

      - Ramsey Island is a small island off the coast of Wales in the United Kingdom
      (Western Europe)


      ## Step 2: Determine their relative positions globally

      - Nepal is in Asia, which is east of Europe on the world map

      - The UK (including Wales) is in Western Europe

      - When considering global orientation, Asia is to the east of Europe


      ## Step 3: Make the comparison

      - Since Rukum District (Nepal) is in Asia, and Ramsey Island (Wales) is in Europe,
      Rukum District is located east of Ramsey Island, not west


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Rukum District is not located west of Ramsey Island; it is located to the

    f9c9e246-fc7d-4d2d-b90b-698dc0a50ae3: '<think>I need to answer whether Rukum District
      is located west of Ramsey Island. Let me think about where these places are
      located.


      Rukum District is in Nepal, which is in South Asia. Nepal is located between
      India and China.


      Ramsey Island is a small island off the coast of Wales, which is part of the
      United Kingdom, in Europe.


      Now let''s think about the relative east-west positioning:

      - Nepal is in Asia, which is generally east of Europe

      - The UK and Wales are in Western Europe

      - Ramsey Island, being off the coast of Wales, is in Western Europe


      So if Rukum District is in Nepal (Asia), and Ramsey Island is off the coast
      of Wales (Western Europe), then Rukum District would be EAST of Ramsey Island,
      not west.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Rukum District is not located west of Ramsey Island.
      It''s located east of it.</think>To determine if Rukum District is located west
      of Ramsey Island, I need to identify the locations of both places and compare
      their positions along an east-west axis.


      Step 1: Identify Rukum District''s location.

      Rukum District is located in Nepal, which is in South Asia between India and
      China.


      Step 2: Identify Ramsey Island''s location.

      Ramsey Island is a small island off the coast of Pembrokeshire in Wales, United
      Kingdom, which is in Western Europe.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      When looking at a world map, Nepal (where Rukum District is) is significantly
      east of the United Kingdom (where Ramsey Island is). Asia is east of Europe
      on the global east-west axis.


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on relative positions.

      Since Rukum District (in Nepal/Asia) is east of Ramsey Island (in UK/Europe),
      it cannot be west of Ramsey Island.

      about the relative geographic locations of two places: Luxettipet and Rutigliano.
      Let me think about where these places are located.


      Luxettipet is a town located in the state of Telangana in India. It''s in the
      southern part of India.


      Rutigliano is a town in the metropolitan city of Bari, in the Apulia region
      of southern Italy.


      Now, to determine if Luxettipet is west of Rutigliano, I need to compare their
      longitudes.


      India is located in Asia, to the east of Europe. Italy is in southern Europe.


      When looking at a world map, moving from west to east, we generally go from
      the Americas to Europe to Asia to the Pacific.


      Since Italy (where Rutigliano is) is in Europe, and India (where Luxettipet

      On a world map, Italy (Europe) is west of India (Asia). When moving from west
      to east across the globe, we generally go from the Americas to Europe to Africa/Asia.


      Step 4: Make the directional determination.

      First, let me identify where these places are:


      1. Beaufort, Victoria - This is likely a town in Victoria, Australia.

      2. Barsoi - I need to determine where this is located.


      Beaufort, Victoria is indeed a small town in Victoria, Australia. Australia
      is located in the southern hemisphere, and Victoria is a state in the southeastern
      part of the country. Australian locations would generally have longitudes around
      140-150 degrees east.


      Now for Barsoi. Barsoi appears to be a town in the state of Bihar in northeastern
      India. India is in the northern hemisphere and would have longitudes around
      70-90 degrees east.


      If we compare the longitudes:

      - Locations in Australia are generally around 140-150 degrees east

      - Locations in India are generally around 70-90 degrees east


      Since places with higher east longitude values are further east, and Australia
      is further east than India, Beaufort in Victoria, Australia would be EAST of
      Barsoi, India (not west).


      So Beaufort, Victoria is NOT located west of Barsoi.</think># Is Beaufort, Victoria
      located west of Barsoi?


      I need to determine the locations of both places and compare their positions
      on the globe.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Beaufort, Victoria is a town in the state of Victoria in Australia.

      - Barsoi is a town located in the state of Bihar in northeastern India.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate longitudes.

      - Australia is located in the Eastern Hemisphere, with Victoria having longitudes
      around 140-150 degrees east.

      - India is also in the Eastern Hemisphere, but with longitudes around 70-90
      degrees east.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Places with higher eastern longitude values are further east on the globe.

      - The Caribbean/Puerto Rico is in the western hemisphere

      - Italy is in the eastern hemisphere


      Therefore, Capracotta (in Italy) would be east of Machuelo Abajo (in Puerto
      Rico), not west of it.</think># Is Capracotta located west of Machuelo Abajo?


      I need to determine the locations of both places and compare their east-west
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Capracotta is a town in Italy, in the Molise region of southern Italy.

      - Machuelo Abajo is a barrio (neighborhood) in Puerto Rico, which is in the
      Caribbean.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions globally.

      - Italy is in Europe, in the eastern hemisphere.

      - Puerto Rico is in the Caribbean, in the western hemisphere.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions.

      - Places in Europe (like Italy) are east of places in the Caribbean/Americas.

      - The Prime Meridian runs through Western Europe, with Italy being east of it.

      - The Americas, including Puerto Rico, are well west of the Prime Meridian.


      Therefore, Capracotta (Italy) is located east of Machuelo Abajo (Puerto Rico),
      not west.

      locations of Capracotta and Machuelo Abajo, and then compare their east-west
      positions.


      1. Capracotta: I believe Capracotta is a town in Italy, in the central part
      of the country.

      2. Machuelo Abajo: I believe this is a place in Puerto Rico, which is a Caribbean
      island territory of the United States.


      If I''m correct about these locations, then:

      - Italy is in Europe

      - Puerto Rico is in the Caribbean, which is part of North America


      Looking at a world map, Europe is east of North America (including the Caribbean).
      So Italy would be east of Puerto Rico.


      Therefore, Capracotta (in Italy) would be east of Machuelo Abajo (in Puerto
      Rico).

      Capracotta is a town in Italy, specifically in the Molise region in the central
      part of the country.


      Step 2: Identify where Machuelo Abajo is located.

      Machuelo Abajo is a barrio (neighborhood) in Ponce, Puerto Rico, which is in
      the Caribbean.


      Step 3: Compare their positions globally.

      Italy is in Europe, which is east of the Americas (including Puerto Rico).

      Puerto Rico is in the Caribbean, which is part of North America and is west
      of Europe.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Since Italy (where Capracotta is) is east of Puerto Rico (where Machuelo Abajo
      is), Capracotta is east of Machuelo Abajo - not west.

      - Muggia is a town in northeastern Italy, near Trieste, close to the border
      with Slovenia.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions using longitude.

      - India is located in Asia, significantly east of Europe.

      - Italy is in Europe, west of Asia.

      - Therefore, Vetapalem (in India) is east of Muggia (in Italy), not west.

      1. First, I need to identify where Urbisaglia is located. Urbisaglia is a town
      in Italy, specifically in the Marche region, which is in central-eastern Italy.


      2. Next, I need to identify where Monte Cristi is. Monte Cristi is a city in
      the Dominican Republic, which is located in the Caribbean on the island of Hispaniola.
      The Dominican Republic is in North America.


      3. Now, I need to determine their relative positions to decide if Urbisaglia
      is west of Monte Cristi.


      Italy is in Europe, which is east of North America (where the Dominican Republic
      is located). Therefore, Urbisaglia is east of Monte Cristi, not west of it.


      So my answer is NO, Urbisaglia is not west of Monte Cristi in the Dominican
      Republic. It''s actually east of it.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographic locations of both places and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify where Urbisaglia is located.

      Urbisaglia is a town in the Marche region of central-eastern Italy, in Europe.


      Step 2: Identify where Monte Cristi is located.

      Monte Cristi is a city in the Dominican Republic, which is in the Caribbean
      region of North America.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a global map.

      The Dominican Republic is in the Western Hemisphere, while Italy is in the Eastern
      Hemisphere. When comparing east-west positions globally, Europe (where Italy/Urbisaglia
      is) lies to the east of the Caribbean (where Monte Cristi is).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Italy is east of the Dominican Republic, Urbisaglia is east of Monte Cristi,
      not west.

      coast of India, on the Bay of Bengal.


      2. Now, I need to identify where Koltur is. This is a bit tricky because there
      might be multiple places named Koltur. One Koltur I''m aware of is an island

      Odisha located west of Koltur?


      I need to determine the geographic locations of both places to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify Gopalpur, Odisha.

      Gopalpur is a coastal town in the state of Odisha (formerly Orissa) on the eastern
      coast of India, located along the Bay of Bengal.


      Step 2: Identify Koltur.

      Koltur is a small island in the Faroe Islands, which is an archipelago located
      in the North Atlantic Ocean between Norway, Scotland, and Iceland.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      The Faroe Islands (including Koltur) are located far to the west of India. On
      a world map, Koltur is positioned much further west than Gopalpur.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Gopalpur, Odisha is in eastern India and Koltur is in the North Atlantic,
      Gopalpur is located to the east of Koltur, not to the west.

      Nusa Kambangan is an island in Indonesia. It''s located in the Central Java
      province, off the southern coast of Java.


      Bhiwapur is a town in India, in the state of Maharashtra.


      Now let''s determine their relative positions:

      - Indonesia (where Nusa Kambangan is) is in Southeast Asia

      - India (where Bhiwapur is) is in South Asia


      Looking at a world map, Indonesia is east of India. Since Nusa Kambangan is
      in Indonesia and Bhiwapur is in India, Nusa Kambangan would be east of Bhiwapur,
      not west.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Nusa Kambangan is not located west of Bhiwapur.
      It''s located east of Bhiwapur.</think>I need to determine the relative locations
      of these two places:


      Step 1: Identify where Nusa Kambangan is located.

      Nusa Kambangan is an island in Indonesia, specifically off the southern coast
      of Java in Central Java province.


      Step 2: Identify where Bhiwapur is located.

      Bhiwapur is a town in Maharashtra state in central India.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      Indonesia is located in Southeast Asia, while India is in South Asia.

      On a world map, Indonesia (including Nusa Kambangan) is positioned to the east
      of India (including Bhiwapur).


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      Since Indonesia is east of India, Nusa Kambangan is east of Bhiwapur, not west
      of it.


      NO'

      to determine the locations of both Nusa Kambangan and Bhiwapur.


      1) Nusa Kambangan is an island in Indonesia. It''s located off the southern
      coast of Java island. Indonesia is in Southeast Asia, and Java is one of its
      main islands.


      2) Bhiwapur is likely a place in India. I believe it''s located in the state
      of Maharashtra in central India.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - Indonesia (where Nusa Kambangan is) is located in Southeast Asia

      - India (where Bhiwapur is) is located in South Asia

      - Generally, Indonesia is east of India


      Since Nusa Kambangan is in Indonesia and Bhiwapur is in India, Nusa Kambangan

      When looking at a world map, Indonesia (where Nusa Kambangan is) lies to the
      east of India (where Bhiwapur is). The entire Indonesian archipelago is east
      of the Indian subcontinent.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Nusa Kambangan is in Indonesia (east) and Bhiwapur is in India (west),
      Nusa Kambangan is located east of Bhiwapur, not west.

      the locations of Bargal and Lika, and then figure out their relative positions.


      Step 1: Identify where Bargal is located.

      Bargal is a coastal town in northeastern Somalia, located on the Gulf of Aden
      on the Horn of Africa.


      Step 2: Identify where Lika is located.

      Lika is a region in central Croatia in Europe, part of the Lika-Senj County.


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      Somalia is in eastern Africa, while Croatia is in southeastern Europe. When
      looking at a world map, Somalia (where Bargal is) is significantly east of Croatia
      (where Lika is).


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Bargal (in Somalia) is east of Lika (in Croatia), not west, the answer
      is:


      NO'

      where both locations are:


      1. Kohistan District is a district in Pakistan, which is in South Asia.

      2. Goring-by-Sea sounds like it''s in the UK (the "by-Sea" naming pattern is
      common in British coastal towns).


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:


      - Pakistan is located in South Asia, to the east of the Middle East and to the
      west of India.

      - The UK (assuming Goring-by-Sea is indeed in the UK) is in Western Europe.


      Looking at a world map, Pakistan is significantly east of the UK. If we go from
      west to east across the map, we''d encounter:

      1. UK (Western Europe)

      2. Eastern Europe

      3. Western Asia / Middle East

      4. Pakistan (South Asia)


      So Pakistan, including Kohistan District, would be EAST of the UK, not west
      of it.


      Therefore, Kohistan District is NOT located west of Goring-by-Sea (assuming
      Goring-by-Sea is in the UK). It would be east of it.

      - Goring-by-Sea is a seaside resort in West Sussex, England, United Kingdom.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a global map.

      - The United Kingdom is in Western Europe.

      - Pakistan is in South Asia, east of the Middle East.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the world map, I would encounter the UK (including
      Goring-by-Sea) first, then continue eastward through Europe, the Middle East,
      and eventually reach Pakistan where Kohistan District is located.

      - This means Kohistan District is east of Goring-by-Sea, not west.

      compare their relative positions to see if Putuo District is west of Mirchaiya.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Putuo District is a district in Zhoushan, which is a city in Zhejiang Province,
      China. Zhoushan is located on the east coast of China.

      - Mirchaiya is a town in Nepal, located in the eastern part of the country.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate coordinates or relative positions.

      - China is located in East Asia, and Zhoushan specifically is on China''s eastern
      coast.

      - Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia, situated between India and Tibet
      (China).


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Nepal is west of much of China, but it''s located more to the southwest relative
      to eastern coastal China. Given that Zhoushan is on China''s eastern coast,
      and Mirchaiya is in eastern Nepal, Putuo District in Zhoushan would be east
      of Mirchaiya, not west.

      located east of Mirchaiya.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positioning of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Putuo District is part of Zhoushan city in Zhejiang Province, eastern China.
      Zhoushan is an archipelago located off the east coast of China.

      - Mirchaiya is a town in eastern Nepal, in South Asia.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - China is located east of Nepal on a world map.

      - Specifically, Zhoushan, being on China''s east coast, is even further east.

      - Nepal is a landlocked country west of China.

      - Even though Mirchaiya is in eastern Nepal, all of Nepal is still west of eastern
      China.


      Step 3: Make the east-west determination.

      - Putuo District in Zhoushan is situated significantly to the east of Mirchaiya.

      step:


      1. First, I need to identify where Crumpsall is located. Crumpsall is an area
      in Manchester, which is in the northwest of England, United Kingdom.


      2. Next, I need to identify where Smith County, Tennessee is located. Smith
      County is a county in the U.S. state of Tennessee, which is in the southeastern
      United States.


      3. Now I need to determine if Crumpsall (in England) is west of Smith County,
      Tennessee (in the USA).


      To determine east-west relationships across continents, I need to think about
      global geography. The United Kingdom is to the east of the United States across
      the Atlantic Ocean. Manchester, including Crumpsall, is in the UK, while Tennessee
      is in the eastern part of the USA.


      Since the UK is east of the USA, and Crumpsall is in the UK, Crumpsall must
      be east of Smith County, Tennessee - not west of it.</think>I need to determine
      the locations of both places and their relationship to each other.


      Step 1: Identify where Crumpsall is located.

      Crumpsall is an area in Manchester, which is located in northern England, United
      Kingdom.


      Step 2: Identify where Smith County, Tennessee is located.

      Smith County is a county in the U.S. state of Tennessee, which is in the southeastern
      part of the United States.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship between these locations.

      The United Kingdom is located east of the United States across the Atlantic
      Ocean. Since Crumpsall is in the UK and Smith County is in the eastern United
      States, Crumpsall must be east of Smith County, Tennessee - not west.

      to:

      1. Determine where Crumpsall is located

      2. Determine where Smith County, Tennessee is located

      3. Compare their geographical positions to determine if Crumpsall is west of
      Smith County, Tennessee


      Step 1: Where is Crumpsall located?

      Crumpsall is an area in Manchester, England, UK. Manchester is in the northwest
      of England.


      Step 2: Where is Smith County, Tennessee located?

      Smith County is a county in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Tennessee is in the
      southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      England is located to the east of the United States across the Atlantic Ocean.
      Since Crumpsall is in England, and Smith County is in the United States, Crumpsall
      would be east of Smith County, not west.


      So the answer is NO, Crumpsall is not located west of Smith County, Tennessee.
      It''s actually to the east.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic
      positions of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify where Crumpsall is located.

      Crumpsall is an area in North Manchester, England, in the United Kingdom.


      Step 2: Identify where Smith County, Tennessee is located.

      Smith County is a county in the state of Tennessee in the southeastern United
      States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      The United Kingdom is located to the east of the United States across the Atlantic
      Ocean. Since Crumpsall is in the UK and Smith County is in the US, Crumpsall
      is east of Smith County, Tennessee - not west.

      First, I need to identify where Crumpsall is located.

      Crumpsall is a suburban area in Manchester, England, UK.


      Next, I need to identify where Smith County, Tennessee is located.

      Smith County is a county in the U.S. state of Tennessee.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - Manchester, England is in the western part of Europe

      - Tennessee is in the eastern United States


      When comparing locations that are on different continents, I need to consider
      their positions on a global map. Going west from the United States, you would
      cross the Pacific Ocean and eventually reach Asia, then Europe. Going east from
      the United States, you would cross the Atlantic Ocean and reach Europe.


      Since England (where Crumpsall is) is east of the United States (where Smith
      County, Tennessee is), Crumpsall is not west of Smith County, Tennessee. Instead,
      it''s east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two places.


      Step 1: Identify where Crumpsall is located.

      Crumpsall is a suburban area in Manchester, England, in the United Kingdom.


      Step 2: Identify where Smith County, Tennessee is located.

      Smith County is a county in the eastern United States, specifically in the state
      of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Compare their global positions.

      The United Kingdom is located to the east of the United States across the Atlantic
      Ocean. On a world map, the UK is positioned to the east of the entire continental
      United States, including Tennessee.


      Step 4: Determine directional relationship.

      Since Crumpsall (in the UK) is east of Smith County, Tennessee (in the USA),
      it cannot be west of it.

      First, I need to identify the locations mentioned:

      1. Jubb al-Safa

      2. Loughor


      To determine their relative positions, I need to know where each is located.


      Jubb al-Safa sounds like an Arabic name, so it''s likely in the Middle East
      or North Africa. Specifically, I believe it''s in Syria.


      Loughor is a Welsh name. It''s a town in Wales, United Kingdom, which is in
      Western Europe.


      Geographically speaking:

      - The Middle East (including Syria) is east of Europe

      - Wales is in western Europe


      Therefore, Jubb al-Safa (in Syria) would be located east of Loughor (in Wales),
      not west of it.


      So the answer would be "NO" - Jubb al-Safa is not located west of Loughor; it''s
      located east of Loughor.</think>I need to determine the locations of both places
      and their relative positions.


      Step 1: Identify where Jubb al-Safa is located.

      Jubb al-Safa (or Jubb as-Safa) is a town in Syria, which is in the Middle East.


      Step 2: Identify where Loughor is located.

      Loughor is a town in Wales, United Kingdom, located in Western Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Looking at a world map, Syria (where Jubb al-Safa is) is located in the Middle
      East, which is east of Europe (where Loughor is).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Syria is east of Wales, Jubb al-Safa is east of Loughor, not west of it.


      NO'

      - England is located to the east of the United States across the Atlantic Ocean.

      - North Carolina is on the eastern side of the United States.

      First, let me identify where each district is located:


      Kondagaon district: This is a district in the state of Chhattisgarh in central
      India.


      Pechorsky District: This is likely referring to a district in Russia. There''s
      a Pechorsky District in Pskov Oblast, which is in western Russia near the border
      with Estonia.


      Now, to determine if Kondagaon is west of Pechorsky:

      - India is located in southern Asia

      - Russia is located in northern Asia and eastern Europe

      - Specifically, Pskov Oblast (where Pechorsky District is) is in the western
      part of Russia

      - Broadly speaking, India is southwest of Russia


      Looking at global orientation, India is generally south and west of Russia.
      Since Kondagaon is in central India and Pechorsky is in western Russia, Kondagaon
      would be southwest of Pechorsky.


      So if we''re just asking about east-west orientation (ignoring the north-south
      component), then yes, Kondagaon would be west of Pechorsky District.</think>To

      Step 2: Identify Pechorsky District''s location.

      Pechorsky District is located in Pskov Oblast in western Russia, near the border
      with Estonia.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      India is situated significantly west of Russia on the Asian continent. Even
      though Pechorsky is in western Russia, Russia as a whole is east of India. Kondagaon
      in central India would be several thousand kilometers west of even the westernmost
      parts of Russia.

      First, let me identify these locations:


      Rivercess County is a county in Liberia, which is a country in West Africa.


      Co-op City is a residential development located in the Bronx, which is one of
      the five boroughs of New York City in the United States.

      \ Reasoning\n\n1. First, I need to identify where Rivercess County is located.\n\
      \   * Rivercess County is a county in Liberia, which is a country in West Africa.\n\
      \n2. Next, I need to identify where Co-op City, Bronx is located.\n   * Co-op\
      \ City is a neighborhood in the Bronx borough of New York City, United States,\
      \ located on the east coast of North America.\n\n3. To compare their east-west\
      \ positions, I need to consider their approximate longitudes:\n   * Rivercess\
      \ County, Liberia is located around 9\xB0 West longitude\n   * Co-op City, Bronx\
      \ is located around 74\xB0 West longitude\n\n4. In the longitude system, higher\
      \ numbers of West longitude (or more negative numbers if using the -180 to +180\
      \ system) indicate locations further west.\n\n5. Since 74\xB0 West is a higher\
      \ west longitude than 9\xB0 West, Co-op City is actually further west than Rivercess\
      \ County.\n\n# Answer\nNO"

      There are a few places called Froxfield:

      - Froxfield in Hampshire, England, UK

      - Froxfield in Wiltshire, England, UK


      Both of these Froxfields are in the United Kingdom.

      The UK is located to the east of North America, across the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore,
      any location in the UK (including either Froxfield) would be east of any location

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Gladeview is a census-designated place located in Miami-Dade County, Florida,
      in the eastern United States.

      - Froxfield could refer to villages in England (in Hampshire or Wiltshire).


      Step 2: Compare their positions globally.

      - The United States is located west of England in terms of global geography.

      - However, this question asks if Froxfield is west of Gladeview (not the other
      way around).

      - England is east of the United States, meaning any location in England would
      be east of any location in Florida.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      - Since Froxfield (assuming it refers to the English locations) is in England,
      and England is east of Florida, Froxfield is located east of Gladeview, not
      west.

      Zirakpur is a city in India, located in the state of Punjab, near Chandigarh
      in northern India.


      Vinger - I need to check where this is. I believe Vinger might be a location
      in Norway or another Scandinavian country, but I should confirm this.


      If Zirakpur is in India and Vinger is in Norway or another European country,
      then Zirakpur would be east of Vinger, not west, because:

      - India is in Asia, which is east of Europe

      - Moving from Europe to Asia means traveling eastward


      Let me check if my understanding of these locations is correct. Zirakpur is
      definitely in northern India. Vinger appears to be in Norway, near the Swedish
      border in southeastern Norway.


      Norway is in Europe, and India is in Asia. Geographically, Europe is west of
      Asia. This means that Vinger (in Norway) is west of Zirakpur (in India).


      Therefore, Zirakpur is NOT located west of Vinger. Instead, Zirakpur is east
      of Vinger.</think>I''ll think step by step to determine the relative positions

      Zirakpur is a city in Punjab, India, located in northern India near Chandigarh.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Vinger is located.

      Vinger is a location in southeastern Norway, near the Swedish border in Scandinavia.


      Step 3: Compare their global positions.

      Norway is in Europe, while India is in Asia. Looking at a world map, Europe
      is positioned to the west of Asia.


      Step 4: Determine their east-west relationship.

      Since Norway (where Vinger is) is west of India (where Zirakpur is), Zirakpur
      is east of Vinger, not west of it.

      First, let me recall what I know about Charodinsky District:

      - I believe Charodinsky District (or Charodinsky Rayon) is an administrative
      district in Dagestan, which is a republic in Russia, located in the North Caucasus
      region.


      Now, for Patcham:

      - Patcham is likely a place in the United Kingdom, possibly a suburb or district
      of Brighton in East Sussex, England.


      If these identifications are correct, then Charodinsky District in Dagestan,
      Russia would be significantly east of Patcham in the UK. Russia is east of the
      United Kingdom.


      Therefore, Charodinsky District would NOT be west of Patcham; it would be east

      ## Step 1: Identify Charodinsky District

      Charodinsky District (also known as Charodinsky Rayon) is an administrative
      district located in Dagestan, which is a republic in the Russian Federation
      in the North Caucasus region.


      ## Step 2: Identify Patcham

      Patcham is a suburb in the northern part of Brighton and Hove, a city located
      on the south coast of England in the United Kingdom.


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      - Russia (where Charodinsky District is located) is east of the United Kingdom
      (where Patcham is located)

      - When comparing these specific locations on a world map, Charodinsky District
      in Dagestan is significantly east of Patcham in the UK

      Let me try to recall what I know about these places:


      1. Charodinsky District: I believe this is a district in Dagestan, which is
      a republic within Russia. Dagestan is located in the North Caucasus region,
      which is in the southwestern part of Russia, bordering the Caspian Sea.


      2. Patcham: I believe this is an area in Brighton, which is a city on the south
      coast of England in the United Kingdom.


      If my recollections are correct, then Charodinsky District in Russia would be
      east of Patcham in England, since Russia is east of the United Kingdom on a

      former Soviet republics, based on the name.


      Patcham is likely in the United Kingdom - I believe it''s an area in Brighton,
      on the south coast of England.


      If Charodinsky District is in Russia or Eastern Europe, and Patcham is in the
      UK, then Charodinsky District would be east of Patcham, not west. This is because
      Russia and Eastern Europe are generally east of the United Kingdom on a world

      Russia, in the eastern part of the North Caucasus region.

      - Patcham is an area in the northern part of Brighton, United Kingdom.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions globally.

      - Russia is located to the east of the United Kingdom on a world map.

      - Specifically, Dagestan in Russia is significantly east of any part of the
      UK.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Charodinsky District is in Russia (east) and Patcham is in the UK (west),
      Charodinsky District is located to the east of Patcham, not to the west.


      NO, Charodinsky District is not located west of Patcham. It is located east

      - The United Kingdom is in Western Europe

      - Dagestan is in the eastern part of Russia''s European territory

      - England is on the western side of Europe


      Looking at their relative positions on a map, Russia (where Charodinsky District

      The United Kingdom is located in Western Europe, while Russia (including Dagestan)
      is located further east. Even though Dagestan is in southwestern Russia, all
      of Russia is east of the United Kingdom.


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      Since Patcham (in the UK) is west of Charodinsky District (in Russia), it means

      to determine the relative positions of Bulloch County, Georgia and Litchfield,
      California on a map of the United States.


      First, let''s establish their general locations:

      - Bulloch County is in Georgia, which is a southeastern state in the US

      - Litchfield is in California, which is on the west coast of the US


      In general, Georgia is in the eastern part of the United States, while California
      is in the western part. The continental United States has the Atlantic Ocean
      on the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west, with Georgia being close to the
      Atlantic and California being on the Pacific.

      County, Georgia would be east of Litchfield, California - not west of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify where Bulloch County, Georgia is located.

      Bulloch County is in the state of Georgia, which is located in the southeastern
      United States on the eastern side of the country.


      Step 2: Identify where Litchfield, California is located.

      Litchfield is in California, which is on the west coast of the United States
      on the western side of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west). Georgia is near the Atlantic Ocean, while California borders the Pacific
      Ocean.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their positions.

      Since Georgia is in the eastern United States and California is in the western
      United States, Bulloch County, Georgia must be east of Litchfield, California
      - not west.

      - Bulloch County is in the state of Georgia, which is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      - Litchfield is in California, which is on the west coast of the United States.


      In the United States, states on the west coast (like California) are generally
      located west of states on the east coast (like Georgia). So California is west
      of Georgia.


      Since Bulloch County is in Georgia, and Litchfield is in California, that means
      that Bulloch County is east of Litchfield, not west of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Bulloch County, Georgia is NOT located west of
      Litchfield, California.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      the United States.

      - Litchfield is in California, which is a state on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - The United States generally spans from east (Atlantic Ocean) to west (Pacific
      Ocean).

      - Georgia is on the eastern side of the country.

      - California is on the western side of the country.


      Step 3: Draw the conclusion.

      - Since Georgia (where Bulloch County is located) is on the eastern side of
      the United States, and California (where Litchfield is located) is on the western
      side, Bulloch County must be east of Litchfield, not west.

      1. Georgia is a state on the east coast of the United States.

      2. California is a state on the west coast of the United States.

      3. Generally, places in California are west of places in Georgia because the
      United States spans from east to west with the east coast (including Georgia)

      side.


      To be more specific:

      - Bulloch County is in eastern Georgia

      - Litchfield is in California, likely in the eastern or central part of California


      Given the overall geography of the United States, places in California (including
      Litchfield) would be west of places in Georgia (including Bulloch County).


      Therefore, Bulloch County, Georgia would be EAST of Litchfield, California -

      of the United States.


      2) Litchfield is located in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.


      3) The continental United States generally extends from the Atlantic Ocean (east)

      4) Since Georgia is an eastern state and California is a western state, places
      in Georgia would be EAST of places in California, not west of them.

      \ Ethiopia is located roughly between 3\xB0N-15\xB0N latitude and 33\xB0E-48\xB0\
      E longitude.\n\nStep 2: Identify where Inishvickillane is located.\nInishvickillane\
      \ is one of the Blasket Islands located off the western coast of Ireland. Ireland\
      \ is in Western Europe, roughly at 52\xB0N latitude and 8\xB0W to 10\xB0W longitude.\n\
      \nStep 3: Compare their east-west positions.\nWhen comparing locations globally\
      \ on an east-west axis, we look at their longitudes. Ethiopia (where Arba Minch\
      \ is) has eastern longitudes (33\xB0E-48\xB0E), while Ireland (where Inishvickillane\
      \ is) has western longitudes (around 10\xB0W).\n\nStep 4: Make the determination.\n\
      Since Arba Minch is at an eastern longitude and Inishvickillane is at a western\
      \ longitude, Arba Minch is located EAST of Inishvickillane, not west.\n\nNO"
