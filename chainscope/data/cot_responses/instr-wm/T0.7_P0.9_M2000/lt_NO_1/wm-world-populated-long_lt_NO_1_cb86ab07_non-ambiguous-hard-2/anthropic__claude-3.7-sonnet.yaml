      Samdrup Jongkhar is a town in southeastern Bhutan, near the border with India.
      Bhutan is a country in South Asia, located in the eastern Himalayas.

      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Bhutan is located in Asia, far to the east of Europe. Montenegro is in Europe.
      When comparing places on different continents, we need to consider their positions
      on the global map.


      Europe is generally west of Asia. Montenegro (where Andrijevica is) is in Europe,
      while Bhutan (where Samdrup Jongkhar is) is in Asia. This means Samdrup Jongkhar
      would be east of Andrijevica, not west.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lisburn is a city in Northern Ireland, UK, located in Europe.

      - Sarasota Springs is in Florida, USA, located in North America.


      Step 2: Consider their global positions.

      - Europe is east of North America across the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Northern Ireland is in the western part of Europe.

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a global map.

      - Even though Lisburn is in western Europe, all of Europe is still significantly
      east of the United States.

      - Sarasota Springs, Florida would be west of Lisburn when looking at a world
      map.


      Therefore, Lisburn is NOT west of Sarasota Springs, Florida. Lisburn is east

      Step 2: Identify where Avalon, New Jersey is located.

      Avalon is a borough in Cape May County, New Jersey, on the east coast of the
      United States.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Huntington County is in Indiana, which is a state in the United States.

      - Crofton is in British Columbia, which is a province in Canada.


      Step 2: Determine their general positions.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - British Columbia is the westernmost province of Canada, located on the Pacific
      coast.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The United States and Canada share a roughly east-west oriented border.

      - British Columbia is on the far western edge of North America.

      - Indiana is in the middle-eastern part of the United States, far from the west
      coast.

      - British Columbia is significantly west of Indiana.


      Step 4: Therefore, Huntington County, Indiana would be east of Crofton, British
      Columbia, not west.


      NO, Huntington County, Indiana is not located west of Crofton, British Columbia.

    1f003e8b-c5a7-4f66-8624-e2a3da91e962: '# Is Luxettipet located west of Rutigliano?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both
      places and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify where Luxettipet is located.

      Luxettipet is a town in Telangana state in southern India.


      Step 2: Identify where Rutigliano is located.

      Rutigliano is a town in the Puglia (Apulia) region of southern Italy.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - India is located in Asia, east of Europe

      - Italy is in southern Europe

      - When comparing locations on an east-west axis, we compare their longitudes

      - Places in India have greater (more easterly) longitudes than places in Italy


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Luxettipet is in India and Rutigliano is in Italy, and India is east of
      Italy, Luxettipet is east of Rutigliano, not west of it.


      NO'

      the standard orientation where North America is on the left and Africa is to
      the right.

      - However, since the Earth is a sphere, if we go far enough west from North
      America, we would eventually reach Asia and then Africa from the opposite direction.


      Step 4: Determine the most direct relationship.

      - The standard way to determine east/west relationships is to use the shortest
      distance across the globe.

      - The shortest path from New York to Liberia crosses the Atlantic Ocean eastward.

      - This means Liberia (and Rivercess County) is east of New York City (and Co-op
      City, Bronx).
