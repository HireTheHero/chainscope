      2) Now, let''s consider their relative positions:

      - Mopidevi, being in India, is in Asia

      - Veliki Preslav, being in Bulgaria, is in Europe

      - Asia is east of Europe


      3) Therefore, since Mopidevi is in India (Asia) and Veliki Preslav is in Bulgaria
      (Europe), and Asia is east of Europe, Mopidevi must be east of Veliki Preslav,

      1. Let me identify the locations:

      - Bhagalpur division is in Bihar, India

      - Franzensfeste (also known as Fortezza) is in northern Italy


      2. Let me determine their rough positions:

      - Bhagalpur division is in eastern India

      - Franzensfeste is in northern Italy, in the Alps


      3. Let me compare their positions globally:

      - India is east of Italy

      - Therefore, Bhagalpur (being in India) is east of Franzensfeste (being in Italy)


      4. The question asks if Bhagalpur is west of Franzensfeste

      - Since we established Bhagalpur is east of Franzensfeste, it cannot be west
      of it


      Answer: NO'
