      \   - Geographically, it is in the northeastern part of India, near the border\

      is located west of Roswell, Georgia, we need to find the longitudinal coordinates
      of both locations and compare them.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations**

      - Churchill, Somerset is a place in the United Kingdom, specifically in the
      county of Somerset in South West England.

      - Roswell, Georgia is a city in the southeastern United States, located in the
      state of Georgia.


      **Step 2: Determine the longitude of each location**

      - Churchill, Somerset (UK) is approximately at a longitude of **-2.8 degrees**
      (west of the Prime Meridian).

      - Roswell, Georgia (USA) is approximately at a longitude of **-84.4 degrees**
      (also west of the Prime Meridian).


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      - Longitude values increase in the negative direction as you go west.

      - Since -84.4 is further west than -2.8, **Roswell, Georgia is west of Churchill,
      Somerset**.


      **Final Answer: NO**. Churchill, Somerset is not west of Roswell, Georgia.'

      \ west of Inishvickillane, let's follow a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n\
      1. **Identify the location of Arba Minch**:  \n   Arba Minch is a city in southern\
      \ Ethiopia, located in East Africa. Ethiopia is situated roughly between 33\xB0\
      E and 48\xB0E longitude.\n\n2. **Identify the location of Inishvickillane**:\
      \  \n   Inishvickillane is one of the Blasket Islands, located off the west\
      \ coast of County Kerry in Ireland. Ireland is situated roughly between 5\xB0\
      W and 10\xB0W longitude.\n\n3. **Compare longitudes**:  \n   Arba Minch (around\
      \ 37\xB0E) is significantly east of Inishvickillane (approximately 10\xB0W).\
      \ \n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   Since Arba Minch is at a much higher (more eastern)\
      \ longitude than Inishvickillane, Arba Minch is east of Inishvickillane.\n\n\

    b028bd1d-319b-4e06-840b-51e4c7618150: "Let's analyze the question step by step:\n\
      \n1. **Identify the locations:**\n   - **Arba Minch** is a city in southern\
      \ Ethiopia, which is located in East Africa.\n   - **Inishvickillane** is one\
      \ of the Blasket Islands, located off the west coast of Ireland, in Western\
      \ Europe.\n\n2. **Determine the relative longitudinal positions:**\n   - Ethiopia\
      \ is in the Eastern Hemisphere. Arba Minch has a longitude of approximately\
      \ 37\xB0 East.\n   - Ireland is in the Western Hemisphere. Inishvickillane has\
      \ a longitude of approximately 10\xB0 West.\n\n3. **Compare longitudes:**\n\
      \   - Since Arba Minch is at 37\xB0 East and Inishvickillane is at 10\xB0 West,\
      \ Arba Minch is significantly farther east than Inishvickillane.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Arba Minch is **east** of Inishvickillane, not west.\n\nAnswer: **NO**."
