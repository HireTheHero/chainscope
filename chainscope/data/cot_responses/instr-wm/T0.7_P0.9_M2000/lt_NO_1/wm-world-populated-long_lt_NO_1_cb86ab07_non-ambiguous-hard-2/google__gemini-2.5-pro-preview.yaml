      in South Africa. Mpumalanga is in the northeast, and KwaZulu-Natal is on the
      eastern coast, south of Mpumalanga. Both are in the eastern part of South Africa.

      2.  **Identify Stoke Bardolph:** This is a village in Nottinghamshire, England,

      London, is where it''s defined), with Stoke Bardolph being slightly west of
      it.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal (in South Africa)
      are located east of Stoke Bardolph (in the UK), not west.
