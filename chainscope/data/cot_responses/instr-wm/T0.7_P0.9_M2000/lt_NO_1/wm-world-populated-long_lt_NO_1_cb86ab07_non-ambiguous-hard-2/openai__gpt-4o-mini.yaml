    c28cf727-541b-4e3c-80bb-fcb9e328ce51: 'To determine if Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal
      is located west of Stoke Bardolph, we need to first identify the locations involved:


      1. **Stoke Bardolph**: This is a village located in Nottinghamshire, England.

      2. **Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal**: This seems to be a bit of a mix-up. Mpumalanga
      is a province in South Africa, while KwaZulu-Natal is another separate province
      in South Africa. They are not typically referred to together as a single location.


      Now, let''s consider the geographical positions:


      - Stoke Bardolph is in the northern part of England.

      - Mpumalanga is situated in the northeastern part of South Africa, while KwaZulu-Natal
      is located to the southeast of South Africa.


      Given that both Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal are in the Southern Hemisphere
      and much further south than Stoke Bardolph in England, it is clear that they
      are not west of Stoke Bardolph but rather south and east.


      After this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      NO.'

      2. **Mpumalanga**: This is a province in South Africa, located in the northeastern
      part of the country, known for its natural beauty and attractions like the Kruger
      National Park.


      3. **KwaZulu-Natal**: This is another province in South Africa, located on the
      eastern coast of the country, bordering the Indian Ocean.


      Now, let''s determine the relative positions:


      - Stoke Bardolph is in England, which is situated to the north of Africa.

      - Mpumalanga is located further south and slightly to the west compared to KwaZulu-Natal.


      Since Stoke Bardolph is in England and Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal are in South
      Africa, Mpumalanga is not directly west of Stoke Bardolph but rather south and
      slightly to the west when comparing overall geographic locations.

      both places.


      1. **Nusa Kambangan**: This is an island located off the southern coast of Java,
      Indonesia. It is situated in the Indian Ocean.


      2. **Bhiwapur**: This is a town in the Nagpur district of Maharashtra, India,
      which is located to the east of Nusa Kambangan.


      Now, considering the geographical positions:

      - Nusa Kambangan is to the south of Java and relatively closer to the Indian
      Ocean.

      - Bhiwapur is located in India, to the east of the Indian Ocean.


      Since Nusa Kambangan is located to the south of Java (and thus further south
      than Bhiwapur) and east of Bhiwapur, it cannot be west of Bhiwapur.

      2. **Location of Agame**: Agame is a district in the Central African Republic.

      2. **Brandywine, Maryland**: Brandywine is a community located in Prince George''s

      - Llanddona is situated in the UK, while Brandywine is in the USA. They are
      in different countries and on different continents.

      - To determine if Llanddona is west of Brandywine, we would consider their longitudes.
      Llanddona is located approximately at a longitude of around -4.15 degrees (west),
      while Brandywine is at approximately -76.9 degrees (west).


      Now, looking at their longitudes:

      - Since Llanddona''s longitude is significantly less negative (closer to zero)
