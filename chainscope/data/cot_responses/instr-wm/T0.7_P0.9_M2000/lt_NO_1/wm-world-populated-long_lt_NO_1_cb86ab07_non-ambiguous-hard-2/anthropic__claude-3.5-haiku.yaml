      1. First, let''s locate Bhaluka Upazila:

      - Bhaluka Upazila is a sub-district located in Mymensingh District, Bangladesh

      - It is in the northern part of Bangladesh


      2. Next, let''s locate Umbilo, Durban:

      - Umbilo is a suburb in Durban, South Africa

      - It is located in the southern part of Africa


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Bhaluka Upazila is in Bangladesh (South Asia)

      - Umbilo is in South Africa (southern Africa)

      - These locations are on different continents, separated by thousands of miles


      4. To determine if Bhaluka Upazila is west of Umbilo:

      - Given their vastly different locations, it would not make sense to say one
      is west of the other

      - They are in completely different parts of the world


      5. Conclusion:

      The question cannot be answered with a simple west/east orientation due to the
      extreme geographical distance.

      1. First, I''ll locate Bulloch County, Georgia on a map

      - Bulloch County is located in southeastern Georgia

      - Its county seat is Statesboro

      - It is in the eastern part of Georgia


      2. Next, I''ll locate Litchfield, California on a map

      - Litchfield is located in Lassen County, California

      - It is in the northeastern part of California


      3. Compare their geographic positions

      - Bulloch County is on the East Coast (eastern United States)

      - Litchfield is in the western United States (California)

      - The entire state of California is west of Georgia


      4. Determine relative positioning

      - Since California is west of Georgia, any location in California (including
      Litchfield) would be west of any location in Georgia (including Bulloch County)


      5. Therefore, the statement is FALSE - Bulloch County is NOT west of Litchfield,
      California.
