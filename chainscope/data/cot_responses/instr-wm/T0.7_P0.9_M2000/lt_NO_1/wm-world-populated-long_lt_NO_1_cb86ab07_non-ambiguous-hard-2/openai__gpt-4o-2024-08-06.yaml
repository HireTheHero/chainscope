      but let''s assume you mean a place in the vicinity for this comparison.


      1. First, identify the coordinates or relative positions of both locations.

      Assuming Koltur is a location near Gopalpur in the same region of Odisha, it''s
      likely that Gopalpur is east of Koltur due to its coastal position.

      coast of India along the Bay of Bengal.


      2. **Identify the location of Koltur**: Assuming Koltur refers to a specific

      2. **Brandywine, Maryland** is a community located in the United States, specifically
      in Prince George''s County, which is in the eastern part of the country.


      Now, we need to compare the longitudinal positions of these two locations:


      - The United Kingdom, where Llanddona is located, is generally west of the Prime
      Meridian, while the eastern United States, where Brandywine is located, is generally
      west of the Prime Meridian as well, but significantly further west compared
      to the UK.


      Therefore, Llanddona is east of Brandywine, Maryland.


      The answer is: NO.'
