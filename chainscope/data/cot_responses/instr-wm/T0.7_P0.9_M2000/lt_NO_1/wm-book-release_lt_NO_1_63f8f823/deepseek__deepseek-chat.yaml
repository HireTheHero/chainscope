      We need to determine whether Rex Stout''s *Champagne for One* was released earlier
      than Agatha Christie''s *Ordeal by Innocence*. To do this, we''ll need to find
      the publication dates for both books and compare them.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Authors and Their Works

      First, let''s confirm that we''re talking about the correct authors and their
      respective books.


      - **Rex Stout**: An American writer known for his detective fiction, particularly
      the Nero Wolfe series.

      - **Agatha Christie**: A British author famous for her detective novels, including
      those featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple.


      The books in question are:

      - *Champagne for One* by Rex Stout

      - *Ordeal by Innocence* by Agatha Christie


      ### Step 2: Research the Publication Dates

      Next, we need to find the publication dates for both books.


      #### *Champagne for One* by Rex Stout

      A quick search reveals that *Champagne for One* was first published in **1958**.
      It is part of the Nero Wolfe series and is considered one of Stout''s notable
      works.


      #### *Ordeal by Innocence* by Agatha Christie

      Researching *Ordeal by Innocence*, we find that it was published in **1958**
      as well. This novel is a standalone mystery, not featuring Christie''s famous
      detectives like Poirot or Marple.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Publication Years

      Both books were published in the same year, 1958. To determine which one came
      out earlier, we need to look at the specific publication months, if available.


      #### *Champagne for One*

      Further investigation shows that *Champagne for One* was published in **May
      1958**.


      #### *Ordeal by Innocence*

      *Ordeal by Innocence* was published in **November 1958**.


      ### Step 4: Determine Which Book Was Released First

      Now that we have the specific publication months:

      - *Champagne for One*: May 1958

      - *Ordeal by Innocence*: November 1958


      Clearly, *Champagne for One* was published several months before *Ordeal by
      Innocence* in the same year.


      ### Conclusion

      Based on the publication dates, **Rex Stout''s *Champagne for One*** was indeed
      released earlier than **Agatha Christie''s *Ordeal by Innocence***.


      **YES**, *Champagne for One* was released earlier than *Ordeal by Innocence*.'

      - reCAPTCHA was released sometime in **2007**, but likely after May since it

      - *Starless Night* was released in **August 1993**.

      - *The Sculptress* was released in **March 1993**.


      Since *The Sculptress* was published in March 1993 and *Starless Night* was
      published in August 1993, *The Sculptress* was released earlier.


      **Answer: NO** (R. A. Salvatore''s *Starless Night* was not released earlier
      than Minette Walters''s *The Sculptress*).'

      \ Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences*. To\
      \ answer this, we'll need to find the publication dates of both books.\n\n###\
      \ Step 1: Identify the Authors and Titles\nFirst, let's make sure we're clear\
      \ on the authors and the full titles of the books in question.\n\n- **Richard\
      \ Fari\xF1a**: The author of *Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me*.\n-\
      \ **Truman Capote**: The author of *In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple\
      \ Murder and Its Consequences*.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Publication Date of\
      \ *Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me*\nNext, we'll look up the publication\
      \ date of Richard Fari\xF1a's book.\n\nUpon researching, I find that *Been Down\
      \ So Long It Looks Like Up to Me* was published in **1966**.\n\n### Step 3:\
      \ Find the Publication Date of *In Cold Blood*\nNow, we'll determine the publication\
      \ date of Truman Capote's *In Cold Blood*.\n\nResearch indicates that *In Cold\
      \ Blood* was first published in **1965**.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Publication\
      \ Dates\nNow that we have both publication dates:\n\n- *Been Down So Long It\
      \ Looks Like Up to Me*: **1966**\n- *In Cold Blood*: **1965**\n\n### Step 5:\
      \ Determine Which Book Was Released Earlier\nComparing the two dates:\n\n- **1965**\
      \ is earlier than **1966**.\n\nTherefore, *In Cold Blood* was published before\
      \ *Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me*.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the\
