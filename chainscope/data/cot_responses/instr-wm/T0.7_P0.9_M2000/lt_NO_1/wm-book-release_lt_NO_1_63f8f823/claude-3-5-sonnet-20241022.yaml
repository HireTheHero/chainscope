      2. Let me find when Michael Wolff''s Burn Rate was released

      - Burn Rate was published in 1998


      3. Let me find more specific dates

      - The Star Wars Encyclopedia was released in November 1998

      - Burn Rate was released in June 1998


      4. Compare the dates:

      - June 1998 (Burn Rate) comes before November 1998 (Star Wars Encyclopedia)

      - Therefore, the Star Wars Encyclopedia was NOT released earlier than Burn Rate


      NO'

      - "The Fifty Year Sword" was first published in 2005 in a limited Dutch edition

      - It was more widely released in 2012


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Wilson''s book: 2005

      - Danielewski''s book: First edition in 2005


      4. Since both books were first released in the same year (2005), Wilson''s book
      was not released earlier.
