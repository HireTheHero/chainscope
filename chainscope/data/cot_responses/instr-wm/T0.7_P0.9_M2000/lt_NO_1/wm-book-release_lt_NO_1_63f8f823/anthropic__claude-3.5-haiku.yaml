      Death" (1995)


      4. The question asks: Was "Naked in Death" released earlier?

      - Since 1995 is later than 1987, the answer is NO


      NO'
    eb86d658-032e-401a-b7fc-da27ff700812: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll find the publication year for Naked in Death by Nora Roberts:

      - This is the first book in her "In Death" series

      - It was published in 1995


      2. Next, I''ll find the publication year for Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina
      by Tom Veitch:

      - This is a Star Wars anthology book

      - It was published in 1993


      3. Comparing the years:

      - Naked in Death: 1995

      - Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina: 1993

      - 1995 is later than 1993


      4. Therefore, Naked in Death was NOT released earlier than Tales from the Mos

      2016.


      3. I''ll look up Matt Zoller Seitz''s "Two Experts Pick the Greatest" - but
      I cannot find a book by this exact title. This might be an error in the book
      title.


      4. Without being able to confirm the publication date of the second book, I
      cannot definitively compare their release dates.


      5. However, since I know the publication date of Weinstein''s book (2016), and
      I cannot verify the other book''s existence or date, I cannot confidently answer
      the question.


      Given the information available, I do not have enough certainty to provide a
      YES or NO answer.'
