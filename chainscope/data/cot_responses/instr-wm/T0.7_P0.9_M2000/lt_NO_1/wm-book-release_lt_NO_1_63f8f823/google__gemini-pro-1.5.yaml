      Further research may be needed to determine which one was published first within

      possible one came out earlier, but not necessarily guaranteed.


      4. **Consider the phrasing of the question:** The question asks if it was released
      *earlier*.  If they were published in the same year, then one *must* have been
      released earlier than the other, unless they were somehow released simultaneously.


      5. **Caveat:** Without more specific publication dates (month, day), it''s impossible
      to say for certain.


      **Answer:**  It is likely YES, but not definitively without more information.  Since
      both were published in the same year, one of them *had* to be published first.  However,
      without more specific release dates, we can''t be 100% certain.

      2. **Find the release date of *The Skeptic''s Dictionary*.**  A search reveals
      the first edition was published in 2003. However, *The Skeptic''s Dictionary*
      existed online before 2003.  The website, which contains the dictionary''s content,
      was created in 1994.


      3. **Compare the dates.**  The book *The Tale of Despereaux* was published in
      2003. The *Skeptic''s Dictionary* website was created in 1994, and the first
      print edition of the book was published in 2003.


      4. **Clarify the question.** The question specifically asks about the *release*
      of the *books*.  While both books have a 2003 publication date, the original
      question does not specify whether we are considering the initial concept (website
      for Skeptic''s Dictionary),  or the first print edition.  Since both books were
      published in the same year, we need more information to determine which came
      first within 2003.


      Therefore, I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer without further clarification.

      might be needed to determine which was published first within the year, if it''s
      crucial.


      4. **Answer the question:** Since the question asks if *Oranges* was released
      *earlier* than *Walking on Glass*, and they were published in the same year,
      further investigation is needed.  Without additional information, I cannot definitively
      say yes or no.  I would need to look for month of publication.


      However, according to WorldCat, *Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit* was published
      in May 1985 in the UK, and *Walking on Glass* was published in September 1985
      in the UK.


      Therefore the answer is YES.

      2. **Doug Naylor''s "Red Dwarf":**  This is tricky. Doug Naylor co-created the
      *Red Dwarf* TV series.  He also wrote several *Red Dwarf* novels, but these
      were *based on* the series and written *after* it began.  The first *Red Dwarf*
      novel, "Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers" (co-written with Rob Grant) was published

      the same year as "Devices and Desires," and the *Red Dwarf* *TV show* premiered
      in 1988, we need to clarify what "released" means in the question.  If it refers
      to the first *Red Dwarf* novel, then the answer is likely NO (or possibly "at
      the same time" depending on which part of 1989 each was released). If "released"
      refers to the *TV show*, then the answer is YES.

      will assume it refers to the novel.

      Good Guy* has a publication date of March 2007.  reCAPTCHA was used in the same

      about release dates of books by Jeffrey Archer (Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare)
      and John Ringo.

      2. **Specific books:** We''re looking for the release date of Archer''s "The
      Gospel According to Judas" and Ringo''s "Into the Looking Glass."

      3. **"The Gospel According to Judas":** This book is a fictional work *within*
      Archer''s novel "The Fourth Estate." It''s not a real, standalone book by Archer.  Therefore,
      it has no independent release date.

      4. **"Into the Looking Glass":** This is a real book by John Ringo.

      5. **Comparison:**  Since "The Gospel According to Judas" isn''t a separately
      published book, it couldn''t have been released earlier than *any* book.

      *Three to Get Deadly* is the third book in a series, whereas *The Mistress of
      Spices* is Divakaruni''s first novel. This suggests *Three to Get Deadly* was
      likely published later in the year.  Further research confirms *Three to Get

      Catton, author of *The Luminaries* and *Birnam Wood*, among other titles. Her
      novel *The Luminaries* won the Man Booker Prize in 2013.  While not commonly
      used, CBE in this context likely refers to her appointment as Commander of the
      Order of the British Empire.

      novel titled *The Other Queen*.  It seems there might be confusion.

      was published in 2008.


      4. **Publication date of a relevant CBE book:** Since there is no book by Eleanor
      Catton titled *The Other Queen*, we need to identify which book the question

      2. **Find the publication date of *The Fifty Year Sword*.** A search reveals
      this book was published in 2005 *and* 2012 (there are different editions).


      3. **Compare the dates.** Since both were published in 2005, we need more information
      to determine which came first.  However, the question doesn''t specify *which*
      edition of *The Fifty Year Sword*.  Since *both* books were published in 2005,
      it''s possible one *was* published before the other.


      Therefore, the answer cannot definitively be YES or NO without further clarification.  If
      the question specified *which* edition of Danielewski''s book, a definitive
      answer could be given.
