      eastern Kentucky, their relative east-west position becomes clear

      - Kentucky, even its eastern portion, is still west of northeastern Georgia

      - Osage County is in northern Oklahoma

      - Rockwall County is in northeast Texas

      - Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas

      - Rockwall County is in northeast Texas, close to the eastern side of the state

      2) Looking at their relative positions:

      - San Luis Obispo County borders the Pacific Ocean

      - El Dorado County is inland, near the Nevada border

      1) First, let me recall the general locations:

      - Pittsburg County, OK is in eastern Oklahoma

      - Nobles County, MN is in southwestern Minnesota

      3) Looking at a mental map:

      - Minnesota borders South Dakota to its west

      - Oklahoma is roughly aligned with or slightly east of the Dakotas

      - Nobles County, being in SW Minnesota, is close to the South Dakota border

      - Pittsburg County is in the eastern part of Oklahoma

      3. Since Kentucky is north of Tennessee, I need to consider their east-west
      positioning:

      - Ballard County is in the westernmost part of Kentucky

      - Hardeman County is in western Tennessee, but not at the far western edge


      4. Checking their relative positions:

      - Ballard County is further west than Hardeman County

      - Ballard County is in Kentucky


      2. Considering their states:

      - Tennessee is south of Kentucky

      - Nevada is east of Oregon

      - Since Nevada is east of Oregon

      - And Lander County is in Nevada while Wallowa County is in Oregon

      - Therefore Lander County must be east of Wallowa County


      NO (Lander County, NV is not west of Wallowa County, OR - it''s east of it)'

      1) First, let me visualize the location of these counties in Mississippi:

      - Kemper County is located in east-central Mississippi, along the Alabama border

      - George County is located in southeastern Mississippi, along the Alabama border


      2) Looking at their relative positions:

      - Kemper County is much further north than George County

      - Both counties are on the eastern edge of Mississippi

      - George County is near the Gulf Coast

      - Kemper County is more in the middle (vertically) of the state


      3) In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Since both counties are along the Alabama border

      - And George County is further south along that border

      - They are roughly aligned on a north-south axis

      - With Kemper being slightly more to the west due to Mississippi''s eastern
      border curving slightly


      Therefore: YES, Kemper County is located slightly west of George County.

      - Oklahoma is south of South Dakota

      - Central South Dakota and western Oklahoma are both in the Great Plains region


      3. Looking at the map in my mind:

      - Hand County, SD is in the middle of South Dakota

      - Custer County, OK is in the western part of Oklahoma

      - South Dakota is in the northern central part of the US
