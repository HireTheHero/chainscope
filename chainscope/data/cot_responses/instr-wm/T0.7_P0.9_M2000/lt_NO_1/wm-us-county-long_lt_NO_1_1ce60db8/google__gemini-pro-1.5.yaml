      3. **Compare their longitudes:**  Since longitude determines east-west position,
      Burke County, being further west, would have a lower longitudinal value than
      Saluda County.


      4. **Visualize/Map:** Picturing a map, North Carolina is west of South Carolina.  Burke
      County is in western NC and Saluda County is in central-west SC, so Burke County
      is west of Saluda County.
