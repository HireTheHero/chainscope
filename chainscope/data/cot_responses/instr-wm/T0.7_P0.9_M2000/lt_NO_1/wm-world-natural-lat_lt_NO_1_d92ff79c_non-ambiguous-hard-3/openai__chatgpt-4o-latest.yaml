      south of the Thanon Thong Chai Range, we need to identify the geographic locations
      of both Baiyang Lake and the Thanon Thong Chai Range.


      Step 1: Locate Baiyang Lake.

      - Baiyang Lake (also known as Baiyangdian) is located in Hebei Province, China.
      It is situated in the North China Plain, southwest of Beijing.


      Step 2: Locate the Thanon Thong Chai Range.

      - The Thanon Thong Chai Range is a mountain range located in northern Thailand.
      It is part of the larger Shan Hills and includes Thailand''s highest peak, Doi
      Inthanon.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Baiyang Lake is in northern China, which is significantly farther north in
      latitude than northern Thailand, where the Thanon Thong Chai Range is located.


      Conclusion:

      Since Baiyang Lake is located in northern China and the Thanon Thong Chai Range
      is in northern Thailand, Baiyang Lake is clearly north of the Thanon Thong Chai
      Range.
