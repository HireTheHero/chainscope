      1. **Locate Lake Boyukshor**: Lake Boyukshor is situated in Azerbaijan, near
      the capital city of Baku. It is a large, saline lake.


      2. **Locate the Guardafui Channel**: The Guardafui Channel is a body of water
      that separates the Horn of Africa (specifically Somalia) from the Socotra Archipelago.

      3. **Geographical Considerations**: Lake Boyukshor is located in the northeastern
      part of the Azerbaijan region, while the Guardafui Channel is much further south,
      off the coast of Somalia.


      Given that Lake Boyukshor is in the north (Azerbaijan) and the Guardafui Channel

      Now, evaluating the positions of these two places:


      - Lake Ashi is in Japan, while the Kitanglad Mountain Range is in the Philippines.

      - The distance between Japan and the Philippines is significant, with Japan
      located to the north of the Philippines.
