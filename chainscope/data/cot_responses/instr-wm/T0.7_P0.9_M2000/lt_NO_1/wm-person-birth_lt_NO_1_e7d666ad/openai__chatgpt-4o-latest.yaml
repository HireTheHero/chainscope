    b2c28e8a-a6c2-4ece-afa9-67d1d37b70e0: '1. Abbas ibn Ali was born in the year 647
      CE.

      2. Sun Guoting, the Chinese calligrapher, lived during the Tang dynasty and
      is known for his work from the mid-7th century.

      3. Sun Guoting passed away in 691 CE, and his most famous work, *Shu Pu* (Treatise
      on Calligraphy), was written in 687 CE.

      4. Though Sun Guoting''s birth year is not precisely recorded, he was active
      in the later part of the 7th century.

      5. Given that Abbas ibn Ali was born in 647 CE, it is reasonable to assume that
      he was born earlier than Sun Guoting, who was active in the second half of the
      7th century.


      **Final Answer: YES**'

      2. Sun Guoting, a Chinese calligrapher, lived during the Tang dynasty and died
      in 691 CE.

      3. Since Abbas ibn Ali was born in 647 CE and Sun Guoting died in 691 CE, we
      need to determine when Sun Guoting was born.

      4. Sun Guoting''s exact birth year is not well recorded, but he was active in
      the mid-to-late 7th century.

      5. Given that Sun Guoting died in 691 CE, he was likely born after 647 CE.


      Since Abbas ibn Ali was born in 647 CE and Sun Guoting was likely born later,
      the answer is:


      **YES.**'
