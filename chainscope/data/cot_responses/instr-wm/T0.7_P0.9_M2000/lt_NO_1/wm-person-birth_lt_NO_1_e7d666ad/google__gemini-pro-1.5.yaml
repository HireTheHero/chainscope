      3. **Comparison:**  Early 2nd century BCE comes *before* the mid-2nd century
      BCE.


      Therefore, YES, Judah Maccabee was likely born earlier than Zhang Qian.

    b68b315e-4a1e-43c3-afa5-ef85ea945875: '1. **Ptolemy XIV''s timeframe:** Ptolemy
      XIV Philopator was a Pharaoh of Egypt who lived in the 1st century BC.  He was
      Cleopatra''s younger brother and (briefly) husband.  He died in 44 BC.


      2. **Dionysius of Halicarnassus''s timeframe:** Dionysius of Halicarnassus was
      a Greek historian and rhetorician who lived during the late 1st century BC,
      having been born around 60 BC and dying around 7 BC.


      3. **Comparison:** Ptolemy XIV died in 44 BC. Dionysius of Halicarnassus was
      born around 60 BC. Therefore, Ptolemy XIV must have been born *before* 44 BC.  Dionysius
      was born *after* 60 BC.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since Ptolemy XIV was born before 44 BC and Dionysius was
      born around 60 BC, Ptolemy XIV was born earlier.

      BCE.  His birth would have been a few decades earlier, likely sometime in the
      2nd century BCE.


      2. **Find approximate dates for Empress Wei Zifu:** She lived during the Han
      Dynasty and was Empress from 128 to 121 BCE.  Therefore, she was born sometime
      before 128 BCE, likely in the early 2nd century BCE.


      3. **Compare the timeframes:** Both individuals were likely born in the 2nd
      century BCE. While the exact dates are difficult to pin down, Antiochus XII
      Dionysus''s reign and therefore likely birth was *later* than Wei Zifu''s time
      as Empress. This suggests Wei Zifu was born earlier.
