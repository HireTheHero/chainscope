      Revolt against the Seleucid Empire. He lived in the 2nd century BCE and died

      160 BCE and was an adult military leader, he was likely born sometime around
      200-190 BCE.

      - Judah Maccabee: ~200-190 BCE

      - Zhang Qian: ~195 BCE

      2) Zhuge Hui was a military general of the Eastern Jin dynasty in China who

      4) Given their death dates (Joseph around 355-356 CE and Zhuge Hui in 345 CE)
      and their comparable periods of activity, we cannot definitively determine who
      was born earlier.


      Since we don''t have enough information to determine their relative birth dates
      with certainty, I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer. The most honest
      response would be that we don''t have enough information to answer this question.
