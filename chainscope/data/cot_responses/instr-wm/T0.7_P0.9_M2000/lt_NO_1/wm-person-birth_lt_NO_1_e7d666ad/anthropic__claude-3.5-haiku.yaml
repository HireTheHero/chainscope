      - Judah Maccabee was active in the mid-2nd century BCE

      - Zhang Qian was born slightly earlier, in the late 2nd century BCE


      5. Conclusion:

      Since Zhang Qian was born earlier than Judah Maccabee, the answer is:


      NO'

      3. Zeno of Elea lived approximately from 490 BC to 430 BC.

      4. More specifically, Yang Cishan lived in the late 11th to early 12th century,
      which overlaps with Aimar V''s lifetime.


      5. However, the specific birth dates of these individuals are not precisely
      known.


      6. Given the historical context and geographical regions they lived in, I cannot
      confidently state which one was born earlier.


      7. Without precise birth dates, I cannot definitively answer whether Aimar V
      was born earlier than Yang Cishan.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. Since I cannot be certain,
      I will default to the most conservative response.


      Answer: NO'

      1. Duke Cheng of Qi was a ruler in ancient China, specifically in the state
      of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period.


      2. King Hiram I was a ruler of Tyre, a Phoenician city-state, who is mentioned
      in the Bible and lived around the late 10th century BCE.


      3. The Spring and Autumn period in China lasted from approximately 771 to 476
