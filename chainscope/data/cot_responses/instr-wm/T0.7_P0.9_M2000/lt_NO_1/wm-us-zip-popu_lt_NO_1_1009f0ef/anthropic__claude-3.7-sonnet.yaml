      Step 1: I need to identify which locations these zip codes represent.

      - 26354 is a zip code in West Virginia (WV)

      - 83661 is a zip code in Idaho (ID)


      Step 2: I need to determine the population of each zip code area.

      - Zip code 26354 (WV) appears to be in a rural area of West Virginia, likely
      covering Philippi or surrounding areas. West Virginia is generally less densely
      populated, and rural zip codes there typically have small populations, often
      in the low thousands.

      - Zip code 83661 (ID) appears to be in Idaho, likely covering New Plymouth or
      surrounding areas. While Idaho is also relatively rural overall, some of its
      zip codes can have moderate populations.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Based on general demographic patterns, West Virginia has been experiencing population
      decline, especially in rural areas, while many parts of Idaho have seen growth.
      Rural West Virginia zip codes typically have smaller populations than comparable
      areas in Idaho.


      Zip code 26354 in rural West Virginia is very likely to have a smaller population
      than zip code 83661 in Idaho.

      - 26354 is a zip code in West Virginia (WV)

      - 83661 is a zip code in Idaho (ID)


      Step 2: Consider what I know about these specific zip codes.

      - 26354 appears to be in a rural area of West Virginia

      - 83661 appears to be in Idaho, likely also rural or small town


      Step 4: Without specific population figures for these zip codes, I need to acknowledge
      the limitations of my knowledge.

      I don''t have sufficient information to make a definitive comparison of the
      populations of these specific zip codes.

      Step 2: I need to compare the populations of these zip codes.

      - Zip code 26354 serves the Morgantown area in West Virginia

      - Zip code 83661 serves the New Plymouth area in Idaho


      Step 3: Based on demographic data:

      - Morgantown area (26354) in WV is a university town with West Virginia University

      Step 2: Consider what information I have about these specific zip codes.

      I don''t have direct population data for these specific zip codes in my knowledge.


      Step 3: Consider general population patterns.

      - West Virginia is a relatively small state with a total population of about
      1.8 million.

      - Idaho is also a less populous state with about 1.8-1.9 million people.

      - Rural zip codes in both states would typically have small populations.

      - 26354 appears to be in a rural area of West Virginia.

      - 83661 appears to be in a rural area of Idaho.


      Step 4: Consider regional differences.

      Step 4: Consider the nature of the zip codes.

      The 26354 zip code in WV is likely a rural area, as West Virginia is predominantly
      rural.

      The 83661 zip code in ID is also likely rural, as most of Idaho outside Boise

      - 26354 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 83661 is in Idaho (ID)


      Step 2: Find the population information for each zip code.

      - Zip code 26354 (WV) corresponds to Philippi, West Virginia. This is a small
      rural area with an approximate population of around 3,000-4,000 people.

      - Zip code 83661 (ID) corresponds to New Plymouth, Idaho. This is also a small
      rural area with an approximate population of around 1,500-2,000 people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Based on demographic data, Philippi, WV (26354) typically has a larger population
      than New Plymouth, ID (83661). Philippi is a small city while New Plymouth is
      a very small town.


      Step 4: Determine which is less populous.

      Since 83661 (New Plymouth, ID) appears to have fewer residents than 26354 (Philippi,

      - 85629 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 60459 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Let me recall population data for these specific zip codes.

      - 85629 (AZ) corresponds to Sahuarita, Arizona, which has a population of approximately
      15,000-20,000 people.

      - 60459 (IL) corresponds to Burbank, Illinois (Chicago suburb), which has a
      population of approximately 25,000-30,000 people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Based on the population data, 85629 (Sahuarita, AZ) has fewer residents than

      - 21225 covers part of Baltimore (a major city) and nearby areas like Brooklyn/Curtis
      Bay


      Step 3: Compare the population data.

      - Baltimore is one of the largest cities in Maryland with dense urban areas

      - Lake Charles is smaller than Baltimore, and Louisiana is generally less densely
      populated than Maryland, especially in the areas around major East Coast cities

      - Zip code 21225 is part of the Baltimore metropolitan area, which would likely
      have higher population density than a zip code in Lake Charles


      Step 4: Make a determination based on typical population patterns.

      - Urban zip codes in major metropolitan areas like Baltimore typically have
      higher populations than zip codes in smaller cities like Lake Charles


      Based on this reasoning, 70601 in Lake Charles, LA is likely less populous than
      21225 in the Baltimore area, MD.

      if 70601, LA is less populous than 21225, MD.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 70601 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)

      - 21225 is a zip code in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Determine the population of 70601, LA.

      70601 is a zip code in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Lake Charles is a mid-sized
      city in southwestern Louisiana. While I don''t have the exact population figure
      for this specific zip code, Lake Charles has a total population of approximately
      70,000-80,000 people, and 70601 would represent a portion of this city.


      Step 3: Determine the population of 21225, MD.

      21225 is a zip code in the Baltimore area of Maryland. This zip code covers
      parts of Brooklyn and Curtis Bay, which are densely populated urban/suburban
      areas within the Baltimore metropolitan region. The Baltimore metro area is
      much larger than Lake Charles, with the city proper having over 600,000 residents.

      Based on the locations, 21225 is part of a major metropolitan area (Baltimore),
      while 70601 is in a mid-sized city (Lake Charles). Urban zip codes in major
      metropolitan areas like Baltimore typically have higher population densities
      than those in smaller cities.


      Step 5: Make a conclusion based on the available information.

      Given that 21225 is in the Baltimore metropolitan area, which is significantly
      more populous than Lake Charles, and considering the urban nature of the Baltimore
      zip code versus the smaller city context of the Louisiana zip code, it''s reasonable
      to conclude that 70601, LA likely has fewer residents than 21225, MD.

      Zip code 85941 corresponds to Lakeside, Arizona, which is a small community
      in the White Mountains region. While I don''t have the exact population figure,
      it''s a rural area with a relatively small population.


      Step 2: I need to identify the population of zip code 65355, MO.

      I''m not finding specific information about zip code 65355 in Missouri. This
      may be because it''s either a very small community or possibly not a currently
      used zip code.


      Step 3: Compare the available information.

      Without precise population figures for both zip codes, I cannot make a definitive
      comparison. Lakeside, AZ (85941) is a known small town, while 65355, MO appears
      to be either very small or possibly not a standard residential zip code.

      in population density.


      Step 3: Think about typical population densities.

      - Urban zip codes in the NYC metro area (including Jersey City) tend to be among
      the most densely populated in the country.

      - Florida zip codes, even in Miami, typically have lower population density
      than those in the immediate NYC area.


      Step 4: Make a reasoned judgment.

      - 07306 in Jersey City is likely to be more densely populated as it''s in one
      of the most densely populated regions of the US.

      - 33018 in Florida, while in a populated area, is likely to have fewer people
      than a dense urban Jersey City zip code.


      Based on this reasoning, I believe that 33018, FL is less populous than 07306,
      NJ.

      Step 4: Any valid zip code with any population (like 10927 in NY) would have
      more people than an invalid zip code.


      NO (10927, NY is NOT less populous than 39705, MS, since 39705 appears to be

      Mississippi.


      Step 1: Let me check if these are valid zip codes.

      - 10927 appears to be a valid zip code in New York

      - 39705 - I need to verify if this is a valid zip code in Mississippi


      Step 2: Upon checking, I don''t believe 39705 is a valid, populated zip code
      in Mississippi. The 397xx range typically belongs to Columbus, MS area, but
      39705 specifically doesn''t appear to be an active residential zip code.


      Step 3: If one zip code is valid and populated (10927 NY) while the other (39705
      MS) is either not valid or essentially unpopulated, then the population comparison
      would indicate that 10927 NY has more people than 39705 MS (which would have
      zero or near-zero population).


      NO - 10927, NY is not less populous than 39705, MS. The New York zip code likely
      has some population, while the Mississippi zip code appears to be either invalid
      or essentially unpopulated.'

      zip code 10927 in New York is less than the population of zip code 39705 in
      Mississippi.


      Step 1: I need to identify these zip codes and their populations.


      Zip code 10927 is in Haverstraw, New York.

      Zip code 39705 appears to be in Mississippi.


      Step 2: I need to check if these are valid zip codes and find their populations.


      Upon checking, I need to note that 39705 does not appear to be a standard residential
      zip code in Mississippi. In fact, it may not be a valid residential zip code
      at all, as Mississippi zip codes typically start with 386, 387, 388, 389, or
      396.


      Step 3: Since one of the zip codes appears invalid or may be a special-purpose
      zip code (like a PO Box-only zip code), I need to determine how to answer.


      If 39705 is not a standard residential zip code or doesn''t exist, it would
      effectively have a population of zero or near zero.


      Zip code 10927 in Haverstraw, NY is a valid residential zip code with a population
      greater than zero.


      Therefore, 10927 NY would have a higher population than 39705 MS (which likely
      has very few or no residents).

      Step 1: Identify the ZIP codes in question.

      - 10927 in New York

      - 39705 in Mississippi


      Step 2: Research the population of 10927, NY.

      ZIP code 10927 appears to be in Haverstraw, NY, which is in Rockland County.
      This is in the New York City metropolitan area, which tends to be densely populated.


      Step 3: Research the population of 39705, MS.

      ZIP code 39705 appears to be in Columbus, MS, which is in Lowndes County. This
      is a more rural area of Mississippi.


      Step 4: Compare population estimates.

      Based on census data, ZIP codes in the New York City metropolitan area like
      10927 typically have higher population densities than rural Mississippi ZIP
      codes like 39705. Haverstraw, NY is in a more densely populated region than
      Columbus, MS.


      Step 5: Make a conclusion based on population data.

      ZIP code 10927 (Haverstraw, NY) has a higher population than ZIP code 39705
      (Columbus, MS).

      However, I don''t have access to current population data for specific ZIP codes.
      There''s another issue: ZIP code 39705 may not be a valid ZIP code. While 10927
      appears to be a valid ZIP code for Haverstraw, New York, I''m not certain that
      39705 is currently an active ZIP code in Mississippi (standard Mississippi ZIP
      codes typically start with 386, 387, 388, or 39).


      Without specific population data for these ZIP codes, I cannot make a definitive
      comparison. If 39705 is not a valid ZIP code, then the question itself has a

      Step 1: I need to identify these zip codes and their populations.


      Step 2: For zip code 10927 in New York:

      This appears to be a zip code in Haverstraw, NY. However, I don''t have the
      exact population data for this specific zip code.


      Step 3: For zip code 39705 in Mississippi:

      This doesn''t appear to be a valid or commonly recognized zip code in Mississippi.
      Mississippi zip codes typically start with 386, 387, 388, 389, or 396.


      Step 4: Since 39705 doesn''t appear to be a standard Mississippi zip code, it''s
      likely either very small or possibly not a residential zip code at all.


      Step 5: Without specific population data, I need to consider what we know about
      valid vs. potentially invalid zip codes. A valid residential zip code (10927)
      would have some population, while an invalid or non-residential zip code would
      effectively have zero or near-zero population.


      Based on this reasoning, 10927 NY is likely NOT less populous than 39705 MS,
      since 39705 may not be a standard residential zip code.

      - 10927 appears to be a valid ZIP code in New York

      - 39705 - I need to verify if this is a valid ZIP code in Mississippi


      Step 2: Research on ZIP code 39705 in Mississippi.

      Upon checking, 39705 does not appear to be a currently used ZIP code in Mississippi.
      The ZIP codes in Mississippi typically start with 386, 387, 388, 389, or 396,
      not 397. This suggests that 39705 is either not a valid ZIP code or is not currently
      in use.


      Step 3: Since one of the ZIP codes appears to be invalid or not in use, I cannot
      make a direct population comparison.

      - 10927 (Haverstraw, NY) is a real ZIP code with a population

      - 39705 (MS) appears to not be a currently used ZIP code, so it effectively
      has no population


      Step 4: If 39705 is not a valid/used ZIP code, its population would be zero
      or undefined, making 10927 more populous by default.


      NO - 10927, NY is not less populous than 39705, MS, because 39705 appears to
