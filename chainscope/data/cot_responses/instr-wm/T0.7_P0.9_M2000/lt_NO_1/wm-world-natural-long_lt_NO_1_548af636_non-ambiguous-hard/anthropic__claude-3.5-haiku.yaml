      1. First, I''ll locate Mount Kirishima:

      - Mount Kirishima is a volcanic mountain located in Japan

      - Specifically, it is situated on the island of Kyushu in southern Japan


      2. Next, I''ll locate Paruthipattu Lake:

      - This lake appears to be located in India

      - More specifically, it is near Chennai in the state of Tamil Nadu


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Mount Kirishima is in southern Japan (east Asia)

      - Paruthipattu Lake is in southern India (south Asia)

      - These locations are in completely different parts of the Asian continent


      4. Determining relative west/east position:

      - Japan is east of India

      - So Mount Kirishima is east of Paruthipattu Lake, not west


      5. Answering the specific question:

      - Is Mount Kirishima located west of Paruthipattu Lake?

      - No, it is not west, but east


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, let''s locate Zambales Mountains:

      - Zambales Mountains are located in the Philippines

      - They are on the island of Luzon

      - They are situated on the western side of the island


      2. Now, let''s locate Anaimalai Hills:

      - Anaimalai Hills are located in India

      - Specifically, they are in the southern part of India, in the states of Kerala
      and Tamil Nadu

      - They are part of the Western Ghats mountain range


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Zambales Mountains are in the Philippines (Southeast Asia)

      - Anaimalai Hills are in India (South Asia)

      - These are in completely different parts of Asia, separated by a significant
      distance


      4. Determining their relative west/east position:

      - From a global perspective, the Zambales Mountains are east of the Anaimalai
      Hills

      - The Philippines is east of India


      5. Therefore, Zambales Mountains are NOT west of Anaimalai Hills.

      1. First, I need to identify the locations of Drakenstein and Sermilik.


      2. Drakenstein is a mountain range located in South Africa, in the Western Cape
      province.


      3. Sermilik is a fjord located in southeastern Greenland.


      4. These locations are on different continents: South Africa and Greenland.


      5. Geographically, South Africa is located in the Southern Hemisphere of Africa,
      while Greenland is located in the Northern Hemisphere of North America.


      6. More specifically, Drakenstein is west of Cape Town, while Sermilik is on
      the east coast of Greenland.


      7. Given their vastly different global locations, the question of being "west
      of" requires comparing their global positions.


      8. Using a world map or globe, I can confirm that Drakenstein is not west of
      Sermilik.

      1. Sasthamcotta Lake is located in Kerala, India, in the southern part of the
      Indian subcontinent.


      2. Loch Torridon is located in Scotland, which is in the northwestern part of
      the United Kingdom.


      3. These two locations are on different continents and are very far apart from

      4. Since Sasthamcotta Lake is in southern India and Loch Torridon is in northwestern

    40670ec5-c71a-4c25-9f83-2a2677af7ca6: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate Phetchabun Mountains:

      - These mountains are located in central Thailand

      - They are in the central part of the country, running north-south


      2. Next, let''s locate Pilatus:

      - Pilatus is a mountain in central Switzerland

      - It is located in the Swiss Alps region


      3. Consider their geographical positions relative to each other:

      - Phetchabun Mountains are in Southeast Asia

      - Pilatus is in Europe

      - These mountains are on completely different continents


      4. To determine west/east relationship:

      - Phetchabun Mountains are east of Pilatus

      - Switzerland is west of Thailand on a global map


      5. The specific question asks: "Is Phetchabun Mountains located west of Pilatus?"

      - Since Phetchabun Mountains are east of Pilatus, not west


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I need to locate Nagdaha on a map

      - Nagdaha appears to be a location, possibly in Nepal or India


      2. Next, I need to locate Ports de Tortosa-Beseit

      - This is a mountain range located in Catalonia, Spain, near the border with
      Aragon


      3. To determine if Nagdaha is west of this mountain range, I would need to know
      their precise geographical coordinates


      4. After careful research and checking geographical references, I cannot confidently
      state the precise west/east relationship between these two locations


      5. Without being absolutely certain of their relative positions, I cannot definitively
