      if Sterling Memorial Library in Connecticut (CT) is located west of Mississinewa
      Lake Dam in Indiana (IN).


      To solve this, I need to know the relative positions of these two locations
      on the east-west axis:


      1) Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut (CT), which is a state in the
      northeastern United States.

      2) Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Indiana (IN), which is a state in the midwestern
      United States.


      Generally speaking, Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States,
      while Indiana is in the Midwest, significantly west of Connecticut.


      On a west-to-east direction across the United States:

      - West Coast states

      - Mountain states

      - Midwest states (including Indiana)

      - Northeast states (including Connecticut)

      - East Coast


      Therefore, Connecticut (where Sterling Memorial Library is located) is east
      of Indiana (where Mississinewa Lake Dam is located), not west of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the two places.

      - Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut (CT), which is a state in the
      northeastern United States.

      - Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Indiana (IN), which is a state in the midwestern
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic layout of the United States.

      - Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region, which is west of the northeastern
      states.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - When moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter
      Indiana before reaching Connecticut.

      - This means Connecticut (including Sterling Memorial Library) is east of Indiana
      (including Mississinewa Lake Dam).


      NO (Sterling Memorial Library is east of Mississinewa Lake Dam, not west of
      it)'

      to determine the geographical locations of Sterling Memorial Library in Connecticut
      (CT) and Mississinewa Lake Dam in Indiana (IN), and then compare their east-west
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Sterling Memorial Library is located at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

      - Mississinewa Lake Dam is located in Indiana.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      Connecticut is a state in the northeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast.

      Indiana is a state in the Midwest region of the United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - Connecticut is located on the East Coast

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest, west of Connecticut


      Therefore, if we''re comparing east-west positions, Connecticut (where Sterling
      Memorial Library is) would be EAST of Indiana (where Mississinewa Lake Dam is).


      So Sterling Memorial Library in CT is NOT west of Mississinewa Lake Dam in IN.
      Rather, it''s east of it.</think>I need to determine the east-west relationship

      Mississinewa Lake Dam is located in Indiana (IN).


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions based on states.

      Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is significantly east
      of Indiana. All of Connecticut is east of all of Indiana.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut (east) and Mississinewa Lake
      Dam is in Indiana (west), Sterling Memorial Library is east of Mississinewa
      Lake Dam, not west of it.

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Connecticut (CT) is in the northeastern United States, specifically in New
      England

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest region of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude):

      - Connecticut is on the East Coast

      - Indiana is in the interior of the country, west of Connecticut


      Since Connecticut is on the East Coast and Indiana is in the Midwest, Connecticut
      would be east of Indiana, not west. Therefore, Sterling Memorial Library in

      - Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States, in the New
      England region

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region, significantly inland from the East
      Coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - States in the Midwest (like Indiana) are west of the East Coast states (like
      Connecticut)

      - Therefore, Connecticut is east of Indiana, not west


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Since Sterling Memorial Library is in Connecticut, and Connecticut is east
      of Indiana, the library must be east of Mississinewa Lake Dam, not west of it.

      Souls in Asheville, North Carolina is west of Nashville Municipal Auditorium
      in Tennessee, I need to compare their geographical locations.


      First, let''s think about where these places are located:


      Asheville, NC is in western North Carolina, near the border with Tennessee.

      Nashville, TN is in the central part of Tennessee.


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider their relative positions.
      Tennessee is generally west of North Carolina, so a location in Tennessee would
      typically be west of a location in North Carolina.


      Nashville is in the middle of Tennessee, while Asheville is in the western part
      of North Carolina. Even though Asheville is in western NC, it''s still east
      of most of Tennessee, including Nashville.


      So based on general geographical knowledge, Nashville Municipal Auditorium in
      Tennessee would be west of Cathedral of All Souls in Asheville, North Carolina.


      Therefore, Cathedral of All Souls is NOT west of Nashville Municipal Auditorium.
      It''s east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Cathedral of All Souls is in Asheville, North Carolina

      - Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville, Tennessee

      - Generally, Tennessee is positioned west of North Carolina on the US map


      Step 2: Consider the specific cities within these states.

      - Asheville is located in western North Carolina

      - Nashville is located in central Tennessee


      Step 3: Compare their longitude positions.

      - Even though Asheville is in the western part of North Carolina, it''s still
      east of Nashville

      - Nashville, being in central Tennessee, is further west than Asheville


      Therefore, Cathedral of All Souls in Asheville, NC is NOT west of Nashville
      Municipal Auditorium in TN. It is east of it.

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Tennessee is inland, west of North Carolina

      - Generally, locations in Tennessee would be west of locations in North Carolina

      Even though Asheville is in western North Carolina, Nashville is still further
      west. Nashville is approximately in the center of Tennessee, while Asheville
      is near the western edge of North Carolina.

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast, while Tennessee is inland


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Asheville is in western North Carolina

      - Nashville is in central Tennessee


      Step 4: Despite Asheville being in western North Carolina, Nashville is still
      further west geographically. Even the western edge of North Carolina is generally

      \ the central United States.\n\nNext, let's determine where FirstBank Southwest\
      \ Tower is located. The \"Southwest\" in the name suggests it might be in the\
      \ southwestern part of Texas. Texas is south of Oklahoma and extends further\
      \ east and west than Oklahoma.\n\nSince the question specifies \"FirstBank Southwest\
      \ Tower, TX\", it's likely in the southwestern part of Texas, possibly in a\
      \ city like Amarillo, which is in the Texas Panhandle. The Texas Panhandle is\
      \ the northwestern portion of Texas that borders the western part of Oklahoma.\n\
      \nIf FirstBank Southwest Tower is indeed in Amarillo (or another city in the\
      \ Texas Panhandle), then it would be west of most of Oklahoma, but I need to\
      \ be more precise about the east-west positioning.\n\nNorman, Oklahoma (where\
      \ the National Weather Center is) is in central Oklahoma. Amarillo, Texas is\
      \ in the western part of the Texas Panhandle.\n\nLooking at a mental map, Amarillo\
      \ is actually west of Norman. So if FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Amarillo,\
      \ then the National Weather Center would NOT be west of it.\n\nLet me double-check\
      \ this: Norman, OK is at approximately 97.4\xB0 W longitude, while Amarillo,\
      \ TX is at approximately 101.8\xB0 W longitude. Since 97.4 is less than 101.8,\
      \ Norman is east of Amarillo.\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% certain that FirstBank\
      \ Southwest Tower is in Amarillo. If it's in a different part of Texas, the\
      \ answer could change.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine if the\
      \ National Weather Center in Oklahoma is west of FirstBank Southwest Tower in\
      \ Texas, I need to find their locations and compare their longitudes (east-west\
      \ positions).\n\n## Step 1: Locate the National Weather Center\nThe National\
      \ Weather Center is located in Norman, Oklahoma, which is in the central part\
      \ of Oklahoma.\n\n## Step 2: Locate FirstBank Southwest Tower\nFirstBank Southwest\
      \ Tower is located in Amarillo, Texas, which is in the Texas Panhandle (the\
      \ northwestern portion of Texas).\n\n## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions\n\
      - Norman, Oklahoma is approximately at 97.4\xB0 W longitude\n- Amarillo, Texas\
      \ is approximately at 101.8\xB0 W longitude\n\n## Step 4: Determine the answer\n\
      On a map, points with higher western longitude numbers are further west. Since\
      \ 101.8\xB0 W (Amarillo) is a larger number than 97.4\xB0 W (Norman), Amarillo\
      \ is further west than Norman.\n\n# Answer: NO\n\nThe National Weather Center\
      \ in Oklahoma is NOT located west of FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas. It\
      \ is actually east of it."

      to determine the locations of two buildings:

      1. National Weather Center in Oklahoma (OK)

      2. FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas (TX)


      Then I need to compare their geographical positions to determine if the National
      Weather Center is west of the FirstBank Southwest Tower.


      Let me think about the locations:


      The National Weather Center is in Norman, Oklahoma. Oklahoma is located in the
      central part of the United States.


      FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas. Based on the name "Southwest," it''s
      likely in the southwestern part of Texas. Let me think about the geography of
      Texas relative to Oklahoma.


      Oklahoma is directly north of Texas. Within these states, we need to consider
      the east-west positioning.


      If the FirstBank Southwest Tower is in southwest Texas (like El Paso), then
      it would be west of Oklahoma. In that case, the National Weather Center would
      NOT be west of the tower.


      However, if the FirstBank Southwest Tower is in the eastern or central part
      of Texas, then the National Weather Center in Oklahoma might be west of it.


      I believe the FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Amarillo, Texas, which is in the
      Texas Panhandle (the northernmost part of Texas). Amarillo is in the western
      part of the Texas Panhandle.


      Norman, Oklahoma (where the National Weather Center is located) is in central
      Oklahoma.


      Looking at a mental map, Amarillo is actually west of Norman. Therefore, the
      National Weather Center would be EAST of the FirstBank Southwest Tower, not
      west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two buildings.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - National Weather Center is in Norman, Oklahoma

      - FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Amarillo, Texas (in the Texas Panhandle)


      Step 2: Consider their geographical positions.

      - Norman, Oklahoma is located in central Oklahoma

      - Amarillo, Texas is located in the western part of the Texas Panhandle


      Step 3: Compare their longitude positions.

      - Amarillo is located farther west than Norman

      - The Texas Panhandle extends westward, with Amarillo being in the western portion

      - Norman, Oklahoma lies to the east of Amarillo


      Therefore, the National Weather Center (in Norman, OK) is located EAST of the
      FirstBank Southwest Tower (in Amarillo, TX), not west of it.

      I need to determine if the Cathedral Basilica of St. James in Brooklyn, NY is
      located west of Tappan Lake, OH.


      To answer this, I need to understand the relative geographic positions:


      1. Cathedral Basilica of St. James is in Brooklyn, New York

      2. Tappan Lake is in Ohio


      In the United States, the general geographic relationship is:

      - West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington) is the westernmost part

      - East Coast (including New York) is the easternmost part

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, between the East Coast and the central United States


      New York is on the East Coast, while Ohio is more inland to the west of New
      York. Therefore, locations in New York would generally be EAST of locations
      in Ohio, not west.

      Lake, OH - not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative geographical

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Cathedral Basilica of St. James is in Brooklyn, New York

      - Tappan Lake is in Ohio


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      In the US, states are arranged with the East Coast (including New York) on the
      eastern side of the country, and the Midwest (including Ohio) more toward the
      center.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      New York is located on the East Coast, while Ohio is located west of New York
      in the Midwest region. Therefore, any location in Brooklyn, NY would be east
      of locations in Ohio.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Brooklyn is east of Ohio, the Cathedral Basilica of St. James (Brooklyn,
      NY) is located EAST of Tappan Lake, OH - not west of it.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region, significantly west of New York


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      of Lake Ellsworth in Oklahoma and Kaibab Lake in Arizona, and then compare their
      east-west positions.


      First, let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United States

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States


      Typically, Arizona is west of Oklahoma. Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Oklahoma borders Texas to its south, Kansas to its north, Arkansas to its
      east, and New Mexico to its west

      - Arizona borders California to its west, Nevada to its northwest, Utah to its
      north, New Mexico to its east, and Mexico to the south


      Since Arizona is generally west of Oklahoma, it''s likely that lakes in Oklahoma
      would be east of lakes in Arizona. But I should be careful because specific
      locations within states could vary.


      Given the standard positioning of these states, Lake Ellsworth in Oklahoma would
      be east of Kaibab Lake in Arizona, not west of it.</think>To answer whether
      Lake Ellsworth (Oklahoma) is located west of Kaibab Lake (Arizona), I need to
      determine their relative positions.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic positions of the states.

      Oklahoma is located in the central United States, while Arizona is in the southwestern
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare the general east-west positioning of these states.

      Arizona lies significantly west of Oklahoma on a US map. Oklahoma''s western
      border connects with the Texas Panhandle and New Mexico, while Arizona is two
      states further west (beyond New Mexico).


      Step 3: Determine if there''s any unusual positioning of these specific lakes
      within their states.

      While lakes can be positioned anywhere within their respective states, they
      would need to overcome the substantial east-west distance between Oklahoma and
      Arizona to reverse the expected relationship.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Given the geographic positioning of these states, Lake Ellsworth in Oklahoma
      would be east of Kaibab Lake in Arizona, not west of it.


      NO, Lake Ellsworth (Oklahoma) is not located west of Kaibab Lake (Arizona).'

      In the United States, states that are further west have lower longitude values,
      and states that are further east have higher longitude values.


      Oklahoma is in the central part of the United States, while Arizona is in the

      Since Lake Ellsworth is in Oklahoma and Kaibab Lake is in Arizona, it''s most

      Step 4: Make the final determination about the lakes.

      Since Lake Ellsworth is in Oklahoma (an eastern state relative to Arizona),
      and Kaibab Lake is in Arizona (a western state relative to Oklahoma), Lake Ellsworth
      must be east of Kaibab Lake, not west of it.

      to determine the geographic locations of Badin Lake, NC and Chickamauga Lake,
      TN relative to each other - specifically whether Badin Lake is west of Chickamauga
      Lake.


      First, let me establish where these lakes are located:

      1. Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Chickamauga Lake is in Tennessee (TN)


      In general, Tennessee is west of North Carolina in the United States. Tennessee
      borders North Carolina on North Carolina''s western side.


      Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina, and Chickamauga Lake is in Tennessee,
      it would be unlikely that Badin Lake is west of Chickamauga Lake. It''s more
      likely that Badin Lake is east of Chickamauga Lake.


      To be more precise:

      - Badin Lake is located in central/western North Carolina

      - Chickamauga Lake is located in eastern Tennessee, near Chattanooga

      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' positions

      North Carolina (NC) and Tennessee (TN) are neighboring states, with Tennessee
      located directly west of North Carolina.


      ## Step 2: Consider the lakes'' locations within their states

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina

      - Chickamauga Lake is in Tennessee


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      Since Tennessee is west of North Carolina, and these lakes are in their respective
      states, Badin Lake (in NC) would be east of Chickamauga Lake (in TN).

      TN on a west-east basis.


      First, let me think about the states these lakes are in:

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Chickamauga Lake is in Tennessee (TN)


      In terms of the general geography of US states, Tennessee is west of North Carolina.
      Tennessee borders North Carolina on North Carolina''s western side.


      Given this state-level information, we would expect that most locations in Tennessee
      would be west of most locations in North Carolina. However, since these are
      specific lakes that could potentially be near the border between the states,
      I should think about their specific locations.


      Badin Lake is in the central part of North Carolina, not particularly close
      to the Tennessee border.


      Chickamauga Lake is in southeastern Tennessee, relatively close to the Georgia
      border.


      Based on this geographical knowledge, Chickamauga Lake in Tennessee would be
      west of Badin Lake in North Carolina, since Tennessee as a whole is west of
      North Carolina.


      So Badin Lake, NC is NOT west of Chickamauga Lake, TN. Rather, Badin Lake is
      EAST of Chickamauga Lake.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these lakes are located.

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Chickamauga Lake is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Examine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Tennessee is located west of North Carolina. The entire state of Tennessee is
      positioned to the west of North Carolina on a US map.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of these lakes within their states.

      - Badin Lake is located in central North Carolina

      - Chickamauga Lake is in southeastern Tennessee


      Step 4: Make the final determination based on the above information.

      Since Tennessee is entirely west of North Carolina, and these lakes are not
      in unusual border positions that would change this relationship, Chickamauga
      Lake must be west of Badin Lake.


      NO, Badin Lake, NC is not located west of Chickamauga Lake, TN. It is located

      Tennessee, including Chickamauga Lake.


      Chickamauga Lake is in Tennessee, which places it west of most points in North

    f7f15524-4976-4bf1-8138-1b4daa07f433: '<think>This question is asking about the
      relative east-west positions of two lakes in the United States:

      1. Badin Lake in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Chickamauga Lake in Tennessee (TN)


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Tennessee is inland, west of North Carolina


      Since Tennessee is generally west of North Carolina, it would be reasonable
      to assume that a lake in Tennessee (Chickamauga Lake) would be west of a lake
      in North Carolina (Badin Lake).


      However, I need to be careful about the exact locations, as states have irregular
      shapes and specific locations within states might not follow the general east-west
      relationship of the states themselves.


      North Carolina is definitely east of Tennessee along their entire border, so
      a lake in North Carolina would almost certainly be east of a lake in Tennessee.
      This means Badin Lake (in NC) would be east of Chickamauga Lake (in TN), not
      west of it.


      So Badin Lake is NOT west of Chickamauga Lake; rather, it''s east of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States, west of the Appalachian
      Mountains.

      North Carolina is also in the southeastern United States, but lies east of Tennessee,
      extending to the Atlantic coast.


      Step 2: Consider the state boundaries.

      The entire state of North Carolina is east of Tennessee. They share a border,
      with Tennessee to the west and North Carolina to the east.


      Step 3: Determine the lakes'' relative positions.

      Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina and Chickamauga Lake is in Tennessee,
      and North Carolina is entirely east of Tennessee, Badin Lake must be east of
      Chickamauga Lake, not west.

      Texas is generally west of Alabama. Alabama is on the Gulf Coast in the eastern

      - Alabama is entirely east of Texas on the map

      - Birmingham, Alabama is in the central part of Alabama

      - Fort Worth, Texas is in the north-central part of Texas


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Texas is west of Alabama, Fort Worth (in Texas) is west of Birmingham

      1. Wellmont Theater in New Jersey (NJ)

      2. LaDue Reservoir in Ohio (OH)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Wellmont Theater is west of LaDue Reservoir.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - New Jersey is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, but still east of the Mississippi River


      Generally speaking, Ohio is west of New Jersey. This means that locations in
      Ohio are typically west of locations in New Jersey, not the other way around.


      So if Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey, and LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio, then
      Wellmont Theater would be EAST of LaDue Reservoir, not west.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO, Wellmont Theater in NJ is not located west
      of LaDue Reservoir in OH.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are found.

      - Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, but still in the eastern half of the
      country


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Ohio is west of New Jersey

      - Therefore, locations in Ohio (including LaDue Reservoir) are generally west
      of locations in New Jersey (including Wellmont Theater)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific locations.

      - If Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey and LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio, then
      Wellmont Theater must be east of LaDue Reservoir, not west.


      NO, Wellmont Theater in NJ is not located west of LaDue Reservoir, OH.'

      Theater in New Jersey is located west of LaDue Reservoir in Ohio.


      First, let me establish the locations:

      - Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio (OH)


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their relative positions
      on a map. In the United States:

      - New Jersey is on the east coast

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, west of New Jersey


      Generally speaking, locations in Ohio are west of locations in New Jersey. But
      the question is asking if the NJ location is west of the Ohio location, which
      would be the reverse of the typical geographic relationship.


      Since New Jersey is east of Ohio, and Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey, while
      LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio, Wellmont Theater would be east of LaDue Reservoir,
      not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are situated.

      - Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of the East Coast states


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Ohio is west of New Jersey on a map of the United States, any location
      in Ohio (including LaDue Reservoir) would generally be west of locations in
      New Jersey (including Wellmont Theater).


      Step 4: Conclude based on this geographic relationship.

      Since Wellmont Theater is in New Jersey (east) and LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio
      (west), Wellmont Theater cannot be west of LaDue Reservoir.

      - New Jersey is a state on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Ohio is a state in the Midwest, but still relatively eastern part of the US


      Generally speaking, Ohio is west of New Jersey. So a location in New Jersey

      To answer this, I need to consider the geographical positions of these places.
      Let me think about the states first:

      - Idaho is east of Oregon (Oregon is on the Pacific coast, while Idaho is inland)


      Now, let''s think about these specific locations:

      - Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho, so it''s likely in the eastern part of the northwest

      Let me think about the geographic locations:

      - Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      Generally speaking, Idaho is east of Oregon, as Oregon is on the Pacific coast
      and Idaho is inland. The state boundary between Oregon and Idaho runs north-south,

      Oregon is located on the Pacific coast, while Idaho is an inland state.

      The state boundary between them runs north-south, with Oregon lying to the west
      of Idaho.


      Step 2: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho, which means it''s east of the Oregon-Idaho border.

      Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, which places it west of the Oregon-Idaho border.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Since Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho (east) and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (west),
      Arrowrock Dam must be east of Lost Creek Lake, not west of it.

      to determine the locations of both Arrowrock Dam in Idaho (ID) and Lost Creek
      Lake in Oregon (OR), and then compare their east-west positions.


      First, let me consider what I know about US geography:

      - Idaho (ID) is east of Oregon (OR)

      - Oregon is on the Pacific coast, while Idaho is inland

      - States in the western US generally follow a pattern where coastal states are
      west of inland states


      Since Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho, and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, and Oregon
      is west of Idaho, it''s likely that Arrowrock Dam is east of Lost Creek Lake,
      not west.


      To be more precise:

      - Arrowrock Dam would be somewhere in Idaho

      - Lost Creek Lake would be somewhere in Oregon

      - Given the general geography of these states, where Oregon is entirely west
      of Idaho, any location in Idaho would typically be east of any location in Oregon


      Therefore, it''s most likely that Arrowrock Dam (ID) is NOT located west of
      Lost Creek Lake (OR), but rather east of it.</think>I need to determine the
      relative east-west positions of these two water structures.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these structures are located.

      - Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Idaho and Oregon.

      - Oregon is located on the Pacific coast

      - Idaho is an inland state that borders Oregon to the east

      - Idaho is entirely east of Oregon


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Idaho is east of Oregon, and Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho while Lost Creek
      Lake is in Oregon, Arrowrock Dam must be east of Lost Creek Lake, not west of
      it.


      NO, Arrowrock Dam, ID is not located west of Lost Creek Lake, OR. It is located
      east of it.'

      Let me think about the geography of the western United States:

      - Idaho (ID) is directly east of Oregon (OR)

      - Oregon is on the Pacific coast, while Idaho is inland

      - Generally, locations in Idaho would be east of locations in Oregon


      Now, the specific locations:

      - Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho (ID)

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)


      Based on the general geography of these states, it''s very likely that Arrowrock
      Dam in Idaho is east of Lost Creek Lake in Oregon, not west of it.

      Lake, OR, but rather east of it.</think># Is Arrowrock Dam, ID located west
      of Lost Creek Lake, OR?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geography of the western United States.

      2) Oregon (OR) is located on the Pacific coast, while Idaho (ID) is an inland
      state.

      3) Oregon is directly west of Idaho in terms of their relative positions.

      4) Since Arrowrock Dam is in Idaho and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, we can
      determine their relative east-west positioning.

      5) Given that Idaho is east of Oregon, locations in Idaho (including Arrowrock
      Dam) would generally be east of locations in Oregon (including Lost Creek Lake).

      6) Therefore, Arrowrock Dam would be east of Lost Creek Lake, not west of it.


      NO - Arrowrock Dam, ID is not located west of Lost Creek Lake, OR.'

      Then I need to compare their east-west positions (longitudes) to determine if
      Bull Shoals Dam is west of the Plaza Hotel.


      Bull Shoals Dam is located in north central Arkansas, on the White River. Arkansas
      is generally located in the south-central United States.


      Las Vegas, New Mexico (not to be confused with the more famous Las Vegas, Nevada)
      is a city in northeastern New Mexico. New Mexico is located in the southwestern
      United States, west of Arkansas.

      - Arkansas is east of New Mexico

      - Therefore, Bull Shoals Dam in Arkansas would be east of the Plaza Hotel in

      - Bull Shoals Dam is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Plaza Hotel is in Las Vegas, New Mexico (NM) - not to be confused with Las
      Vegas, Nevada


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - On a US map, New Mexico is significantly west of Arkansas


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Bull Shoals Dam is in northern Arkansas

      - Las Vegas, NM is in northeastern New Mexico

      - Even accounting for their positions within their respective states, New Mexico
      is still west of Arkansas


      Since Bull Shoals Dam is in Arkansas (east) and the Plaza Hotel is in Las Vegas,
      New Mexico (west), Bull Shoals Dam cannot be west of the Plaza Hotel.

      To compare east/west positions, I need to consider their longitudes. In the
      US, locations further west have higher longitude values (when using west longitude
      notation with negative values) or lower longitude values (when using the east
      longitude notation with positive values).


      Let me think about the states first:

      - Arkansas (AR) is in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico (NM) is in the southwestern United States


      Generally, New Mexico is west of Arkansas. But I need to be more specific since
      I''m comparing specific locations within these states.


      Bull Shoals Dam is in northern Arkansas, near the Missouri border.

      Las Vegas, New Mexico is in northeastern New Mexico.


      Given the general geography of the US, New Mexico is definitely west of Arkansas.
      Even the eastern part of New Mexico is likely to be west of the western part
      of Arkansas. So the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas, NM is almost certainly west of
      Bull Shoals Dam, AR.


      Therefore, Bull Shoals Dam is NOT west of the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas, NM.
      Rather, Bull Shoals Dam is EAST of the Plaza Hotel.</think># Is Bull Shoals
      Dam, AR located west of Plaza Hotel (Las Vegas, New Mexico), NM?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two locations based
      on their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Bull Shoals Dam is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Plaza Hotel is in Las Vegas, New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - On a map of the US, New Mexico is clearly west of Arkansas


      Step 3: Even accounting for specific locations within each state:

      - Bull Shoals Dam is in northern Arkansas near the Missouri border

      - Las Vegas, New Mexico is in northeastern New Mexico

      - Even though I''m looking at specific points in each state, the entire state
      of New Mexico lies west of Arkansas


      Step 4: Conclusion based on U.S. geography.

      Since New Mexico is west of Arkansas, the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas, NM must
      be west of Bull Shoals Dam, AR. Therefore, Bull Shoals Dam is NOT west of the
      Plaza Hotel, but rather east of it.

      I need to determine if Bull Shoals Dam is located to the west of the Plaza Hotel.


      First, let me consider the general geography of Arkansas and New Mexico:

      - Arkansas is generally located in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States


      Generally speaking, New Mexico is west of Arkansas. However, I need to be more
      specific about these particular locations.


      Bull Shoals Dam is in northern Arkansas, likely in the north-central or northwestern
      part of the state.


      The Plaza Hotel is in Las Vegas, New Mexico - which is important to distinguish
      from the more famous Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas, NM is in the northeastern

      Even though New Mexico is generally west of Arkansas, since the Plaza Hotel

      In general, New Mexico is west of Arkansas. But I need to be more specific about

      I need to determine if Tellico Reservoir is west of Nimrod Lake.


      First, let me think about the general geographic positions of Tennessee and
      Arkansas:

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is west of Tennessee. The states roughly have this
      relationship:

      [Western states] <- Arkansas <- Tennessee <- [Eastern states]


      Since Tellico Reservoir is in Tennessee and Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas, it''s
      most likely that Tellico Reservoir is EAST of Nimrod Lake, not west.


      To be thorough, I should also consider that these water bodies might be near
      the borders of their respective states, which could potentially change their
      relative positions. However, even if they''re at the extreme edges of their
      states (Tellico at the western edge of TN and Nimrod at the eastern edge of

      2) Tennessee is in the southeastern United States.

      3) Arkansas is in the south-central United States.

      4) Arkansas is positioned west of Tennessee in the United States.


      5) Tellico Reservoir is located in Tennessee.

      6) Nimrod Lake is located in Arkansas.

      7) Since Arkansas is west of Tennessee, water bodies in Arkansas would generally

      First, I''ll recall the general geographic positions of Tennessee and Arkansas
      within the United States:

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern United States

      - Arkansas is west of Tennessee, in the south-central United States


      The Mississippi River generally forms the boundary between these states, with
      Arkansas on the western side and Tennessee on the eastern side.


      Based on the general locations of these states, it would be unlikely that Tellico
      Reservoir in Tennessee would be west of Nimrod Lake in Arkansas, since Tennessee
      as a whole is east of Arkansas.


      To be more specific:

      - Tellico Reservoir would be somewhere in Tennessee, which is entirely east
      of Arkansas

      - Nimrod Lake would be somewhere in Arkansas, which is entirely west of Tennessee

      Looking at the geographical positions of these states:

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - Arkansas is positioned west of Tennessee (the Mississippi River roughly forms

      ## Answer: NO


      Tellico Reservoir, TN is located east of Nimrod Lake, AR, not west of it.'

      TN (Tennessee) is located west of Nimrod Lake, AR (Arkansas), I need to think
      about the relative geographical positions of these two states and the specific

      First, let''s consider the general geographical positions of Tennessee and Arkansas:

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States, west of Tennessee


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is west of Tennessee. So if we''re comparing locations
      in these two states, the location in Arkansas would typically be west of the
      location in Tennessee.


      Tellico Reservoir is in Tennessee, and Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas. Based on
      the general state positions, Tellico Reservoir (TN) would be east of Nimrod
      Lake (AR), not west of it.


      So my reasoning suggests that Tellico Reservoir, TN is NOT located west of Nimrod
      Lake, AR, but rather east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative locations
      of these two bodies of water by examining their state locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these reservoirs are located.

      - Tellico Reservoir is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states relative to each other.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - Importantly, Arkansas is positioned to the west of Tennessee


      Step 3: Determine the relative positioning of the reservoirs.

      - Since Tellico Reservoir is in Tennessee, and Tennessee is east of Arkansas

      - And Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas, which is west of Tennessee

      - Tellico Reservoir must be east of Nimrod Lake, not west of it


      NO'

      Let me reason through the US geography:


      1. Tennessee (TN) is a state located in the southeastern United States.

      2. Arkansas (AR) is a state located in the south-central United States.

      3. Generally speaking, Arkansas is west of Tennessee. Tennessee borders Arkansas''s
      eastern neighbor (Mississippi) to the east.


      So based on the general state positions, a reservoir in Tennessee would typically
      be east of a lake in Arkansas, not west.


      Let me double-check by thinking about the specific locations:

      - Tellico Reservoir is in eastern Tennessee

      - Nimrod Lake is in west-central Arkansas


      This confirms my reasoning - Tellico Reservoir in Tennessee would be east of

      2) Arkansas is located west of Tennessee in the United States. Tennessee is
      in the southeastern US, while Arkansas is in the south-central region.

      3) Tellico Reservoir is in eastern Tennessee.

      4) Nimrod Lake is in west-central Arkansas.

      5) Since Arkansas as a whole is west of Tennessee, and these water bodies are
      within their respective states, Tellico Reservoir would be east of Nimrod Lake,

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Arkansas is positioned to the west of Tennessee


      Step 3: Since these reservoirs are in their respective states, their relative

      1. Civic Center Music Hall is in OK (Oklahoma)

      2. Lensic Theater is in NM (New Mexico)


      I need to determine which one is further west. Let me think about the geographic
      locations of these states:


      Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States. New Mexico is located
      in the southwestern United States.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, New Mexico is definitely west of Oklahoma.
      New Mexico borders Arizona to its west and Texas to its east, while Oklahoma
      borders Texas to its south and Kansas to its north.


      Since New Mexico is west of Oklahoma, any location in Oklahoma (including Civic
      Center Music Hall) would be east of any location in New Mexico (including Lensic

      Generally speaking, New York is east of Illinois. Let''s be more specific about
      the locations:


      - Basic Creek Reservoir is in New York (NY)

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in Illinois (IL), and likely in Chicago
      based on the name


      Since Illinois is west of New York, and Chicago is in Illinois, the Chicago
      Avenue Pumping Station would be west of Basic Creek Reservoir in New York.


      So the question is asking if Basic Creek Reservoir is west of Chicago Avenue
      Pumping Station, which would be the opposite of what I just determined.</think>To
      answer whether Basic Creek Reservoir, NY is located west of Chicago Avenue Pumping
      Station, IL, I need to consider the geographic locations of both places.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Basic Creek Reservoir is in New York (NY)

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      New York is located on the east coast of the United States, while Illinois is
      in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare specific locations.

      The Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, as suggested by its name, is likely in Chicago,
      Illinois. Basic Creek Reservoir is somewhere in New York state.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion based on geography.

      Illinois is west of New York. Therefore, Chicago Avenue Pumping Station (in
      Illinois) is west of Basic Creek Reservoir (in New York), not the other way
      around.


      NO, Basic Creek Reservoir, NY is not located west of Chicago Avenue Pumping
      Station, IL. It is east of it.'

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Illinois is located in the midwestern United States

      - On a map of the US, New York is clearly east of Illinois


      Step 3: More specifically about these locations.

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, as the name suggests, is in Chicago, Illinois

      - Basic Creek Reservoir is somewhere in New York state

      - Any location in New York state would be east of Chicago, Illinois


      Step 4: Conclusion.

      To answer this, I need to know the relative positions of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania,
      and then the relative positions of these specific locations within their states.


      In general, Massachusetts is located northeast of Pennsylvania on the US map.
      Massachusetts is on the eastern seaboard, and Pennsylvania is west of it. This
      means that most places in Massachusetts would be EAST of places in Pennsylvania,

      So if Bunch-of-Grapes is in Massachusetts (MA) and Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania

      2) Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA).


      3) To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their
      relative positions on a map. West means closer to the Pacific Ocean/further
      from the Atlantic Ocean in the US context.


      4) Generally speaking, Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States,
      on the Atlantic coast.


      5) Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern United States, but it''s southwest
      of Massachusetts.


      6) This means that locations in Massachusetts would typically be east of locations
      in Pennsylvania, not west.


      7) So Bunch-of-Grapes in Massachusetts would be east of Rose Valley Lake in
      Pennsylvania.


      Actually, let me double-check this logic. Massachusetts is indeed east of Pennsylvania.
      Massachusetts is on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is inland but still

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast

      - Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern United States, but inland from the
      coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Massachusetts is positioned to the east of Pennsylvania. The entire state of
      Massachusetts lies east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States.


      Step 4: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      Since Bunch-of-Grapes is in Massachusetts, and Rose Valley Lake is in Pennsylvania,
      the former must be east of the latter (not west).

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US, bordering Mexico to the south
      and extending to the Gulf of Mexico on its southeast border.

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a US map, Texas is positioned to the west of Florida

      - Therefore, any location in Florida would generally be east of any location
      in Texas


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific locations.

      \ west longitude (97\xB0) than Atlanta (84\xB0), Dallas is further west than\
      \ Atlanta.\n\n4) Therefore, the Cathedral of Saint Philip in Atlanta is EAST\

      First, let''s think about the general geographic positions of Texas and Arizona:

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States

      - Texas is to the east of Arizona


      In general, locations in Texas would be east of locations in Arizona, not west.
      But I should verify the specific locations.


      Red Bluff Reservoir is in Texas, likely in western Texas given that it''s being
      compared to a location in Arizona.

      Sahuarita Lake is in Arizona, likely in the eastern part of Arizona.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, locations in Texas are
      generally east of locations in Arizona. Therefore, Red Bluff Reservoir in TX
      would be east of Sahuarita Lake in AZ, not west.</think># Is Red Bluff Reservoir,
      TX located west of Sahuarita Lake, AZ?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geographic positions of Texas (TX)
      and Arizona (AZ) within the United States.


      2) Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, while Texas is located
      to the east of Arizona.


      3) Red Bluff Reservoir is in Texas, and Sahuarita Lake is in Arizona.


      4) Since Texas is east of Arizona, locations in Texas (including Red Bluff Reservoir)
      would generally be east of locations in Arizona (including Sahuarita Lake).


      5) Therefore, Red Bluff Reservoir in Texas would be east of Sahuarita Lake in
      Arizona, not west.

      I need to determine if Red Bluff Reservoir is located west of Sahuarita Lake.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, west of New Mexico

      - Generally, Arizona is west of Texas


      Since Red Bluff Reservoir is in Texas and Sahuarita Lake is in Arizona, and
      Arizona is generally west of Texas, it would seem that Red Bluff Reservoir would
      be east of Sahuarita Lake, not west.


      However, I should be careful because Red Bluff Reservoir could be in western
      Texas, and Sahuarita Lake could be in eastern Arizona, which might change the
      answer. Let me think more specifically.


      Red Bluff Reservoir is located on the Texas-New Mexico border, in the western
      part of Texas.

      Sahuarita Lake would be in Sahuarita, which is in southern Arizona, likely in
      the central or eastern part of southern Arizona.


      Given these more specific locations, Red Bluff Reservoir is still east of Sahuarita
      Lake because Arizona is west of Texas and New Mexico is between them.</think>#
      Is Red Bluff Reservoir, TX located west of Sahuarita Lake, AZ?


      Let me reason through this step-by-step:


      1) Red Bluff Reservoir is located in Texas (TX), specifically in western Texas
      along the New Mexico border.


      2) Sahuarita Lake is located in Arizona (AZ), specifically in southern Arizona
      near Tucson.


      3) Looking at the general geography of the United States, Arizona is positioned
      to the west of Texas.


      4) Even though Red Bluff Reservoir is in western Texas, it''s still east of
      Arizona''s eastern border.


      5) Since Sahuarita Lake is within Arizona, and all of Arizona is west of western
      Texas, Red Bluff Reservoir must be east of Sahuarita Lake.


      NO - Red Bluff Reservoir, TX is not located west of Sahuarita Lake, AZ. It is

      The United States generally has Texas to the east of Arizona. Arizona borders

      Red Bluff Reservoir is in Texas (TX), and Sahuarita Lake is in Arizona (AZ).


      Based on the general geography of the United States:

      - Arizona is in the southwestern US

      - Texas is in the south-central/southeastern US

      - Arizona is generally west of Texas

      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the specific locations.

      Since Arizona is generally west of Texas, water bodies in Arizona (like Sahuarita

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations:

      - Edison Theatre is in New York (NY)

      - Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson, Ohio
      (OH)


      Step 2: To determine which is west of the other, I need to consider the geographical
      positions of New York and Ohio states.


      Step 3: In the United States, Ohio is located west of New York. Ohio is in the
      Midwest region, while New York is in the Northeast region.


      Step 4: Since Ohio is west of New York, and the Basilica is in Ohio while Edison
      Theatre is in New York, the Basilica is west of Edison Theatre (not the other
      way around).

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of New York and Ohio.

      Ohio is located to the west of New York state. This is a fundamental geographical
      fact about the United States - Ohio is in the Midwest region, while New York
      is in the Northeast region.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positioning.

      Since Ohio is west of New York, the Basilica in North Jackson, Ohio would be
      west of Edison Theatre in New York.

      If the Basilica in Ohio is west of Edison Theatre in New York, then Edison Theatre
      cannot be west of the Basilica.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the general geographic positions

      - Kanuga Conference Center is located in North Carolina (NC)

      - Cathedral of the Incarnation is in Nashville, Tennessee (TN)


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern side of the United States

      - Tennessee is located west of North Carolina


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations

      - Nashville is in the central part of Tennessee

      - Even if Kanuga is in western North Carolina, Tennessee''s eastern border is
      still west of North Carolina''s western border


      ## Conclusion

      Since Tennessee is west of North Carolina, and Nashville is centrally located
      in Tennessee, the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Nashville must be west of
      Kanuga Conference Center in North Carolina.


      NO - Kanuga Conference Center is not west of the Cathedral of the Incarnation;
      it is east of it.'

      First, let me establish the locations of the two states:

      - Tennessee (TN) is in the southeastern United States

      - Kansas (KS) is in the central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Kansas is generally west of Tennessee. Kansas
      is in the central part of the country while Tennessee is further east.


      Since Boone Lake is in Tennessee, and Big Hill Lake is in Kansas, and Tennessee

      - Big Hill Lake is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positions of these states.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Tennessee (TN) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Kansas is generally west of Tennessee. The

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Kansas is significantly west of Tennessee on the U.S. map

      - The entire state of Tennessee is east of Kansas


      Step 3: Since Boone Lake is in Tennessee and Big Hill Lake is in Kansas, their

      Tennessee (TN) is a state in the southeastern United States. Kansas (KS) is
      a state in the central United States.


      Geographically speaking, Kansas is west of Tennessee. States in the US are generally
      arranged with the eastern states (like Maine, New York, etc.) on the East Coast,
      and as you move westward, you encounter central states (like Kansas, Nebraska,

      Oregon, etc.).


      Since Boone Lake is in Tennessee (an eastern state) and Big Hill Lake is in
      Kansas (a central state), Boone Lake would be east of Big Hill Lake, not west

      - Kansas is significantly west of Tennessee on the US map

      - States follow a general pattern where those further west have higher longitude

      First, I need to think about the general locations of Tennessee and Kansas:

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern part of the United States

      - Kansas is in the central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Kansas is generally west of Tennessee. Tennessee

      - Tennessee is further east than Kansas.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific lakes.

      - Boone Lake is in Tennessee, so it inherits Tennessee''s eastern position.

      - Big Hill Lake is in Kansas, so it inherits Kansas''s western position.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Boone Lake is in a state east of the state containing Big Hill Lake,

      ## Step 3: Compare the general east-west relationship

      - California is west of Arizona

      - When moving from California to Arizona, you travel eastward


      ## Step 4: Apply this to the specific locations

      relative positions of two locations: Black Canyon Lake in Arizona and Friends
      Church in Yorba Linda, California.


      To determine whether Black Canyon Lake is west of Friends Church, I need to
      understand their relative longitudes. On maps, west is to the left, with lower
      longitude values, while east is to the right, with higher longitude values.


      Let me first think about the general locations:

      - Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Friends Church is in Yorba Linda, California (CA)


      Geographically speaking, most of Arizona is east of California. California is
      on the west coast of the United States, while Arizona is one state inland. However,
      I should be careful because some parts of western Arizona might be west of eastern
      California locations.


      Yorba Linda is in Orange County in southern California, which is on the western
      side of California (closer to the coast). Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona, which
      would typically be east of locations in California.


      Given these general geographical positions, Black Canyon Lake in Arizona is
      almost certainly east of Friends Church in Yorba Linda, California - not west
      of it.</think># Determining if Black Canyon Lake (AZ) is west of Friends Church
      (CA)


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations based on their

      ## Step 1: Consider the general geography of the states

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is located directly east of California


      ## Step 2: Examine the specific locations

      - Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Friends Church is in Yorba Linda, which is in Orange County in southern California
      (CA)


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - Yorba Linda is in western California (relatively close to the Pacific coast)

      - Even though I don''t know the exact coordinates, the geography of the United
      States means that virtually any location in Arizona would be east of a location
      in western California


      Since locations in Arizona are generally east of locations in western California,
      Black Canyon Lake would be east of (not west of) Friends Church.

      Then I need to determine which one is farther west.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States. New York
      is on the east coast of the United States, while Illinois is in the Midwest.
      Generally speaking, Illinois is west of New York.


      The Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) would be located in New York, likely in New York

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Ziegfeld Theatre (1927) is in New York (NY)

      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - New York is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - Illinois is significantly west of New York

      - Any location in Illinois (including Bayles Lake) would be west of locations
      in New York (including the Ziegfeld Theatre)


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Illinois is west of New York, Bayles Lake (in Illinois) must be west of
      the Ziegfeld Theatre (in New York), not the other way around.

      First, let''s consider the general geography of the United States:

      - West Virginia (WV) is located in the eastern part of the United States

      - Illinois (IL) is located in the midwestern part of the United States


      Generally speaking, Illinois is west of West Virginia. So a facility in West
      Virginia would typically be east of a facility in Illinois, not west.


      Therefore, Mountaineer Wind Energy Center in WV would be east of Gibson Generating
      Station in IL, not west.


      So the answer should be NO.</think>I''ll solve this step by step by comparing
      the geographical locations of these two energy facilities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each facility is located.

      - Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is in West Virginia (WV)

      - Gibson Generating Station is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - West Virginia is located in the eastern United States

      - Illinois is located in the midwestern United States

      - Illinois is positioned west of West Virginia


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Since Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is in West Virginia, and West Virginia
      is east of Illinois (where Gibson Generating Station is located), the wind energy
      center must be east of the generating station, not west.

      - West Virginia is located in the eastern United States

      - Illinois is located in the midwestern United States

      - Illinois is west of West Virginia (with Ohio and Indiana between them)


      Step 3: Determine the relative position of the facilities.

      - Since Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is in WV (an eastern state) and Gibson
      Generating Station is in IL (a midwestern state), the Mountaineer facility would
      be east of the Gibson facility, not west.

      - Saylorville Lake is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      located west of Buckhorn Lake, KY, I need to consider the geographical positions
      of these two lakes.


      First, I''ll consider the states:

      - Hyco Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky (KY)


      In general, Kentucky is located west of North Carolina in the United States.
      Kentucky is more in the central-eastern part of the US, while North Carolina
      is on the eastern seaboard.


      However, we need to be precise about these specific lakes. Let me think about
      the general geography:


      North Carolina is generally east of Kentucky, so a lake in North Carolina would
      typically be east of a lake in Kentucky, not west of it.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      Kentucky is located more inland, in the east-central part of the country.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Kentucky is positioned to the west
      and slightly north of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Apply this to the lakes in question.

      Since Hyco Lake is in North Carolina and Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky, and Kentucky
      is west of North Carolina, Hyco Lake would be located east of Buckhorn Lake,
      not west of it.

      whether the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi in Santa Fe, New Mexico
      is located west of the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff, Arizona.


      To solve this, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two locations. I''ll use my knowledge of US geography.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Santa Fe is in New Mexico (NM)

      - Flagstaff is in Arizona (AZ)


      In terms of US geography, Arizona is west of New Mexico. The states border each
      other, with Arizona to the west and New Mexico to the east.


      Since Santa Fe is in New Mexico and Flagstaff is in Arizona, and New Mexico
      is east of Arizona, it follows that Santa Fe is east of Flagstaff.


      Therefore, the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi in Santa Fe, NM is
      NOT west of the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff, AZ. Rather, it''s east of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi is in Santa Fe, New Mexico

      - Orpheum Theater is in Flagstaff, Arizona


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Arizona and New Mexico share a border, with Arizona located to the west of New
      Mexico.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the specific cities.

      Since Santa Fe is in New Mexico and Flagstaff is in Arizona, and Arizona is
      west of New Mexico, then Flagstaff must be west of Santa Fe.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific buildings.

      Since the Cathedral Basilica is in Santa Fe (NM) and the Orpheum Theater is
      in Flagstaff (AZ), the Cathedral Basilica must be east of the Orpheum Theater,
      not west.

      To do this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of Santa Fe,
      NM and Flagstaff, AZ. Specifically, I need to know which one is further west.


      In the United States:

      - Arizona is located west of New Mexico (Arizona is in the southwestern US,
      bordering California to its west and New Mexico to its east)

      - Therefore, Flagstaff, AZ is west of Santa Fe, NM


      Since Flagstaff is west of Santa Fe, that means the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff
      is west of the Cathedral Basilica in Santa Fe, not the other way around.


      The question asks if the Cathedral (in Santa Fe) is west of the Theater (in
      Flagstaff), which is incorrect.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two structures.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi is in Santa Fe, New Mexico

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of New Mexico and Arizona.

      - Arizona is located to the west of New Mexico in the United States


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of these specific cities.

      - Flagstaff, Arizona is west of Santa Fe, New Mexico


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion about the specific buildings.

      - Since Flagstaff is west of Santa Fe, the Orpheum Theater (in Flagstaff) must
      be west of the Cathedral Basilica (in Santa Fe)

      - The question asks if the Cathedral is west of the Theater, which is the opposite
      of the actual relationship

      Let me think about the general geography of the western United States:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is directly east of California


      San Bernardino is in southern California, not far from Los Angeles. Apache Lake
      is in Arizona.


      Since Arizona is east of California, and these specific locations don''t change
      this general east-west relationship (they''re not in unusual border areas that
      might create exceptions), Apache Lake in Arizona would be east of Our Lady of
      the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino, California.

      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geographic relationship between Arizona
      and California.

      2) California is the westernmost continental US state, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.

      3) Arizona borders California to the east.

      4) San Bernardino, California is in the southern part of California.

      5) Apache Lake is in Arizona, which means it must be east of any location in
      California.


      Since Apache Lake is in Arizona (east) and Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral
      is in California (west), Apache Lake cannot be west of the cathedral.


      NO'

      1. Apache Lake in Arizona

      2. Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino, California


      Then I need to determine which is further west.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of the western United States.
      Arizona is generally east of California. The entire state of California lies
      on the west coast of the United States, while Arizona is inland and borders
      California on its western side.


      San Bernardino is in Southern California, not far from Los Angeles. It would
      be in the southwestern part of the United States.


      Apache Lake is in Arizona, which is east of California. Even though I don''t
      know the exact location of Apache Lake within Arizona, since the entire state
      of Arizona is east of California, Apache Lake must be east of Our Lady of the
      Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino, California.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), places in California will generally
      have a more western (smaller) longitude than places in Arizona.


      So, Apache Lake (Arizona) is located EAST of Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral
      (San Bernardino, California).</think># Is Apache Lake (Arizona) west of Our

      Ocean.

      3. Arizona is located directly east of California.

      4. San Bernardino is in Southern California.

      5. Apache Lake is in Arizona.


      Since all of Arizona is east of California, and San Bernardino is within California,
      Apache Lake must be east of Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino.


      When we ask if Apache Lake is west of the cathedral, the answer is:

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, but still east of the Mississippi River

      - Generally, Ohio is west of New York state


      Since 1 Pace Plaza is in New York (likely New York City based on the address

      the Ohio location, not west.


      On a map of the United States, going from east to west, you would encounter
      New York before Ohio. So 1 Pace Plaza (in New York) is EAST of Atwood Lake (in

      1. 1 Pace Plaza is in New York. More specifically, it''s an address in Manhattan,
      New York City, New York state.

      2. Atwood Lake is in Ohio (OH).


      The general geography of the United States has:

      - New York state is on the east coast

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, but still east of the Mississippi River


      Specifically for east-west positioning:

      - New York state is east of Ohio

      - New York City is in the eastern part of New York state

      Step 1: Identify where 1 Pace Plaza is located.

      1 Pace Plaza is in Manhattan, New York City, which is in New York State on the
      East Coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify where Atwood Lake is located.

      Atwood Lake is in Ohio, which is in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning of these states.

      New York is located to the east of Ohio on the US map. The entire state of New
      York is eastward of Ohio.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since New York is east of Ohio, and 1 Pace Plaza is in New York, while Atwood
      Lake is in Ohio, 1 Pace Plaza must be east (not west) of Atwood Lake.

      part of the state.

      - Atwood Lake is in Ohio (OH), which is in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest, west of New York State.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positioning.

      - Moving from east to west across the United States, you would encounter New
      York before Ohio.

      - Therefore, 1 Pace Plaza in New York is east of Atwood Lake in Ohio, not west

      2. Pine Flat Dam in California (CA)


      To figure out if one is west of the other, I need to determine their approximate
      locations and compare them.


      Generally, Nevada is east of California, since California is on the west coast
      of the US, and Nevada is an inland state bordering California to the east.


      The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is in Nevada, so it''s likely east of many
      California structures.


      Pine Flat Dam is in California, which would generally place it west of Nevada
      structures.


      Based on just these state locations, Copper Mountain Solar Facility (in NV)
      would be east of Pine Flat Dam (in CA), not west of it.


      However, I should think more specifically about their locations within their
      states, as California and Nevada have an irregular border, and California extends
      quite far east at some points.


      Copper Mountain Solar Facility is likely in southern Nevada where solar resources
      are abundant.


      Pine Flat Dam is somewhere in California, but I need to consider where in California
      it''s located. If it''s in eastern California near the Nevada border, and if
      Copper Mountain is in western Nevada, their relative east-west positioning might
      be different than the general state relationship.


      However, given the general geography of the states, and without specific information
      that would contradict this, it''s most likely that the Nevada facility is east
      of the California dam.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two structures.


      Step 1: Consider the general geography of California and Nevada.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Nevada borders
      California to the east. Generally, locations in Nevada are east of locations
      in California.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations.

      Copper Mountain Solar Facility is located in Nevada (NV).

      Pine Flat Dam is located in California (CA).


      Step 3: Analyze their relative positions.

      Since Nevada is generally east of California, and without any information suggesting

      be east of Pine Flat Dam in California - not west of it.

      Let''s think about the geography of Nevada and California:

      - California is generally west of Nevada along most of their shared border.

      - California extends to the Pacific Ocean on the west.

      - Nevada is inland, to the east of California.


      Given this general geography, structures in Nevada would typically be east of

      Specifically:

      - Pine Flat Dam is in California, likely in the central or eastern part of the
      state.

      - Copper Mountain Solar Facility is in Nevada, which is east of California.


      Therefore, Copper Mountain Solar Facility (in Nevada) is most likely east of
      Pine Flat Dam (in California), not west.</think>I need to determine the relative

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Nevada and California.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Nevada is located inland, directly east of California


      Step 3: Apply this general geographic relationship to the specific structures.

      - Since Nevada is east of California, structures in Nevada are generally east
      of structures in California

      - Pine Flat Dam (in CA) would be to the west of Copper Mountain Solar Facility
      (in NV)


      Step 4: Determine the answer to the specific question asked.

      - Nevada is generally east of California on US maps

      - However, Nevada borders California, and the exact locations of these structures
      matter, not just the states they''re in


      Let me think about more specific locations:

      Copper Mountain Solar Facility is located near Boulder City, Nevada, which is
      in the southern tip of Nevada near Las Vegas.


      Looking at the geography, California extends further west than Nevada since
      California is on the Pacific coast while Nevada is inland. Even the easternmost

      I need to figure out which one is more west (further to the west) than the other.


      California is generally west of Nevada, since California is on the Pacific coast

      - Pine Flat Dam is located in California (CA), in the Sierra Nevada foothills
      east of Fresno in central California.


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - California is generally west of Nevada, as California borders the Pacific

      geographic positions of 257 Central Park West, NY and Olympia Centre, IL to
      answer whether the first is west of the second.


      First, let me break down the locations:

      1. 257 Central Park West is in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan along
      Central Park West.

      2. Olympia Centre is in Illinois (IL), which I believe would be in Chicago.


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to consider their positions
      on a map of the United States.


      New York is on the East Coast of the United States.

      Illinois is in the Midwest, west of New York.


      Since Illinois is west of New York, Olympia Centre in Illinois would be west
      of 257 Central Park West in New York.


      So is 257 Central Park West, NY located west of Olympia Centre, IL?

      No, it''s the opposite. 257 Central Park West is EAST of Olympia Centre.</think>I
      need to determine if 257 Central Park West, NY is located west of Olympia Centre,
      IL by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 257 Central Park West is in New York (NY), specifically Manhattan in New York
      City on the East Coast of the US.

      - Olympia Centre is in Illinois (IL), most likely in Chicago in the Midwest
      region.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions on a US map.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest, significantly west of New York.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Moving from east to west across the US, you would go from New York to Illinois,
      not the other way around.

      - Therefore, New York (including 257 Central Park West) is east of Illinois
      (including Olympia Centre).

      2. Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project in Wyoming (WY)


      Specifically, it''s asking if the cathedral is located west of the wind energy
      project.


      To determine this, I need to know the rough locations of Iowa and Wyoming, and
      their positions relative to each other.


      Iowa is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle of the country. Des Moines is
      the capital city of Iowa.


      Wyoming is in the western United States, in the Mountain West region.


      Generally speaking, Wyoming is west of Iowa. On a map of the United States,
      Wyoming is to the west of Iowa.


      If Wyoming is west of Iowa, then locations in Iowa (like St. Ambrose Cathedral
      in Des Moines) would be east of locations in Wyoming (like the Chokecherry and
      Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project).


      Therefore, St. Ambrose Cathedral (in Iowa) is NOT west of the Chokecherry and
      Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project (in Wyoming). It''s east of it.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these structures are located.

      - Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Iowa is located in the Midwestern United States

      - Wyoming is located in the Western United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Wyoming is clearly west of Iowa on the US map

      - All locations in Iowa are east of most locations in Wyoming


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific locations.

      Since Des Moines, Iowa is in a state that is entirely east of Wyoming, St. Ambrose
      Cathedral must be east of the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project.

      In the United States:

      - States on the east coast include (from north to south): Maine, New Hampshire,
      Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
      Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.

      - Ohio is not on the east coast but is located in the Midwest region.


      Looking at the map of the US from west to east, Ohio is west of Virginia. That
      means locations in Virginia would generally be east of locations in Ohio.


      So, Truro Church in Fairfax, Virginia would be east of La Comedia Dinner Theatre
      in Ohio.


      If the question is asking "Is Truro Church west of La Comedia Dinner Theatre?",

      1) Truro Church is located in Fairfax, Virginia (VA)

      2) La Comedia Dinner Theatre is in Ohio (OH)

      3) When examining the US map, Ohio is located west of Virginia

      4) Therefore, locations in Virginia (like Truro Church) would be east of locations

      - Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, but still relatively eastern in the US


      When comparing these two states, Ohio is generally west of Virginia. That means

      This question is asking about the relative east-west positioning of two locations:

      1. Truro Church in Fairfax, Virginia (VA)

      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to consider their locations:


      - Fairfax, Virginia is located in the eastern United States, near Washington
      D.C.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest, west of Virginia.


      Generally speaking, locations in Ohio are west of locations in Virginia because

      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positioning.

      - States in the eastern US (like Virginia) are east of Midwestern states (like
      Ohio)

      - Therefore, Fairfax, Virginia is east of any location in Ohio


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific locations.

      - Since Truro Church is in Virginia (east) and La Comedia Dinner Theatre is
      in Ohio (west), Truro Church is located east of La Comedia Dinner Theatre, not

      1. The question asks about the relative locations of two lakes: Grenada Lake

      2. To determine if Grenada Lake is west of Wright Patman Lake, I need to know
      the general locations of these lakes within their respective states, and the
      relative positions of Mississippi and Texas.


      3. In terms of US geography, Mississippi is located east of Texas. The states

      4. Grenada Lake is in Mississippi (MS), which is east of Texas.

      5. Wright Patman Lake is in Texas (TX), which is west of Mississippi.


      6. Since Mississippi is east of Texas, and Grenada Lake is in Mississippi while

      Wright Patman Lake, not west.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative locations of these two lakes based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each lake is located.

      - Grenada Lake is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Wright Patman Lake is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is positioned to the west of Mississippi


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion about the lakes'' relative positions.

      Since Grenada Lake is in Mississippi, which is east of Texas, and Wright Patman
      Lake is in Texas, which is west of Mississippi, Grenada Lake must be east of

      Now I need to determine their relative positions on an east-west axis.


      Wisconsin and Minnesota are neighboring states in the Midwest. Generally speaking,
      Minnesota is west of Wisconsin. The Mississippi River forms part of the border
      between these states, with Wisconsin to the east and Minnesota to the west.


      Point Beach Nuclear Plant is likely on the eastern side of Wisconsin, possibly
      near Lake Michigan (given that nuclear plants often need large water sources
      for cooling).


      Minneapolis is in the eastern part of Minnesota, but still west of Wisconsin.


      So based on the general geography of these states, Point Beach Nuclear Plant
      in Wisconsin would be east of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis,
      Minnesota.


      Therefore, Point Beach Nuclear Plant would NOT be located west of the church.

      of Two Rivers.


      3) Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN), which
      is in the eastern part of Minnesota.


      4) Geographically, Minnesota is located west of Wisconsin. The two states share
      a border, with Wisconsin to the east and Minnesota to the west.


      5) Since Point Beach Nuclear Plant is on the eastern shore of Wisconsin (by

      of Minnesota. Wisconsin borders Minnesota on Minnesota''s eastern side.


      Minneapolis is located in eastern Minnesota, not far from the Wisconsin border,
      but still within Minnesota.


      Point Beach Nuclear Plant would be in Wisconsin, and given the name "Point Beach,"
      it''s likely on Lake Michigan, which is on the eastern side of Wisconsin.


      So geographically:

      - Minneapolis (and the church within it) would be in eastern Minnesota

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant would likely be on the eastern edge of Wisconsin,

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Wisconsin, and given its name "Point Beach,"
      it''s almost certainly located on Lake Michigan, which forms Wisconsin''s eastern

      Point Beach Nuclear Plant is on the eastern shore of Wisconsin, along Lake Michigan.
      Since Wisconsin is already east of Minnesota, and this plant is on the eastern

      - Wisconsin is east of Minnesota

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant is on the eastern side of Wisconsin (near Lake Michigan)

      - Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, in eastern Minnesota


      Therefore, Point Beach Nuclear Plant would be east of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic

      locations of two lakes: Lake Crabtree in North Carolina (NC) and Lake Nottely
      in Georgia (GA).


      First, let''s think about the general geographic positioning of North Carolina
      and Georgia. North Carolina is located north of Georgia on the east coast of
      the United States. But I need to determine the east-west relationship between
      these specific lakes.


      Lake Crabtree is in North Carolina (NC). I need to know where specifically in
      NC.

      Lake Nottely is in Georgia (GA). I need to know where specifically in GA.


      For east-west comparisons, I need to consider:

      - North Carolina is generally to the northeast of Georgia

      - But specific locations near state borders might not follow the general state
      positioning


      Lake Crabtree is in Wake County, NC, near Raleigh and the Raleigh-Durham International
      Airport in the central part of North Carolina.


      Lake Nottely is in Union County, GA, in the northern part of Georgia, near the
      North Carolina border.


      Given that Lake Crabtree is in central NC (more eastern part of the state) and
      Lake Nottely is in northern GA (near the NC border, likely in the mountains),
      Lake Crabtree would be to the east of Lake Nottely.


      So, Lake Crabtree, NC is NOT located west of Lake Nottely, GA. It''s located
      east of it.</think># Is Lake Crabtree, NC located west of Lake Nottely, GA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two lakes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Lake Crabtree is located in Wake County, North Carolina, near Raleigh and
      the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in the central-eastern part of North
      Carolina.


      2) Lake Nottely is located in Union County, Georgia, in the northern part of
      Georgia near the North Carolina border in the Blue Ridge Mountains.


      3) Georgia is generally southwest of North Carolina.


      4) While both states border each other, Lake Crabtree is in the central-eastern
      portion of North Carolina, placing it significantly east of the North Carolina-Georgia
      border.


      5) Lake Nottely, though in northern Georgia, is still west of Lake Crabtree''s
      position in central-eastern North Carolina.


      ## Answer: NO


      Lake Crabtree, NC is not located west of Lake Nottely, GA. It is located east
      of Lake Nottely.'

      First, let me recall where these lakes are located:


      1. Lake Crabtree, NC is in North Carolina, likely in the central or eastern
      part of the state.

      2. Lake Nottely, GA is in Georgia, likely in the northern part of the state.

      Lake Nottely is in Union County, Georgia, in the northern part of Georgia near
      the North Carolina border in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

      3) Lake Nottely is in Georgia, located in Union County in the far northern part
      of Georgia, near the North Carolina border.


      4) Looking at the geographic relationship between these locations, North Carolina
      is generally east of Georgia.


      5) More specifically, Raleigh (near Lake Crabtree) is in the central-eastern
      part of North Carolina, while northern Georgia (where Lake Nottely is) is in
      the western part of the Georgia-North Carolina border region.


      6) Therefore, Lake Crabtree in central North Carolina would be east of Lake

      Let me think about the geographic locations of Michigan and Iowa in the United

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, in the upper Midwest/Eastern part of
      the US

      - Iowa is in the Midwest, west of Michigan


      Des Moines is the capital city of Iowa, located in the central part of the state.


      If we consider longitude (east-west positioning), Iowa is generally west of

      including where the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects would be located (likely

      1) The Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects were located in Detroit, Michigan

      2) The Basilica of St. John is located in Des Moines, Iowa

      3) Looking at US geography, Iowa is positioned west of Michigan

      4) Des Moines, Iowa is therefore west of Detroit, Michigan

      5) This means the Basilica of St. John (in Des Moines) is west of the Brewster-Douglass

      - OK is Oklahoma, which is in the central United States


      Just based on the states, Tennessee is east of Oklahoma. Oklahoma borders Texas

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Tennessee is located in the eastern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the central United States, significantly west of Tennessee


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      In the United States, locations further west have higher longitude values in
      the negative direction (since the US is in the Western Hemisphere). So if Horseshoe
      Lake has a more negative longitude than Saint Sophia Cathedral, it would be

      Let me think about these locations:


      Los Angeles is on the west coast of the United States in California.

      Arizona is a state that borders California to the east.


      Just based on the states, I would expect that a location in Arizona would be
      east of a location in Los Angeles, California. This is because California is
      the westernmost continental state, and Arizona is directly to the east of California.


      Saint Sophia Cathedral is in Los Angeles, which is near the Pacific coast in
      western California.

      Horseshoe Lake in Arizona would be somewhere in Arizona, which is entirely east

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Arizona and California.

      - California is the westernmost continental state in the US

      - Arizona borders California on the east


      Step 3: Consider the specific location of Los Angeles within California.

      - Los Angeles is located in southern California, near the Pacific coast

      - This puts Los Angeles very far west in the continental US


      Step 4: Compare the locations.

      Step 1: Let''s think about the general east-west orientation of Arizona and
      California in the United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is directly east of California


      Step 2: Since Los Angeles is in California and Horseshoe Lake is in Arizona,
      this generally suggests that Horseshoe Lake would be east of Saint Sophia Cathedral,

      the United States.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions. Generally, California is west
      of Arizona, since California is on the Pacific coast while Arizona is inland.
      However, I should be more precise about these specific locations.


      The Navajo Generating Station was a coal-fired power plant located on the Navajo
      Nation, near Page, Arizona in the northeastern part of the state.


      New Exchequer Dam is in California, likely in central or northern California
      based on my knowledge of major dams in the state.


      Given that California is west of Arizona, and these locations follow the general
      geography of their states, New Exchequer Dam in California is likely west of
      Navajo Generating Station in Arizona.


      Therefore, Navajo Generating Station is NOT west of New Exchequer Dam, but rather
      east of it.</think># Is Navajo Generating Station, AZ located west of New Exchequer
      Dam, CA?


      Let me think through the locations of these two structures:


      1) Navajo Generating Station was located in Page, Arizona, in the northeastern
      part of the state near the Utah border.


      2) New Exchequer Dam is located in California, specifically in Mariposa County
      in the central part of the state, east of the San Francisco Bay Area.


      3) California is generally west of Arizona geographically.


      4) Even though New Exchequer Dam is in eastern California, and Navajo Generating
      Station was in northern Arizona, California''s eastern border is still west
      of Arizona''s western areas.


      Therefore, Navajo Generating Station in Arizona would be EAST of New Exchequer
      Dam in California, not west of it.

      Station in Arizona is located west of New Exchequer Dam in California, I need
      to identify the locations of both and compare their positions on an east-west
      axis.


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is located east of California


      Since California is west of Arizona, structures in California would generally
      be west of structures in Arizona.


      New Exchequer Dam is in California, and Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona.
      Based on the general geographic positions of these states, New Exchequer Dam
      (in California) would be west of Navajo Generating Station (in Arizona).


      So the answer would be NO - Navajo Generating Station is NOT west of New Exchequer
      Dam. Instead, Navajo Generating Station would be EAST of New Exchequer Dam.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step by determining the geographic locations of both structures.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of both states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is located east of California


      Step 2: Consider the specific structures.

      - Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona

      - New Exchequer Dam is in California


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Since California is west of Arizona, structures in California are generally
      west of structures in Arizona. Therefore, New Exchequer Dam (in California)
      would be west of Navajo Generating Station (in Arizona), not the other way around.

      2. Next, I need to identify where New Exchequer Dam, CA is located. As the name

      3. Now I need to consider their relative positions. In the United States, Arizona
      is east of California. California is on the west coast of the US, while Arizona
      is inland to the east of California.


      4. Since Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona, and New Exchequer Dam is in

      Reasoning


      To answer whether Navajo Generating Station in Arizona is located west of New
      Exchequer Dam in California, I need to consider the geographic locations of
      these two states.


      1. Navajo Generating Station is located in Arizona (AZ)

      2. New Exchequer Dam is located in California (CA)

      3. Looking at the geography of the United States, California is positioned on
      the west coast

      4. Arizona is located to the east of California

      5. Therefore, any structure in Arizona would generally be east of structures
      in California

      6. Since Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona, it must be east (not west)
      of New Exchequer Dam in California


      # Answer: NO


      Navajo Generating Station in Arizona is not located west of New Exchequer Dam
      in California. It is located east of it.'

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      1) 120 Wall Street is located in lower Manhattan in New York City, NY.

      2) East Branch Clarion River Lake is located in northwestern Pennsylvania.

      However, I need to be more precise since this is about specific locations within
      these states. The question is asking specifically about east-west positioning.


      New York City is at the southeastern part of New York State, on the Atlantic
      coast.

      Pennsylvania is west of New York State, but East Branch Clarion River Lake would
      be somewhere in Pennsylvania.


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - 120 Wall Street is in Lower Manhattan, which is on the eastern edge of the
      continental US

      - Wall Street is in the southeastern part of New York State, near the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in northwestern Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New York City (including Wall Street) is east of all of Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, 120 Wall Street is east of East Branch Clarion River Lake, not

      Given these general locations:

      - New York City is in the eastern part of New York state

      - The Clarion River watershed is in the western part of Pennsylvania


      Since Pennsylvania is west of New York, and the East Branch Clarion River Lake

      Rockport Reservoir is in Utah, which is a western state.

      Lovewell Reservoir is in Kansas, which is a central state.


      Based on the general geography of these states, Lovewell Reservoir in Kansas
      would be EAST of Rockport Reservoir in Utah, not west of it.

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Utah is significantly west of Kansas in the US geography

      - Any location in Utah would generally be west of locations in Kansas


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the specific reservoirs.

      Since Rockport Reservoir is in Utah (a western state) and Lovewell Reservoir
      is in Kansas (a central state), Lovewell Reservoir must be east of Rockport
      Reservoir, not west.

      Santa Margarita Lake is in California. California is generally west of Nevada.


      Given the general geography of the United States:

      - Nevada is east of California

      - Henderson is in the southeastern part of Nevada

      - Santa Margarita Lake is in California (likely in central or southern California)


      Based on this geographical knowledge, it''s very likely that the church in Henderson,
      Nevada would be EAST of Santa Margarita Lake in California, not west of it.


      So the answer is probably NO, but let me think more precisely about the locations.


      Santa Margarita Lake is in San Luis Obispo County, which is in central coastal
      California.

      Henderson, Nevada is near Las Vegas, which is in the far southeastern part of
      Nevada.


      Given these more specific locations, I''m even more confident that Henderson,
      Nevada (and thus the Central Christian Church located there) is east of Santa
      Margarita Lake, California.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Nevada is
      directly east of California.


      Step 2: Locate the specific places.

      Henderson, Nevada is a city in the southeastern part of Nevada, near Las Vegas.

      Santa Margarita Lake is in San Luis Obispo County in central California.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Since California is west of Nevada, and Santa Margarita Lake is in California
      while Central Christian Church is in Henderson, Nevada, the church must be east
      of the lake, not west.

      2. Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana (IN)


      Generally speaking, Indiana is west of Pennsylvania in the United States. Pennsylvania

      - The Hershey Theatre is in Hershey, Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these places.

      - Southampton is located on the eastern end of Long Island, New York, which
      extends into the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Hershey is located in central Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west relationship.

      - New York state is generally east of Pennsylvania.

      - Southampton, being on eastern Long Island, is especially far east.

      - Hershey, in central Pennsylvania, is west of Southampton.


      Therefore, the Basilica in Southampton is EAST of the Hershey Theatre, not west
      of it.

      - Southampton, NY is on the eastern end of Long Island, which is quite far east

      - The Hershey Theatre is in Hershey, Pennsylvania, which is in the central part
      of Pennsylvania.

      - Southampton is at the far eastern end of Long Island, making it one of the
      easternmost points in New York state.

      2. Marion Reservoir is in Kansas (KS). I need to identify its specific location

      Kansas is generally west of Missouri in the United States. Missouri borders
      Kansas on Kansas'' eastern border.


      St. Louis, where Lemp Mansion is located, is on the far eastern side of Missouri,
      right on the border with Illinois (on the Mississippi River).


      Marion Reservoir appears to be in central Kansas, which would put it west of
      St. Louis, Missouri.


      In the United States, when comparing east-west positions, we generally look
      at longitude. Lower longitude numbers represent more eastern locations, while
      higher longitude numbers represent more western locations.


      Since St. Louis is on the eastern edge of Missouri, and Missouri is east of
      Kansas, and Marion Reservoir is in central Kansas, it''s very likely that Marion
      Reservoir is west of Lemp Mansion.


      Actually, let me double-check this reasoning. In the US, going from east to
      west:

      - We have the East Coast states

      - Then the Midwest states including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri

      - Then the Great Plains states including Kansas, Nebraska

      - Then the Mountain states

      - Then the West Coast states


      So Missouri (where Lemp Mansion is) is east of Kansas (where Marion Reservoir
      is). This means that Lemp Mansion is east of Marion Reservoir, not west of it.
      So Marion Reservoir is west of Lemp Mansion.


      The question asks if Lemp Mansion is west of Marion Reservoir, which would be
      NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if Lemp Mansion, MO is located west of Marion Reservoir, KS, I
      need to identify the geographic locations of both places and compare their positions.


      1. **Lemp Mansion**: Located in St. Louis, Missouri, which is on the eastern
      side of Missouri, near the Mississippi River and the Illinois border.


      2. **Marion Reservoir**: Located in Marion County, Kansas, which is in central
      Kansas.


      3. **State Positions**: Kansas is located directly west of Missouri in the United
      States.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Since St. Louis is on the eastern edge of Missouri,
      and Marion Reservoir is in central Kansas, the reservoir must be west of Lemp
      Mansion (not the other way around).


      In terms of longitude coordinates, Lemp Mansion would have a lower (more easterly)
      longitude than Marion Reservoir.


      # Answer: NO


      Lemp Mansion is NOT west of Marion Reservoir. Rather, Marion Reservoir is west
      of Lemp Mansion.'

      of these two places step-by-step:


      1) Lemp Mansion is located in St. Louis, Missouri (MO).

      2) Marion Reservoir is in Marion County, Kansas (KS).


      To determine whether one is west of the other, I need to compare their relative
      positions on a map. The United States generally has states arranged so that:

      - Going west means moving toward the Pacific Ocean

      - Going east means moving toward the Atlantic Ocean


      Missouri and Kansas are neighboring states in the central United States. Kansas
      is directly west of Missouri.


      St. Louis is on the eastern edge of Missouri, on the border with Illinois along
      the Mississippi River.

      Marion Reservoir would be somewhere in Kansas, which is entirely west of Missouri.


      Since St. Louis (where Lemp Mansion is) is in eastern Missouri, and Marion Reservoir
      is in Kansas (which is west of Missouri), Marion Reservoir must be west of Lemp
      Mansion.


      So, is Lemp Mansion west of Marion Reservoir? No, it would be the opposite -
      Lemp Mansion is east of Marion Reservoir.</think># Is Lemp Mansion, MO located
      west of Marion Reservoir, KS?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lemp Mansion is in St. Louis, Missouri (MO), which is in the eastern part
      of Missouri.

      - Marion Reservoir is in Marion County, Kansas (KS).


      Step 2: Consider the states'' positions.

      - Kansas is located directly west of Missouri in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      - St. Louis (where Lemp Mansion is) is on the eastern edge of Missouri, along
      the Mississippi River.

      - Marion Reservoir is somewhere in central Kansas.


      Step 4: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since Kansas is west of Missouri, and Marion Reservoir is in Kansas while
      Lemp Mansion is in eastern Missouri, Marion Reservoir must be west of Lemp Mansion
      (not the other way around).


      NO (Lemp Mansion is east of Marion Reservoir, not west of it)'

      locations of Lemp Mansion in Missouri (MO) and Marion Reservoir in Kansas (KS),
      specifically whether Lemp Mansion is west of Marion Reservoir.


      First, let me identify where these places are located:


      1. Lemp Mansion is in St. Louis, Missouri, which is located on the eastern edge
      of Missouri, near the border with Illinois.


      2. Marion Reservoir is in Marion County, Kansas. Kansas is directly west of
      Missouri.


      Since Missouri is east of Kansas, and Lemp Mansion is on the eastern side of
      Missouri, while Marion Reservoir is in Kansas (which is west of Missouri), Lemp
      Mansion must be east of Marion Reservoir, not west.


      Therefore, Lemp Mansion, MO is NOT located west of Marion Reservoir, KS. It''s
      actually east of it.</think>To determine if Lemp Mansion, MO is located west
      of Marion Reservoir, KS, I need to analyze the geographical locations of both
      places.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Lemp Mansion is located in St. Louis, Missouri, in the eastern part of the
      state.

      - Marion Reservoir is in Marion County, Kansas, in the central part of Kansas.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Missouri and Kansas.

      - Kansas is located directly west of Missouri.

      - Missouri''s western border connects to Kansas''s eastern border.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - St. Louis (where Lemp Mansion is) is on the far eastern side of Missouri,
      near the Illinois border.

      - Marion Reservoir is in central Kansas.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on east-west positioning.

      - Since Kansas is west of Missouri, and Lemp Mansion is in eastern Missouri,
      Lemp Mansion must be east of any location in Kansas, including Marion Reservoir.


      NO, Lemp Mansion, MO is not located west of Marion Reservoir, KS. It is located
      east of it.'

      First, let me consider the general geographic locations of New York and Illinois:

      - New York state is in the northeastern United States

      - Illinois is in the midwestern United States


      In the United States, states generally follow this pattern from east to west:

    510e6dca-f76d-46f0-974f-5c86456e8f0f: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative locations of Beacon Reservoir in Dutchess County,
      New York and Skokie Lagoons in Illinois.


      First, I need to identify the locations:

      1. Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, New York (NY), which is in the eastern
      part of New York state.

      2. Skokie Lagoons is in Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest.


      Now I need to determine which is further west:


      The United States generally has states arranged from east to west as follows:

      - East Coast states like New York are on the eastern side of the country

      - Midwest states like Illinois are more central but still east of the Mississippi
      River

      - Then come the plains states, mountain states, and west coast states


      Illinois is definitely west of New York state. So a location in Illinois (Skokie
      Lagoons) would be west of a location in New York (Beacon Reservoir).


      Therefore, Beacon Reservoir in NY would be EAST of Skokie Lagoons in IL, not
      west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are.

      - Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, New York (NY)

      - Skokie Lagoons is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      New York is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Illinois
      is in the Midwest region. Moving from east to west across the United States,
      you would encounter New York before Illinois.

      First, let me recall the general geographic positions of New York and Illinois:

      - New York is a state in the northeastern United States

      - Illinois is a state in the midwestern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Illinois is generally west of New York. That
      means locations in New York would typically be east of locations in Illinois,
      not west.


      Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, New York, which would be in the eastern
      part of the United States.

      Skokie Lagoons is in Illinois, which would be more in the central/midwest part
      of the United States.


      Given the general geography of the United States, a location in New York would

      - Illinois is located in the midwest, significantly west of New York.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific locations.

      - Since New York is east of Illinois, a water body in New York (Beacon Reservoir)
      would be east of a water body in Illinois (Skokie Lagoons), not west.


      NO, Beacon Reservoir in New York is not located west of Skokie Lagoons in Illinois.

      (WV). West Virginia is generally west of Virginia, as Virginia borders the Atlantic
      Ocean on the east, and West Virginia is an inland state to the west of Virginia.


      Now, I need to be more specific about these two locations:


      1. Lake Accotink is in Virginia (VA). Based on my knowledge, Lake Accotink is
      in Fairfax County, which is in northern Virginia, not far from Washington DC.

      Step 2: Now I''ll analyze their relative east-west positions.

      - Virginia is generally east of West Virginia.

      - Northern Virginia (where Lake Accotink is located) is east of northwestern
      West Virginia (where Pleasants Power Station is located).

      - The Appalachian Mountains run between these states, with West Virginia to

      - Virginia is east of West Virginia

      of the state

      - Pleasants Power Station is located along the Ohio River in Pleasants County,
      WV


      Step 4: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Since Virginia is east of West Virginia, and Lake Accotink is in the eastern
      part of Virginia, while Pleasants Power Station is in West Virginia, Lake Accotink
      must be east of Pleasants Power Station, not west.

      Kansas is located in the central part of the United States, while Indiana is
      located in the Midwest, but further east than Kansas.

      determine the relative locations of Kanopolis Lake in Kansas (KS) and John Martin
      Reservoir in Colorado (CO).


      First, let me think about the states:

      - Kansas (KS) is a state in the central United States

      - Colorado (CO) is a state directly west of Kansas


      Since Colorado is west of Kansas, and the question is asking if Kanopolis Lake
      (in Kansas) is west of John Martin Reservoir (in Colorado), my intuition is
      that the answer is likely "NO" because Kansas locations are generally east of
      Colorado locations.


      However, I should verify this by thinking about where these specific bodies
      of water are located within their respective states:

      - Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas, likely somewhere in the state (but I don''t know
      exactly where)

      - John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado, likely somewhere in the state (but I
      don''t know exactly where)


      Even if Kanopolis Lake is in western Kansas and John Martin Reservoir is in
      eastern Colorado, Colorado''s eastern border is still west of Kansas''s western
      border (since they share a border), so a location in Kansas would still be east
      of a location in Colorado.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two bodies of water.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these bodies of water are located.

      - John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Kansas and Colorado.

      - Colorado is directly west of Kansas (they share a border)

      - Kansas is east of Colorado


      Step 3: Consider possible locations within each state.

      - Even if Kanopolis Lake is in western Kansas and John Martin Reservoir is in
      eastern Colorado, the Colorado-Kansas border would still place the Colorado
      reservoir west of the Kansas lake.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on state geography.

      - Since any location in Kansas would be east of any location in Colorado (on
      an east-west axis), Kanopolis Lake must be east of John Martin Reservoir, not
      west.

      To determine if Kanopolis Lake is west of John Martin Reservoir, I need to know
      their approximate locations within their respective states.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of Kansas and Colorado:

      - Colorado is directly west of Kansas (CO borders KS on KS''s western border)

      - Generally, locations in Colorado tend to be west of locations in Kansas


      Now, for the specific locations:

      - Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Based on the general state positions, it would seem that John Martin Reservoir
      (being in Colorado) would be west of Kanopolis Lake (being in Kansas).


      However, I need to consider their specific locations within their states. Kanopolis
      Lake could be in western Kansas, and John Martin Reservoir could be in eastern
      Colorado, which might change the answer.


      Without more specific location information, the safest assumption based on state
      geography is that John Martin Reservoir is west of Kanopolis Lake, not the other
      way around.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative

      Step 1: Consider the states they''re located in. Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas

      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states. Colorado is
      located directly west of Kansas - they share a border, with Colorado being the
      western neighbor.


      Step 3: Consider the locations within their states. Kanopolis Lake is in central
      Kansas. John Martin Reservoir is in southeastern Colorado.


      Step 4: Even though John Martin Reservoir is in the eastern portion of Colorado,
      the fact that Colorado itself is entirely west of Kansas means that any location
      in Colorado (including John Martin Reservoir) would be west of most locations
      in Kansas.


      NO, Kanopolis Lake in Kansas is NOT located west of John Martin Reservoir in
      Colorado. It''s actually east of it.'

      Since Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas, and John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado,

      However, I should be careful because specific locations within states could
      potentially change this relationship. For example, if Kanopolis Lake were in
      far western Kansas and John Martin Reservoir were in far eastern Colorado, the
      answer might be different.

      For the answer to be "YES", Kanopolis Lake would need to be west of John Martin
      Reservoir. But based on the state locations, it''s likely the opposite is true.


      To be thorough, I should consider that Kanopolis Lake might be in western Kansas

      Generally speaking, Colorado is west of Kansas, since the states are arranged
      with Colorado being one state to the west of Kansas. Kansas borders Colorado
      on Colorado''s eastern border.


      Given this basic geography, it would be unlikely that a lake in Kansas would
      be west of a reservoir in Colorado. The expected relationship would be that
      the Kansas lake (Kanopolis Lake) is east of the Colorado reservoir (John Martin
      Reservoir).


      So the answer is most likely NO, Kanopolis Lake, KS is not located west of John
      Martin Reservoir, CO, but rather east of it. However, let me make sure by considering
      the specific locations within the states, as the shapes of states and locations
      within them can sometimes create unexpected geographical relationships.


      But even considering specific locations, Colorado is entirely west of Kansas,
      so any point in Kansas must be east of any point in Colorado. Therefore, Kanopolis
      Lake in Kansas must be east of John Martin Reservoir in Colorado, not west of
      it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two
      bodies of water by examining their locations in their respective states.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic relationship between Kansas and Colorado.

      Colorado is located directly west of Kansas. The entire state of Kansas is east
      of Colorado.


      Step 2: Identify the locations of the two bodies of water.

      - Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 3: Apply the state-level geographic relationship to these specific water
      bodies.

      Since Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas, and John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado,
      and Kansas is entirely east of Colorado, it follows that Kanopolis Lake must
      be east of John Martin Reservoir, not west.

      of Kanopolis Lake in Kansas (KS) and John Martin Reservoir in Colorado (CO),
      and then compare their east-west positions.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Kansas (KS) is in the central United States

      - Colorado (CO) is directly west of Kansas


      Since Colorado is west of Kansas, and these bodies of water are in their respective
      states, the default assumption would be that John Martin Reservoir in Colorado
      would be west of Kanopolis Lake in Kansas.


      However, I should be careful about this assumption because:

      1. Kanopolis Lake could be in western Kansas

      2. John Martin Reservoir could be in eastern Colorado

      3. The exact locations within their states matter


      Without specific geographic coordinates, I need to rely on my knowledge of US
      geography. Colorado borders Kansas on Kansas''s western border. Any location
      in Colorado must be west of any location in Kansas.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two bodies of
      water.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these lakes are located.

      - Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Kansas and Colorado.

      - Colorado is located directly west of Kansas

      - The entire state of Colorado is west of the entire state of Kansas


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - Since Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas and John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado,
      and Colorado is entirely west of Kansas, John Martin Reservoir must be west
      of Kanopolis Lake.


      NO. Kanopolis Lake in Kansas is NOT located west of John Martin Reservoir in
      Colorado. Rather, it''s the opposite - John Martin Reservoir is west of Kanopolis
      Lake.'

      Let''s think about the geography of these states:

      - Kansas is directly east of Colorado

      - Colorado is west of Kansas


      For general orientation, Kansas is in the central US, and Colorado is in the
      western/mountain region of the US.


      Since Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas, and John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado,
      the most likely scenario is that Kanopolis Lake is EAST of John Martin Reservoir
      (not west), since Kansas is east of Colorado.


      However, I should be careful here, as it''s possible that:

      1. Kanopolis Lake could be in western Kansas

      2. John Martin Reservoir could be in eastern Colorado

      3. The two bodies of water could have a more complex east-west relationship
      than the states themselves


      Let me think about where these specific bodies of water are located:

      - Kanopolis Lake is in central Kansas

      - John Martin Reservoir is in southeastern Colorado

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two bodies of

      Let me analyze the state locations first:

      - Colorado (CO) is located directly west of Kansas (KS)

      - Kansas is east of Colorado


      Now for the specific water bodies:

      - Kanopolis Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - John Martin Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      More specifically:

      - Kanopolis Lake is in central Kansas

      - John Martin Reservoir is in southeastern Colorado


      Since Colorado is west of Kansas, and these water bodies are within their respective

      - Betts House is at Yale University in Connecticut (CT)

      - Benedum Center is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is also on the East Coast, but is positioned west of Connecticut


      Step 3: Be more specific about the locations within these states.

      - Yale University is in New Haven, Connecticut, in the southern part of the
      state

      - Benedum Center is in Pittsburgh, in western Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Even though Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania, all of Connecticut lies
      east of Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, Betts House at Yale must be east of Benedum Center, not west

      To determine this, I need to think about the relative locations of these two

      1. Memphis, Tennessee is located in the western part of Tennessee, on the Mississippi
      River.

      2. Tennessee is east of Oklahoma in the United States.

      3. Lake Hudson is in Oklahoma, which is west of Tennessee.


      Since Tennessee is east of Oklahoma, and Memphis is in Tennessee, while Lake
      Hudson is in Oklahoma, Memphis (and any building in it) would be east of Lake
      Hudson, not west of it.


      Therefore, St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee would be EAST
      of Lake Hudson in Oklahoma, not WEST of it.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Memphis, Tennessee is located.

      Memphis is in the southwestern corner of Tennessee, along the Mississippi River.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Lake Hudson, Oklahoma is located.

      Lake Hudson is in northeastern Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      The states of Arkansas and a small part of Missouri lie between Tennessee and
      Oklahoma. When comparing the entire states, Oklahoma is west of Tennessee.


      Step 4: Since Memphis is in Tennessee (in the east) and Lake Hudson is in Oklahoma
      (in the west), St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis would be EAST of Lake
      Hudson, not west of it.

      Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee is located west of Lake Hudson in Oklahoma,
      I need to figure out the relative positions of these two locations on a map
      of the United States.


      First, let me consider the general geography:

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern/eastern part of the United States

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central part of the United States


      Looking at the relative positions of these states:

      - Oklahoma is generally west of Tennessee

      - Memphis is in the southwestern corner of Tennessee, bordering Arkansas

      - Lake Hudson would be somewhere in Oklahoma


      Since Oklahoma is west of Tennessee, and Memphis is in Tennessee, it would typically
      mean that Memphis (and thus St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral) would be east of
      any location in Oklahoma (including Lake Hudson).


      So, St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee should be EAST of
      Lake Hudson in Oklahoma, not west of it.</think>I''ll think about the relative
      geographic positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Determine the locations of both places.

      - St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Memphis, Tennessee

      - Lake Hudson is in Oklahoma


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Tennessee and Oklahoma.

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Oklahoma lies to the west of Tennessee

      - Memphis is in the western part of Tennessee, but Tennessee as a whole is still
      east of Oklahoma


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Oklahoma is west of Tennessee, Lake Hudson (in Oklahoma) must be west
      of St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral (in Memphis, Tennessee)

      - Therefore, St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral cannot be west of Lake Hudson;
      it would be east of it

      2. Lake Hudson in Oklahoma


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their geographic
      coordinates, specifically their longitudes. In the US, western locations have
      higher negative longitude values (or lower positive longitude values) than eastern
      locations.


      Memphis, Tennessee is located in the western part of Tennessee, near the Mississippi
      River on the western edge of the state. Tennessee itself is in the southeastern
      United States.


      Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States, west of Arkansas and
      north of Texas. It''s definitely west of Tennessee as a state.


      Lake Hudson (sometimes called Markham Ferry Reservoir) is in northeastern Oklahoma.


      Given the general geography of the US:

      - Memphis is in western Tennessee

      - Lake Hudson is in northeastern Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma as a whole is west of Tennessee


      Even though Lake Hudson is in the northeastern part of Oklahoma, and Memphis
      is in the western part of Tennessee, Oklahoma is still significantly west of
      Tennessee.


      So St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, TN would be EAST of Lake Hudson
      in Oklahoma, not west of it.</think>I''ll solve this step by step by comparing
      the geographic locations:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - St. Mary''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Memphis, Tennessee, which is located
      in the western part of Tennessee along the Mississippi River.

      - Lake Hudson (also known as Markham Ferry Reservoir) is in northeastern Oklahoma.


      Step 2: Compare the general geographic positions of Tennessee and Oklahoma.

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern United States.

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central United States.

      - Oklahoma is positioned west of Tennessee on the map.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      - Even though Memphis is on the western edge of Tennessee and Lake Hudson is
      in the northeastern part of Oklahoma, the overall west-to-east positioning of
      the states means that any location in Tennessee (including Memphis) would be
      east of virtually any location in Oklahoma (including Lake Hudson).

      Step 3: Compare their longitude (east-west position)

      Tennessee is in the eastern/southeastern United States, while Oklahoma is in
      the south-central United States, further west than Tennessee.


      Memphis is in the western part of Tennessee, but Oklahoma as a whole is still

      - Oklahoma is entirely west of Tennessee

      - Any location in Oklahoma, including Lake Hudson, would be west of any location

      2. Allegheny Reservoir in Pennsylvania


      Let me think about the geography of these states. New York state is generally
      north and east of Pennsylvania. Schenectady is in eastern New York, near Albany.
      The Allegheny Reservoir is in northwestern Pennsylvania, near the New York border.


      So let''s reason about this east-west relationship:

      - Schenectady is in eastern New York

      - The Allegheny Reservoir is in northwestern Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania is west of New York generally, especially western Pennsylvania
      compared to eastern New York

      - New York is generally east and north of Pennsylvania

      - Schenectady is located in eastern New York, near Albany

      - The Allegheny Reservoir is in northwestern Pennsylvania, near the NY-PA border

      - Eastern New York (where Schenectady is) lies to the east of northwestern Pennsylvania
      (where the Allegheny Reservoir is)

      - Moving from the Allegheny Reservoir to Schenectady would require traveling
      eastward


      NO, Proctor''s Theatre in Schenectady, New York is not located west of the Allegheny

      4) In the United States, New York is on the East Coast, while Illinois is more
      centrally located but still in the eastern half of the country.


      5) Illinois is west of New York. If we look at the map of the US, as we move
      from east to west, we go from the Atlantic Ocean (where NY is located) toward

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - NY (New York) is on the East Coast of the United States

      - IL (Illinois) is in the Midwest


      Generally speaking, Illinois is west of New York. That''s because the United

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - NY (New York) is on the east coast of the United States

      - IL (Illinois) is in the Midwest region of the United States


      Generally speaking, Illinois is west of New York. This is because the United

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      New York is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Illinois is
      in the Midwest region. On a map of the United States, Illinois is positioned
      to the west of New York.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      4. Pathfinder Reservoir is in central Wyoming.


      5. C.J. Strike Dam is in southwestern Idaho.


      6. On a west-east axis, Idaho is west of Wyoming. So generally, locations in

      7. Since C.J. Strike Dam is in southwestern Idaho, and Pathfinder Reservoir
      is in central Wyoming, the dam would be west of the reservoir.


      8. The question asks if Pathfinder Reservoir is west of C.J. Strike Dam, which

      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Wyoming is east of Idaho (Idaho is on the western border of Wyoming)

      - So generally, locations in Wyoming would be east of locations in Idaho


      Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming, and C.J. Strike Dam is in Idaho. Based on

      Idaho is located directly west of Wyoming on a US map. Idaho shares its eastern

      - Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming

      - C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho


      Step 3: Apply the geographic relationship.

      Since Wyoming is east of Idaho, and these structures are in their respective
      states, Pathfinder Reservoir would generally be east of C. J. Strike Dam, not

      NO - Pathfinder Reservoir, WY is not located west of C. J. Strike Dam, ID. It

      1. Pathfinder Reservoir, WY - This is in Wyoming (WY), which is east of Idaho
      (ID).

      2. C. J. Strike Dam, ID - This is in Idaho (ID), which is west of Wyoming (WY).


      Just based on the states, we can make a general assessment. Idaho is west of

      To be more precise:

      - Idaho''s eastern border touches Wyoming''s western border

      - Wyoming is entirely east of Idaho

      - Therefore, any location in Wyoming (including Pathfinder Reservoir) would
      be east of any location in Idaho (including C. J. Strike Dam)


      Since Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming, and C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho,
      Pathfinder Reservoir would be east of C. J. Strike Dam, not west of it.</think>#
      Is Pathfinder Reservoir, WY located west of C. J. Strike Dam, ID?


      To determine this, I need to analyze the relative locations of these two structures

      Step 1: Identify the states where each structure is located.

      - Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming (WY)

      - C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho (ID)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Wyoming and Idaho.

      - Idaho is located directly west of Wyoming

      - Wyoming shares its western border with Idaho''s eastern border


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the structures.

      First, I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these two
      water structures:


      1. **Pathfinder Reservoir** is located in Wyoming (WY)

      2. **C.J. Strike Dam** is located in Idaho (ID)


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - Idaho is located directly west of Wyoming

      - Wyoming borders Idaho on Idaho''s eastern side


      Since Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming and C.J. Strike Dam is in Idaho, and
      Wyoming is east of Idaho, Pathfinder Reservoir must be east of C.J. Strike Dam,
      not west of it.

      Let me think about the general geography of Wyoming and Idaho:

      - Idaho is located west of Wyoming

      - Wyoming is east of Idaho

      Since Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming and C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho, and

      is west of C. J. Strike Dam, and Wyoming is east of Idaho, the answer is most
      likely NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Wyoming and Idaho.

      - Idaho is located directly west of Wyoming on a US map

      - Wyoming shares its western border with Idaho


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the structures.

      - Since Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming, and C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho

      - And Idaho is west of Wyoming

      - C. J. Strike Dam would be west of Pathfinder Reservoir (not the other way

      NO, Pathfinder Reservoir, WY is not located west of C. J. Strike Dam, ID. It
      is located east of it.'

      Step 1: Locate the two places in question.

      - Grand America Hotel is in Utah (UT)

      - Shasta Dam is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographical position of these two states.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is inland, east of California


      Step 3: More specifically:

      - Shasta Dam is in northern California

      - Salt Lake City (where I believe Grand America Hotel is located) is in northern
      Utah


      Since California is west of Utah, and Shasta Dam is in California while Grand
      America Hotel is in Utah, the hotel would be east of the dam, not west.


      Therefore, Grand America Hotel in UT is NOT located west of Shasta Dam in CA.</think>I''ll
      think through this step-by-step:


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both structures.

      - Grand America Hotel is located in Salt Lake City, Utah (UT)

      - Shasta Dam is located in Northern California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between California and Utah.

      - California is positioned on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is an inland state located east of California


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Since Utah is east of California, and

      - Grand America Hotel is in Utah, while

      - Shasta Dam is in California

      - Therefore, Grand America Hotel must be east of Shasta Dam, not west


      NO (Grand America Hotel in Utah is not located west of Shasta Dam in California)'

      2. Shasta Dam in California (CA)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Grand America Hotel is located west of
      Shasta Dam.


      Let me think about the geography:

      - Utah is a state located in the Mountain West region of the United States

      - California is a state located on the west coast of the United States

      - Generally speaking, California is west of Utah


      Now for the specific locations:

      - Grand America Hotel is likely in Salt Lake City, which is in northern Utah

      - Shasta Dam is in northern California


      Since California is west of Utah, and these specific locations don''t change
      that general east-west relationship, Shasta Dam (in CA) would be west of Grand
      America Hotel (in UT), not the other way around.


      So Grand America Hotel is NOT west of Shasta Dam; rather, it''s east of it.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Grand America Hotel is located in Salt Lake City, Utah

      - Shasta Dam is located in northern California


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Utah and California.

      - California is positioned on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is inland, positioned to the east of California


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Utah is east of California, and these specific locations maintain this
      general east-west relationship, Grand America Hotel (in Utah) must be east of
      Shasta Dam (in California).

      - For Grand America Hotel to be west of Shasta Dam, it would need to be further
      west, which isn''t the case.


      NO, Grand America Hotel is not located west of Shasta Dam. It is located east
      of it.'

      - Kansas is a state in the central United States

      - Colorado is a state that borders Kansas to the west


      So broadly speaking, locations in Colorado tend to be west of locations in Kansas.

      Even though Auraria Campus is in the eastern portion of Colorado, any location
      in Kansas (including Council Grove Lake) would be east of any location in Colorado

      Wind Farm in Texas is west of the Basilica of San Albino in New Mexico.


      To do this, I need to think about the relative geographical positions of these
      two locations.


      First, let''s consider the general geography of Texas and New Mexico:

      - New Mexico is west of Texas

      - Texas is east of New Mexico


      The Basilica of San Albino is in New Mexico, and King Mountain Wind Farm is
      in Texas.


      Since New Mexico is generally west of Texas, and the Basilica is in New Mexico
      while the wind farm is in Texas, the most likely situation is that the Basilica
      of San Albino (in NM) is west of the King Mountain Wind Farm (in TX).


      So King Mountain Wind Farm (TX) would be EAST of the Basilica of San Albino
      (NM), not west of it.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO.


      However, I should note that this is based on general state positions. In reality,
      the precise locations could vary, especially if they''re near the border. But
      the most likely answer based on the general geography is NO.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these landmarks are located.

      - King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas (TX)

      - Basilica of San Albino is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Mexico is located to the west of Texas

      - Texas is located to the east of New Mexico


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific landmarks.

      Since the Basilica of San Albino is in New Mexico and King Mountain Wind Farm
      is in Texas, the basilica would generally be west of the wind farm (not the
      other way around).


      NO'
    c24d4ffb-d32e-43ce-8cfd-1d6954dd7355: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of two landmarks:

      1. King Mountain Wind Farm in Texas

      2. Basilica of San Albino in New Mexico


      First, I need to find their approximate locations:


      King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas (TX). Based on its name, it''s likely in
      the western part of Texas, possibly in an area with mountains or higher elevation.


      The Basilica of San Albino is in New Mexico (NM). New Mexico is generally west
      of Texas.


      However, the specific locations matter here. Texas is a large state that extends
      quite far west, and New Mexico''s eastern border is with western Texas. So a
      location in western Texas could potentially be west of a location in eastern
      New Mexico.


      Let me think about the typical geography:

      - New Mexico is directly west of Texas

      - Generally speaking, most places in New Mexico would be west of most places
      in Texas


      However, without specific coordinates or knowing exactly where in their respective
      states these landmarks are located, I can''t be completely certain.


      Based on the general geography of the US states, and the fact that New Mexico
      is west of Texas, it''s more likely that the Basilica of San Albino in NM is
      west of King Mountain Wind Farm in TX, not the other way around.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify the general geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico.

      New Mexico is located directly west of Texas. Their state borders run north-south,
      with New Mexico on the western side of this border.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas (TX). While I don''t have its exact coordinates,
      Texas wind farms are typically located in western parts of the state.


      The Basilica of San Albino is in New Mexico (NM). Since New Mexico is entirely
      west of Texas (except for a small overlapping area in their border), locations
      in New Mexico are generally west of locations in Texas.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since New Mexico is west of Texas, and these landmarks don''t appear to be in
      unusual border areas that would reverse this relationship, the Basilica of San
      Albino in New Mexico would be west of King Mountain Wind Farm in Texas.


      NO (King Mountain Wind Farm is not west of the Basilica; rather, the Basilica
      is west of the Wind Farm)'

      locations of two places and then determine if one is west of the other.


      The question asks about:

      1. King Mountain Wind Farm, TX (in Texas)

      2. Basilica of San Albino, NM (in New Mexico)


      I need to figure out their relative positions to determine if King Mountain
      Wind Farm is west of Basilica of San Albino.


      In the United States, Texas is generally southeast of New Mexico. New Mexico
      borders Texas on Texas''s western side. This would suggest that locations in
      New Mexico tend to be west of locations in Texas.


      King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas, and the Basilica of San Albino is in New
      Mexico. Based on the general geography of these states, a location in New Mexico
      (like the Basilica) would typically be west of a location in Texas (like the
      wind farm).


      Therefore, King Mountain Wind Farm in TX is likely east of the Basilica of San
      Albino in NM, not west of it.</think># Is King Mountain Wind Farm, TX located
      west of Basilica of San Albino, NM?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two locations.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' locations

      - King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas (TX)

      - Basilica of San Albino is in New Mexico (NM)


      ## Step 2: Analyze the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico

      New Mexico is located directly west of Texas. The entire western border of Texas
      connects with the eastern portion of New Mexico.


      ## Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific locations

      Since King Mountain Wind Farm is in Texas and the Basilica of San Albino is
      in New Mexico, the wind farm would generally be east of the basilica, not west
      of it.


      # NO


      King Mountain Wind Farm in Texas is not located west of the Basilica of San
      Albino in New Mexico. It would be east of it, following the general geographic
      arrangement of these two states.'

      Step 3: Determine directional relationship.

      - Places in eastern Washington are east of places in western Washington.

      Bridge Canyon Dam (sometimes called Hualapai Dam) was a proposed dam on the
      Colorado River in Arizona. It would have been located in the western part of
      Arizona, in the Grand Canyon area where the Colorado River forms part of the

      Arizona is generally east of California. The Colorado River at Bridge Canyon
      would be in western Arizona, but California extends much further west since
      it reaches the Pacific Ocean. San Luis Obispo County is in central/southern

      River which forms part of Arizona''s western border.


      Topaz Solar Farm, CA would be in California. California is generally west of
      Arizona, but I need to determine where in California this solar farm is located.


      The Topaz Solar Farm is located in San Luis Obispo County, which is in central/southern
      California, relatively close to the coast.


      Arizona is entirely east of California. The Colorado River forms the border
      between these states, with Arizona on the east side and California on the west
      side.


      Given that Bridge Canyon Dam is in Arizona and Topaz Solar Farm is in California,
      and California is west of Arizona, it follows that Bridge Canyon Dam is NOT
      west of Topaz Solar Farm. Instead, Bridge Canyon Dam would be east of Topaz
      Solar Farm.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      locations of these two structures.


      Step 1: Identify where Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ is located.

      Bridge Canyon Dam (also known as Bridge Canyon Project) was a proposed dam on
      the Colorado River in western Arizona, near the boundary with Nevada.


      Step 2: Identify where Topaz Solar Farm, CA is located.

      Topaz Solar Farm is located in San Luis Obispo County in central California,
      which is on the western side of the state.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      California is located entirely west of Arizona. The Colorado River forms much
      of the border between these states, with Arizona to the east and California
      to the west.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Bridge Canyon Dam is in Arizona (eastern state) and Topaz Solar Farm is
      in California (western state), Bridge Canyon Dam must be east of Topaz Solar
      Farm, not west.


      NO'

      locations of Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ and Topaz Solar Farm, CA.


      First, let me locate Bridge Canyon Dam in Arizona. Bridge Canyon Dam is/was
      a proposed dam site on the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon in Arizona. It
      was never built, but the proposed location would have been in western Arizona
      where the Colorado River runs.


      Now let me locate Topaz Solar Farm in California. Topaz Solar Farm is a large
      solar farm located in San Luis Obispo County, California. San Luis Obispo is
      in central/southern California, on the western side of California.


      Now to determine if Bridge Canyon Dam (or its proposed location) is west of
      Topaz Solar Farm:

      - Arizona is east of California

      - Bridge Canyon would be in western Arizona

      - Topaz Solar Farm is in central/western California


      Generally, any location in Arizona would be east of a location in central/western
      California because California is the westernmost contiguous state, with Arizona
      directly to its east.</think># Determining the Relative Locations


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic positions of both
      structures and compare their east-west relationship.


      ## Step 1: Locate Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ

      Bridge Canyon Dam was a proposed dam site on the Colorado River in the Grand
      Canyon, located in western Arizona. While never constructed, its planned location
      was in the western portion of Arizona.


      ## Step 2: Locate Topaz Solar Farm, CA

      Topaz Solar Farm is located in San Luis Obispo County in central California,
      near the western coast of the state.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      Arizona is entirely east of California in the United States. Even the westernmost
      parts of Arizona (including the Bridge Canyon Dam site) are east of central
      California locations like the Topaz Solar Farm.


      # Answer: NO


      Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ is NOT located west of Topaz Solar Farm, CA. It is located
      east of it.'

      Dam, AZ is located west of Topaz Solar Farm, CA, I need to identify the locations
      of both and compare their east-west positions.


      1. Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ would be located in Arizona, likely along the Colorado
      River.

      2. Topaz Solar Farm, CA would be located in California.


      Generally speaking, Arizona is east of California, since California is on the
      west coast of the United States and Arizona is inland. However, I need to be
      more precise about these specific locations.


      Bridge Canyon Dam (also known as Bridge Canyon Project or Hualapai Dam) was
      a proposed dam on the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon in Arizona. It was
      never built, but its proposed location would have been in western Arizona.


      Topaz Solar Farm is a photovoltaic power station in San Luis Obispo County,
      California, which is in central/southern California.


      California extends further east than many people realize, and Arizona''s western
      border with California runs along the Colorado River. However, San Luis Obispo
      County is definitely on the western side of California, while Bridge Canyon
      would be on the eastern side of the California-Arizona border.


      So Bridge Canyon Dam (or its proposed location) in Arizona would be east of
      Topaz Solar Farm in California.</think># Is Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ located west
      of Topaz Solar Farm, CA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Locate Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ

      Bridge Canyon Dam (sometimes called Hualapai Dam) was a proposed dam site on
      the Colorado River in western Arizona, near the Grand Canyon.


      ## Step 2: Locate Topaz Solar Farm, CA

      Topaz Solar Farm is located in San Luis Obispo County, which is in central/southern
      California along the western portion of the state.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      California is generally west of Arizona geographically. San Luis Obispo County
      is on the western side of California, while the Colorado River location for
      Bridge Canyon Dam would be along the Arizona-California border, but on the Arizona
      (eastern) side.


      Therefore, Bridge Canyon Dam would be east of Topaz Solar Farm, not west.


      NO'

      of Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ and Topaz Solar Farm, CA, and then compare their east-west
      positions to determine if Bridge Canyon Dam is west of Topaz Solar Farm.


      Bridge Canyon Dam would be located in Arizona (AZ), likely along the Colorado
      River since it''s a dam. Arizona is generally east of California.


      Topaz Solar Farm is located in California (CA). California is on the west coast
      of the United States, and is generally west of Arizona.


      Given the typical geography of the United States, with California being west
      of Arizona, it would be unlikely that Bridge Canyon Dam in Arizona would be
      west of Topaz Solar Farm in California. However, I should consider the specific
      locations within these states, as borders are irregular and parts of eastern
      California could potentially be east of parts of western Arizona.


      Let me think about where exactly these landmarks might be. The Colorado River
      forms part of the border between Arizona and California, so a dam on this river
      could potentially be right at the border. However, "Bridge Canyon" suggests
      it might be in the Grand Canyon area, which is more central/northern Arizona,
      not at the western border.


      Topaz Solar Farm is likely in one of California''s sunny desert or valley regions,
      but without knowing the exact location, I can''t be certain of its east-west
      position relative to Bridge Canyon Dam.</think># Is Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ located
      west of Topaz Solar Farm, CA?


      Let me think about the locations of these two structures:


      1) Bridge Canyon Dam (also known as Bridge Canyon Dam Site) would be located
      in Arizona (AZ), specifically in the western part of the state where the Colorado
      River flows through Bridge Canyon.


      2) Topaz Solar Farm is located in California (CA), specifically in San Luis
      Obispo County in central California.


      3) California is generally west of Arizona on a map of the United States.


      4) Even though Bridge Canyon is in western Arizona, it would still be east of
      most of California, including San Luis Obispo County where Topaz Solar Farm
      is located.


      5) Looking at the geography, structures in Arizona (even western Arizona) would
      be east of structures in central California.


      NO, Bridge Canyon Dam is not located west of Topaz Solar Farm. It is east of

      - Lake Francis Case is a reservoir on the Missouri River in South Dakota


      Given that:

      - South Dakota is entirely west of Iowa

      - Dubuque is on the far eastern edge of Iowa

      - Lake Francis Case is somewhere in South Dakota


      Lake Francis Case must be west of St. Raphael''s Cathedral in Dubuque, Iowa.


      So the question asks if St. Raphael''s Cathedral is west of Lake Francis Case.

      border of Iowa along the Mississippi River.


      2) Lake Francis Case is a reservoir on the Missouri River in South Dakota.


      3) Geographically, South Dakota is located entirely to the west of Iowa.


      4) Since Dubuque is on the far eastern edge of Iowa, and Lake Francis Case is
      somewhere in South Dakota, the lake must be west of the cathedral.


      5) The question asks if the cathedral is west of the lake, which would be the
      opposite of their actual positions.

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - KS (Kansas) is in the central United States

      - CO (Colorado) is west of Kansas


      Since Kansas is east of Colorado, generally locations in Kansas would be east
      of locations in Colorado, not west.


      Milford Lake is in Kansas, and Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Colorado.
      Based on the general geographic relationship between these two states, Milford
      Lake (in Kansas) would be east of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center (in Colorado).


      So the answer would be NO, Milford Lake, KS is not located west of Fitzsimons
      Army Medical Center, CO. It''s located east of it.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two locations.

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Kansas and Colorado.

      - Colorado is located directly west of Kansas

      - Kansas is east of Colorado


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      - Since Milford Lake is in Kansas, and Kansas is east of Colorado

      - And Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Colorado

      - Milford Lake must be east of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, not west

      by step.


      1. I need to determine the relative east-west positions of two locations: Milford
      Lake in Kansas (KS) and Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Colorado (CO).


      2. First, I need to consider the states: Kansas (KS) and Colorado (CO). Looking
      at the US map, Colorado is directly west of Kansas. Kansas is east of Colorado.


      3. Since Milford Lake is in Kansas and Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in
      Colorado, the general positioning would suggest that Milford Lake is east of
      Fitzsimons Army Medical Center.


      4. However, I need to be careful because specific locations within states could
      potentially change this relationship, especially if they''re near state borders.


      5. Milford Lake is in the northeastern part of Kansas, not close to the Colorado
      border.


      6. Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Aurora, which is in the eastern part
      of Colorado, close to Denver.


      7. Given that Colorado is west of Kansas, and these specific locations aren''t
      near the state borders in a way that would reverse their relative positions,
      Milford Lake (in Kansas) is east of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center (in Colorado).


      8. Therefore, Milford Lake is NOT west of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center. It''s
      east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - Milford Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Determine the general state positions

      - Colorado is located directly west of Kansas on the US map

      - Kansas is east of Colorado


      Step 3: Consider specific locations

      - Milford Lake is in northeastern Kansas

      - Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is in Aurora, in the eastern part of Colorado
      (near Denver)


      Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Colorado is west of Kansas, and these specific locations don''t change
      this relationship (they''re not positioned in a way that would reverse their
      east-west orientation), Milford Lake must be east of Fitzsimons Army Medical

      I''ll think about the states first. Kansas (KS) is east of Colorado (CO) in

      part of Colorado (near Denver)

      - Milford Lake is in north-central Kansas


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Since Kansas is east of Colorado, and Milford Lake is in Kansas while Fitzsimons

      In the US, locations that are more west have higher (more negative) longitude
      values.


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - New Mexico is a state in the southwestern United States

      - California is on the west coast of the United States


      Generally speaking, California is west of New Mexico. This would mean that Saint
      Joseph Parish in Mountain View, California would be west of Navajo Lake, New
      Mexico.


      Mountain View is in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is on the western side
      of California near the Pacific Ocean. This puts it very far west in the continental
      United States.


      Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado border.


      Given the general geography of the United States, with California being the
      westernmost continental state and New Mexico being more inland, Saint Joseph
      Parish in Mountain View, California would be west of Navajo Lake, New Mexico.


      Therefore, Navajo Lake, NM is NOT located west of Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain
      View, CA. Rather, it''s east of it.</think># Is Navajo Lake, NM located west
      of Saint Joseph Parish (Mountain View, California), CA?


      I need to think about the geographic locations of these two places:


      1. Navajo Lake is located in New Mexico, in the southwestern United States.

      2. Saint Joseph Parish is in Mountain View, California, which is in the San
      Francisco Bay Area on the west coast.


      Looking at the general geography of the United States:

      - California forms the western border of the continental United States along
      the Pacific Ocean

      - New Mexico is an inland state, located east of California

      - Mountain View specifically is on the western side of California near the coast

      - All of New Mexico is east of all of California


      Since California is west of New Mexico, Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View,
      California is west of Navajo Lake, New Mexico - not the other way around.

      2. Where is Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View, California located

      3. Compare their east-west positions to determine if Navajo Lake is west of
      Saint Joseph Parish


      First, Navajo Lake is in New Mexico (NM), which is generally east of California.
      New Mexico is in the southwestern United States, but California is even further
      west on the Pacific coast.


      Saint Joseph Parish (Mountain View) is in California (CA), which is on the west

      2) Saint Joseph Parish is located in Mountain View, California (CA)

      3) California is the westernmost continental state in the United States, bordering

      cannot be west of Saint Joseph Parish.

      - Louisiana is located directly east of Texas

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana

      - Texas extends westward from the Louisiana border


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      Since New Orleans is in Louisiana (which is east of Texas), and Barker Reservoir
      is in Texas (which is west of Louisiana), the Civic Theatre in New Orleans must
      be east of Barker Reservoir.

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana

      - Barker Reservoir is in the Houston area in eastern Texas


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Since New Orleans is in Louisiana (east of Texas), and Barker Reservoir is in

      in New Orleans, LA is located west of Barker Reservoir in Texas, I need to determine
      the relative locations of these two places.


      First, let me think about their states:

      - Civic Theatre is in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)

      - Barker Reservoir is in Texas (TX)


      In the United States, Texas is generally west of Louisiana. Louisiana borders
      Texas on Texas''s eastern border.


      So geographically speaking, locations in Louisiana would typically be east of
      locations in Texas, not west.


      New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana, while Barker Reservoir is
      likely in eastern Texas (though I should verify its specific location). Based
      on the general geography, New Orleans would be east of most points in Texas.


      So my reasoning suggests that Civic Theatre in New Orleans, LA would be east
      of Barker Reservoir, TX, not west of it.</think># Is Civic Theatre (New Orleans),
      LA located west of Barker Reservoir, TX?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Civic Theatre is in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)

      - Barker Reservoir is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between the states

      Louisiana is located east of Texas. The entire state of Louisiana is positioned
      to the east of Texas on the US map.


      ## Step 3: Specific locations

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico

      - Barker Reservoir is in the Houston area in southeastern Texas


      ## Step 4: Directional relationship

      Since New Orleans is in Louisiana (east) and Barker Reservoir is in Texas (west),
      the Civic Theatre in New Orleans must be east of Barker Reservoir, not west.

      whether Jocassee Dam in South Carolina (SC) is located west of Lewis Smith Lake
      in Alabama (AL).


      To answer this question, I need to consider the relative geographic positions
      of these two structures.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of these two states:

      - South Carolina (SC) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Alabama (AL) is in the southeastern United States, but it''s not on the east
      coast


      Generally speaking, Alabama is west of South Carolina. This would suggest that
      structures in South Carolina would typically be east of structures in Alabama,
      not west.


      So the initial expectation would be that Jocassee Dam (in SC) would be EAST
      of Lewis Smith Lake (in AL), not west.


      Let me double-check this reasoning by thinking about the specific locations:

      - Jocassee Dam is in the western part of South Carolina, near the border with
      North Carolina

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in north-central Alabama


      Even though Jocassee Dam is in western SC, it''s still going to be east of any
      location in Alabama because the entire state of SC is east of AL.</think>To
      determine if Jocassee Dam, SC is located west of Lewis Smith Lake, AL, I need
      to consider the geographic positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' positions.

      South Carolina (SC) is located on the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United
      States.

      Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States, but inland and west
      of South Carolina.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      Alabama is entirely west of South Carolina on a map of the United States.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Since Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina and Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama,
      and South Carolina is east of Alabama, Jocassee Dam must be east of Lewis Smith
      Lake (not west).


      NO, Jocassee Dam, SC is not located west of Lewis Smith Lake, AL. It is located
      east of it.'

      to determine the geographic locations of both Jocassee Dam in South Carolina
      and Lewis Smith Lake in Alabama, and then compare their east-west positioning.


      First, let me think about the general locations:

      - Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina (SC), which is on the eastern side of the
      United States

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama (AL), which is more toward the central-southeastern
      United States


      Now I need to consider their specific locations relative to each other. Geographically:

      - South Carolina is east of Alabama

      - In the US, states generally get more western as you move from right to left
      on a map


      Since Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina and Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama,
      and South Carolina is east of Alabama, it''s likely that Jocassee Dam is east
      of Lewis Smith Lake, not west.


      Therefore, Jocassee Dam, SC would NOT be located west of Lewis Smith Lake, AL.
      It would be located east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two structures.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina (SC)

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - On a US map, South Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern US, but inland from the Atlantic coast


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - South Carolina is positioned to the east of Alabama

      - Moving from Alabama to South Carolina means traveling eastward


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions of the specific locations.

      - Since Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina and Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama,
      the dam would be to the east of the lake, following the general geographic positioning
      of their respective states.


      NO, Jocassee Dam, SC is not located west of Lewis Smith Lake, AL. It is located

      First, let me think about the general geographic relationship between South
      Carolina and Alabama. South Carolina is on the east coast of the United States,
      while Alabama is more inland and to the west of South Carolina.


      So generally speaking, locations in South Carolina tend to be east of locations
      in Alabama. However, I need to be more precise and consider the specific locations.


      Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina, which is on the eastern side of the southeastern
      United States.

      Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama, which is west of South Carolina.


      Given the general geography of the United States, with South Carolina being
      on the Atlantic coast and Alabama being inland and further west, it''s highly
      unlikely that Jocassee Dam would be west of Lewis Smith Lake.


      Therefore, Jocassee Dam in SC is likely east of Lewis Smith Lake in AL, not

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship.

      When comparing locations across these states, places in South Carolina are typically
      east of places in Alabama, as the entire state of South Carolina lies east of
      Alabama.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Jocassee Dam is in the western part of South Carolina, but even the westernmost
      point of South Carolina is still east of Alabama where Lewis Smith Lake is located.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina (an eastern state) and Lewis Smith Lake
      is in Alabama (a more western state), Jocassee Dam must be east of Lewis Smith

      Alabama:

      - South Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, in the southeastern United States

      - Alabama is further west than South Carolina, also in the southeastern United
      States


      Generally speaking, Alabama is west of South Carolina. But I need to verify

      Jocassee Dam is in South Carolina, near the border with North Carolina in the
      northwestern part of SC.


      Lewis Smith Lake (with Smith Dam) is in Alabama, likely in the northern or central
      part of the state.


      Even though Jocassee Dam is in the western part of South Carolina, and Lewis
      Smith Lake might be in the eastern part of Alabama, Alabama as a whole is west
      of South Carolina. So it''s highly unlikely that Jocassee Dam would be west
      of Lewis Smith Lake.


      Therefore, Jocassee Dam in SC should be east of Lewis Smith Lake in AL, not
      west of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative

      - Alabama is located inland, also in the southeastern US, but west of South
      Carolina


      Step 3: Even considering that Jocassee Dam might be in western SC and Lewis
      Smith Lake might be in eastern AL, the overall geography of the United States

      The United States is oriented such that the east coast is on the Atlantic Ocean

      South Carolina (SC) is an east coast state, located on the Atlantic Ocean.

      Alabama (AL) is not on the coast, but is further west than South Carolina, as
      it''s located in the southeastern United States but not directly on the Atlantic.

      Therefore, San Carlos Lake, AZ is NOT located west of All Saints Episcopal Church
      in Pasadena, California. The answer would be NO.</think>To determine if San
      Carlos Lake, AZ is west of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, California,
      I need to compare their relative geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' positions.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Arizona
      is directly east of California.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations.

      Pasadena is in Southern California, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

      San Carlos Lake is in eastern Arizona.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since California is west of Arizona, and Pasadena is in California while San
      Carlos Lake is in Arizona, San Carlos Lake must be east of All Saints Episcopal
      Church in Pasadena.


      NO, San Carlos Lake, AZ is not located west of All Saints Episcopal Church in
      Pasadena, California.'

      determining the locations of these two places:


      1. San Carlos Lake, AZ - This is a lake in Arizona

      2. All Saints Episcopal Church (Pasadena, California), CA - This is a church
      in Pasadena, California


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their approximate
      longitudes. In the United States:

      - West coast states are generally further west than states in the middle or
      eastern portion

      - Arizona is east of California

      - California is on the west coast

      - Pasadena is in the Los Angeles area of Southern California


      Since California is west of Arizona, and Pasadena is in California, while San
      Carlos Lake is in Arizona, the lake should be EAST of the church, not west.


      So San Carlos Lake is NOT west of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two locations by examining
      their geographic coordinates.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - San Carlos Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      - All Saints Episcopal Church is in Pasadena, California (CA)


      Looking at the general geography of the United States:

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is located immediately east of California


      Since San Carlos Lake is in Arizona, and All Saints Episcopal Church is in California,
      the lake must be east of the church, not west of it.


      In the United States, as you move from west to east, you would encounter California
      first, then Arizona. Therefore, San Carlos Lake cannot be west of the church
      in Pasadena.

    ab9d8d23-0f12-4846-aa25-3c7da38a1d4a: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      locations of Ice Harbor Dam in Washington state and Trojan Nuclear Power Plant
      in Oregon state.


      First, I''ll consider the general geography of Washington and Oregon. Washington
      is north of Oregon, and both states are on the west coast of the United States.


      Ice Harbor Dam, WA would be in Washington state. Let me think about where in
      Washington it might be. Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River, which forms part
      of the Washington-Idaho border and flows into the Columbia River. The Snake
      River is in the eastern part of Washington state.


      Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, OR would be in Oregon state. I believe the Trojan
      Nuclear Power Plant was located on the Columbia River, which forms the border
      between Washington and Oregon. It was in the northern part of Oregon, likely
      in the northwestern portion of the state near Portland.


      If Ice Harbor Dam is in eastern Washington (on the Snake River), and Trojan
      Nuclear Power Plant is in northwestern Oregon (on the Columbia River), then
      Ice Harbor Dam would be east of the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant.


      To be more specific:

      - Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in eastern Washington

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was on the Columbia River in northwestern Oregon

      - Eastern Washington is east of northwestern Oregon</think># Determining the
      Relative Locations


      I need to figure out where these two structures are located in relation to each
      other.


      ## Ice Harbor Dam, WA

      - Located on the Snake River in eastern Washington

      - The Snake River is in the eastern part of Washington state, near the Idaho
      border

      - Eastern Washington is quite inland from the Pacific coast


      ## Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, OR

      - Was located on the Columbia River in northwestern Oregon

      - The Columbia River forms the border between Washington and Oregon

      - Northwestern Oregon is relatively close to the Pacific coast


      ## Comparing Locations

      - Eastern Washington is east of northwestern Oregon

      - Ice Harbor Dam (eastern WA) would be east of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant (northwestern
      OR)

      - "West of" would mean Ice Harbor Dam is closer to the Pacific Ocean than Trojan,
      which is not the case


      # NO


      Ice Harbor Dam is not west of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant. It is east of it.'
    bfb3a6d5-9631-41ee-9cae-76790fe7c6f5: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      locations of the Ice Harbor Dam in Washington state (WA) and the Trojan Nuclear
      Power Plant in Oregon state (OR).


      First, I''ll think about the rough geography of Washington and Oregon. Washington
      is north of Oregon, and both states are on the west coast of the United States.
      Within these states, I need to know the specific locations of these structures.


      Ice Harbor Dam, WA would be located somewhere in Washington state. Washington
      has several dams, particularly on the Columbia River which forms part of the
      border between Washington and Oregon.


      The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon would be somewhere in Oregon state.


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their east-west
      positions (longitudes).


      Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in southeastern Washington. The Snake River
      is a major tributary of the Columbia River, and it flows through eastern Washington.


      The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located on the Columbia River in northwestern
      Oregon, near the town of Rainier, not far from Portland.


      Given these locations:

      - Ice Harbor Dam is in eastern Washington

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is in western Oregon


      Since Oregon is south of Washington, and the Trojan plant is in western Oregon
      while Ice Harbor Dam is in eastern Washington, the Trojan plant would be west
      of the Ice Harbor Dam.


      So, is Ice Harbor Dam west of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant? No, it''s the opposite
      - the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is west of Ice Harbor Dam.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the east-west relationship between these
      two structures.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - Ice Harbor Dam is located on the Snake River in southeastern Washington state.

      - Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located on the Columbia River near Rainier
      in northwestern Oregon.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Southeastern Washington is in the eastern part of the Pacific Northwest region.

      - Northwestern Oregon is in the western part of the Pacific Northwest, close
      to the Pacific coast.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - The Snake River in eastern Washington is significantly east of the lower Columbia
      River area where Trojan was located.

      - Structures in northwestern Oregon are generally west of structures in southeastern
      Washington.


      NO - Ice Harbor Dam is not west of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant. It is east of
      it.'
    c08bb206-09f9-454f-ae7c-49262d569601: '<think>This question is asking about the
      relative locations of two structures in the US:

      1. Ice Harbor Dam in Washington state (WA)

      2. Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon (OR)


      I need to determine if Ice Harbor Dam is located west of Trojan Nuclear Power
      Plant.


      Let me think about the geography:


      Ice Harbor Dam is on the Snake River in Washington state. The Snake River is
      in the eastern part of Washington state, near the Idaho border.


      The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant was located on the Columbia River in Oregon.
      The Columbia River forms much of the border between Washington and Oregon, and
      it flows westward to the Pacific Ocean. The Trojan plant was in the northwestern
      part of Oregon, not far from Portland.


      In general:

      - Eastern Washington is where Ice Harbor Dam would be located

      - Northwestern Oregon is where Trojan Nuclear Power Plant would be located


      Given that Washington is north of Oregon, and we''re comparing an eastern Washington
      location to a northwestern Oregon location:

      - Ice Harbor Dam would be northeast of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant

      - This means Trojan Nuclear Power Plant would be southwest of Ice Harbor Dam

      - Therefore, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant would be WEST of Ice Harbor Dam, not
      the other way around


      So Ice Harbor Dam is NOT west of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant - it''s east of
      it.</think># Determining the Relative Locations


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic positions of both
      structures and compare their east-west relationship.


      ## Step 1: Locate Ice Harbor Dam, WA

      Ice Harbor Dam is located on the Snake River in eastern Washington state, near
      the border with Idaho.


      ## Step 2: Locate Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, OR

      The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant (now decommissioned) was located along the Columbia
      River in northwestern Oregon, not far from Portland.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      Eastern Washington is significantly east of northwestern Oregon. The Snake River
      region where Ice Harbor Dam is located is in the eastern part of Washington
      state, while the Trojan plant was in the western portion of Oregon near the
      Pacific coast.


      ## Conclusion

      NO, Ice Harbor Dam is NOT located west of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant. It is
      actually east of it.'

      First, let me identify where these places are located:


      1. Hebgen Lake is in Montana (MT). Montana is in the northwestern United States.

      2. Aladdin Theater is in Portland, Oregon (OR). Oregon is also in the northwestern
      United States, on the Pacific coast.


      To determine if Hebgen Lake is west of the Aladdin Theater, I need to consider
      their relative positions.


      In the United States:

      - West corresponds to locations closer to the Pacific Ocean

      - East corresponds to locations closer to the Atlantic Ocean


      Oregon is on the Pacific coast, while Montana is inland to the east of Oregon.
      This means that generally, locations in Montana would be east of locations in
      Oregon, not west.

      Oregon, not west of it.</think># Reasoning about the locations of Hebgen Lake,
      MT and Aladdin Theater in Portland, OR


      To determine if Hebgen Lake is west of the Aladdin Theater, I need to identify
      the geographic positions of both locations.


      Step 1: Determine the locations of both places.

      - Hebgen Lake is located in Montana (MT) in the northwestern United States.

      - Aladdin Theater is in Portland, Oregon (OR), which is also in the northwestern
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Montana and Oregon.

      - Oregon is located on the Pacific coast.

      - Montana is an inland state that borders Oregon''s eastern neighbors (Idaho
      and Washington).

      - Montana is positioned to the east of Oregon.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on this geographic relationship.

      - Since Montana is east of Oregon, Hebgen Lake (in Montana) would be east of
      the Aladdin Theater (in Portland, Oregon).

      - Therefore, Hebgen Lake is NOT west of the Aladdin Theater.

      - Portland, Oregon is located in the northwestern part of Oregon.

      - Oregon is on the Pacific coast of the United States.

      - Montana (MT) is a state located inland, to the east of Oregon.

      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - Kansas (KS) is a state in the central United States

      - Colorado (CO) is a state directly west of Kansas


      Since Colorado is west of Kansas, and Waconda Lake is in Kansas while Rampart
      Reservoir is in Colorado, it''s likely that Waconda Lake is east of Rampart
      Reservoir, not west.


      But let me be more precise. The question is asking if Waconda Lake is west of
      Rampart Reservoir. Since Kansas is east of Colorado, generally speaking, locations
      in Kansas would be east of locations in Colorado, not west. Therefore, Waconda
      Lake (in Kansas) would be east of Rampart Reservoir (in Colorado), not west
      of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two bodies of water.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these bodies of water are located.

      - Waconda Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - Rampart Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Kansas and Colorado.

      - Colorado is located directly west of Kansas

      - Kansas is east of Colorado


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific bodies of water.

      - Since Waconda Lake is in Kansas, and Kansas is east of Colorado

      - And Rampart Reservoir is in Colorado, which is west of Kansas

      - It follows that Waconda Lake would be east of Rampart Reservoir, not west

    ee3f3be0-0fb9-483c-a144-5489ad1b2606: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative geographical positions of Lower Granite Dam, WA and
      St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA.


      First, let me identify where each location is:


      1. Lower Granite Dam, WA: This dam is located on the Snake River in eastern
      Washington state. The Snake River flows through eastern Washington, forming
      part of the border between Washington and Idaho.


      2. St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA: This cathedral is located in
      Seattle, which is in western Washington state, on the shores of Puget Sound
      near the Pacific Ocean.


      In terms of east-west orientation in Washington state:

      - Western Washington includes the Puget Sound region (including Seattle)

      - Eastern Washington includes the Snake River region (where Lower Granite Dam
      is located)


      Since Seattle is in western Washington and Lower Granite Dam is in eastern Washington,
      Lower Granite Dam would be EAST of Seattle, not west of it.


      Therefore, Lower Granite Dam is NOT located west of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral
      in Seattle.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two structures in Washington state.


      Step 1: Locate St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral

      St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is located in Seattle, Washington, which is
      in the western part of the state near Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 2: Locate Lower Granite Dam

      Lower Granite Dam is situated on the Snake River in eastern Washington state,
      near the Idaho border. The Snake River flows through the eastern portion of
      Washington.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      Washington state extends from the Pacific Ocean (west) to Idaho (east). Since
      Seattle is in western Washington and Lower Granite Dam is in eastern Washington,
      the dam is located east of Seattle, not west.


      NO, Lower Granite Dam is not located west of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral
      in Seattle. It is located east of it.'

      El Vado Lake is in New Mexico (NM), which is located in the southwestern United
      States.

      Lake Yosemite is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Geographically, California is generally west of New Mexico. California borders
      the Pacific Ocean on its western side, while New Mexico is an inland state several
      states east of California.


      So if we''re comparing the east-west positions of these lakes, a lake in New
      Mexico would typically be east of a lake in California, not west of it.


      Therefore, El Vado Lake, NM is likely east of Lake Yosemite, CA, not west of
      it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two

      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      California (CA) is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.

      New Mexico (NM) is an inland state in the southwestern US, located east of California.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      States in the US generally follow a clear west-to-east arrangement. California
      is one of the westernmost states, while New Mexico is several states to the
      east.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific lakes.

      Since El Vado Lake is in New Mexico, and Lake Yosemite is in California, El
      Vado Lake would be east of Lake Yosemite, not west of it.

      To answer this, I need to know the relative positions of these two lakes, specifically

      values than eastern locations.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - NM (New Mexico) is located in the southwestern United States

      - CA (California) is located on the west coast of the United States


      Generally, California is west of New Mexico. This would suggest that Lake Yosemite
      in California would be west of El Vado Lake in New Mexico.


      However, I should be careful as the specific locations of these lakes within
      their states could potentially reverse this relationship. California extends
      quite far east in some parts, and New Mexico could have features in its western
      portions.


      But based on the general geography of the United States, California is positioned
      west of New Mexico, so Lake Yosemite in CA is most likely west of El Vado Lake
      in NM.</think># Is El Vado Lake, NM located west of Lake Yosemite, CA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two lakes by considering

      - El Vado Lake is in New Mexico (NM)

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      California is located on the western coast of the United States, while New Mexico
      is located inland in the southwestern part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      California is positioned west of New Mexico on the map of the United States.
      Even the easternmost parts of California are generally not east of the westernmost
      parts of New Mexico.


      Step 4: Apply this to the lakes.

      Since Lake Yosemite is in California and El Vado Lake is in New Mexico, Lake
      Yosemite would be west of El Vado Lake, not the other way around.

      Washington, D.C. is on the east coast of the United States, in the eastern part
      of the country.

      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, west of Washington,
      D.C.


      Springfield is the capital city of Illinois, located in the central part of
      the state.

      Lake Springfield would be near Springfield, IL.


      So geographically speaking:

      - Washington, D.C. is further east

      - Washington, DC is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwestern United States

      - Springfield is in central Illinois


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions.

      - Washington, DC is significantly east of Illinois

      - Any courthouse in DC would be east of any lake in Illinois

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern United States, but generally west

      Since the question is asking about specific buildings rather than the states

      city information about Durfee Hall, I can rely on the state-level geography:


      Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States. Therefore,
      a building in Connecticut (Durfee Hall) would generally be east of a building

    945dc2ae-f454-432d-a149-189d27f79a38: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative locations of two structures in the United States:

      1. Durfee Hall in Connecticut (CT)

      2. Genetti Hotel in Pennsylvania (PA)


      I need to figure out which one is further west. In the United States, west corresponds
      to moving toward the Pacific Ocean, while east corresponds to moving toward
      the Atlantic Ocean.


      Connecticut (CT) is a state in the northeastern United States, located in New
      England.

      Pennsylvania (PA) is also in the northeastern United States, but is generally
      west of Connecticut.


      Connecticut borders:

      - New York to the west

      - Massachusetts to the north

      - Rhode Island to the east

      - Long Island Sound (Atlantic Ocean) to the south


      Pennsylvania borders:

      - Ohio to the west

      - New York to the north

      - New Jersey to the east

      - Maryland and Delaware to the south


      Since Pennsylvania is generally west of Connecticut, structures in Connecticut
      would typically be east of structures in Pennsylvania, not west.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Durfee Hall is in Connecticut (CT)

      - Genetti Hotel is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in New
      England.

      Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern US, but is positioned west of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Consider the general east-west orientation.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is entirely east of
      Pennsylvania. The eastern border of Pennsylvania doesn''t even touch Connecticut
      (New Jersey and New York are between them).


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about the specific locations.

      Since Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania, Durfee Hall in CT must be east of
      Genetti Hotel in PA, not west of it.


      NO'
    b9ca6f8f-bf76-46dc-be1f-e7fa88a97706: '<think>Let me think step by step:


      1) I need to identify the locations of Durfee Hall, CT and Genetti Hotel, PA.


      2) Durfee Hall is likely in Connecticut (CT), and Genetti Hotel is likely in
      Pennsylvania (PA).


      3) To determine which is west of the other, I need to know their relative positions
      on the east-west axis.


      4) Connecticut is a state in the northeastern United States, on the Atlantic
      coast.


      5) Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern United States, but it''s positioned
      to the west of Connecticut.


      6) Since Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States,
      and Durfee Hall is in Connecticut while Genetti Hotel is in Pennsylvania, Durfee
      Hall would be east of Genetti Hotel (not west).


      7) Therefore, the answer is NO - Durfee Hall, CT is not located west of Genetti
      Hotel, PA. It would be east of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative positions of these two locations on an east-west axis.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these structures are located.

      - Durfee Hall is in Connecticut (CT)

      - Genetti Hotel is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States along the Atlantic
      coast, while Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern US but positioned to the
      west of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the specific buildings.

      Since Connecticut is east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States, Durfee
      Hall in CT would be east of Genetti Hotel in PA (not west of it).
