      Step 1: Bunch-of-Grapes, Massachusetts

      - Massachusetts is a state located in the northeastern United States. However,
      "Bunch-of-Grapes" is not a recognized town or city within Massachusetts. It
      might refer to a historical site or landmark, but for this question, we will
      assume it refers to a location within Massachusetts unless more specific information
      is provided.


      Step 2: Rose Valley Lake, Pennsylvania

      - Rose Valley Lake is located in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
      is directly to the south of New York and east of Ohio, in the northeastern part
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal coordinates

      1. Milford Lake is located in Kansas, specifically in the northeastern part
      of the state.

      2. Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is located in Aurora, Colorado, which is part
      of the Denver metropolitan area.
