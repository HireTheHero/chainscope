      1. First, I''ll locate Lake Ellsworth in Oklahoma and Kaibab Lake in Arizona
      on a map.


      2. Oklahoma is located in the south-central part of the United States.


      3. Arizona is located in the southwestern part of the United States.


      4. These states are quite far apart, with Arizona being west of Oklahoma.


      5. So, if Lake Ellsworth is in Oklahoma and Kaibab Lake is in Arizona, Lake

      2. Next, locate Leesville Lake in Ohio

      - Ohio is a state west of New York state


      3. Compare their geographic positions

      - Since Astor Theatre is in New York (east) and Leesville Lake is in Ohio (west)

      - Astor Theatre is EAST of Leesville Lake


      4. The question asks: "Is Astor Theatre located west of Leesville Lake?"

      - Since Astor Theatre is actually east of Leesville Lake, the answer is NO

      1. First, I''ll locate Astor Theatre in New York City, NY

      - This is located in Manhattan, New York City, New York

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate Leesville Lake in Ohio

      4. So if New York (where Astor Theatre is located) is east of Ohio, then Astor
      Theatre is definitely east of Leesville Lake


      5. The question asks: "Is Astor Theatre located west of Leesville Lake?"

      - Since Astor Theatre is east of Leesville Lake, the answer is NO

      3. Now I''ll compare their geographical positions:

      - West Virginia is east of Missouri

      - Sutton Lake would be much further east compared to Pomme de Terre Lake


      4. Reasoning about their relative positions:

      - Since Sutton Lake is in eastern West Virginia and Pomme de Terre Lake is in
      western Missouri, Sutton Lake is definitely NOT west of Pomme de Terre Lake


      5. Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'

      Step 1: Copper Mountain Solar Facility is in southeastern Nevada, near Searchlight,
      in Clark County.


      Step 2: Pine Flat Dam is located in central California, in Fresno County, along
      the Kings River.


      Step 3: Checking their relative positions:

      - Nevada is east of California

      - Copper Mountain Solar Facility is in southeastern Nevada

      - Pine Flat Dam is in central California

      - Therefore, Copper Mountain Solar Facility is east of Pine Flat Dam


      Since the question asks if Copper Mountain Solar Facility is west of Pine Flat
      Dam, and it is actually east of Pine Flat Dam, the answer is:


      NO'

      - Saint Sophia Cathedral is located in Los Angeles, California, which is on
      the west coast


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Arizona is east of California

      - This means locations in Arizona are generally east of locations in California


      4. Therefore, Horseshoe Lake in Arizona would be east of Saint Sophia Cathedral
      in Los Angeles
