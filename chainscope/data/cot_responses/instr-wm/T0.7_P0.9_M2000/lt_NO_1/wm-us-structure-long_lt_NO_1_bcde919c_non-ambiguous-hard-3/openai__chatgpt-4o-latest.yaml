      Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, we need to compare their longitudinal coordinates.
      Longitude determines east-west position, with higher (less negative) longitude
      values indicating points further east in the Western Hemisphere.


      **Step 1: Determine the location of Cathedral of All Souls**

      - The Cathedral of All Souls is located in Asheville, North Carolina.

      - Asheville, NC is approximately at longitude **-82.55**.


      **Step 2: Determine the location of Nashville Municipal Auditorium**

      - The Nashville Municipal Auditorium is located in Nashville, Tennessee.

      - Nashville, TN is approximately at longitude **-86.78**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      - Asheville: -82.55

      - Nashville: -86.78


      Since -82.55 is greater than -86.78, that means Asheville is **east** of Nashville.

      Step 1: Identify the location of the Round House.

      - The Round House is in Somerville, Massachusetts.

      - Somerville is just northwest of Boston, Massachusetts.

      - Massachusetts is on the eastern coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Fermi 1.

      - Monroe is in southeastern Michigan, near the western edge of Lake Erie.

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Determine the relative longitudinal positions.

      - Massachusetts (including Somerville) is significantly farther east than Michigan.

      - Therefore, Somerville, MA, is east of Monroe, MI.


      Step 4: Since the question asks if the Round House in Somerville, MA is west
      of Fermi 1, MI, and we have determined that it is east, the answer must be:

      in New Jersey is located west of LaDue Reservoir in Ohio, we need to reason
      through the relative geographic locations of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Wellmont Theater, NJ.

      - The Wellmont Theater is located in Montclair, New Jersey.

      - Montclair is in northern New Jersey, which is part of the eastern United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of LaDue Reservoir, OH.

      - LaDue Reservoir is located in Geauga County, Ohio.

      - Geauga County is in northeastern Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - New Jersey is generally east of Ohio.

      - Montclair, NJ, being in northeastern New Jersey, is especially far east.

      - Geauga County, OH, is in the eastern portion of Ohio, but still west of New
      Jersey.


      Step 4: Conclusion.

      - Since New Jersey is east of Ohio, and more specifically, Montclair is east
      of Geauga County, the Wellmont Theater is located east of LaDue Reservoir.

      **Step 1: Determine the location of the Kanuga Conference Center**

      - The Kanuga Conference Center is located near Hendersonville, North Carolina.

      - Hendersonville, NC is approximately at longitude **-82.46**.


      **Step 2: Determine the location of the Cathedral of the Incarnation**

      Energy Center in West Virginia is located west of the Gibson Generating Station
      in Illinois, we need to analyze the relative geographic positions of the two
      facilities.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Mountaineer Wind Energy Center.

      - The Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is located in West Virginia, specifically
      in the northeastern part of the state, near the town of Thomas in Tucker County.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Gibson Generating Station.

      - The Gibson Generating Station is located in Indiana, not Illinois. It is in
      Gibson County, southwestern Indiana, near the town of Owensville.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - West Virginia is geographically east of Indiana. Therefore, the Mountaineer
      Wind Energy Center, located in northeastern West Virginia, is east of the Gibson
      Generating Station in southwestern Indiana.


      Step 4: Confirm direction.

      - Since West Virginia lies to the east of Indiana, and both facilities are within
      their respective states, the Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is east of the Gibson
      Generating Station.

      - Cherokee Lake is located in eastern Tennessee, near the city of Morristown.\n\
      - Oologah Lake is located in northeastern Oklahoma, near the town of Oologah\
      \ and just north of Tulsa.\n\nStep 4: Compare longitudes (a precise way to determine\

      W longitude.\n- Oologah Lake is approximately at 95\xB0W to 96\xB0W longitude.\n\
      \nStep 5: Reasoning.\n- The higher the degree of west longitude in the U.S.,\
      \ the further west the location is.\n- Since 95\xB0W (Oologah Lake) is more\
      \ west than 84\xB0W (Cherokee Lake), Cherokee Lake is east of Oologah Lake.\n\
      \nFinal answer:\n\nNO."

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary is in Southampton, which is
      on the eastern end of Long Island, New York.

      - Hershey Theatre is in Hershey, Pennsylvania, which is in central Pennsylvania.

      east-west positioning.


      **Step 1: Locate Proctor''s Theatre**

      - Proctor''s Theatre is located in Schenectady, New York.

      - Schenectady is in eastern New York State, near Albany.

      - Its approximate longitude is around **-73.94 degrees**.


      **Step 2: Locate the Allegheny Reservoir**

      - The Allegheny Reservoir (also known as Kinzua Lake) is located in northwestern
      Pennsylvania.

      - Its approximate longitude is around **-78.90 degrees**.


      **Step 3: Compare Longitudes**

      - -73.94 (Schenectady) is east of -78.90 (Allegheny Reservoir), because a smaller
      (less negative) longitude indicates a position further east in the Western Hemisphere.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Schenectady is at a more eastern longitude than the Allegheny Reservoir,
      Proctor''s Theatre is located **east** of the Allegheny Reservoir.

      is located west of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, California, let''s
      analyze the geographical positions of both locations.


      **Step 1: Identify the location of All Saints Episcopal Church**

      - All Saints Episcopal Church is located in Pasadena, California.

      - Pasadena is in Southern California, northeast of downtown Los Angeles.

      - The approximate longitude of Pasadena is around **-118.15 degrees**.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of San Carlos Lake**

      - San Carlos Lake is located in Arizona, on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation.

      - It lies in eastern Arizona, near the towns of Globe and Safford.

      - The approximate longitude of San Carlos Lake is around **-110.5 degrees**.


      **Step 3: Compare longitudes**

      - Longitude values in the Western Hemisphere are negative. The more negative
      the value, the further west the location is.

      - Pasadena: ~ -118.15

      - San Carlos Lake: ~ -110.5

      - Since -118.15 is more negative than -110.5, **Pasadena is further west than
      San Carlos Lake**.
