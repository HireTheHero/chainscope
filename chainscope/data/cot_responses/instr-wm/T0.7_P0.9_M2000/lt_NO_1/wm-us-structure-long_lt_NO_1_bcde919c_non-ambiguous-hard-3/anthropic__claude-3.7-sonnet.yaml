      Step 3: Apply directional logic.

      - If Bunch-of-Grapes is in Massachusetts, and Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania,
      then Bunch-of-Grapes must be east of any location in Pennsylvania, including
      Rose Valley Lake.

      - For Bunch-of-Grapes to be west of Rose Valley Lake, it would need to be located
      to the west of it on a map, which is not possible given their respective states.

      be west of locations in New York state

      - North Jackson, Ohio would be west of locations in New York


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific locations.

      - Since the Edison Theatre is in New York, and the Basilica and National Shrine
      of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson, Ohio, the Edison Theatre would be
      east of the Basilica

      Step 2: Determine their general locations within their states.

      - Wyoming is east of Idaho (Idaho''s eastern border connects to Wyoming''s western
      border)

      - For a location in Wyoming to be west of a location in Idaho, it would need
      to be in far western Wyoming while the Idaho location would need to be in far
      eastern Idaho


      Step 3: Find more specific locations.

      - Pathfinder Reservoir is located in central Wyoming, on the North Platte River

      - C. J. Strike Dam is on the Snake River in southwestern Idaho


      Step 4: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Since Wyoming is east of Idaho, and Pathfinder Reservoir is in central Wyoming

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Fairfax Community Church is in Virginia (VA), which is on the East Coast of
      the United States.

      - Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is in Missouri (MO), which is in the Midwest.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern side of the United States.

      - Missouri is located more centrally and to the west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Moving from east to west across the United States, you would encounter Virginia
      before Missouri.

      - This means Virginia is east of Missouri, not west of it.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Since Fairfax Community Church is in Virginia, and Virginia is east of Missouri,
      the church would be east of the Cathedral Basilica in St. Louis.

      Step 1: Locate Bridge Canyon Dam, Arizona.

      Bridge Canyon Dam was a proposed dam site on the Colorado River in the western
      part of Arizona, near the Grand Canyon. It was never actually built, but the
      proposed location was in western Arizona.


      Step 2: Locate Topaz Solar Farm, California.

      Topaz Solar Farm is located in San Luis Obispo County, California, which is
      in central California.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      California is generally west of Arizona. However, I need to be more specific
      about these particular locations.

      - Western Arizona (where Bridge Canyon Dam would have been) is in the eastern
      part of the western United States.

      - San Luis Obispo County, where Topaz Solar Farm is located, is in central/southern
      California, which is further west than any part of Arizona.


      Therefore, Topaz Solar Farm in California is west of the proposed Bridge Canyon
      Dam site in Arizona.


      NO - Bridge Canyon Dam, AZ is NOT located west of Topaz Solar Farm, CA. It is

      - Topaz Solar Farm is in central California, in San Luis Obispo County.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Bridge Canyon Dam, being on the western edge of Arizona, is still east of
      central California.

      - Topaz Solar Farm, being in central California, is west of the Arizona border.

      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      Arizona is generally east of California. The Colorado River, where Bridge Canyon
      Dam was proposed, forms part of the border between Arizona and California/Nevada,
      with Arizona being on the eastern side of this border.


      San Luis Obispo County is located in central California, well to the west of
      the Arizona border.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      determine the relative positions of these two structures.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both structures.

      - Lower Granite Dam is located on the Snake River in southeastern Washington
      state.

      - St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle, Washington, which is in the
      western part of the state.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of Washington state.

      - Seattle is on the western side of Washington state, near Puget Sound and the
      Pacific Ocean.

      - The Snake River runs through the southeastern part of Washington state.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Seattle is in western Washington, close to the Pacific coast.

      - Lower Granite Dam is in eastern/southeastern Washington, far from the coast.

      - In the United States, western locations have higher longitude values than
      eastern locations.

      - Seattle is west (closer to the Pacific) while Lower Granite Dam is east (closer
      to Idaho).


      Therefore, Lower Granite Dam is located EAST of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral
      in Seattle, not west of it.

      of Washington state.

      - The Snake River and Lower Granite Dam are in the eastern part of Washington
      state, near the Idaho border.


      Step 3: Determine east-west relationship.

      - In the United States, "west" means closer to the Pacific Ocean, while "east"
      means closer to the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Seattle is much closer to the Pacific Ocean than Lower Granite Dam.
