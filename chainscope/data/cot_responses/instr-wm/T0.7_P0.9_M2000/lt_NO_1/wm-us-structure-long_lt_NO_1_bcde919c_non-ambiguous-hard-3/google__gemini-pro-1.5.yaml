      of Oregon, but the Columbia River, where Ice Harbor Dam is located, runs roughly
      east-west and forms much of the border between the two states. We need to determine
      if the dam is on a section of the river west of the power plant.

      the southeast corner of Washington, while Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is near

      National Park *does* have several lakes, but none are officially named "Lake

      but it''s unlikely to be referred to simply as Lake Yosemite.

      2. **Locate Lake Yosemite, CA:**  "Lake Yosemite" isn''t a commonly known name.  Yosemite
      National Park is in California and has several smaller lakes, but a large reservoir
      called Hetch Hetchy Reservoir is sometimes referred to as Lake Yosemite.  It''s
      likely the question refers to this. Hetch Hetchy is in the western part of Yosemite
      National Park.

      Lake is east of Hetch Hetchy Reservoir (Lake Yosemite).

      Lake Yosemite in California.  Yosemite National Park contains several lakes,
      most notably Yosemite Lake (a high-elevation lake).  It''s possible the question
      refers to Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, a lake within Yosemite that was formed by
      damming the Tuolumne River. I will assume "Lake Yosemite" refers to a lake within
      Yosemite National Park.
