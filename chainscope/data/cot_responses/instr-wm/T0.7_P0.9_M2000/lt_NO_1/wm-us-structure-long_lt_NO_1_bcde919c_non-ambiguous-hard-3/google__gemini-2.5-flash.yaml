      Now, visualize or look at a map:


      *   Boise, ID is in the southwestern part of Idaho.

      *   Medford, OR is in the southwestern part of Oregon.


      If you travel from Boise (Arrowrock Dam) to Medford (Lost Creek Lake), you are
      generally traveling **west-southwest**. This means that Boise (Arrowrock Dam)
      is **east** of Medford (Lost Creek Lake).


      The question asks: "Is Arrowrock Dam, ID located west of Lost Creek Lake, OR?"


      Since Arrowrock Dam is *east* of Lost Creek Lake, the answer to whether it''s
      *west* of it is no.


      **NO**'

      *west* of Nimrod Lake (AR). Since Nimrod Lake is west of Tellico Reservoir,
      Tellico Reservoir must be *east* of Nimrod Lake.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'

      3.  **The Question:** "Is Bunch-of-Grapes, MA located west of Rose Valley Lake
      (Pennsylvania), PA?"


      Since "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" is not a real location, its position relative to
      *any* real location cannot be determined.


      Therefore, the question cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO based
      on factual geography.


      However, if we interpret the question as "Can we determine if Bunch-of-Grapes,
      MA is west of Rose Valley Lake, PA?", the answer is no.


      To provide a strict YES or NO, I must assume the premise of the question implies
      a factual basis. Since the premise contains a non-existent place, the question
      is unanswerable in a factual geographical sense.


      If the question is implicitly asking if it''s *possible* to answer, then the
      answer is NO (it''s not possible to determine).

      Generating Station in Arizona would be *east* of Exchequer Dam in California.

      is an "Exchequer Dam" in California, but the "New" prefix is unusual and, for

      dam in California called "New Exchequer Dam." There is a "New Don Pedro Dam"
      which is a significant dam in California, and "Exchequer Dam" which is also
      in California (part of the Merced River project). It''s possible "New Exchequer
      Dam" is a very minor, obscure, or even fictional dam.


      3.  **Address the Ambiguity:** Since "New Exchequer Dam, CA" is not a readily
      identifiable or significant landmark, it''s impossible to definitively determine
      its location relative to Navajo Generating Station. Without a concrete location
      for "New Exchequer Dam," we cannot answer the question.


      Therefore, the question cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO based
      on publicly available geographical information.


      However, if we assume "New Exchequer Dam" is a hypothetical or very obscure
      dam intended to be somewhere *in California*, then we can make a general comparison.
      Arizona is east of California. Therefore, any point in Arizona would be east
      of any point in California.


      **If we assume "New Exchequer Dam, CA" refers to *any* point within the state

      Navajo Generating Station, AZ is located in Arizona. California is to the *west*
      of Arizona. Therefore, Navajo Generating Station, AZ is located **east** of

      **Therefore, for Navajo Generating Station, AZ to be located west of New Exchequer
      Dam, CA, it would require New Exchequer Dam to be located even further west,

      *   86 degrees West (Indianapolis) is numerically higher than 81-82 degrees
      West (Carroll County, OH).


      Therefore, Indianapolis, IN is west of Carroll County, OH.


      **Step 5: Formulate the answer to the question.**

      The question asks: "Is Lake Mohawk (Ohio), OH located west of Old National Centre,
      IN?"


      Since Lake Mohawk, OH is *east* of Old National Centre, IN, the answer to the
