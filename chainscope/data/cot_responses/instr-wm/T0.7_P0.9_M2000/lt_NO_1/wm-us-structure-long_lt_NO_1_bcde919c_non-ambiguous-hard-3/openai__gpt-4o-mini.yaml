      Oklahoma.

      would be on the eastern side of that line, while Ohio would be on the western
      side.


      From this reasoning, since New York City (where the Astor Theatre is located)
      is to the east of Ohio (where Leesville Lake is located), it follows that the

    22673267-5c86-414f-8986-21abc8c01cea: 'To determine if Basic Creek Reservoir in
      New York is located west of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station in Illinois, we need
      to identify the geographical locations of both sites.


      1. **Locate Basic Creek Reservoir**: Basic Creek Reservoir is situated in the
      town of Newburgh, New York. Newburgh is located in the southeastern part of
      the state, near the Hudson River.


      2. **Locate Chicago Avenue Pumping Station**: The Chicago Avenue Pumping Station
      is located in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois,
      along the shores of Lake Michigan.


      3. **Compare the Longitudes**: Newburgh, NY is to the east of Chicago, IL. To
      determine if one location is west of the other, we can consider their longitudes.
      Newburgh has a longitude of approximately -74.0, while Chicago has a longitude
      of approximately -87.6.


      4. **West vs. East**: Since -74.0 (Newburgh) is greater than -87.6 (Chicago),
      this indicates that Newburgh is east of Chicago.


      Based on this reasoning, Basic Creek Reservoir is not located west of the Chicago
      Avenue Pumping Station.

      NO'
    cad3443e-338b-43f2-8fd9-5f011bafa757: 'To determine whether Cherokee Lake, TN
      is located west of Oologah Lake, OK, we need to first identify the geographical
      locations of both lakes.


      1. **Locate Cherokee Lake, TN**: Cherokee Lake is situated in East Tennessee,
      near the town of Morristown. It is primarily to the east of the center of the
      state.


      2. **Locate Oologah Lake, OK**: Oologah Lake is located in northeastern Oklahoma,
      near the town of Oologah. It is positioned to the northwest of Tulsa, Oklahoma.


      3. **Compare their locations**: To determine if Cherokee Lake is west of Oologah
      Lake, we need to consider their relative positions on a map. Tennessee is to
      the east of Oklahoma, and more specifically, Cherokee Lake is in the eastern
      part of Tennessee, while Oologah Lake is in the northeastern part of Oklahoma.


      Given these locations, it can be concluded that Cherokee Lake, TN is actually
      east of Oologah Lake, OK.

      County, NY is located west of Skokie Lagoons in IL, we need to consider the
      geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Locate Beacon Reservoir**: Beacon Reservoir is situated in Dutchess County,
      New York. Looking at a map, Dutchess County is located in the southeastern part
      of New York State.


      2. **Locate Skokie Lagoons**: Skokie Lagoons is located in Cook County, Illinois,
      which is near Chicago. It is positioned to the north of the city and is part
      of a large green space area.


      3. **Comparison of Locations**: Now, we need to compare the east-west positions
      of the two locations. Dutchess County, NY is generally east of Chicago, IL,
      where Skokie Lagoons is located.


      Since Beacon Reservoir is in New York and Skokie Lagoons is to the west in Illinois,
      we can conclude that:


      Beacon Reservoir is not located west of Skokie Lagoons.

      in Seattle, which is in the western part of Washington State.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Seattle is situated near the western border
      of Washington, while Lower Granite Dam is further inland and to the southeast
      of Seattle.


      3. **West vs. East**: For Lower Granite Dam to be west of St. Mark''s Cathedral,
      it would need to be positioned further west than the cathedral. However, given
      that Lower Granite Dam is southeast of Seattle, it is not to the west of St.
      Mark''s Cathedral.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Lower Granite Dam is located to the east of St. Mark''s
      Episcopal Cathedral, the answer to the question is clear.
