      features:


      1. **Wazee Lake** is located in the state of Wisconsin, United States. It is
      a former iron mine that has been flooded and is now the deepest lake in Wisconsin.


      2. **The Calapooya Mountains** are located in the state of Oregon, United States.
      They form a mountain range in southwestern Oregon, separating the Willamette
      Valley from the Umpqua Valley.


      Now, we compare their positions on the map:


      - Wisconsin is in the north-central part of the United States.

      - Oregon is in the Pacific Northwest, which is west of Wisconsin.

      1. Identify the location of Lake Seliger.

      2. Identify the location of Loch Long.

      3. Compare their longitudes to determine which one is farther west.


      Step 1: Lake Seliger is located in Russia, specifically in the Tver and Novgorod
      regions. It is situated to the northwest of Moscow.


      Step 2: Loch Long is a sea loch located in western Scotland, United Kingdom.


      Step 3: Now, let''s compare their approximate longitudes:

      - Lake Seliger is around 33 degrees East longitude.

      - Loch Long is around 4.9 degrees West longitude.


      Since west longitudes are numerically smaller (and to the left on a world map)
      than east longitudes, anything with a west longitude is further west than anything
      with an east longitude.


      Conclusion: Loch Long is located significantly further west than Lake Seliger.

      1. **Canandaigua Lake**: This lake is one of the Finger Lakes located in the
      state of New York, in the northeastern United States. It lies in the western
      part of New York state.


      2. **Lake Isabella**: This lake is located in California, in the western United

      - **Canandaigua Lake (New York)** is situated in the Eastern United States.

      - **Lake Isabella (California)** is situated in the Western United States.


      Since New York is to the east of California, Canandaigua Lake is clearly east
