      part of Tibet.


      2. **Lake Mariout**: This is a salt lake in northern Egypt, located near the

      Now, compare their longitudinal positions:


      - Namcha Barwa is in Tibet, which is in the eastern part of Asia.

      - Lake Mariout is in Egypt, which is in the northeastern part of Africa.


      Since Egypt is to the west of China, Namcha Barwa is located east of Lake Mariout.

      in the southeastern part of Tibet.


      2. **Identify the location of Lake Mariout:** Lake Mariout is located in northern
      Egypt, near the city of Alexandria.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** To find out if Namcha Barwa is west of

      being in Egypt, is at approximately 30 degrees east longitude. Namcha Barwa,
      in Tibet, is situated at approximately 95 degrees east longitude.


      4. **Comparison:** Since 95 degrees east is east of 30 degrees east, Namcha
      Barwa is actually east of Lake Mariout.

      1. **Location of Ooty Lake:** Ooty Lake is located in the town of Ooty, which
      is in the Nilgiris district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Ooty is situated
      in the southern part of India.
