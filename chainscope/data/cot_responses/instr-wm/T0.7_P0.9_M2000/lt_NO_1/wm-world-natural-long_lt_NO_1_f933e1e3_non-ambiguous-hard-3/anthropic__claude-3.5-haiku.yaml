      4. Determining relative position:

      - China is east of Europe

      - Therefore, Heavenly Lake is east of Plansee, not west


      5. Answering the specific question:

      - Is Heavenly Lake of Tianshan located west of Plansee?

      - No, it is located east of Plansee


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Orange Lake in New York state

      2. Then, I''ll locate Diamond Valley Lake

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Orange Lake is located in Orange County, New York, which is in the southeastern
      part of the state, near the Hudson River.


      Step 2: Diamond Valley Lake is located in Riverside County, California, in the
      southwestern United States.


      Step 3: Comparing their locations:

      - Orange Lake is in New York (east coast)

      - Diamond Valley Lake is in California (west coast)

      - New York is east of California

      - Therefore, Orange Lake is east of Diamond Valley Lake


      Since Orange Lake is east of Diamond Valley Lake, the answer is:

      1. First, let''s locate Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains:

      - These mountains are located in Tibet, China

      - Specifically, they are in the central part of Tibet, north of the Himalayas


      2. Next, let''s locate Puig Campana:

      - Puig Campana is a mountain located in Spain

      - More specifically, it is in the province of Alicante, in the Valencia region

      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains are in central Asia

      - Puig Campana is in southeastern Europe (Spain)

      - These locations are very far apart, on different continents


      4. To determine if Nyenchen Tanglha is west of Puig Campana:

      - Nyenchen Tanglha is actually east of Puig Campana, not west

      - Puig Campana is closer to the Prime Meridian, while Nyenchen Tanglha is much
      further east


      5. Conclusion:

      The Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains are NOT located west of Puig Campana.

      2. Determine the location of the Uinta Mountains

      3. Check the relative position of the lake to the mountains


      Step 1: Little Blue Run Lake is actually an artificial reservoir/lake created
      by a coal ash pond in Pennsylvania, not a natural mountain lake.


      Step 2: The Uinta Mountains are located in northeastern Utah, in the western
      United States.


      Step 3: Since Little Blue Run Lake is in Pennsylvania (eastern United States)
      and the Uinta Mountains are in Utah (western United States), the lake is not
      west of the Uinta Mountains.


      The answer is: NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group:

      - This is a volcanic group located in Hokkaido, Japan''s northernmost main island

      - It is in the central part of Hokkaido


      2. Next, I''ll locate Sayram Lake:

      - Sayram Lake is located in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwestern
      China

      - It is near the border with Kazakhstan


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Hokkaido (where Daisetsuzan is) is in northeastern Japan

      - Xinjiang is in northwestern China

      - These are in completely different regions, far from each other


      4. Reasoning about their relative position:

      - Daisetsuzan is east of Sayram Lake, not west

      - The Japanese islands are east of the Asian continental landmass

      1. Locate Zambales Mountains:

      - The Zambales Mountains are located in the Philippines

      - Specifically, they are on the island of Luzon

      - They are situated on the western side of Luzon island


      2. Locate Bailadila Range:

      - The Bailadila Range is located in India

      - It is situated in the state of Chhattisgarh

      - It is in central-eastern India


      3. Geographical relationship:

      - Zambales Mountains are in the Philippines (Southeast Asia)

      - Bailadila Range is in India (South Asia)

      - These are in completely different countries and continents

      - They are very far apart from each other


      4. Determine west/east relationship:

      - Since these mountain ranges are in different countries and continents, the
      concept of one being "west of" the other doesn''t make geographical sense


      5. Conclusion:

      The question cannot be answered with a simple yes or no because the mountain

      west/east determination.

      - It runs roughly parallel to the Mediterranean coast in Algeria


      2. Next, let''s locate the Ouachita Mountains:

      - The Ouachita Mountains are located in western Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma
      in the United States


      3. Now, let''s consider their geographical relationship:

      - The Saharan Atlas is in North Africa

      - The Ouachita Mountains are in North America

      - These mountain ranges are on completely different continents

      - They are separated by the Atlantic Ocean


      4. To determine if the Saharan Atlas is west of the Ouachita Mountains, we need
      to check their relative positions:

      - From a global perspective, the Saharan Atlas is actually east of the Ouachita
      Mountains

      - The Saharan Atlas is in Africa (east), while the Ouachita Mountains are in
      North America (west)


      5. Therefore, the Saharan Atlas is NOT west of the Ouachita Mountains.

    6bd5c1d5-e30d-46f4-80fd-3df66d6b086e: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Mount Kirishima is a volcanic mountain located in Japan, specifically on
      the island of Kyushu in the southern part of the country.


      2. Imja Tsho is a glacial lake located in Nepal, in the Solukhumbu District,
      in the Sagarmatha National Park region near Mount Everest.


      3. Japan is located east of Nepal, so Mount Kirishima would be east of Imja
      Tsho.


      4. Therefore, Mount Kirishima is NOT west of Imja Tsho.

      \n2. Veeranam Lake is located in Tamil Nadu, India.\n\n3. These two locations\

      \ Kanlaon is west of Veeranam Lake, I'll check their geographical coordinates:\n\
      \   - Kanlaon: Around 10.4\xB0 N, 123.1\xB0 E\n   - Veeranam Lake: Around 11.3\xB0\
      \ N, 79.7\xB0 E\n\n5. Comparing their longitudes:\n   - Kanlaon: 123.1\xB0 E\n\
      \   - Veeranam Lake: 79.7\xB0 E\n\n6. Since Kanlaon's longitude is further east\
