      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Sourland Mountain is located in New Jersey, in the eastern United States.

      - Shadow Mountain Lake is located in Colorado, in the western United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      (west).

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Colorado is in the western interior of the United States.

      - Therefore, New Jersey is east of Colorado.


      Step 3: Since Sourland Mountain is in New Jersey and Shadow Mountain Lake is
      in Colorado, Sourland Mountain must be east of Shadow Mountain Lake, not west
      of it.

      1) First, I need to identify where the Tanggula Mountains are located. The Tanggula
      Mountains are a mountain range in Central Asia, primarily in Tibet (China) and
      extending into Qinghai province. They''re located roughly in the central part
      of Asia.


      2) Next, I need to identify where Lake Habbaniyah is located. Lake Habbaniyah
      is a lake in Iraq, in the Middle East, west of Baghdad.


      3) Now I need to determine their relative positions. Iraq is in the Middle East,
      which is west of Central Asia where the Tanggula Mountains are located.


      4) Therefore, the Tanggula Mountains are east of Lake Habbaniyah, not west of
      it.


      NO, the Tanggula Mountains are not located west of Lake Habbaniyah. They are

      Step 1: Identify the location of Tanggula Mountains.

      The Tanggula Mountains are located in Asia, specifically on the border between
      Tibet (China) and Qinghai province in China. They are part of the Tibetan Plateau
      region.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Habbaniyah.

      Lake Habbaniyah is located in Iraq, in the Middle East, west of Baghdad.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Iraq is in the Middle East, while the Tanggula Mountains are in East Asia. On
      a world map, East Asia (including Tibet/China) is located east of the Middle
      East (including Iraq).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since the Tanggula Mountains are in East Asia and Lake Habbaniyah is in the
      Middle East, the Tanggula Mountains are located east of Lake Habbaniyah, not
      west.

      - Jyotisar is a sacred site located in Kurukshetra, Haryana state in northern
      India.

      - The Qattara Depression is a large depression in northwestern Egypt, in North
      Africa.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a world map.

      - India is in South Asia, east of the Middle East and North Africa.

      - Egypt is in North Africa, west of the Middle East and South Asia.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Moving from west to east across this region of the world: we''d encounter
      Egypt (containing the Qattara Depression) first, then the Middle East, and then
      India (containing Jyotisar).

      - Therefore, Jyotisar is east of the Qattara Depression, not west.

      First, I need to locate both Little Blue Run Lake and the Uinta Mountains.


      Little Blue Run Lake is a man-made reservoir located in Beaver County, Pennsylvania,
      near the border with West Virginia and Ohio.


      The Uinta Mountains are a mountain range located in northeastern Utah and extending
      slightly into northwestern Colorado.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - Pennsylvania is in the eastern United States

      - Utah is in the western United States


      Since Pennsylvania is east of Utah, and Little Blue Run Lake is in Pennsylvania,
      while the Uinta Mountains are in Utah, Little Blue Run Lake must be east of
      the Uinta Mountains, not west.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Little Blue Run Lake.

      Little Blue Run Lake is located in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia and
      extends into western Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Uinta Mountains.

      The Uinta Mountains are an east-west oriented mountain range located in northeastern

      West Virginia and western Pennsylvania are in the eastern United States, while

      Sape Strait (also known as Selat Sape) is a narrow strait that separates the
      islands of Sumbawa and Komodo in Indonesia. Indonesia is located in Southeast
      Asia.


      Step 2: Identify where Lake Tanganyika is located.

      Lake Tanganyika is one of the African Great Lakes. It''s located in East Africa,
      stretching across four countries: Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
      Burundi, and Zambia.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Indonesia (where Sape Strait is) is located in Southeast Asia, which is east
      of Africa (where Lake Tanganyika is). On a world map, Indonesia is much further
      east than East Africa.

      Ooty Lake is located in Ooty (Udhagamandalam), which is in Tamil Nadu state

      Lake.

      Since Ooty Lake is east of Kainji Lake (not west), the answer is:

      the relative positions of Mutsu Bay and Lake Sarysu.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Mutsu Bay.

      Mutsu Bay is located in northern Japan, specifically in Aomori Prefecture at
      the northern tip of Honshu island. Japan is in East Asia.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Sarysu.

      Japan is located in the Far East of Asia, while Kazakhstan is in Central Asia.
      On a world map, Kazakhstan is positioned to the west of Japan.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Mutsu Bay is in Japan (Far East Asia) and Lake Sarysu is in Kazakhstan
      (Central Asia), Mutsu Bay is located EAST of Lake Sarysu, not west.

      The Penibaetic System (also known as the Baetic System or Baetic Mountains)

      When looking at a world map, Spain is in Western Europe, while Nepal is in South
      Asia. On a global east-west orientation, Spain (including the Penibaetic System)
      is west of Nepal (where Tilicho Lake is located).

      Since the Penibaetic System (in Spain) is west of Tilicho Lake (in Nepal), Tilicho

      Step 1: Identify the locations mentioned.

      - Celtic Sea is a body of water located off the southern coast of Ireland and
      England, in the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Canada Lake is a small lake located in the Adirondack Mountains in New York
      State, USA.
