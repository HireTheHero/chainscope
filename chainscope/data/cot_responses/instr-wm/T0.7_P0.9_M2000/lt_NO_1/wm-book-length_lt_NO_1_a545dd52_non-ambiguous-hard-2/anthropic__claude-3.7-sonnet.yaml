      First, let me identify the authors and books correctly:

      - "The Baroness James of Holland Park" refers to P.D. James (Phyllis Dorothy
      James), whose formal title was Baroness James of Holland Park. Her book "Devices
      and Desires" is a crime novel.

      - "The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag" is a memoir

      Step 1: Find the page count for Bernard Cornwell''s "The Winter King."

      "The Winter King" by Bernard Cornwell is the first book in his Warlord Chronicles
      trilogy about Arthurian legend. The paperback edition typically has around 496
      pages, though this can vary slightly between different editions.


      Step 2: Find the page count for Richard Phillips''s "A Captain''s Duty."

      There appears to be a confusion here. "A Captain''s Duty" was written by Richard
      Phillips with Stephan Talty. Richard Phillips is actually Captain Richard Phillips,
      the merchant mariner who was taken hostage by Somali pirates in 2009. This book
      typically has around 286 pages in paperback form.


      Step 3: Compare the page counts.

      Bernard Cornwell''s "The Winter King": approximately 496 pages

      Richard Phillips''s "A Captain''s Duty": approximately 286 pages


      Step 4: Determine if the first book has fewer pages than the second.

      496 is greater than 286, so "The Winter King" has more pages, not fewer pages,
      than "A Captain''s Duty."

      I need to clarify that "A Captain''s Duty" is actually by Richard Phillips (with

      "Sharpe''s Company" is a full-length novel (300-400 pages) while "Muse of Fire"
      is a novella (approximately 100-150 pages).


      Therefore, "Sharpe''s Company" has MORE pages than "Muse of Fire," not fewer.

      Step 1: I need to determine the page counts of both books.

      - Peter F. Hamilton''s "The Reality Dysfunction" is a large science fiction
      novel, typically around 1,200-1,300 pages in its paperback edition.

      - Matthew Reilly''s "Scarecrow and the Army of Thieves" (also published as "Scarecrow
      Returns" in some regions) is an action thriller that typically runs around 400-500
      pages.


      Step 2: Compare the page counts.

      - "The Reality Dysfunction" (~1,200-1,300 pages) is significantly longer than
      "Scarecrow and the Army of Thieves" (~400-500 pages).

      - Therefore, "The Reality Dysfunction" does NOT have fewer pages than "Scarecrow
      and the Army of Thieves" - it has substantially more.

      though this can vary slightly depending on the edition.


      2. Sharon Moalem''s book with the subtitle "Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel,
      and Act the Way We Do" appears to be "Inheritance: How Our Genes Change Our
      Lives and Our Lives Change Our Genes." This book typically has around 272 pages,
      again with some variation by edition.


      Comparing the two:

      - "Crimson Shore": ~352 pages

      - Moalem''s book: ~272 pages


      Since 352 is greater than 272, "Crimson Shore" has MORE pages than Sharon Moalem''s

      Since "Ombria in Shadow" has more pages than "Infinity Blade: Redemption," McKillip''s
      book does NOT have fewer pages.
