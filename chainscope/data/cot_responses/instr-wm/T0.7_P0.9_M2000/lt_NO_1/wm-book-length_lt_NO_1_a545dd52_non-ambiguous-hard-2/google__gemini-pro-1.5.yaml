    d6adecde-e01f-4fd9-9203-acbf9c027073: '1. **Find page counts for both books.**  This
      will likely require an internet search.

      2. **Compare the page counts.**  Which book has the lower number?

      3. **Relate the comparison to the question.** Does the lower page count correspond
      to *The Tuloriad*?


      After searching, I find:


      * *The Tuloriad* (combined edition) has around 1088 pages.

      * *Distrust That Particular Flavor* has around 256 pages.


      1088 > 256, so *The Tuloriad* has *more* pages.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

    bd5db805-5155-4f96-a4c9-074fa185f93f: '1. **Find page count for "A Knight of the
      Word" by Terry Brooks:**  This is tricky because "A Knight of the Word" is a
      trilogy consisting of "Running with the Demon," "A Knight of the Word," and
      "Angel Fire East."  Each book has its own page count.  We need the page count
      of the omnibus or a specific book in the trilogy. Let''s assume the question
      refers to the entire trilogy''s combined page count.  This is difficult to determine
      precisely without individual book lengths, but it''s safe to assume a high page
      count for a fantasy trilogy, likely over 1000 pages.


      2. **Find page count for "Ada Wigfield" by Amy Sedaris:** A quick search reveals
      this is a children''s chapter book series. Individual books in the series are
      likely under 200 pages each. Even if we consider multiple books in the series,
      the total page count is unlikely to exceed 1000 pages.


      3. **Compare page counts:** Based on the likely page counts, a multi-volume
      fantasy epic like "A Knight of the Word" (even if we consider just one volume
      of the trilogy) probably has *more* pages than a few books from a children''s
      chapter book series like "Ada Wigfield."
