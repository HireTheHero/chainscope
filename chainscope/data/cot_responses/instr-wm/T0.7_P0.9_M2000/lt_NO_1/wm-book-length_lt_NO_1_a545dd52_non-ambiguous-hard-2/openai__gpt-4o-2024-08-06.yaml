      1. **Sins of Empire**: This book, published in 2017, is the first in Brian McClellan''s
      "Gods of Blood and Powder" series. It typically has around 624 pages.


      2. **The Glory of Their Times**: This book, originally published in 1966, is

      Now, comparing the two:


      - "Sins of Empire" has approximately 624 pages.

      - "The Glory of Their Times" has approximately 384 pages.


      Since 624 pages is more than 384 pages, "Sins of Empire" does not have fewer
