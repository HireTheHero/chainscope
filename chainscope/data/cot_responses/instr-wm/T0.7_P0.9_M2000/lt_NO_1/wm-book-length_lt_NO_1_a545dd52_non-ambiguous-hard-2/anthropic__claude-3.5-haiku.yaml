      1. First, I''ll need to find the page count for each book.


      2. "The Race Beat" by Gene Roberts is a book about journalism and the civil
      rights movement. Its page count is typically around 400-450 pages.

      1. First, I''ll look up the page count for Sleeping Beauties by Owen King:

      - This book (co-written with Stephen King) is approximately 720 pages long


      2. Next, I''ll look up the page count for Under the Never Sky by Veronica Rossi:

      - This book is approximately 384 pages long


      3. Comparing the page counts:

      - Sleeping Beauties: 720 pages

      - Under the Never Sky: 384 pages


      4. Determining which book has fewer pages:

      - 384 is less than 720

      - Therefore, Under the Never Sky has fewer pages than Sleeping Beauties


      5. The question asks: "Does Owen King''s Sleeping Beauties have fewer pages
      than Veronica Rossi''s Under the Never Sky?"

      - Since Sleeping Beauties has MORE pages, the answer is NO.


      Answer: NO'
