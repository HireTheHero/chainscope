      - 37367 is in South Pittsburg, Tennessee


      2) Looking at the relative positions of these states:

      - Tennessee is directly north of North Carolina

      - The TN/NC border runs roughly east-west


      3) Therefore, any location in Tennessee (including South Pittsburg, TN 37367)
      will be north of any location in North Carolina (including Newton, NC 28658).


      4) Since Newton, NC is in North Carolina, it must be south of South Pittsburg,
      TN.

      - Even though South Pittsburg is in "South" Tennessee, it''s still north of

      - 62918 is indeed in southern Illinois

      - 67101 is in south-central Kansas


      5. Final comparison:

      - Southern Illinois is generally south of south-central Kansas

      - 62918 IL is in the southern portion of Illinois

      - Therefore, 62918 IL would be south of 67101 KS


      YES'

    ef0f45e3-2760-49ca-b6c8-d1028bc5ecb4: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Let me identify the locations:

      - 14228 is in Williamsville/Buffalo area in western NY

      - 13323 is in Clinton, NY (near Utica) in central NY


      2. Generally in NY state:

      - Lower ZIP codes (13xxx) are in eastern/central NY

      - Higher ZIP codes (14xxx) are in western NY


      3. Comparing their positions:

      - 14228 (Buffalo area) is in the western part of NY

      - 13323 (Clinton) is in central NY

      - When looking at a map, Buffalo is actually slightly NORTH of Clinton


      Therefore: NO'
    f3a06d51-c99c-4f67-ac43-df7aac2c17ad: "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First,\
      \ let me recall how NY zip codes are generally organized:\n   * Lower numbers\
      \ are generally in the northern part of NY state\n   * Higher numbers are generally\
      \ in the southern part of NY state\n\n2) Let's compare the two zip codes:\n\
      \   * 13323 is a lower number\n   * 14228 is a higher number\n\n3) Since 14228\
      \ is a higher number than 13323, it should be located more south\n\n4) Let me\
      \ verify:\n   * 13323 is Clinton, NY (in central NY)\n   * 14228 is Williamsville,\
      \ NY (near Buffalo)\n   * Looking at a map, Williamsville is actually slightly\
      \ NORTH of Clinton\n\n5) This is one of those exceptions to the general zip\
      \ code pattern in NY\n\nNO"

      \ me identify the locations:\n- 14228 is in Williamsville/Amherst, NY (near\
      \ Buffalo)\n- 13323 is in Clinton, NY (near Utica)\n\n2) Visualizing on a mental\
      \ map of New York State:\n- 14228 (Williamsville) is in Western NY\n- 13323\
      \ (Clinton) is in Central NY\n\n3) Comparing their positions:\n- Williamsville\
      \ (14228) is farther west but at roughly the same latitude as Clinton (13323)\n\
      - Neither location is significantly north or south of the other\n- Both are\
      \ in the northern part of New York State\n\n4) Checking more precisely:\n- Williamsville\
      \ is at approximately 42.9\xB0N latitude\n- Clinton is at approximately 43.0\xB0\
