      south of 60651, IL, we need to analyze the geographic locations of these two
      zip codes in Chicago, Illinois.


      1. **Understand the zip codes**: Both 60622 and 60651 are zip codes in Chicago,
      IL. Chicago zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are located
      closer to the downtown area (south and east), while higher numbers are farther
      from downtown (north and west).


      2. **Locate 60622**: Zip code 60622 covers parts of the West Town and Humboldt
      Park neighborhoods, which are located northwest of downtown Chicago.


      3. **Locate 60651**: Zip code 60651 covers parts of the Austin neighborhood,
      which is also located on the west side of Chicago but slightly farther north
      compared to 60622.


      4. **Compare their positions**: Since 60622 is in West Town/Humboldt Park and
      60651 is in Austin, which is farther north, 60622 is indeed located **south**
      of 60651.

      \ in the southeastern part of Michigan, along the Detroit River, which separates\
      \ the United States from Canada.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Latitude Coordinates\n\
      \nTo compare the north-south positions, we need the latitude values of these\
      \ zip codes.\n\n**Finding the Latitude of 01908, MA (Swampscott)**\n- After\
      \ a quick search, I find that Swampscott, MA has a latitude of approximately\
      \ **42.4749\xB0 N**.\n\n**Finding the Latitude of 48221, MI (Detroit)**\n- Similarly,\
      \ Detroit, MI has a latitude of approximately **42.3314\xB0 N**.\n\n*Note: These\
      \ latitude values are approximate and can vary slightly depending on the specific\
      \ location within the zip code area.*\n\n### Step 3: Compare Latitudes\n\nNow,\
      \ we compare the latitude values:\n\n- **Swampscott, MA**: 42.4749\xB0 N\n-\
      \ **Detroit, MI**: 42.3314\xB0 N\n\nIn terms of latitude, **lower values** indicate\
      \ a more southern location because latitude increases as you move north from\
      \ the equator.\n\nComparing the two:\n- 42.3314\xB0 N (Detroit) is less than\
      \ 42.4749\xB0 N (Swampscott).\n\nThis means **Detroit, MI** is **south** of\

      \n- **Detroit, MI (48221)** has a lower latitude than **Swampscott, MA (01908)**.\n\

    0cc7a75e-52b1-4247-a509-d431b8600f7d: "Alright, let's tackle this question step\
      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether the ZIP code 27051 in North Carolina\
      \ (NC) is located south of the ZIP code 38506 in Tennessee (TN). To find this\
      \ out, we'll need to understand the geographic locations of these two ZIP codes\
      \ and compare their latitudes.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding ZIP Codes\nFirst,\
      \ it's essential to understand what ZIP codes represent. ZIP codes are a system\
      \ of postal codes used by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to efficiently\
      \ deliver mail. Each ZIP code corresponds to a specific geographic area, often\
      \ a town, city, or a part of a city. While ZIP codes can give us a general idea\
      \ of a location, they don't provide exact coordinates. However, for our purpose,\
      \ knowing the general area each ZIP code covers will be sufficient to compare\
      \ their north-south positions.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Locations of the\
      \ ZIP Codes\nNext, we need to identify the specific locations associated with\
      \ the ZIP codes in question.\n\n- **ZIP Code 27051, NC**: This ZIP code is associated\
      \ with the town of Mocksville, which is located in Davie County, North Carolina.\n\
      \  \n- **ZIP Code 38506, TN**: This ZIP code corresponds to Cookeville, a city\
      \ in Putnam County, Tennessee.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Latitude of Each\
      \ Location\nTo compare the north-south positions of these two locations, we'll\
      \ look at their latitudes. Latitude measures how far north or south a location\
      \ is from the equator. Locations with higher latitude numbers are further north,\
      \ while those with lower latitude numbers are further south.\n\nLet's find the\
      \ latitudes:\n\n- **Mocksville, NC (ZIP Code 27051)**:\n  - Latitude: Approximately\
      \ 35.8940\xB0 N\n  \n- **Cookeville, TN (ZIP Code 38506)**:\n  - Latitude: Approximately\
      \ 36.1628\xB0 N\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Latitudes\nNow that we have the\
      \ latitudes, we can compare them to determine which location is further south.\n\
      \n- Mocksville, NC: 35.8940\xB0 N\n- Cookeville, TN: 36.1628\xB0 N\n\nSince\
      \ 35.8940\xB0 N is less than 36.1628\xB0 N, Mocksville, NC, is further south\
      \ than Cookeville, TN.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nBased on the latitude comparison:\n\
      \n- **ZIP Code 27051, NC (Mocksville)** is located south of **ZIP Code 38506,\
      \ TN (Cookeville)**.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**YES**,\

      - **01107** is Springfield, MA.

      - **01129** is also Springfield, MA.

      \ western United States.\n   - 21074, MD is a ZIP code in Maryland, which is\
      \ in the eastern United States.\n\n2. **Understand the general geography:**\n\
      \   - Colorado is generally located further west and at a higher latitude compared\
      \ to Maryland.\n   - Maryland is located on the East Coast and is generally\
      \ further south than Colorado.\n\n3. **Compare latitudes:**\n   - The latitude\
      \ of 81632, CO (near the town of Basalt, Colorado) is approximately **39.37\xB0\
      \ N**.\n   - The latitude of 21074, MD (near the town of Jarrettsville, Maryland)\
      \ is approximately **39.60\xB0 N**.\n\n4. **Analyze the results:**\n   - Since\
      \ 39.37\xB0 N (81632, CO) is slightly south of 39.60\xB0 N (21074, MD), 81632,\
      \ CO is indeed located south of 21074, MD.\n\n**Final Answer: YES.**"

      2. **Compare the ZIP codes**: 77061 is a higher number than 77031, which suggests
      it is located further south.


      3. **Verify with a map**: If we check the locations of these ZIP codes on a
      map, 77061 is indeed south of 77031.


      Thus, the answer is **YES**. 77061, TX is located south of 77031, TX.'

      south of 77031, TX, we need to compare the geographic locations of these two
      zip codes. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Understand the zip codes**: Both 77061 and 77031 are in Houston, Texas.
      Houston is a large city, and zip codes in the area are generally organized geographically.


      2. **Check the general location of 77031**: Zip code 77031 is located in the
      western part of Houston, near the Energy Corridor and the Katy Freeway (I-10).
      It is north of Interstate 10 and west of Beltway 8.


      3. **Check the general location of 77061**: Zip code 77061 is located in the
      southeastern part of Houston, near Hobby Airport and the Gulf Freeway (I-45).
      It is south of Interstate 45 and closer to the Gulf of Mexico.


      4. **Compare the latitudes**: Since 77061 is in the southeastern part of Houston
      and 77031 is in the western part, we can infer that 77061 is indeed south of
      77031.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic locations of these zip codes, 77061,
      TX is located south of 77031, TX.

      south of 32796, FL, we need to analyze the geographic locations of these two
      ZIP codes in Florida.


      ### Step 1: Understand the ZIP code structure

      ZIP codes in the United States are generally assigned from north to south and
      east to west. Lower-numbered ZIP codes tend to be in the northern or eastern
      parts of a state, while higher-numbered ZIP codes are typically in the southern
      or western parts.


      ### Step 2: Compare the ZIP codes

      - **32751** is a ZIP code in Florida.

      - **32796** is another ZIP code in Florida.


      Since 32751 is a lower number than 32796, it is likely located further north
      or east compared to 32796.


      ### Step 3: Verify the locations

      - **32751** corresponds to the city of **Oviedo, FL**, which is located in the
      central part of Florida, northeast of Orlando.

      - **32796** corresponds to the city of **Winter Springs, FL**, which is also
      in the central part of Florida, but slightly northwest of Oviedo.


      ### Step 4: Determine the relative positions

      Oviedo (32751) is slightly southeast of Winter Springs (32796). Therefore, **32751
      is located south of 32796**.

      \ determine which one is further south.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Locations\n\
      \n**ZIP Code 10021:**\n- Location: Upper East Side, Manhattan, New York City,\
