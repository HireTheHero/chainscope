      is generally west of Wisconsin (WI).  This gives a preliminary clue that 55055
      might be *west* of 54474, not necessarily south.

      geographical area. 55XXX zip codes are in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area,
      while 54XXX zip codes are in central Wisconsin.  This reinforces the idea that
      55055 is likely further west than 54474.


      3. **Latitude Consideration:**  While being further west *can* also mean further
      south in some cases, given the relative positions of Minneapolis-St. Paul and

      difference is less relevant, though it can slightly influence latitude depending
      on the shape of the state borders.

      5. **Likely Answer:** Since Minnesota is mostly west of Wisconsin, a zip code
      in Minnesota is likely to be at a similar or higher latitude than a zip code

      4. **Relate location and direction:** Since MN is already west of WI, and 55055

      3. **South Definition:** South implies a lower latitude.  While 55055 is west
      of 54474, the question is about its southerly location.  West-East placement
      doesn''t directly dictate North-South placement.  Parts of Minnesota are south
      of parts of Wisconsin.


      4. **Need More Information:**  Zip codes alone aren''t sufficient to determine
      a precise North/South relationship.  We would need latitude coordinates to be
      sure. However, given MN is generally west of WI, it''s likely that 55055, MN
      is *not* directly south of 54474, WI. Zip code 55055 is associated with Medina,

      43125.  This suggests 46235 might be further north, counteracting the general
      south-ness of Indiana compared to Ohio.


      4. **Need for More Precise Information:** While general knowledge and zip code

      the states:**  While Kentucky is generally south of Virginia, the specific locations
      within each state *could* lead to an exception.  However, since Kentucky is
      considerably south of Virginia, it''s highly unlikely a zip code in Kentucky
      would be north of one in Virginia.

      4. **South vs. East:**  While 87402, NM, is almost certainly east of 93657,
      CA, the question is about being *south*.  Being east doesn''t automatically
      make it south.  Parts of New Mexico are north of parts of California.

      5. **More precise location needed:** To be certain, we''d need more specific
      latitude information for both zip codes.  However, given the significant difference
