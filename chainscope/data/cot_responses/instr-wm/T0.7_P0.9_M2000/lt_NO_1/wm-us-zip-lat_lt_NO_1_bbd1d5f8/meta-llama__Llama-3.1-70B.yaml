      \ Zip codes in the United States are assigned by the United States Postal Service\
      \ (USPS) and are typically organized from east to west and north to south. However,\
      \ this is not a strict rule but rather a general guideline. The first digit\
      \ of a zip code represents a group of states, with lower numbers generally being\
      \ located in the east and higher numbers in the west. The next two digits narrow\
      \ down the region within those states, and the final two digits pinpoint a specific\
      \ post office or area within that region.\n\n2. **Identifying Locations**: \n\

      \ code is located in Wisconsin, also in the north-central region. \"54474\"\
      \ corresponds to Ringle, WI.\n\n3. **Comparing Locations**:\n   - Mayer, MN\
      \ (55055), is located in Carver County, Minnesota, which is south of Minneapolis.\n\
      \   - Ringle, WI (54474), is located in Marathon County, Wisconsin, which is\
      \ northwest of Green Bay.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographic locations\
      \ of Mayer (55055) and Ringle (54474), Mayer is south of Minneapolis, and Ringle\
      \ is northwest of Green Bay. However, the key factor here is latitude, and Ringle\
      \ is at a higher latitude (more north) than Mayer. Therefore, 55055, MN is not\
      \ located south of 54474, WI; it is actually located north.\n\nThe final answer\

      of 32796, FL, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the state**: Both zip codes start with "327", which indicates
      they are located in the state of Florida (FL).


      2. **General geographic location of Florida**: Florida is a state in the southeastern
      United States. It has a long coastline along the Atlantic Ocean to the east
      and the Gulf of Mexico to the west.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is south of another,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Without specific latitude values, we can
      use general knowledge that zip codes in the United States are generally organized
      from east to west and north to south. However, this is not a strict rule but
      rather a general guideline.


      4. **Specific location of 32751**: The zip code 32751 is associated with Maitland,
      FL, which is a city in central Florida.


      5. **Specific location of 32796**: The zip code 32796 is associated with Tavares,
      FL, which is also a city in central Florida.


      6. **Comparing locations**: Given that both locations are in central Florida,
      we can infer that they are roughly at the same latitude. However, without precise
      coordinates, it''s challenging to determine if one is strictly south of the
      other.


      Based on these steps and the available information, we can conclude that 32751,
      FL (Maitland) and 32796, FL (Tavares) are approximately at the same latitude
      in central Florida. Therefore, it is difficult to definitively state if one
      is located south of the other without more specific geographic information.

      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is south of another,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Without specific latitude values, we can
      use general knowledge that Mississippi and Alabama are both southern states,
      but their relative positions are not directly north-south of each other due
      to their proximity and the curvature of the Earth.


      4. **Specific zip code locations**: The zip code 38655 is associated with Oxford,
      Mississippi, and the zip code 35016 is associated with Cardiff, Alabama.


      5. **Specific location comparison**: Oxford, MS, is located in the northern
      part of Mississippi, and Cardiff, AL, is located in the central part of Alabama.
      While both are in the southern United States, their exact positions are not
      strictly north-south of each other.


      Based on these steps and general geographic knowledge, since Oxford, MS (38655)
      is not directly south of Cardiff, AL (35016), it is reasonable to conclude that
      38655, MS is not located south of 35016, AL.
