      1. First, let''s look at the two zip codes: 92029 and 92025, both in California
      (CA)


      2. Zip codes in the same state can be compared by their numerical value


      3. 92029 is numerically higher than 92025


      4. In the US zip code system, lower numbers typically indicate a more northern
      location, while higher numbers indicate a more southern location

      2. In the US zip code system, the first digit represents a broad geographic
      region, and subsequent digits narrow down the location.


      3. Both zip codes start with 297, which means they are in the same general region
      of South Carolina.


      4. In the US zip code system, lower numbers typically indicate locations further
      north, while higher numbers indicate locations further south.


      5. 29730 is a higher number than 29640.


      6. Therefore, 29730 is likely located south of 29640.
