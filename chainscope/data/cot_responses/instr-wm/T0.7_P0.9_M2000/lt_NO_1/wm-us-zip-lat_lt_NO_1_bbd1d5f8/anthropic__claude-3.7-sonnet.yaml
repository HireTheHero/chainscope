      - South Pittsburg, TN (37367) is in the southern part of Tennessee, near the
      Tennessee-Alabama border.

      - Newton, NC (28658) is in the western part of North Carolina.

      - Even though South Pittsburg is in southern Tennessee, it''s still north of
      locations in North Carolina.


      YES, 28658, NC is located south of 37367, TN.'

      - 71047 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Alabama and Louisiana.

      - Alabama is located to the east of Louisiana

      - Louisiana is generally south of Alabama, though they don''t share a border
      directly


      Step 3: Look at the specific locations within their states.

      - 27051 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 38506 is a zip code in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Tennessee is located west of North Carolina

      - Generally speaking, Tennessee is north of parts of North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - US zip codes are somewhat organized geographically, with lower numbers generally
      in the northeast/east and higher numbers as you move south and west

      - 27051 (NC) has a lower number than 38506 (TN)

      - However, zip code numbering isn''t perfectly aligned with latitude


      Step 4: North Carolina is generally south of Tennessee. The entire state of
      Tennessee is north of most of North Carolina. Even though the zip code numbers
      might suggest otherwise, the geographical reality is that any location in NC
      would be south of any location in TN.


      Therefore, my answer is: YES'

      - 55055 is in Minnesota (MN)

      Step 2: I need to determine their relative positions. Minnesota and Wisconsin
      share a border, with Minnesota generally to the west of Wisconsin. But I need
      to determine the north-south relationship of these specific zip codes.


      Step 3: Let me consider the zip code patterns. In the US postal system, zip
      codes generally follow geographic patterns:

      - The first digit represents a group of states (5 covers Minnesota, Wisconsin,
      and other north-central states)

      - The first three digits typically represent sectional centers or regions within
      those states


      Step 4: For Minnesota (55055) and Wisconsin (54474), the second digits (5 vs
      4) suggest that 55055 is in a region that''s coded higher than 54474.


      Step 5: In the upper Midwest, zip codes generally increase as you move from
      north to south. The higher second digit for the Minnesota zip code (55055) compared
      to the Wisconsin zip code (54474) suggests the Minnesota location is further
      south.

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Illinois and Kansas.

      - Illinois is located east of Kansas

      - Kansas is generally west of Illinois


      Step 3: Consider the north-south relationship.

      - Illinois extends further south than much of Kansas

      - However, I need to check these specific zip codes


      Step 4: 62918 is in southern Illinois (as indicated by the "629" prefix, which
      is in the southern portion of the state)

      - Specifically, 62918 appears to be in the southern third of Illinois


      Step 5: 67101 is in Kansas (with "671" prefix)

      - This zip code is likely in the southern half of Kansas


      Step 6: Comparing latitudes, southern Illinois (where 62918 is located) is generally
      south of southern Kansas (where 67101 is located)

      - Bremerton/Silverdale (98311) is located in the western part of Washington
      state, near Seattle.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Spokane is in the eastern part of Washington near the northern border with
      Idaho.

      - Bremerton/Silverdale is in the central-western part of Washington.

      - While they are at somewhat similar latitudes, Spokane is slightly further
      north than the Bremerton area.


      Therefore, 98311 (Bremerton/Silverdale) is slightly south of 99206 (Spokane

      Step 1: Let me recall what I know about US zip code geography, particularly
      in Florida.

      - Florida zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be
      in the northern part of the state, and higher numbers tend to be in the southern
      part.

      - The first three digits of a zip code (the sectional center facility or SCF)
      are particularly important for determining general location.


      Step 2: Compare the first three digits of each zip code.

      - 33573 has first three digits 335

      - 32963 has first three digits 329


      Step 3: Since 335 is a higher number than 329, this suggests that 33573 is likely
      to be south of 32963.


      Step 4: To verify, I can note that 335xx zip codes are generally in the Tampa/St.
      Petersburg area in west-central Florida, while 329xx zip codes are typically
      in the Vero Beach/Indian River County area on Florida''s east coast, which is

      Florida is located south of zip code 32963 in Florida.


      Step 1: Let me analyze the zip codes. In the US zip code system, the first digit
      generally indicates a broad geographic region, with lower numbers typically
      in the northeast/east and higher numbers in the south/west.


      Step 2: Both zip codes start with "3", which generally covers the southeastern
      states including Florida.


      Step 3: The second digit is more specific to regions within states. Here, 33573
      starts with "33" while 32963 starts with "32".


      Step 4: In Florida, zip codes beginning with "33" are generally in the southern
      part of the state (including Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and other southern areas),
      while those beginning with "32" are typically in the northern and central parts
      of Florida.


      Step 5: Since 33xxx zip codes are generally south of 32xxx zip codes in Florida,

      digits typically represent a sectional center facility.


      Step 2: Both zip codes start with "3", which corresponds to the southeastern
      region of the US, including Florida.


      Step 3: The second digit in zip codes often indicates a more specific area within
      the region. In Florida, generally lower second digits (like the "2" in 32963)
      tend to be in northern parts of Florida, while higher second digits (like the
      "3" in 33573) tend to be in more southern parts.


      Step 4: More specifically, zip codes beginning with "329" are typically in the
      east coast central Florida area (around Vero Beach), while zip codes beginning

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of these zip codes in Massachusetts.

      - 01107 is a zip code in Springfield, MA

      - 01129 is also a zip code in Springfield, MA


      Step 2: Since both zip codes are in Springfield, I need to determine their relative
      positions within the city.

      - 01107 covers the South End and Metro Center neighborhoods of Springfield

      - 01129 covers the East Forest Park neighborhood of Springfield


      Step 3: Looking at the geographic layout of Springfield neighborhoods:

      - The South End and Metro Center (01107) are located in the central and southern
      portion of Springfield

      - East Forest Park (01129) is located in the southeastern part of Springfield


      Step 4: Comparing their north-south positions:

      - The South End (01107) is generally in the central-south part of Springfield

      - East Forest Park (01129) is in the southeastern part, but extends further
      south than the South End


      Based on this analysis, 01107 is not south of 01129. In fact, 01129 extends
      further south than 01107.

      of 18102, PA. Let me think about this step by step.


      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 15014 is a zip code in Pennsylvania, in the western part of the state (likely
      near Pittsburgh area)

      - 18102 is a zip code in Pennsylvania, in the eastern part of the state (likely
      near Allentown area)


      Step 2: Consider the general layout of Pennsylvania zip codes.

      - In the US zip code system, lower numbers tend to be in the eastern parts of
      the country, with higher numbers as you move west

      - However, within Pennsylvania specifically, lower zip codes (15xxx) are in
      the western part of the state, while higher zip codes (18xxx) are in the eastern
      part


      Step 3: Determine north-south positioning.

      - Pennsylvania''s geography has the western part (Pittsburgh area, 15xxx) and
      the eastern part (Allentown area, 18xxx) at roughly similar latitudes

      - However, the western part of PA (where 15014 is located) is generally slightly
      south of the eastern part (where 18102 is located)


      Based on the general geography of Pennsylvania zip codes, 15014 (western PA)
      would be slightly south and considerably west of 18102 (eastern PA).


      NO, 15014, PA is not south of 18102, PA. They are at similar latitudes, with
      15014 possibly slightly north of 18102, but primarily west of it.'

      south of 18102, PA. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: I need to identify what locations these zip codes correspond to.

      - 15014 is a zip code in Pennsylvania, likely in the western part of the state
      based on the "150" prefix.

      - 18102 is a zip code in Pennsylvania, likely in the eastern part of the state
      based on the "181" prefix.


      Step 2: Recall the general organization of Pennsylvania zip codes.

      - Pennsylvania zip codes generally start with 150-196.

      - Lower numbers (150-168) tend to be in the western part of the state (Pittsburgh
      area).

      - Higher numbers (169-196) tend to be in the eastern part of the state (Philadelphia
      area).


      Step 3: Consider the north-south orientation.

      - Pennsylvania''s geography is such that the western and eastern parts of the
      state are at roughly similar latitudes.

      - However, generally speaking, the lower zip code numbers in PA tend to be in
      the western part, while higher numbers tend to be in the eastern part, without
      a strong north-south correlation.

      - 15014 (western PA) and 18102 (eastern PA) are more differentiated by east-west
      position than north-south.


      Step 4: Based on the zip code system, I can''t definitively determine north-south
      positioning just from these numbers, as the primary organization is east-west.


      Since I don''t have precise latitude information for these specific zip codes,
      I cannot make a definitive determination about which is further south based
      solely on the zip codes provided.


      NO (I cannot confidently state that 15014, PA is south of 18102, PA based on
      zip codes alone, and generally western PA zip codes are not necessarily south
      of eastern PA zip codes)'

      south of 18102, PA. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: I need to identify what locations these zip codes represent.

      - 15014 is a zip code in Pennsylvania, likely in the western part of the state
      (lower zip codes in the east coast tend to be in the northeast, with numbers
      increasing as you go south and west)

      - 18102 is also a zip code in Pennsylvania, likely in the eastern part of the
      state


      Step 2: Consider the general pattern of US zip codes.

      - The first digit of zip codes generally increases from east to west

      - The first three digits (the sectional center facility or "SCF") identify the
      region

      - 150xx would be in western PA (likely Pittsburgh area)

      - 181xx would be in eastern PA


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since 15014 is in western PA and 18102 is in eastern PA, they are more east-west
      of each other than north-south

      - However, western PA is generally at a lower latitude (more south) than eastern
      PA in the northern part of the state

      - Pittsburgh (150xx) is south of areas like Scranton/Allentown (181xx)


      Based on the general geography of Pennsylvania and the zip code system, 15014
      (western PA) is likely southwest of 18102 (eastern PA).


      NO, 15014, PA is not located south of 18102, PA. It''s located southwest, but
      not directly south.'

      To determine if one zip code is south of another, I need to find the geographic
      locations of both zip codes and compare their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 15909 is in Indiana County, Pennsylvania

      - 15140 appears to be in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area)


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Zip code 15909 (Indiana County) is located in west-central Pennsylvania

      - Zip code 15140 (Allegheny County/Pittsburgh area) is in southwestern Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Indiana County is generally north and east of Allegheny County. Since latitude
      decreases as you move south, and 15909 is in a county that''s north of where
      15140 is located, 15909 would be north of 15140, not south.

      - The Pittsburgh metro area (15140) is in the southwestern part of Pennsylvania.

      - Clymer and the 15909 area are more toward the central part of western Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Based on the general geography of Pennsylvania zip codes, the first
      digits "15" indicate western Pennsylvania, but the subsequent digits help determine
      more specific locations. In this region, typically higher third digits in the
      zip code indicate locations further north.


      Step 4: Since 15909 has a higher third digit (9) compared to 15140 (1), and
      considering the counties they''re in, 15909 is likely north of 15140, not south.


      NO, 15909, PA is not located south of 15140, PA. It is located north of it.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 46235 is a ZIP code in Indiana (IN)

      - 43125 is a ZIP code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between Indiana and Ohio.

      - Ohio is located east of Indiana

      - They share a border that runs roughly east-west


      Step 3: Consider the ZIP code numbering system.

      - In the US ZIP code system, the first digit represents a broad geographic region

      - Both ZIP codes start with 4, which covers the Midwest region

      - The second and third digits typically represent sectional centers or regions
      within states


      Step 4: Compare the specific ZIP codes.

      - 46235 is in Indiana, likely in the Indianapolis area (46xxx series)

      - 43125 is in Ohio, likely in the Columbus area (43xxx series)


      Step 5: Determine the north-south relationship.

      - Indianapolis (46xxx) is generally at a similar latitude to Columbus (43xxx)

      - However, Indianapolis is slightly south of Columbus

      - Therefore, 46235 in Indiana would be south of 43125 in Ohio


      YES'

      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 46235 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 43125 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Indiana and Ohio.

      - Ohio is directly east of Indiana

      - Indiana''s northern border aligns with Ohio''s northern portion

      - Both states share a horizontal border running east-west


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbers.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow geographical patterns

      - The first three digits of a zip code represent a sectional center facility

      - 462xx (Indiana) vs 431xx (Ohio)

      - These different first three digits indicate different postal regions


      Step 4: Compare the relative positions.

      - Indiana (46235) is west of Ohio (43125)

      - The higher first digit in the Indiana zip code (4) compared to Ohio (4) means
      they''re in the same general latitude band

      - The higher second digit in Indiana (6 vs 3) typically indicates a more southern
      location within this band


      Step 5: Make a determination based on postal geography.

      - The zip code 46235 (IN) is in the central-eastern part of Indiana

      - The zip code 43125 (OH) is in the central-southern part of Ohio

      - When comparing their latitudes, 46235 is indeed south of 43125

      Step 3: Analyze the ZIP codes.

      - In the US ZIP code system, generally lower numbers are in the eastern and
      northern parts of the country

      - The first digit "4" indicates both are in the same general region (Midwest)

      - The second digit is higher for the Indiana ZIP (6 vs 3), which typically indicates
      a more southern location


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 26301 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 21229 is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Maryland is located north of West Virginia on the US map.

      - Maryland borders West Virginia on West Virginia''s northern side.


      Step 3: Since zip codes within each state generally follow geographic patterns,
      a zip code in West Virginia (26301) would typically be south of a zip code in
      Maryland (21229).


      Step 4: To be precise, 26301 is in Clarksburg, WV, which is in the northern
      part of West Virginia.

      21229 is in Baltimore, MD, which is in the central part of Maryland.


      Step 5: Comparing these specific locations, Clarksburg, WV is indeed south of
      Baltimore, MD.

      - 32507 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 78653 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Indiana and Ohio.

      - Ohio is east of Indiana

      - Indiana and Ohio share a border


      Step 3: Consider what the zip code numbers tell us about location.

      - In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers are in the eastern part

      - 44065 is in Ohio (OH).


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Indiana and Ohio.

      - Ohio is east of Indiana.

      - The states share a border, with Ohio to the east of Indiana.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system in the US.

      - US zip codes generally increase from east to west and from north to south.

      - The first digit indicates a broad geographical region (4 covers the Midwest
      including both IN and OH).

      - The first three digits narrow down to a more specific area.


      Step 4: Compare the zip codes.

      - 46506 (IN) starts with 465, which is in northern Indiana.

      - 44065 (OH) starts with 440, which is in northern Ohio.

      - Since both are in the "4" region but Indiana''s zip starts with 465 while
      Ohio''s starts with 440, and zip codes generally increase from east to west,
      this suggests Indiana''s zip is west of Ohio''s zip.

      Step 3: 46506 (Indiana) has a higher first digit (4) but also a higher second

      in the same general region, but the higher second digit for the Indiana zip
      code suggests it might be further west and/or south.


      Step 4: More specifically, zip codes beginning with 460-469 cover central and
      northern Indiana, while zip codes beginning with 440-449 cover northern Ohio.


      Step 5: 46506 is in northern Indiana, while 44065 is in northern Ohio. Since

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 56470 is in Minnesota (MN)

      - 98338 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - Washington state is in the northwest corner of the contiguous United States,
      bordering Canada to the north.

      - Minnesota is in the northern central part of the United States, also bordering
      Canada to the north.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Washington is on the west coast, while Minnesota is more central.

      - In terms of latitude (north-south position), Minnesota and Washington are
      both northern states, but Minnesota extends further south than the southern
      border of Washington.

      - Any location in Minnesota would be at a similar latitude or south of locations

      - 32351 is a ZIP code in Florida (FL)

      - 36582 is a ZIP code in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the geography of Florida and Alabama.

      Florida is located south of Alabama. The entire state of Florida is positioned
      below Alabama on the map of the United States.


      Step 3: Since 32351 is in Florida and 36582 is in Alabama, and Florida is south
      of Alabama, it follows that any location in Florida would be south of any location

      Step 3: Consider the specific ZIP codes.

      - ZIP codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to
      be in the eastern and southern parts of the country

      - 32xxx ZIP codes are in northern Florida

      - 36xxx ZIP codes are in southern Alabama


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since 32351 is in Florida, and Florida is south of Alabama, and 36582 is in
      Alabama, it''s very likely that 32351, FL is south of 36582, AL.

      - The specific ZIP codes are in the border regions of their respective states

      - 38655 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)

      - 35016 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Mississippi is generally west of Alabama

      - However, the question is asking about north/south positioning, not east/west


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbers themselves.

      - In the US zip code system, generally (though with exceptions), lower numbers

      tend to be in the western and southern parts

      - 38655 (MS) has a higher first digit than 35016 (AL)

      Step 4: More specifically, zip codes beginning with 35 in Alabama are typically
      in the northern part of Alabama, while zip codes beginning with 38 in Mississippi
      are typically in the northern part of Mississippi

      Alabama


      Step 5: Looking more precisely, 35016 is in north-central Alabama, while 38655

      if 40517, KY is south of 40514, KY.


      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of these two zip codes in Kentucky.

      - 40517 is a zip code in Lexington, Kentucky

      - 40514 is also a zip code in Lexington, Kentucky


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative positions.

      - In the US zip code system, especially within the same city, zip codes that
      are close numerically are often (but not always) geographically close.

      - 40517 is located in the southeastern part of Lexington

      - 40514 is located in the southwestern part of Lexington


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - 40517 is in the eastern part of south Lexington

      - 40514 is in the western part of south Lexington

      - Both are in the southern portion of Lexington, but their east-west positioning
      differs

      - 40517 is slightly more to the east, while 40514 is more to the west

      - They are approximately at the same latitude (north-south position)


      Based on their geographic positions, 40517 is not clearly south of 40514. They
      are roughly at the same latitude, with 40517 being more eastward rather than
      southward of 40514.

      relationships.

      - For Lexington specifically, 40517 is located in the southeastern part of Lexington.

      - 40514 is located in the southwestern part of Lexington.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - 40517 is in the eastern part of south Lexington

      - Iowa is located to the northwest of Indiana

      - States further north have higher latitude numbers

      - Iowa is generally north of Indiana


      Step 4: Looking at the zip codes specifically:

      - The first digits of zip codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower
      numbers are in the northeast and higher numbers move south and west

      - 46xxx (Indiana) vs 50xxx (Iowa) - the higher first digit for Iowa suggests
      it''s further north

      Step 1: Let me identify the geographic positions of these zip codes.

      - 46761 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 50322 is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Indiana and Iowa.

      - Iowa is located to the northwest of Indiana

      - Indiana is located to the southeast of Iowa


      Step 3: Looking more specifically at latitude:

      - States further north generally have higher latitude numbers

      - Iowa is north of Indiana geographically

      - This suggests that zip codes in Iowa would typically have higher latitude
      than zip codes in Indiana


      Step 4: The zip code numbers themselves provide additional confirmation:

      - The first three digits of zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower
      numbers are in the northeast and higher numbers as you move south and west

      - 463xx-469xx is the range for northern/central Indiana

      - 503xx-506xx is the range for central Iowa

      - The lower first digits for Indiana (4xx) versus Iowa (5xx) align with the
      geographic reality that Indiana is east of Iowa, not necessarily south


      Based on the geographic position of these states, Indiana (46761) is indeed
      south of Iowa (50322).

      - 4xxxx zip codes typically cover more southern regions than 5xxxx zip codes

      - 46xxx is in northern/central Indiana

      - 50xxx is in central/southern Iowa


      Step 4: Make the determination based on latitude.

      - Even though 46761 is in northern Indiana, Indiana as a whole is south of Iowa

      - 50322 (in Iowa) would be at a higher latitude than 46761 (in Indiana)

      tend to be in the western and southwestern parts

      - 46xxx is a standard Indiana zip code prefix

      - 50xxx is a standard Iowa zip code prefix


      Step 4: Make the geographical determination.

      - Since Indiana as a state is entirely south of Iowa as a state, any location
      in Indiana (including 46761) would be south of any location in Iowa (including
      50322)

      - 50322 is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Indiana and Iowa.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest, east of Illinois

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest, west of Illinois

      - Generally, Indiana is at a similar latitude to Iowa, but their exact north-south
      relationship depends on specific locations


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - The first digit in zip codes generally follows a pattern from east (0) to
      west (9)

      - The first three digits typically represent specific regions within states

      - However, zip code numbers themselves don''t directly indicate north-south
      positioning


      Step 4: Look at the specific locations.

      - 46761 is in Indiana, and Indiana is generally south of Iowa

      - Iowa borders Minnesota to the north and Missouri to the south

      - Indiana borders Michigan to the north and Kentucky to the south

      - Most of Indiana is south of most of Iowa


      Step 5: Make a conclusion based on geography.

      Since Indiana is generally south of Iowa (Indiana''s northern border is at a
      similar latitude to central Iowa), and specific zip codes within these states
      would follow this general geographic relationship, 46761, IN would be south

      - 33624 is a zip code in Tampa, Florida


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Florida and how zip codes are organized.

      - In Florida, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend
      to be further south

      - The first three digits (336xx vs 346xx) suggest that 33624 is likely south

      - 34684 is a zip code in Palm Harbor, Florida

      - 33624 is a zip code in Tampa, Florida


      Step 2: Consider the general pattern of zip codes in Florida.

      In the US zip code system, Florida zip codes generally follow a pattern where
      codes in the northern part of the state have lower numbers than those in the
      southern part. However, this pattern isn''t always perfectly consistent, especially
      within metropolitan areas.


      Step 3: Look at the first digits of these zip codes.

      - 34684 starts with "34"

      - 33624 starts with "33"


      Step 4: Since 34 is higher than 33, and Florida zip codes generally increase
      as you move north (contrary to the usual pattern in many other states), this
      suggests that 34684 is likely north of 33624.

      - 19933 is a ZIP code in Delaware (DE)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Virginia and Delaware.

      - Delaware is a small state on the eastern seaboard

      - Virginia is located south of Delaware along the eastern seaboard

      - Generally, most locations in Virginia would be south of locations in Delaware


      Step 3: Consider ZIP code numbering patterns.

      and higher numbers as you move south and west

      - 20136 (VA) has a higher number than 19933 (DE), which is consistent with VA
      being south of DE


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geography.

      - Since Virginia is geographically south of Delaware, and these ZIP codes follow

      - 71341 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)

      - 76513 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Louisiana and Texas.

      - Louisiana is generally located to the east of Texas

      - Louisiana is generally in the southeastern part of the United States

      - Texas extends further north than Louisiana


      Step 3: More specifically, let me think about these particular zip codes:

      - 71341 appears to be in northern Louisiana (based on the zip code pattern)

      - 76513 appears to be in central Texas (based on the zip code pattern)


      Step 4: In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Northern Louisiana (71341) is typically at a similar latitude or slightly
      north of central Texas (76513)

      - Louisiana zip codes starting with 71xxx are typically in the northern part
      of the state

      - Texas zip codes starting with 76xxx are typically in the central part of the
      state


      Based on the geographic positions of these zip codes, 71341 in northern Louisiana
      is likely at a similar latitude or slightly north of 76513 in central Texas,
      not south of it.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 71341 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)

      - 76513 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Louisiana and Texas.

      - Louisiana is located to the east of Texas

      - Louisiana is generally at the same latitude as the southern part of Texas


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - In the US zip code system, lower numbers generally (but not always) correspond
      to more eastern and northern locations

      - 71xxx zip codes are typically in northern Louisiana

      - 76xxx zip codes are typically in central/north-central Texas


      Step 4: Make the geographical comparison.

      - 71341 (LA) is in northern Louisiana

      - 76513 (TX) is in central Texas, likely north of southern Louisiana but south
      of northern Louisiana

      - Since 71341 is in northern Louisiana, it''s likely to be at a similar latitude
      or even north of 76513 in Texas


      Based on this analysis, 71341, LA is likely NOT south of 76513, TX. It''s either

      Step 1: Let me consider what I know about New York zip codes. Generally, in
      the US postal system, zip codes are assigned with some geographical logic.


      Step 2: For New York state specifically, lower zip code numbers tend to be in
      the northern parts of the state, while higher zip code numbers tend to be in
      the southern parts.


      Step 3: Zip code 13323 starts with 133xx, while 14228 starts with 142xx. Since
      142xx is higher than 133xx, this suggests that 14228 is likely south of 13323.


      Step 4: However, this general pattern isn''t always perfectly consistent. Let
      me be more specific about these locations:

      - 14228 is in the Buffalo area in western New York

      - 13323 is in central New York, in the Mohawk Valley region


      Step 5: Buffalo (14228) is actually west and slightly north of the Mohawk Valley

      generally start with 10-14, with lower numbers in the southern part of the state
      (NYC area has 10xxx and 11xxx) and higher numbers as you move north and west.


      Step 5: However, this contradicts my initial reasoning, as in New York specifically,
      higher zip codes tend to be further north and west. 14xxx codes are typically

      parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western and southern
      parts.


      Step 2: However, within a state like New York, the pattern is more specific.
      In New York, lower zip codes are generally in the southeastern part of the state
      (around NYC area), while higher zip codes tend to be in the western part of
      the state.


      Step 3: The zip code 13323 is in the 133xx range, which typically covers areas
      in central New York.


      Step 4: The zip code 14228 is in the 142xx range, which typically covers areas
      in western New York, around Buffalo.


      Step 5: In New York State, as you move from east to west, you generally go from
      lower zip codes to higher zip codes. Buffalo (142xx) is west of central NY (133xx),
      not south.


      Step 6: Specifically, 14228 is in Amherst/Buffalo area in western NY, while
      13323 is in the Utica area in central NY. On a map, Buffalo is west and slightly
      north of Utica, not south of it.


      NO, 14228, NY is not located south of 13323, NY. It is located west and slightly
      north of it.'

      in New York is located south of zip code 13323 in New York.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 14228 is a zip code for Williamsville, NY, which is in the Buffalo area in
      western New York.

      - 13323 is a zip code for Clinton, NY, which is in central New York near Utica.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of New York State.

      - Western New York (Buffalo area) is generally at a similar latitude to central
      New York.

      - However, I need to be more precise about the north-south relationship.


      Step 3: Compare the first digits of the zip codes.

      - In the US zip code system, lower first digits generally indicate more northern
      or eastern regions.

      - 13xxx zip codes are typically north/east of 14xxx zip codes in New York State.


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      - Clinton (13323) is in central NY, slightly east and north of the Buffalo area.

      - Williamsville (14228) is in the Buffalo area, which is slightly south and
      west of Clinton.


      Based on the geographic layout of New York State, Williamsville (14228) is actually
      slightly south of Clinton (13323).
