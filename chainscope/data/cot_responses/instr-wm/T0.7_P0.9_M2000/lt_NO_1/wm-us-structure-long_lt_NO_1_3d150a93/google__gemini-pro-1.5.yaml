      north of Miami Beach.


      5. **East coast placement:** Since both locations are on the east coast, the
      question of one being *west* of the other suggests a slight inland difference
      or a bend in the coastline.  However, given their relative north/south positions,
      it''s unlikely one would be significantly west of the other.  I would expect
      them to be roughly aligned north-south.


      6. **Verify with a map:** A quick map check confirms Hobe Sound is slightly
      *north* and very slightly *west* of Miami Beach.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

    dbd8f7e5-cbbd-4fa6-b265-747747dafa36: '1. **Locate Anderson Lake (CA):** Anderson
      Lake is in California.  California is a West Coast state.

      2. **Locate Baker Lake (WA):** Baker Lake is in Washington. Washington is also
      a West Coast state, and is north of California.

      3. **West/East Relationship:**  We need to determine if something in California
      (further south) is *west* of something in Washington (further north).  Since
      the West Coast runs roughly North-South, a location in California would generally
      be *south* of a location in Washington, not necessarily west.  While there can
      be some westward deviation, Washington extends much further west than the westernmost
      point of California.


      Therefore, Anderson Lake (CA) is likely *south*, not strictly *west*, of Baker
      Lake (WA).

      3. **West/East Relationship:**  We need to determine if something in California
      is west of something in Washington.  Generally, the further west you go in the
      contiguous US, the closer you get to the Pacific Ocean.  Washington''s western
      border is the Pacific Ocean.  California extends southward along the Pacific.

      4. **Conclusion:**  Since Washington is directly north of California and borders
      the Pacific, anything in California would have to be *south* and potentially
      slightly west or east of something in Washington, but not significantly west.

      and 32 Old Slip.  Mineshaft was located in Manhattan, New York City.  32 Old
      Slip is also in Manhattan.


      2. **Compare Longitudes:**  West of a location means it has a *smaller* longitude
      value.  Since both are in Manhattan, latitude is less critical, but we''ll still
      check it to be sure.


      3. **Manhattan''s layout:** Manhattan''s streets are largely a grid.  Addresses
      generally increase as you go north, and avenues increase as you go west (with
      some exceptions).  This can give us a *general* idea but isn''t definitive for
      precise location.


      4. **Online search:** Searching online for the specific locations reveals that
      Mineshaft was in the Meatpacking District, generally west of where the Financial

      2. **Manhattan''s street grid:** Manhattan''s streets generally run north-south
      and avenues run east-west.  "West" means a lower avenue number or a lower street
      number in some cases.


      3. **Look up historical address of Mineshaft:** Mineshaft was located at 835
      Washington Street.


      4. **Look up address of 32 Old Slip:** 32 Old Slip is at that address, near

      we need to find its former location.  A search reveals it was located in the
      Meatpacking District of Manhattan.


      2. **Compare Longitudes:**  West and East are determined by longitude.  A location
      further west has a *smaller* longitude value (more negative in the Western Hemisphere).  Therefore,
      we need to compare the longitudes of the two locations.


      3. **Mineshaft''s approximate location:**  Various sources place Mineshaft in
      the general vicinity of West 12th Street and Washington Street in the Meatpacking
      District.


      4. **32 Old Slip location:** This is a specific address in the Financial District
      of Manhattan.

      Mineshaft was located in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan.


      2. **Determine East/West in Manhattan:** Manhattan''s street grid is largely
      oriented north-south and east-west.  Streets with lower numbers are generally
      further east, and higher numbers are further west.  Avenues run north-south,
      with higher numbers further west.


      3. **Compare locations:** The Meatpacking District is considerably west of the
      Financial District.

      last known address was 835 Washington Street, New York, NY.


      2. **Find the coordinates of 32 Old Slip, NY:** This is a valid address in New
      York City.


      3. **Compare longitudes:**  Washington Street runs North-South in Manhattan,
      and Old Slip is in the Financial District.  Generally, locations further West
      have lower longitude numbers. We need to find out if the longitude of 835 Washington
      Street is lower (more west) than the longitude of 32 Old Slip.


      4. **Use a mapping tool or online resource:** A quick search shows that 835
      Washington St is significantly west of 32 Old Slip.

    fe526009-dde5-44bd-83a3-640c1a23d772: '1. **Find the locations:** We need the
      geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude) for both Mineshaft (a former
      gay club in New York City) and 32 Old Slip.  A simple web search should suffice.


      2. **Focus on Longitude:** Since we''re talking about East/West, longitude is
      the relevant coordinate.  West locations have *higher* longitude values than
      East locations.


      3. **Compare Longitudes:**  Once we have the longitudes for both locations,
      we compare them. If Mineshaft''s longitude is *greater* than 32 Old Slip''s,
      then Mineshaft is west of it.


      4. **Answer:**  Since Mineshaft was located in Manhattan and 32 Old Slip is
      also in Manhattan, and Manhattan is a relatively small island, it is highly
      unlikely that there is a large longitudinal difference between the two locations.
      However, precise coordinates are still necessary for a definitive answer.


      Mineshaft (849 Washington Street) was located at approximately -74.0101. 32
      Old Slip is located at approximately -74.005.


      -74.0101 is greater than -74.005.

      the Orange County Courthouse is located slightly east at 425 N. Orange Ave.  Since
      the street addresses are on the same street (N. Orange Ave) and the Cathedral
      has a lower address number, it is south of the courthouse.  However, since the
      question asks about West/East, and the Cathedral is on the same street as the
      Courthouse, it can''t be West of it.

      Church Street is west of Magnolia Avenue in Orlando.

      * Second Presbyterian Church is located at 7700 N. Meridian Street.


      Monument Circle is in the heart of downtown Indianapolis.  N. Meridian Street
      is a major north-south thoroughfare. Addresses on N. Meridian with higher numbers
      are further north of downtown.  This implies Second Presbyterian is north of
      Christ Church Cathedral.  North-south placement is irrelevant to the east-west
      question.  However, Indianapolis is laid out on a fairly standard grid.  It''s
      unlikely that Meridian Street, even far north, would cross significantly west
      of Monument Circle.


      Therefore, the answer is likely NO.


      **Final Answer: NO**

    3b3a7842-d9f2-452e-9e2e-71853670a98e: '1. **Find the locations of both churches:**  We
      need the addresses or coordinates of both Christ Church Cathedral and Second
      Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis.


      2. **Compare their longitudinal coordinates:**  Longitude determines east-west
      position.  A location further west will have a *lower* longitudinal value.


      3. **Determine which church has the lower longitude:**  The church with the
      lower longitudinal coordinate is west of the other.


      Using online search:


      Christ Church Cathedral is located at 125 Monument Circle.

      Second Presbyterian Church is located at 7700 N Meridian St.


      Monument Circle is in the heart of downtown Indianapolis. North Meridian Street
      is a major thoroughfare running north-south, well north of the downtown core.


      Therefore, Second Presbyterian Church, being significantly north of downtown,
      is almost certainly also west of the centrally located Christ Church Cathedral.  However,
      to be absolutely certain I would need to look at a map to confirm the slight
      westward jog of Meridian St. as it goes north.


      A quick map check confirms this.

      San Francisco Bay Area, is still a considerable distance west of Pendleton,
      Oregon.


      **Answer: YES**

      '
    e0ff16cb-359c-4d87-bfad-5509324ffa25: '1. **Locate Camanche Reservoir, CA:**  Camanche
      Reservoir is in Calaveras County, California.  California is a western US state.


      2. **Locate Charles E. Nelson House, OR:** Charles E. Nelson House is in Lake
      Oswego, Oregon. Oregon is also a western US state, directly north of California.


      3. **West/East Relationship:** Since Oregon is north of California, a location
      in California would generally be *south* of a location in Oregon, not west.  While
      there could be some slight variations depending on the exact longitude, the
      predominant directional relationship is north/south.


      4. **Conclusion:** Camanche Reservoir is primarily south, not west, of Charles
      E. Nelson House.

      Since -73.9700 is *less negative* (and thus greater) than -74.0059, the Basilica

      \ I will compare the longitudes of the two theaters.\n\n3. **Determine west/east\
      \ relationship:** If the longitude of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask\
      \ Theatre is less than the longitude of the Guthrie Theater, then it is west.\
      \ Otherwise, it is east.\n\nAfter performing the above steps using a map or\
      \ online search, I find:\n\nHeart of the Beast is located at approximately 44.9507\xB0\
      \ N, 93.2720\xB0 W\nGuthrie Theater is located at approximately 44.9889\xB0\
      \ N, 93.2703\xB0 W\n\nSince 93.2720 (Heart of the Beast) is slightly *greater*\
      \ than 93.2703 (Guthrie), Heart of the Beast is slightly *east* of the Guthrie.\n\
      \nNO\n"
