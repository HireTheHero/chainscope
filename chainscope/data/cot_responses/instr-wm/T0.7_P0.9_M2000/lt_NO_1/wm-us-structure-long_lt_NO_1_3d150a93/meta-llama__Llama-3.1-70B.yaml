      3. **Determine the geographical relationship**: To determine if Kewaunee Power
      Station, WI, is west of Point Beach Nuclear Plant, WI, we need to understand
      the general geography of Wisconsin. Both plants are located on the western shore
      of Lake Michigan, which means they are relatively close to each other in terms
      of east-west positioning.


      4. **Final analysis**: Given the geography, it is likely that Kewaunee Power

    3bc080c8-bcaf-4ba0-a46a-5f7882f0b323: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Guist Creek Lake, KY, and Chickamauga Lake, TN, and then compare
      their positions in relation to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of Guist Creek Lake, KY**: Guist Creek Lake is located
      in Shelby County, Kentucky, in the central part of the state.


      2. **Identify the location of Chickamauga Lake, TN**: Chickamauga Lake is located
      in southeastern Tennessee, near the city of Chattanooga.


      3. **Determine the geographical relationship**: To determine if Guist Creek
      Lake, KY, is west of Chickamauga Lake, TN, we need to understand the general
      geography of the United States. Kentucky is generally north of Tennessee. When
      considering the east-west axis, Tennessee is generally west of Kentucky, but
      not significantly so in a north-south context. However, considering the specific
      locations within these states, we must note that "west of" implies that Guist
      Creek Lake would need to be to the west of Chickamauga Lake on a map.


      4. **Final analysis**: Given the geography, Kentucky (where Guist Creek Lake
      is located) is generally north of Tennessee (where Chickamauga Lake is located).
      Therefore, it is unlikely that Guist Creek Lake, KY, would be west of Chickamauga
      Lake, TN, because Kentucky is more to the north and east of Tennessee.


      Based on the geographical relationship and the fact that Kentucky is north of
      Tennessee, the answer is: **NO**'

      3. **Determine the Directional Relationship**: To be "west" of another location,
      the subject would need to be positioned to the west of that location on a map.
      In this case, the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart and the New Hope Baptist
      Church are both within Newark, which is in the northeastern part of the United
      States. Therefore, it''s unlikely that one is significantly west of the other.

      the locations of both Iranistan, CT, and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception
      in Burlington, Vermont, and then compare their positions in relation to each
      other.


      1. **Identify the location of Iranistan, CT**: Iranistan was a mansion located
      in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Connecticut is a state in the northeastern United
      States, bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, and
      New York to the west and the south.


      2. **Identify the location of Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Burlington,
      Vermont), VT**: The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is located in Burlington,
      Vermont. Vermont is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United
      States, bordered by Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New
      York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north.


      3. **Determine the geographical relationship**: To determine if Iranistan, CT,
      is west of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Burlington, Vermont,
      we need to understand the general geography of the United States. Connecticut
      is generally south of Vermont. When considering the east-west axis, Vermont
      is generally east of Connecticut, but not significantly so in a north-south
      context. However, considering the specific locations within these states, we
      must note that "west of" implies that Iranistan would need to be to the west
      of the cathedral on a map.


      4. **Final analysis**: Given the geography, Connecticut (where Iranistan was
      located) is generally south of Vermont (where the Cathedral of the Immaculate
      Conception is located). Therefore, it is unlikely that Iranistan, CT, would
      be west of the cathedral, as Connecticut is more to the south of Vermont.

    c357815f-be38-45fc-ad0a-96477f5c2c27: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Triumph Church in Michigan and Rosary Cathedral in Toledo,
      Ohio, and then compare their positions in relation to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of Triumph Church, MI**: Triumph Church is located
      in Detroit, Michigan. Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes region of the United
      States.


      2. **Identify the location of Rosary Cathedral (Toledo, Ohio), OH**: Rosary
      Cathedral is located in Toledo, Ohio. Toledo is a city in Ohio, a state in the
      Midwestern region of the United States.


      3. **Determine the geographical relationship**: To determine if Triumph Church,
      MI, is west of Rosary Cathedral, OH, we need to understand the general geography
      of the United States. Michigan is generally north of Ohio. When considering
      the east-west axis, Michigan is not significantly west of Ohio, but more north.
      However, considering the specific locations within these states, we must note
      that "west of" implies that Triumph Church would need to be to the west of Rosary
      Cathedral on a map.


      4. **Final analysis**: Given the geography, Detroit, Michigan (where Triumph
      Church is located) is not west of Toledo, Ohio (where Rosary Cathedral is located).
      Detroit is more to the north and slightly east of Toledo.


      Based on the geographical relationship, the answer is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify the location of Terrapin Crossroads, CA**: Terrapin Crossroads
      is located in San Rafael, California. California is a state in the western United

      of the United States. California is to the south of Washington. When considering
      the east-west axis, Washington is generally west of California. However, considering
      the specific locations within these states, we must note that "west of" implies

    12ec35db-b447-4b5a-a21f-06760d3d973b: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Georgia and Christ Church
      Cathedral in Lexington, Kentucky, and then compare their positions in relation
      to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, GA**: Cobb
      Energy Performing Arts Centre is located in Georgia, which is a state in the
      southeastern United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Christ Church Cathedral (Lexington, Kentucky),
      KY**: Christ Church Cathedral is located in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky is
      a state in the eastern United States, north of Tennessee and south of Ohio,
      Indiana, and Illinois.


      3. **Determine the geographical relationship**: To determine if Cobb Energy
      Performing Arts Centre, GA, is west of Christ Church Cathedral, KY, we need
      to understand the general geography of the United States. Georgia is generally
      southeast of Kentucky. When considering the east-west axis, Kentucky is generally
      west of Georgia, but not significantly so in a north-south context. However,
      considering the specific locations within these states, we must note that "west
      of" implies that Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre would need to be to the
      west of Christ Church Cathedral on a map.


      4. **Final analysis**: Given the geography, Georgia (where Cobb Energy Performing
      Arts Centre is located) is generally southeast of Kentucky (where Christ Church
      Cathedral is located). Therefore, it is unlikely that Cobb Energy Performing
      Arts Centre, GA, would be west of Christ Church Cathedral, KY, because Georgia
      is more to the east and south of Kentucky.


      Based on the geographical relationship and the fact that Georgia is southeast
      of Kentucky, the answer is: **NO**'

      Arizona.


      2. **Identify the Location of Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, AZ**: Palo
      Verde Nuclear Generating Station is located in Arizona, also in the southwestern
      part of the United States. Arizona is a state that borders Utah.


      3. **Compare Geographical Positions**: To be "west" of a location, the subject
      would need to be positioned to the west of that location on a map. In this case,
      Navajo Lake in Utah is generally north of Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station
      in Arizona.


      Given these considerations, since Navajo Lake in Utah is generally north of
      Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona, it cannot be west of the nuclear
      power plant.

      \ the locations of both Camanche Reservoir, CA, and Charles E. Nelson House,\
      \ OR, and then compare their geographical positions.\n\n1. **Identify Locations**:\
      \ First, we need to identify the locations of both Camanche Reservoir and Charles\
      \ E. Nelson House. Camanche Reservoir is located in California, specifically\
      \ in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Charles E. Nelson House is located in Oregon,\
      \ more specifically in Portland.\n\n2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next,\
      \ we determine their geographic positions. Camanche Reservoir is situated in\
      \ the western United States, in the state of California. Charles E. Nelson House\
      \ is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, in the state\
      \ of Oregon.\n\n3. **Compare Longitudes**: To determine if one is west of the\
      \ other, we compare their longitudes. Generally, the farther west a location\
      \ is, the higher its longitude. \n\n4. **Camanche Reservoir Longitude**: Camanche\

      \ W (Camanche Reservoir) is east of 122.7\xB0 W (Charles E. Nelson House), this\
      \ implies that Camanche Reservoir is located east of Charles E. Nelson House.\n\

      1. **Identify the location of Camanche Reservoir, CA**: Camanche Reservoir is
      located in the Sierra Nevada foothills of Northern California.


      2. **Identify the location of Charles E. Nelson House, OR**: The Charles E.
      Nelson House is located in Eugene, Oregon, which is in the western part of the
      state.


      3. **Understand the geographical relationship**: California is generally south
      of Oregon. Eugene, where the Charles E. Nelson House is located, is in the western
      part of Oregon, close to the Pacific Ocean. The Sierra Nevada foothills, where
      Camanche Reservoir is located, are in the eastern part of California.


      4. **Final analysis**: Given the geographical relationship, California is generally
      south of Oregon, and Eugene, Oregon, is in the western part of the state. Therefore,
      Camanche Reservoir in California is not west of Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon.
      Instead, it is more south or southeast of the house.

      to consider their geographical locations and compare their positions.


      1. **Identify Locations**: Both the Basilica of Regina Pacis and the HERE Arts
      Center are located in New York. New York is a state in the northeastern United
      States.


      2. **Understand Geographical Directions**: Within the context of New York City,
      the HERE Arts Center is located in Manhattan, which is an island borough of
      New York City. The Basilica of Regina Pacis is located in Brooklyn, another
      borough of New York City.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Manhattan is generally north of Brooklyn in the context
      of New York City''s layout. To be "west" of a location, the subject would need
      to be positioned to the west of that location on a map.


      Given these considerations, since Manhattan (where the HERE Arts Center is located)
      is generally north of Brooklyn (where the Basilica of Regina Pacis is located),
      the basilica cannot be west of the arts center.


      Therefore, the answer to whether the Basilica of Regina Pacis, NY is located

      and then compare their positions in relation to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of the Basilica of Regina Pacis, NY**: The Basilica
      of Regina Pacis is located in Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn is one of the five
      boroughs of New York City.


      2. **Identify the location of HERE Arts Center, NY**: The HERE Arts Center is

      3. **Compare the geographical positions**: To be "west" of a location, the subject
      would need to be positioned to the west of that location on a map.


      4. **Final analysis**: Given the geographical layout of New York City, Brooklyn
      is generally southeast of Manhattan. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Basilica
      of Regina Pacis, located in Brooklyn, would be west of the HERE Arts Center,

      Church in Jackson, Mississippi, and then compare their positions in relation

      1. **Identify the location of House on the Rock, WI**: House on the Rock is
      located in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Wisconsin is a state in the north-central
      United States.


      2. **Identify the location of First Presbyterian Church (Jackson, Mississippi),

      is a state in the southern United States, bordered by Tennessee to the north,
      Alabama to the east, and Louisiana to the west.


      3. **Determine the geographical relationship**: To determine if House on the

      the general geography of the United States. Wisconsin is generally north of
      Mississippi, but not significantly so in a north-south context. However, considering

      3. **Determine the geographical relationship**: To determine if the Cathedral
      of Saint Peter in Belleville, Illinois, is west of the Cathedral of the Immaculate
      Conception in Memphis, Tennessee, we need to understand the general geography
      of the United States. Illinois is generally north of Tennessee. When considering
      the east-west axis, Tennessee is generally west of Illinois, but not significantly
      so in a north-south context. However, considering the specific locations within
      these states, we must note that "west of" implies that the Cathedral of Saint
      Peter would need to be to the west of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception
      on a map.


      4. **Final analysis**: Given the geography, Illinois (where the Cathedral of
      Saint Peter is located) is generally north of Tennessee (where the Cathedral
      of the Immaculate Conception is located). Therefore, it is unlikely that the
      Cathedral of Saint Peter, IL, would be west of the Cathedral of the Immaculate
      Conception, TN, because Illinois is more to the north of Tennessee.


      Based on the geographical relationship and the fact that Illinois is north of
      Tennessee, the answer is: **NO**'
