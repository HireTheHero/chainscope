      - Beech Fork Lake is in West Virginia

      - Boone Lake is in Tennessee


      2) Let me consider the general geography:

      - West Virginia is north and east of Tennessee

      - Tennessee''s eastern border touches western North Carolina and Virginia

      - West Virginia''s western border touches Kentucky and Ohio

      1. First, let me recall the locations of these churches:

      - All Souls Church, Unitarian is located at 1500 Harvard Street NW

      - Foundry United Methodist Church is located at 1500 16th Street NW


      2. In Washington DC''s grid system:

      - Harvard Street runs east-west

      - 16th Street runs north-south


      3. Comparing their positions:

      - All Souls is near 16th Street, but slightly east of it

      - Foundry is directly on 16th Street


      4. Therefore, since All Souls is east of 16th Street, and Foundry is on 16th
      Street, All Souls must be east (not west) of Foundry.


      NO'
