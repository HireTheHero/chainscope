      \ by step. The question is: **Is Lake Onalaska, MN located west of Mammy's Cupboard,\
      \ MS?**\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\nFirst, I need to identify where\
      \ Lake Onalaska, MN, and Mammy's Cupboard, MS, are located.\n\n- **Lake Onalaska,\
      \ MN**: I know that MN stands for Minnesota, which is in the northern part of\
      \ the United States, near Canada.\n- **Mammy's Cupboard, MS**: MS stands for\
      \ Mississippi, which is in the southern part of the United States, along the\
      \ Gulf Coast.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Geography\nNext, I need to understand\
      \ the relative positions of Minnesota and Mississippi in terms of east and west.\n\
      \nLooking at a map of the United States:\n- Minnesota is located in the upper\
      \ Midwest.\n- Mississippi is located in the southeastern part of the country.\n\
      \nFrom this, it seems that Minnesota is generally north of Mississippi, but\
      \ I need to determine if Lake Onalaska, MN, is specifically west of Mammy's\
      \ Cupboard, MS.\n\n### Step 3: Find Specific Locations\nTo be more precise,\
      \ I should locate Lake Onalaska in Minnesota and Mammy's Cupboard in Mississippi.\n\
      \n- **Lake Onalaska, MN**: After a quick search, I find that Lake Onalaska is\
      \ a city in Winona County, Minnesota. It's situated in the southeastern part\
      \ of Minnesota, near the Mississippi River.\n- **Mammy's Cupboard, MS**: Mammy's\
      \ Cupboard is a historic restaurant located in Natchez, Mississippi. Natchez\
      \ is in the southwestern part of Mississippi, also near the Mississippi River.\n\
      \n### Step 4: Compare Longitudes\nSince the question is about east-west positioning,\
      \ I need to compare the longitudes of these two locations. Longitude measures\
      \ how far east or west a location is.\n\nAfter checking:\n- **Lake Onalaska,\
      \ MN**: Approximately 91.5\xB0 W longitude.\n- **Mammy's Cupboard, MS**: Approximately\
      \ 91.4\xB0 W longitude.\n\nWait a minute, both are around 91 degrees west longitude.\
      \ That means they are almost at the same longitude, with Lake Onalaska being\
      \ slightly more west (91.5\xB0 W compared to 91.4\xB0 W).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\
      Given that Lake Onalaska, MN, has a longitude of approximately 91.5\xB0 W and\
      \ Mammy's Cupboard, MS, has a longitude of approximately 91.4\xB0 W, Lake Onalaska\

      \ step by step to determine whether Sacred Heart Cathedral in Rochester, New\
      \ York, is located west of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir in Pennsylvania.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to clearly identify the\
      \ two locations in question:\n\n1. **Sacred Heart Cathedral, Rochester, New\
      \ York**\n2. **Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, Pennsylvania**\n\n### Step 2:\
      \ Understand the Geographical Positions\n\nTo determine if one location is west\
      \ of the other, I need to understand their respective geographical positions,\
      \ specifically their longitudes since east-west positioning is determined by\
      \ longitude.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Coordinates\n\nI'll start by finding the\
      \ approximate coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each location.\n\n**Sacred\
      \ Heart Cathedral, Rochester, NY:**\nI recall that Rochester is located in western\
      \ New York, near Lake Ontario. A quick search confirms that Rochester's approximate\
      \ coordinates are:\n- Latitude: 43.1610\xB0 N\n- Longitude: 77.6109\xB0 W\n\n\
      **Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, PA:**\nI'm less familiar with this location,\
      \ but I know it's in Pennsylvania. Searching for its coordinates, I find that\
      \ the reservoir is located near Howard, PA. Its approximate coordinates are:\n\
      - Latitude: 41.0135\xB0 N\n- Longitude: 77.6792\xB0 W\n\n### Step 4: Compare\
      \ the Longitudes\n\nNow, I'll compare the longitudes of both locations to determine\
      \ their east-west positioning.\n\n- **Sacred Heart Cathedral, Rochester, NY:**\
      \ Longitude = 77.6109\xB0 W\n- **Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, PA:** Longitude\
      \ = 77.6792\xB0 W\n\nIn terms of longitude, a higher numerical value indicates\
      \ a position further west. So, comparing 77.6109\xB0 W and 77.6792\xB0 W:\n\n\
      77.6109\xB0 W < 77.6792\xB0 W\n\nThis means that Sacred Heart Cathedral has\
      \ a smaller longitude value than Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, indicating\
      \ that it is located further east.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nSince Sacred\
      \ Heart Cathedral in Rochester, NY, has a smaller longitude (77.6109\xB0 W)\
      \ compared to Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir in PA (77.6792\xB0 W), it is located\
      \ to the east of the reservoir.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is NO, Sacred Heart\

      \ The goal is to determine whether the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception\
      \ in Tyler, Texas, is located west of the Wortham Theater Center in Texas. To\
      \ answer this, I'll need to find the geographical locations of both places and\
      \ compare their longitudes, since longitude determines east-west positioning.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception\
      \ (Tyler, Texas):**\n- **City:** Tyler\n- **State:** Texas\n\n**Wortham Theater\
      \ Center:**\n- **City:** Houston\n- **State:** Texas\n\nSo, we're comparing\
      \ two locations within Texas: Tyler and Houston.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Coordinates\
      \ of Both Locations\n\nTo determine which is further west, we need the longitude\
      \ of each location. The location with the more negative longitude is further\
      \ west.\n\n**Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Tyler, Texas):**\n- **Address:**\
      \ 423 S Broadway Ave, Tyler, TX 75702\n- **Coordinates:** Approximately 32.3496\xB0\
      \ N, 95.3010\xB0 W\n\n**Wortham Theater Center (Houston, Texas):**\n- **Address:**\
      \ 501 Texas Ave, Houston, TX 77002\n- **Coordinates:** Approximately 29.7604\xB0\
      \ N, 95.3698\xB0 W\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's look\
      \ at the longitudes:\n\n- **Tyler (Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception):**\
      \ 95.3010\xB0 W\n- **Houston (Wortham Theater Center):** 95.3698\xB0 W\n\nIn\
      \ terms of longitude, the more negative the number, the further west the location\
      \ is. Here, 95.3698\xB0 W is more negative than 95.3010\xB0 W.\n\n### Step 4:\
      \ Determine Which Location is Further West\n\nSince 95.3698\xB0 W (Houston)\
      \ is more negative than 95.3010\xB0 W (Tyler), the Wortham Theater Center in\
      \ Houston is further west than the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in\
      \ Tyler.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the Cathedral of the Immaculate\

      1. **Locate Griffy Lake**: Griffy Lake is a small reservoir located in Bloomington,
      Indiana, which is in the southern part of the state. Bloomington is approximately
      50 miles south of Indianapolis.


      2. **Locate Lake Monroe**: Lake Monroe is also located in southern Indiana,

    f14b13e9-5284-4a04-8f4e-28754a97fd98: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of the Comedy Theatre and the Gaiety Theatre in New York City
      and compare their positions relative to each other.


      ### Step 1: Identify the locations of the theatres.

      - **Comedy Theatre (New York City)**: This theatre is located at 110 West 41st
      Street, New York, NY.

      - **Gaiety Theatre (New York City)**: This theatre was located at 1547 Broadway,
      New York, NY.


      ### Step 2: Compare the addresses.

      - The Comedy Theatre is on West 41st Street, which is south of Times Square.

      - The Gaiety Theatre was on Broadway, near Times Square.


      ### Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - Broadway runs diagonally through Manhattan, but generally, addresses on Broadway
      increase as you move north.

      - West 41st Street is south of the area where the Gaiety Theatre was located
      (1547 Broadway is around 45th Street).


      ### Step 4: Conclusion.

      Since the Comedy Theatre is on West 41st Street and the Gaiety Theatre was on
      Broadway near 45th Street, the Comedy Theatre is **south** of the Gaiety Theatre,
      not west.
