      2. Then I''ll locate Wortham Theater Center

      3. I''ll determine their relative positions (east/west)


      After carefully checking their geographic locations:

      - Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is in Tyler, Texas

      - Wortham Theater Center is actually in Houston, Texas

      - These are in different cities, quite far apart


      Since they are in different cities, their relative east/west positioning becomes
      less meaningful.


      However, based on their actual city locations:

      - Tyler is east of Houston

      - So the Cathedral would be east of the Wortham Theater Center


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Theodore Roosevelt Lake and Blue Ridge Reservoir on a
      map of Arizona.


      2. Theodore Roosevelt Lake is located in central Arizona, in Gila County, east
      of Phoenix.


      3. Blue Ridge Reservoir is also located in Gila County, in the Mogollon Rim
      area.


      4. Looking at the precise geographic locations, Blue Ridge Reservoir is located
      northwest of Theodore Roosevelt Lake.


      5. Since Blue Ridge Reservoir is northwest of Theodore Roosevelt Lake, Theodore
      Roosevelt Lake is located southeast of Blue Ridge Reservoir.


      6. This means Theodore Roosevelt Lake is NOT west of Blue Ridge Reservoir.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
