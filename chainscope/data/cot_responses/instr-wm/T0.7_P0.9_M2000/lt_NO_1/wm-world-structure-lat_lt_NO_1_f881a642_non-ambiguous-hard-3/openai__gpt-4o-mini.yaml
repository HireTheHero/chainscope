      is located south of St Mark''s Church, Darling Point, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: We need to find the geographical locations of both
      Windy Hill Wind Farm and St Mark''s Church, Darling Point.


      2. **Locate St Mark''s Church, Darling Point**: This church is located in Darling
      Point, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, situated on the eastern side of Sydney
      Harbour.


      3. **Locate Windy Hill Wind Farm**: Windy Hill Wind Farm is located in Victoria,
      Australia, specifically near the town of Yarram.


      4. **Determine Relative Position**: Now that we have the locations, we need
      to understand their relative positions. St Mark''s Church in Darling Point (Sydney)
      is in the eastern part of Australia, while the Windy Hill Wind Farm (Yarram,
      Victoria) is located to the south-east of Sydney.


      5. **Assess Direction**: Since Windy Hill Wind Farm is located in Victoria and
      is generally to the south of Sydney, it would be south of St Mark''s Church
      in Darling Point.


      After considering these points, we conclude:


      **YES**, Windy Hill Wind Farm is located south of St Mark''s Church, Darling
      Point.'
