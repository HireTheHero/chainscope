      2. **Locate Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim:** The Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is
      also located in Pyongyang, North Korea.  Specifically, it''s on the location
      of his execution.


      3. **Determine relative locations:**  Information suggests the Shrine is in
      the Munsu-dong district of Pyongyang, northeast of the city center.  Ryanggang
      Hotel is closer to the city center. Pyongyang is generally laid out with important
      structures oriented around the Taedong River, which flows roughly southwest
      to northeast.  Therefore, structures further from the city center in the Munsu-dong
      area are likely to be north or east of those in the center.



      4. **Conclusion:** Ryanggang Hotel is likely north-west or west of the Shrine,
      and therefore *not* south of it.

      2. **Locate Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim:** The Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is
      also in Pyongyang, North Korea.  Specifically, it''s on Munsu Hill.

      3. **Pyongyang Layout:** Pyongyang generally stretches north-south along the
      Taedong River.  Munsu Hill is in the eastern part of the city.  Thinking about
      the layout, locations further "up" the river are considered north.

      4. **Relative Positions:** I need more specific information to determine the
      north-south relationship between these two locations within Pyongyang.  General
      knowledge of the city layout isn''t enough.  Online searching suggests Ryanggang
      Hotel is near the train station, which is generally south of Munsu Hill.


      **Answer: YES** (Likely, but further confirmation with a map would be ideal.  My
      reasoning suggests it, but I lack definitive proof based on common knowledge.)
