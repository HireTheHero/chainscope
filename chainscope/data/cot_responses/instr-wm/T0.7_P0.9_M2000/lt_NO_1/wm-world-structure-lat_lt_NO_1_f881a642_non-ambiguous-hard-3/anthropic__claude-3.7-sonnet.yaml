      of St. Joseph in Bronxville, New York and Halse Hall, and then compare their
      positions to see if the church is south of Halse Hall.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville, New York.

      The Church of St. Joseph is located in Bronxville, New York, USA. Bronxville
      is in Westchester County, New York, which is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Halse Hall.

      Halse Hall is a historic great house located in Clarendon, Jamaica. Jamaica
      is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of these locations.

      New York is located in the northern hemisphere, roughly between 40-45 degrees
      north latitude.

      Jamaica is also in the northern hemisphere, but much further south, at approximately
      18 degrees north latitude.


      Step 4: Determine which is further south.

      Since Jamaica (where Halse Hall is located) has a lower latitude than New York
      (where the Church of St. Joseph is located), Jamaica is further south.


      Therefore, the Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville, New York is NOT south of
      Halse Hall, but rather north of it.

      question.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville, New York.

      - Bronxville is in New York State, USA, which is in North America.

      - Specifically, Bronxville is in Westchester County, just north of New York
      City.

      - This places the Church of St. Joseph at approximately 40-41 degrees north
      latitude.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Halse Hall.

      - Halse Hall is a historic great house located in Clarendon, Jamaica.

      - Jamaica is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea.

      - Jamaica is located at approximately 18 degrees north latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes to determine which is further south.

      - Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville is at approximately 40-41 degrees north
      latitude.

      - Halse Hall in Jamaica is at approximately 18 degrees north latitude.

      - A lower north latitude indicates a more southern position.

      - Since 18 degrees north is lower than 40-41 degrees north, Halse Hall is further
      south.


      NO, Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville, New York is NOT located south of Halse

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - Kalmar Cathedral is located in Kalmar, Sweden, which is in southern Sweden.

      - Madonna della Ceriola is a church/sanctuary located on Monte Isola, an island
      in Lake Iseo in northern Italy.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      Europe.

      - Sweden, even its southern parts, is significantly further north than northern
      Italy.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Sweden is north of Italy, and Kalmar is in Sweden while Madonna della
      Ceriola is in Italy, Kalmar Cathedral must be north of Madonna della Ceriola.

      - If Kalmar Cathedral is north of Madonna della Ceriola, it cannot be south

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both structures.

      - Enguri Dam is located in Georgia (the country), in the Caucasus region.

      - The Ethiopian Parliament Building is located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in
      East Africa.


      Step 2: Let me determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Georgia is located roughly between 41-43 degrees North latitude.

      - Ethiopia is located roughly between 3-15 degrees North latitude.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Georgia is significantly further north than Ethiopia.

      - Therefore, Enguri Dam (in Georgia) is north of the Ethiopian Parliament Building
      (in Ethiopia), not south.


      NO, Enguri Dam is not located south of the Ethiopian Parliament Building. It
      is located north of it.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both dams.

      - Khanpur Dam is located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northern Pakistan.

      - Mirani Dam is located in Balochistan province in southwestern Pakistan.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - Northern Pakistan is above (north of) southwestern Pakistan.

      - Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is in the northern part of Pakistan.

      - Balochistan is in the southwestern part of Pakistan.


      Step 3: Determine their north-south relationship.

      - Since Khanpur Dam is in northern Pakistan and Mirani Dam is in southwestern
      Pakistan, Khanpur Dam must be north of Mirani Dam.

      - Therefore, Khanpur Dam is NOT south of Mirani Dam.

      Reservoir and Sai Ying Pun Community Complex, and then compare their relative
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Bratsk Reservoir.

      Bratsk Reservoir is located in Russia, specifically in Siberia. It was created
      by the Bratsk Dam on the Angara River. It is located in the northern hemisphere,
      in the southern part of Siberia.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Sai Ying Pun Community Complex.

      Sai Ying Pun Community Complex is located in Hong Kong, specifically in the
      Sai Ying Pun district on Hong Kong Island. Hong Kong is in the northern hemisphere,
      in East Asia.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine which is further south.

      Russia (including Siberia where Bratsk Reservoir is located) is generally much
      further north than Hong Kong. Bratsk Reservoir is located at approximately 55-56
      degrees north latitude, while Hong Kong is located at about 22 degrees north
      latitude.


      Since a lower latitude number in the northern hemisphere means further south,
      Hong Kong (and thus Sai Ying Pun Community Complex) is significantly further
      south than Bratsk Reservoir in Russia.


      Therefore, Bratsk Reservoir is NOT located south of Sai Ying Pun Community Complex.
      In fact, it''s the opposite - Bratsk Reservoir is located north of Sai Ying
      Pun Community Complex.

      - Polgolla Barrage is a dam/water control structure in Sri Lanka, specifically
      in the central highlands of Sri Lanka.


      Step 2: Determine their relative geographic positions.

      - Andhra Pradesh is located on the southeastern coast of India.

      - Sri Lanka is an island nation located south of India, separated by the Palk
      Strait.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Andhra Pradesh (and its Secretariat) is located in India, which is entirely
      north of Sri Lanka.

      - Polgolla Barrage is in central Sri Lanka.

      - Therefore, Andhra Pradesh Secretariat must be north of Polgolla Barrage.


      NO, the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat is not located south of Polgolla Barrage.
      It is located north of it.'

      of Ryanggang Hotel and the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Ryanggang Hotel is located.

      Ryanggang Hotel is located in Pyongyang, North Korea.


      Step 2: Let me identify where the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is located.

      The Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is located in Sinuiju, North Korea, near the
      border with China.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Pyongyang is in the southwestern part of North Korea.

      Sinuiju is in the northwestern part of North Korea, near the border with China.

      This means Sinuiju (where the shrine is) is north of Pyongyang (where the hotel
      is).


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      If the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is north of Ryanggang Hotel, then Ryanggang
      Hotel is south of the Shrine.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me verify the locations again:


      Ryanggang Hotel is indeed in Pyongyang, which is in the southwestern part of
      North Korea.

      The Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is in Sinuiju, which is in the northwestern part
      of North Korea.


      When comparing their positions, Sinuiju is north of Pyongyang. Therefore, the
      Ryanggang Hotel (in Pyongyang) is south of the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim (in
      Sinuiju).


      YES.'
