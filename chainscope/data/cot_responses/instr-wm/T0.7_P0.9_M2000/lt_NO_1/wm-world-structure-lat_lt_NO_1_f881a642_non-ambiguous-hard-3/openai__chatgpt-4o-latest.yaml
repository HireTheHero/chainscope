      2. Identify the location of the Denver Federal Center.

      3. Compare their relative positions to determine if Chestermere Lake is south

      Step 1: Chestermere Lake is located in the city of Chestermere, in the province

      2. **South Gippsland Freeway**: This freeway is located in the state of Victoria,
      Australia, and serves the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne. Melbourne is located
      in the southeastern part of the country.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - Brisbane is located significantly farther north than Melbourne.

      - Therefore, any road in Brisbane, including the Inner City Bypass, is located
      **north** of any road in Melbourne, including the South Gippsland Freeway.


      So, the Inner City Bypass in Brisbane is **not** south of the South Gippsland
      Freeway.
