      1. First, locate Isabella County, MI:

      - Isabella County is in central Michigan, in the lower peninsula

      - It is located in the central part of the state, north of Lansing


      2. Next, locate Iberville Parish, LA:

      - Iberville Parish is in southeastern Louisiana

      - It is located along the Mississippi River, south of Baton Rouge


      3. Compare their geographic positions:

      - Isabella County is in Michigan (northern US)

      - Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (southern US)

      - Michigan is geographically north of Louisiana


      4. Conclusion:

      - Since Isabella County is in northern Michigan and Iberville Parish is in southern

      1. First, I''ll locate Wetzel County, WV (West Virginia)

      - This county is in northern West Virginia

      - Specifically, it''s in the northern part of the state, near the Ohio River


      2. Next, I''ll locate Indian River County, FL (Florida)

      - This county is on the east coast of Florida

      - It''s in the southeastern part of the state


      3. Now, I''ll compare their geographical positions

      - West Virginia is north of Florida

      - Wetzel County is even further north in West Virginia

      - Indian River County is in southern Florida


      4. So when comparing their positions:

      - Wetzel County is much further north

      - Indian River County is much further south


      5. Therefore, Wetzel County is NOT south of Indian River County


      The answer is: NO'
