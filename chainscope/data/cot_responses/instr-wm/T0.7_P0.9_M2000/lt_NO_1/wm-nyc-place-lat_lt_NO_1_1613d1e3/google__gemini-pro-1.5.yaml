      While "Cafe Metro" appears to be a generic name and may have had several locations,
      a search for "Cafe Metro Brooklyn" suggests its main location was indeed in
      downtown Brooklyn.  Downtown Brooklyn is a relatively small area.  It''s highly
      likely that any Cafe Metro in Brooklyn would be very near the courthouse, and
      not significantly north or south of it.


      Therefore, without a *specific* address for a *specific* Cafe Metro, it''s difficult
      to give a definitive answer.  However, given the close proximity of businesses
      in Downtown Brooklyn, it''s unlikely one would be significantly south of the
      other.  I''d lean towards NO, but with the caveat that a specific address for
      Cafe Metro could change this.

      to find the locations of CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4 and CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP
      4 BUILDING 5, both in the Bronx.  It''s likely these are parts of the same overall
      facility.


      2. **Determine relative position:**  "Building 5" suggests a numbering system
      within the Claremont Rehab Group 4 complex.  Buildings within a complex are
      often numbered sequentially based on location or construction order.  It''s
      unlikely that a lower numbered building (Group 4, implicitly "Building something
      less than 5") would be south of a higher numbered building (Building 5) within
      the same complex.


      3. **Consider alternative interpretations:** Could "Group 4" refer to a separate
      building or area altogether?  While possible, the shared name "Claremont Rehab"
      strongly suggests they are related and likely on the same property or very close
      by.


      4. **Conclusion:**  Based on the naming convention, it''s highly probable that
      CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4 is *not* located south of CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING
      5.

      is above a southern part of Queens. Ideally, more specific addresses would be
      needed to be 100% certain. However, given the general locations, it''s highly
      probable.

      at 2727 West 23rd Street, Brooklyn, NY 11224.


      2. **Compare the latitudes of the two locations.**  Lower latitude values correspond
      to locations further south. Fourth Avenue is in Park Slope, and West 23rd Street
      is in Coney Island.  Coney Island is generally south of Park Slope.


      3. **Determine the relative north/south positions.**  Since Coney Island is
      south of Park Slope, Coney Island Prep High School is south of Church of the
      Resurrection.


      NO.

      the locations of Resurrection Church and Coney Island Prep High School in Brooklyn.

      2. **Compare latitudes:** Once I have the locations, I need to compare their
      latitudes. The location further south will have a lower latitude.

      3. **Determine south/north:** If Resurrection Church has a lower latitude than
      Coney Island Prep, the answer is YES. If Resurrection Church has a higher latitude,
      the answer is NO.


      Using a search engine:


      * Resurrection Church, Brooklyn (multiple locations exist, assuming the most
      prominent one based on search results) appears to be in the Sunset Park/Bensonhurst
      area.

      * Coney Island Prep High School appears to be in, well, Coney Island.


      Coney Island is generally the southernmost part of Brooklyn.  Sunset Park/Bensonhurst
      is further north.


      Therefore, Resurrection Church is NOT south of Coney Island Prep.


      NO

      Since both are on East Tremont Avenue, and the street numbers increase going
      east (and often north), Middletown Plaza, having a higher street number, is
      likely east and possibly slightly north of West Farms Library.

      the precise locations of both the Bronx CC Greenhouse and the Bronx CC Student
      Center Annex.  A map or online search specifically for Bronx Community College
      would be helpful.


      2. **Compare latitudes:** Once I have the locations, I need to compare their
      latitudes. The location further south will have a lower latitude value.


      3. **Determine south/north:** If the Bronx CC Greenhouse has a lower latitude
      than the Bronx CC Student Center Annex, it is south of the Annex.


      (I do not have access to real-time information like maps.  I need that information
      to give a definitive answer.)


      Assuming I have access to a map and find the information, and the Greenhouse
      is indeed south of the Student Center Annex, then the answer is YES. Otherwise,
      NO.

      * Moore Homestead Playground Handball Court is indeed part of Moore Homestead
      Playground, located around 83rd Ave and 173rd Street.


      Since they are both on 173rd street, and 73rd Ave is west of 83rd Ave, that

      or their cross streets.

      3. **Compare the latitudes:** The location with the smaller latitude value is
      further south. If Washington Houses Building 6 has a smaller latitude than Amsterdam
      Residence, the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer is NO.


      Using online search, I find:


      * **Washington Houses Building 6:**  1890 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10031
      (approximately)

      * **Amsterdam Residence:** 250 W 90th St, New York, NY 10024


      Since these are both on Amsterdam Avenue, I simply need to compare the street
      numbers. 1890 is a higher number than the 200 block of W 90th (which intersects
      Amsterdam Ave). Higher numbers on Amsterdam Ave represent locations further
      north.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.

      3. **Determine the answer:** If Parkside Preparatory Academy has a smaller latitude
      value than Explore Charter School, the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer
      is NO.


      Using online search engines, I find:


      * **Parkside Preparatory Academy:** Located near Ocean Parkway and Church Avenue.

      * **Explore Charter School:** Located on the border of Flatbush and Crown Heights.


      Ocean Parkway and Church Avenue is considerably south of Flatbush/Crown Heights.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

      likely near the Grand Central Parkway. "STEIN SENIOR CENTER" needs more context
      to determine its precise location in Manhattan.


      4. **Compare latitudes:**  Since I can''t look up the precise locations, I cannot
      compare their latitudes. Latitude determines the north/south position.

      Lighthouse numbers often increase as you move further into a waterway or along
      a coastline.  A lower number usually signifies a position closer to the entrance
      or beginning.


      2. **Raritan Bay:**  Raritan Bay is located between Staten Island (NY) and New
      Jersey.  Ships would enter the bay from the ocean and proceed inland.


      3. **Light 42 vs. Light 58:** Since 42 is less than 58, Raritan Bay Light 42
      is likely closer to the entrance of the bay than Light 58. This means Light
      58 would be further inland or further up the bay.


      4. **South vs. North:** As Raritan Bay opens roughly eastward towards the Atlantic,
      progressing "inland" or "up the bay" generally corresponds with moving north.


      Therefore, Raritan Bay Light 42 would be south of Raritan Bay Light 58.

      point of a navigational route. Higher numbers are further downstream or further
      along the route.


      2. **Raritan Bay:**  Both lighthouses are in Raritan Bay. This implies they
      are likely along a similar navigational path.


      3. **Light 42 vs. Light 58:**  42 is a lower number than 58.  This suggests
      Light 42 is likely further "upstream" or closer to the starting point of navigation
      in Raritan Bay than Light 58.  Since Raritan Bay opens southward towards the
      ocean, "upstream" would be north.

      Now, using a search engine or map:


      NYU 7th St Residence Hall is around 7th St and University Place in Greenwich
      Village.

      The Alternate Learning Center (Boys'' Club of New York) appears to be located
      uptown near 110th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem.


      Since Greenwich Village (around 7th St) is significantly south of Harlem (around
