      3) On the Rockaway Peninsula:

      - The Atlantic Ocean is to the south

      - Jamaica Bay is to the north

      - Vernam Basin is on the Jamaica Bay (north) side

      - Ocean Bay Community Center is in the residential area between Jamaica Bay
      and the Atlantic Ocean


      4) Therefore, since Ocean Bay Community Center is south of Jamaica Bay and Vernam
      Basin is part of Jamaica Bay, Ocean Bay Community Center must be south of Vernam
      Basin.


      Answer: YES'
    a182b099-388b-4ce2-9d14-ce75609fcb81: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) VERNAM BASIN is located in the Arverne/Edgemere area of Queens, connecting
      to Jamaica Bay.


      2) OCEAN BAY COMMUNITY CENTER is located in the Ocean Bay (Bayside) Houses development
      in the Far Rockaway neighborhood of Queens.


      3) Looking at the map:

      - Vernam Basin is near Beach 58th Street

      - Ocean Bay Community Center is around Beach 54th Street


      4) Both are in the Rockaways area, but Ocean Bay Community Center is slightly
      east of Vernam Basin.


      5) In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Vernam Basin extends into Jamaica Bay from the shoreline

      - Ocean Bay Community Center is located inland in the housing development

      - The housing development is south of Jamaica Bay


      Therefore, since Ocean Bay Community Center is inland/south of Jamaica Bay,
      and Vernam Basin is part of Jamaica Bay, Ocean Bay Community Center is indeed
      south of Vernam Basin.


      Answer: YES'

      1) First, let me locate these places:

      - Ocean Bay Community Center is located in the Arverne neighborhood of Queens,
      near Beach Channel Drive

      - Vernam Basin is a body of water in Jamaica Bay, located near Arverne and Edgemere


      2) Looking at their relative positions:

      - Ocean Bay Community Center is on the Rockaway Peninsula

      - Vernam Basin is a part of Jamaica Bay that cuts into the northern edge of
      the Rockaway Peninsula


      3) When looking at a map:

      - Ocean Bay Community Center is situated on the main part of the Rockaway Peninsula

      - Vernam Basin is a water inlet that extends south from Jamaica Bay

      - The Community Center is positioned south of where Vernam Basin meets Jamaica

      - Johnson Houses is around 112th Street

      - East Drive over the Loch is around 103rd Street

      2) Looking at their specific locations:

      - THE VILLAGE PRESCHOOL is on Nelson Avenue

      - ATLANTIS MARINA & YACHT CLUB is on Mansion Avenue near Great Kills Harbor


      3) In Great Kills:

      - The marina is right on the waterfront of Great Kills Harbor

      - The preschool is located inland, north of the harbor area

      - Any location on the harbor waterfront would be south of the inland areas

      THE VILLAGE PRESCHOOL must be NORTH of ATLANTIS MARINA & YACHT CLUB

      3. In a typical playground layout, basketball courts and handball courts are
      usually placed adjacent to each other.


      4. Given that these are part of the same "Homestead" facility and the basketball
      courts don''t include "Moore" in their name while the handball court does, it''s
      likely they''re the same facility just with slightly different naming conventions
      in the database.


      5. Since they''re essentially the same facility/location, one cannot be south
      of the other in any meaningful way.

      - Street numbers increase as you go north

      - Therefore, lower street numbers are further south

      - Brooklyn is generally south and west of Queens


      2. Stroud Playground Comfort Station is in Brooklyn

      - This means it''s in the southern borough


      3. August Martin High School is in Queens

      - This means it''s in the northern borough


      4. Given their locations in different boroughs:

      - Since Stroud Playground is in Brooklyn (the southern borough)

      - And August Martin High School is in Queens (the northern borough)

      - A location in Brooklyn would typically be south of a location in Queens


      Therefore: YES, Stroud Playground Comfort Station is located south of August
      Martin High School.'

    8cc40154-fda6-451c-9466-ab029ef35515: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let''s identify the general locations:

      - Dyckman is in upper Manhattan, in the Inwood neighborhood

      - Co-op City is in the northeast Bronx


      2) In terms of north-south orientation:

      - Dyckman Street and its surroundings are in the northernmost part of Manhattan

      - Co-op City is one of the northernmost neighborhoods in the Bronx


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - Co-op City is significantly further north than the Dyckman area

      - Therefore, Dyckman Spanish 7 Day Adventist Church must be south of Co-op City

      2) Thinking about the geography:

      - The Bronx is north of Manhattan

      - Co-op City is in the eastern part of the Bronx

      - Dyckman Street/area is at the northern tip of Manhattan


      3) Therefore:

      - Since Co-op City is in the Bronx (which is north of Manhattan), and Dyckman
      is in upper Manhattan (which is entirely south of the Bronx), the Dyckman church
      must be south of any building in Co-op City.
