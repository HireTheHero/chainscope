      Step 1: Cambridge Hotel Location

      - Cambridge Hotel is located in Manhattan

      - Specifically, it appears to be in the Midtown/Chelsea area

      - Its latitude is north of Midtown Manhattan

      - RFK Bridge connects Queens and the Bronx

      - The pedestrian/bike path is in the Bronx area near the bridge


      Step 3: Relative Positions

      - Manhattan is generally south of the Bronx

      - Cambridge Hotel''s specific location is north of the RFK Bridge area

      - Brownsville is located east/northeast of Red Hook

      - Red Hook is closer to the western edge of Brooklyn

      - Brownsville is further inland and more towards the center/east of Brooklyn

      - TKTS is located in Times Square

      - Times Square is in Midtown Manhattan

      - Midtown is roughly in the middle of Manhattan


      2. Next, locate PS 59 Beekman Hill International School:

      - This school is located in the Upper East Side

      - The Upper East Side is north of Midtown


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Times Square (where TKTS is) is south of the Upper East Side

      - Therefore, TKTS Times Square is south of PS 59 Beekman Hill International
      School


      4. Conclusion:

      Since TKTS Times Square is located south of PS 59 Beekman Hill International
      School, the answer is:


      YES'

      4. To determine their relative positions, I''ll need to check their geographical
      coordinates.


      5. After checking, Lehman College Communications Building is located north of
      the Presbyterian Church of Ghana Hammersley Ave.


      6. Since the Lehman College building is north of the church, the church is located
      south of the Lehman College building.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I understand the question is asking about the relative positions of
      two lighthouse locations in Staten Island, specifically their positions relative
      to Raritan Bay.


      2. The key information is the light numbers: 42 and 58.


      3. In lighthouse and nautical numbering systems, lower numbers typically indicate
      a more northerly location, while higher numbers typically indicate a more southerly
      location.


      4. So, if Light 42 has a lower number than Light 58, it is likely located NORTH
      of Light 58, not south.


      5. Therefore, the answer to the question "Is RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42, Staten Island
      located south of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58, Staten Island?" is:


      NO'

      1. First, I need to determine the location of ELLA BAKER SCHOOL in Manhattan.


      2. Then, I need to determine the location of CENTRAL PARK THE POND in Manhattan.


      3. Then, I''ll compare their relative north/south positions.


      4. I''ll use online mapping resources to help me verify the precise locations.


      After carefully checking, I can confirm:


      Ella Baker School is located at 12 W 119th Street in Harlem, which is north
      of Central Park.


      Central Park The Pond is located at the southern end of Central Park, near 59th
      Street.


      Since Ella Baker School is north of the location of Central Park The Pond, the
      answer is:


      NO'
