      or inaccurately named. Let''s assume it refers to a location in Manhattan for
      this question.


      2. **Identify the location of the RFK Bridge (Robert F. Kennedy Bridge) Pedestrian

      pedestrian and bike path is located on the section of the bridge that connects
      Manhattan to the Bronx.


      3. **Determine the relative positions:** The RFK Bridge connects Manhattan at
      125th Street in Harlem, extending north to the Bronx. Therefore, anything in
      Manhattan that is south of 125th Street would be south of the RFK Bridge Pedestrian
      and Bike path.

      OV OCEAN PKWY is south of BAY FAMILY CENTER in Brooklyn, we need to consider
      their relative locations.


      1. **Location of BELT SHORE PKW BR OV OCEAN PKWY**: This location refers to
      where the Belt Parkway, a major highway in Brooklyn, crosses over Ocean Parkway.
      The Belt Parkway runs along the southern edge of Brooklyn, near the coast, and
      Ocean Parkway is a north-south thoroughfare that runs from Prospect Park to
      the southern edge of Brooklyn at Brighton Beach.


      2. **Location of BAY FAMILY CENTER**: The Bay Family Center is located at 1757
      Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn, NY. However, if we assume "Bay Family Center" refers
      to a location near where the Bay Parkway runs through neighborhoods like Bensonhurst
      or Gravesend, it is not directly on Ocean Parkway but is relatively central
      or north compared to the Belt Parkway.


      3. **Comparison**: The Belt Parkway, particularly where it intersects Ocean
      Parkway, is situated toward the southernmost parts of Brooklyn, closer to neighborhoods
      like Brighton Beach and Coney Island. In contrast, Bay Parkway and its associated
      locations, like where a family center might be, are generally further north
      than the Belt Parkway.


      With this information:


      The BELT SHORE PKW BR OV OCEAN PKWY is indeed located south of BAY FAMILY CENTER
      by the nature of the Belt Parkway''s southern route through Brooklyn.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      named Hope Garden would need to be specifically identified to compare.


      Given the lack of specific identifiers for Hope Garden within the context of
      Manhattan and without a map reference, I can''t definitively determine its position
      relative to Stanton Street Courts. Therefore, I recommend consulting a detailed
      map of Manhattan to accurately compare the two locations.

      the Dongan Hills area, which is further inland compared to Stapleton. Stapleton,
      where Independence Park is located, is closer to the waterfront and generally
      considered southeast of Dongan Hills.


      Based on this understanding of the locations:


      - Independence Park is southeast of PS 11 Thomas Dongan.

      Thomas Dongan is:


      **NO**'

      numbers typically start at the beginning of the channel or waterway, and higher
      numbers are found further along the route.


      2. **Positioning in Raritan Bay**: Raritan Bay is situated between Staten Island,
      New York, and the northern coast of New Jersey. The numbering of navigational
      aids in the bay usually follows the shipping route from the mouth of the bay
      inward.


      3. **Number Sequence**: If RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42 and RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 are
      numbered sequentially along a common route, LIGHT 42 would typically be found
      earlier along the route than LIGHT 58. This suggests that LIGHT 42 is positioned
      north of LIGHT 58, assuming the route goes from north to south.

      3. **Research Positions**: Without specific longitude and latitude data or a
      nautical chart detailing the exact locations of these lights, we rely on typical
      navigation practices. In general, higher numbered navigation lights can be positioned
      further along a navigational route, but this is not a strict rule for determining
      north-south positioning.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Common Navigation Patterns**: If we assume a typical

      RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42 and RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58, we need to consider their geographic
      locations in relation to one another.


      1. **Understanding the Naming Convention**: The names "RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42"
      and "RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58" suggest that these are navigational aids (lights)
      in Raritan Bay, which is situated between Staten Island, New York, and the coast
      of New Jersey.


      2. **Geographic Orientation**: Raritan Bay generally runs east to west, with
      its northern shore bordering Staten Island and its southern shore bordering
      New Jersey.


      3. **Numbering System**: In navigational aids, higher numbers are typically
      used for lights or markers that are further from the starting point of a waterway.
      However, the specific numbering system can vary depending on local conventions.


      4. **Researching Specific Locations**: Without specific coordinates or a detailed
      chart of Raritan Bay, we cannot definitively determine the relative positions
      based solely on their names and numbers.


      Given these considerations and without additional geographic data, a precise
      YES or NO answer cannot be conclusively provided based solely on the available
      information. However, if we assume a standard progression where higher numbers
      might indicate a position further along a particular direction, then:


      **Answer**: NO, RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42 is not located south of RARITAN BAY LIGHT
      58 based solely on typical numbering conventions without specific geographic
      data.'

      42 is located south of Raritan Bay Light 58, we need to consider their positions
      relative to each other in Raritan Bay, Staten Island.


      1. **Understanding Raritan Bay Lights:** The lights in Raritan Bay are navigational
      aids. They are numbered sequentially, typically indicating their positions along
      a channel or navigational route. Lower numbered lights are often closer to the
      mouth of the channel, while higher numbers are further in.


      2. **Location of Raritan Bay Light 42 and Light 58:** In navigational terms,
      lower numbers usually start from the mouth of a bay or river and increase as
      they move inland or further along the channel. Therefore, Light 42 would generally
      be positioned before Light 58 when moving from the mouth of the bay inward.


      3. **Geographical Orientation:** Raritan Bay is oriented such that the entrance
      is to the south-southeast, and it extends northward as you move inland. Thus,
      a lower numbered light like 42 would be expected to be closer to the south than
      a higher numbered light like 58.


      Summarizing the above reasoning, Raritan Bay Light 42, being a lower number
      than Light 58, is likely located south of Raritan Bay Light 58.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
