      Bronx is located south of Faith Christian Academy in the Bronx, we need to consider
      the geography of the Bronx and the relative positions of these two locations.


      1. **Geography of the Bronx**: The Bronx is the northernmost of the five boroughs
      of New York City. It''s located north of Manhattan and Queens, and east of the
      Hudson River. The Bronx is divided into several neighborhoods, each with its
      own geography and landmarks.


      2. **Ewen Playground Location**: Ewen Playground is located in the Throggs Neck
      neighborhood of the Bronx. Throggs Neck is in the southeastern part of the borough,
      along the East River and Long Island Sound.


      3. **Faith Christian Academy Location**: The location of Faith Christian Academy
      within the Bronx isn''t specified. Without a specific address, we can only make
      a general guess based on the name of the school and the distribution of schools
      in the Bronx.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Ewen Playground is in the southeastern
      part of the Bronx (Throggs Neck) and Faith Christian Academy''s location is
      unknown, we need to consider the general geography of the Bronx. The Bronx is
      relatively narrow from north to south, so locations in the south are generally
      closer to the southern tip of the borough. However, the exact latitude of Faith
      Christian Academy is needed for a precise determination.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, we can''t definitively
      say whether Ewen Playground is south of Faith Christian Academy. If Faith Christian
      Academy is located in the southern part of the Bronx, it could potentially be
      south of Ewen Playground. However, without a specific address or a more precise
      description of Faith Christian Academy''s location, we can''t make a definitive
      determination. The answer to this question is unknown without more specific
      information.

    a374a49a-6de5-4851-ab20-4c95aede37fa: 'To determine if the Manhattanville Rehabs
      Group 3 Building 1 in Manhattan is located south of the CIDitty Kiddie Pre-K
      Center in the Bronx, we need to consider the general geography of New York City
      and the relative positions of Manhattan and the Bronx, as well as the specific
      locations within these boroughs.


      1. **Manhattan and Bronx Geography**: Manhattan and the Bronx are two of the
      five boroughs of New York City. Manhattan is generally located south of the
      Bronx, but it''s important to note that Manhattan is a long and narrow island,
      so the relative positions of points within these boroughs can vary.


      2. **Manhattanville Rehabs Group 3 Building 1 Location**: The Manhattanville
      Rehabs Group 3 Building 1 is likely located within the Manhattanville neighborhood
      of Manhattan. Manhattanville is in the northern part of Manhattan, near the
      Harlem River.


      3. **CIDitty Kiddie Pre-K Center Location**: The CIDitty Kiddie Pre-K Center
      is located in the Bronx. Without a more specific address, we can assume it''s
      somewhere within the Bronx.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Manhattanville is in the northern part
      of Manhattan and the CIDitty Kiddie Pre-K Center is in the Bronx, we need to
      consider their relative positions. Manhattan is generally south of the Bronx,
      but the specific locations of these two points need to be considered. The Manhattanville
      neighborhood, being more north in Manhattan, and the Bronx, being more north
      overall, means the Manhattanville location could potentially be south or north
      depending on the exact latitude.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the northern location of Manhattanville within Manhattan
      and the general location of the CIDitty Kiddie Pre-K Center within the Bronx,
      it''s reasonable to conclude that the Manhattanville Rehabs Group 3 Building
      1 is likely north of the CIDitty Kiddie Pre-K Center in the Bronx. However,
      the exact determination requires precise latitude comparisons, which aren''t
      provided. Based on general geographic principles, though, we can make an educated
      guess.

      to consider the general geography of New York City and the relative positions
      of Manhattan and the Bronx, as well as the specific locations within these boroughs.


      1. **Manhattan and the Bronx Geography**: Manhattan and the Bronx are two of
      the five boroughs of New York City. Manhattan is located directly south of the
      Bronx. This means that generally, points in Manhattan are south of points in
      the Bronx.


      2. **Cambridge Hotel Location**: The Cambridge Hotel is located in Manhattan,
      most likely in the central or southern part of the borough. Without an exact
      address, we can''t be more specific.


      3. **RFK Bridge Ped and Bike Location**: The RFK Bridge (formerly known as the
      Triborough Bridge) connects Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens. The Ped and Bike
      portion of the bridge is a pathway for pedestrians and cyclists. The specific
      location of the RFK Bridge Ped and Bike in this context is not specified, but
      it could refer to either the Manhattan or Bronx side of the bridge.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Manhattan is directly south of the Bronx,
      and assuming the RFK Bridge Ped and Bike refers to the Bronx side of the bridge,
      we can conclude that the Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan is likely south of the
      RFK Bridge Ped and Bike in the Bronx.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Manhattan
      and the Bronx, and assuming the RFK Bridge Ped and Bike refers to the Bronx
      side of the bridge, the Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan is likely south of the
      RFK Bridge Ped and Bike in the Bronx.

      is located south of the Church of the Epiphany York Ave, both in Manhattan,
      we need to consider the specific locations of these two points within Manhattan
      and their relative positions.


      1. **Manhattan Cruise Terminal Location**: The Manhattan Cruise Terminal is
      located on the west side of Manhattan, along the Hudson River. It''s situated
      in the Hell''s Kitchen neighborhood, which is generally considered to be in
      the midtown area of Manhattan.


      2. **Church of the Epiphany York Ave Location**: The Church of the Epiphany
      York Ave is located in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The Upper
      East Side is generally considered to be the northeastern part of Manhattan.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Manhattan is a long and narrow island, stretching
      north to south. Generally, points on the west side of Manhattan (like the Cruise
      Terminal) are considered to be west of points on the east side (like the Church
      of the Epiphany). However, to determine if one point is south of another, we
      need to consider their relative positions north to south.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Hell''s Kitchen, where the Cruise Terminal is located,
      is generally considered to be in the midtown area of Manhattan. The Upper East
      Side, where the Church of the Epiphany is located, is further north. This means
      that points in Hell''s Kitchen are generally south of points in the Upper East
      Side.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is located in Hell''s
      Kitchen and the Church of the Epiphany York Ave is located in the Upper East
      Side, it''s reasonable to conclude that the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is indeed
      south of the Church of the Epiphany York Ave, both in Manhattan.

      in Manhattan is located south of the Church of the Epiphany York Avenue in Manhattan,
      we need to consider the general geography of Manhattan and the relative positions
      of these two locations within the borough.


      1. **Manhattan Geography**: Manhattan is the central borough of New York City
      and is known for its north-south orientation. It''s divided into several neighborhoods,
      with the northern part generally referred to as "Uptown" and the southern part
      as "Downtown."


      2. **Manhattan Cruise Terminal Location**: The Manhattan Cruise Terminal is
      located on the west side of Manhattan, along the Hudson River. It''s specifically
      situated in the Hell''s Kitchen neighborhood, which is in the midtown area of
      Manhattan, close to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum.


      3. **Church of the Epiphany York Avenue Location**: The Church of the Epiphany
      is located on York Avenue, which is on the east side of Manhattan. Without a
      specific address, we can assume it''s in the Yorkville neighborhood, which is
      in the Upper East Side of Manhattan.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: The Manhattan Cruise Terminal, being in Hell''s
      Kitchen, is in the midtown area of Manhattan. The Church of the Epiphany, likely
      in Yorkville, is in the Upper East Side, which is further north. Generally,
      in Manhattan, locations in the midtown area are south of locations in the Upper
      East Side.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Manhattan and the relative
      positions of Hell''s Kitchen (where the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is located)
      and Yorkville (where the Church of the Epiphany is likely located), it''s reasonable
      to conclude that the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is indeed south of the Church
      of the Epiphany York Avenue in Manhattan.

      the geography of Manhattan and the relative positions of these two locations
      within the borough.


      1. **Manhattan''s Geography**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New
      York City. It''s an island bordered by the Hudson River on the west, the East
      River on the east, and the Harlem River on the northeast.


      2. **Manhattan Cruise Terminal Location**: The Manhattan Cruise Terminal is
      located on the Hudson River, on the west side of Manhattan. It''s in the Hell''s
      Kitchen neighborhood, which is in the midtown west area of Manhattan.


      3. **Church of the Epiphany Location**: The Church of the Epiphany is located
      on York Avenue in Manhattan. York Avenue is a north-south avenue on the east
      side of Manhattan, running parallel to the East River.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Both the Manhattan Cruise Terminal and the Church
      of the Epiphany are on opposite sides of Manhattan. The Cruise Terminal is on
      the west side, while the Church is on the east side. Manhattan is a relatively
      narrow island, so locations on the east side are generally east of those on
      the west side.


      5. **Directional Analysis**: Since the Church of the Epiphany is on the east
      side of Manhattan and the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is on the west side, the
      Church is generally east of the Cruise Terminal. The question asks about a southward
      relationship, which is not applicable in this case.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that the Church of the Epiphany is on the east side
      of Manhattan and the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is on the west side, it''s not
      possible for the Cruise Terminal to be located south of the Church. The two
      locations are on opposite sides of the island.

      in the western part of Queens, near the East River and the Queensboro Bridge.


      2. **Bayside Annex Post Office Location**: The Bayside Annex Post Office is
      located in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens. Bayside is in the northeastern
      part of Queens, closer to the Nassau County border.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Queens is a large borough with diverse neighborhoods.
      Generally, points in the western part of Queens (like Long Island City) are
      south or southwest of points in the northeastern part of Queens (like Bayside).
      However, the exact positions depend on the specific latitude and longitude of
      the locations.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Ravenswood Projects is in the western
      part of Queens and the Bayside Annex Post Office is in the northeastern part
      of Queens, it''s likely that Ravenswood Projects is south of the Bayside Annex
      Post Office. However, without precise coordinates, this can''t be determined
      with absolute certainty.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic principles of Queens and
      the relative positions of the neighborhoods mentioned, it''s reasonable to conclude
      that Ravenswood Projects Building 31 is likely south of the Bayside Annex Post
      Office. However, without exact coordinates, this conclusion is based on the
      typical layout of Queens neighborhoods and their relative positions.


      The final answer is: YES

      Pkwy in Brooklyn is located south of Bay Family Center in Brooklyn, we need
      to consider the geography of Brooklyn and the relative positions of these locations
      within the borough.


      1. **Brooklyn Geography**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York
      City. It''s located in the western part of Long Island. It''s bordered by Queens
      to the northeast, the East River to the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean to the
      south, and the Upper New York Bay to the southwest.


      2. **Belt Shore Pkw Br Ov Ocean Pkwy Location**: "Belt Shore Pkw Br Ov Ocean
      Pkwy" likely refers to a bridge or overpass on the Belt Parkway over Ocean Parkway
      in Brooklyn. The Belt Parkway is a major highway in Brooklyn, and Ocean Parkway
      is a major street running north-south through Brooklyn. The location of the
      overpass would be somewhere along the Belt Parkway where it crosses Ocean Parkway.


      3. **Bay Family Center Location**: "Bay Family Center" is likely a specific
      facility or building in Brooklyn. Without a more specific address, it''s challenging
      to pinpoint its exact location.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: To determine if the overpass is south of the Bay
      Family Center, we need to consider the general layout of Brooklyn and the locations
      of these points. Since we don''t have an exact address for the Bay Family Center,
      we can''t make a precise determination. However, given the general layout of
      Brooklyn and the fact that the Belt Parkway and Ocean Parkway are major thoroughfares,
      it''s likely that the overpass would be in the southern part of Brooklyn. This
      would make it south of many locations in the borough.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the available information and the general geography
      of Brooklyn, it''s reasonable to conclude that Belt Shore Pkw Br Ov Ocean Pkwy
      is likely located south of Bay Family Center. However, without a more specific
      location for the Bay Family Center, this conclusion is based on general geographic

    a7bf1eaf-a388-4d31-8ed3-56a7f87568a9: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two locations to consider - Hillman Houses
      in Manhattan and Williamsburg in Manhattan.


      2. **Understand the geography of NYC**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City. It''s a long, narrow island, with streets running east-west
      and avenues running north-south. The island is divided into various neighborhoods.


      3. **Determine the relative positions of Hillman Houses and Williamsburg**:
      Hillman Houses is located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which is in the
      southeastern part of the island. Williamsburg, on the other hand, is located
      in the northern part of Brooklyn, which is west of Manhattan. However, the question
      specifies that we''re considering Williamsburg in Manhattan, which is a neighborhood
      on the eastern side of the island, just south of the Williamsburg Bridge.


      4. **Analyze the geography of Manhattan**: Manhattan is generally divided into
      Upper Manhattan (north of Central Park), Midtown (Central Park to 34th Street),
      and Lower Manhattan (south of 34th Street). The Lower East Side, where Hillman
      Houses is located, is in Lower Manhattan. Williamsburg in Manhattan is also
      in Lower Manhattan, but slightly north of the Lower East Side.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both Hillman Houses and Williamsburg in Manhattan
      are in Lower Manhattan, and considering the relative positions of these neighborhoods
      within the borough, it''s reasonable to conclude that Hillman Houses is located
      south of Williamsburg in Manhattan.

      Here''s a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Manhattan Geography**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York
      City. It''s a long, narrow island that runs north to south. The northern tip
      of Manhattan is at the southern end of the Hudson River, and the southern tip
      is where the East River meets the Hudson River.


      2. **Hope Garden Location**: Hope Garden is located in the Lower East Side neighborhood

      3. **Stanton Street Courts Location**: Stanton Street Courts is also located
      in the Lower East Side neighborhood, near the intersection of Stanton Street

      4. **Comparing Locations**: Since both Hope Garden and Stanton Street Courts
      are in the Lower East Side, they are relatively close to each other. However,
      the Lower East Side spans a significant area within Manhattan, and we need to
      consider their specific positions within this neighborhood.

      precise relative positions. However, based on the general layout of the Lower
      East Side, it''s likely that Hope Garden is located north of Stanton Street

      and south from the Houston Street area, and Hope Garden is likely located in
      the northern part of the neighborhood.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the information available, it''s reasonable to conclude

      for Health Care and Rehabilitation in Queens is located south of Nova Gotham
      Hotel in Manhattan, we need to consider the geography of New York City and the
      relative positions of Queens and Manhattan.


      1. **Queens and Manhattan Geography**: Queens is located east of Manhattan.
      Manhattan is the central borough of New York City, and Queens is one of the
      outer boroughs. Generally, points in Queens are east or northeast of points
      in Manhattan.

      The Parker Jewish Institute is located in New Hyde Park, which is in the eastern
      part of Queens. It''s relatively east within Queens.

      borough of New York City.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Parker Jewish Institute is in eastern
      Queens and Nova Gotham Hotel is likely in Manhattan, we need to consider their
      relative positions. Queens is generally east or northeast of Manhattan. The

      is located south of PS 32 Samuel Mills Sprole in Brooklyn, we need to consider
      the geography of Brooklyn and the relative positions of these two schools within
      the borough.


      1. **Brooklyn Geography**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York
      City. It''s located in the western part of Long Island and is bordered by Queens
      to the north and east, Manhattan to the northwest, and Staten Island to the
      southwest.

      is in the southern part of the borough. This is because Staten Island has a
      north-south orientation, and locations in the north are generally north of locations
      in the south.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the locations of Egbert Triangle and Footbridge Over
      Brooks Lake Dam within Staten Island, it''s reasonable to conclude that Egbert
      Triangle is likely north of Footbridge Over Brooks Lake Dam. Therefore, the

      Island is located south of Footbridge Over Brooks Lake Dam in Staten Island,
      we need to consider the relative positions of these two locations within Staten
      Island. Here''s a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Understand the geography of Staten Island**: Staten Island is the southernmost
      borough of New York City. It''s generally rectangular in shape, with the northern
      part being more developed and the southern part being more rural and natural.


      2. **Identify the locations**: Egbert Triangle and Footbridge Over Brooks Lake
      Dam are both located in Staten Island. Without more specific information, we
      can assume they are within the same general area.


      3. **Analyze the geography of Staten Island**: Given that Staten Island is the
      southernmost borough, and assuming these locations are within the same general
      area, it''s reasonable to conclude that Egbert Triangle is likely south of Footbridge
      Over Brooks Lake Dam. However, without precise coordinates or a detailed map,
      we can''t be absolutely certain.


      4. **Consider the context**: The names "Egbert Triangle" and "Footbridge Over
      Brooks Lake Dam" don''t provide much information about their specific locations.
      However, the term "triangle" often refers to a small area or intersection, which
      might indicate a more central or northern location within Staten Island. On
      the other hand, "Footbridge Over Brooks Lake Dam" suggests a more natural or
      rural setting, which is typically found in the southern part of Staten Island.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Staten Island and the context
      of the location names, it''s reasonable to conclude that Egbert Triangle is
      likely located south of Footbridge Over Brooks Lake Dam. However, without more
      specific information or a detailed map, we can''t be absolutely certain.

      Island is located south of the Footbridge Over Brooks Lake Dam in Staten Island,
      we need to consider the geography of Staten Island and the relative positions
      of these two locations.


      1. **Staten Island Geography**: Staten Island is one of the five boroughs of
      New York City. It''s the southernmost borough, located south of Manhattan, Brooklyn,
      and Queens. It''s separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill
      Van Kull.


      2. **Egbert Triangle Location**: Egbert Triangle is a small park or triangle
      in Staten Island. Without an exact address or location, it''s difficult to pinpoint
      its position precisely within the borough.


      3. **Footbridge Over Brooks Lake Dam Location**: The Footbridge Over Brooks
      Lake Dam is likely located in the vicinity of Brooks Lake, which is situated
      in the central part of Staten Island. However, without a specific address or
      location, it''s challenging to determine its exact position.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Given the general geography of Staten Island, we
      can make some assumptions about the relative positions of these locations. Since
      Egbert Triangle is not specified as being in a specific neighborhood or area,
      we can assume it''s somewhere within the central or southern parts of Staten
      Island. The Footbridge Over Brooks Lake Dam, being associated with Brooks Lake,
      is likely in the central part of the island.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, it''s reasonable to conclude
      that Egbert Triangle is likely south of the Footbridge Over Brooks Lake Dam.
      This is because the central part of Staten Island, where the dam is likely located,
      is generally north of the southern parts of the island. However, without precise
      locations for both points, this conclusion is based on general geographic principles
      and assumptions.

      Building 92 in Brooklyn is located south of S Jamaica Projects Building 12 in
      Queens, we need to consider the general geography of New York City and the relative
      positions of Brooklyn and Queens, as well as the specific locations within these
      boroughs.


      1. **Brooklyn and Queens Geography**: Brooklyn and Queens are two of the five
      boroughs of New York City. Brooklyn is located southwest of Queens. This means
      that generally, points in Brooklyn are south or southwest of points in Queens,
      but it depends on the specific locations within these boroughs.


      2. **Brooklyn Navy Yard Location**: The Brooklyn Navy Yard is located on the
      waterfront in the northwestern part of Brooklyn, near the Brooklyn Bridge and
      DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass). It''s relatively north within
      Brooklyn.


      3. **S Jamaica Projects Building 12 Location**: The S Jamaica Projects, also
      known as the South Jamaica Houses, are located in the South Jamaica neighborhood
      of Queens. This area is in the southeastern part of Queens.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the Brooklyn Navy Yard is in northwestern
      Brooklyn and the S Jamaica Projects are in southeastern Queens, we need to consider
      their relative positions. Brooklyn as a whole is generally southwest of Queens,
      but the specific locations of these two points need to be considered. The Brooklyn
      Navy Yard, being more north in Brooklyn, and the South Jamaica Projects being
      more southeast in Queens, means the Navy Yard could potentially be north or
      south depending on the exact latitude, but generally, points in northwest Brooklyn
      are north of points in southeast Queens.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the northwestern location of the Brooklyn Navy Yard
      within Brooklyn and the southeastern location of the S Jamaica Projects within
      Queens, it''s reasonable to conclude that the Brooklyn Navy Yard Building 92
      is likely north of the S Jamaica Projects Building 12 in Queens. However, the

    1e66056e-966c-4807-9362-49b4fdff2e8e: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the general geography of Queens and the relative positions of the Jerome Hardeman
      Early Childhood Center and Bowne Street Community Church within the borough.
      Here''s a step-by-step analysis:


      1. **Queens Geography**: Queens is one of the five boroughs of New York City,
      and it''s located in the western part of Long Island. It''s the largest borough
      in terms of area.


      2. **Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center Location**: Without specific information
      about the exact location of the Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center, we can
      assume it''s somewhere in Queens, but its position relative to the Bowne Street
      Community Church is not immediately clear.


      3. **Bowne Street Community Church Location**: The Bowne Street Community Church
      is likely located on Bowne Street in Queens. This street runs roughly north-south
      in the western part of Queens, near the East River.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Given the general geography of Queens and the location
      of Bowne Street, we can infer that the Bowne Street Community Church is likely
      in the northern part of Queens. The Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center,
      being located in Queens but with no specific address provided, could be anywhere
      in the borough.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without more precise information about the location of the
      Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center, it''s challenging to determine if it''s
      located south of the Bowne Street Community Church. It''s possible, but not
      certain, given the lack of specific details. If we assume that the Early Childhood
      Center is also in the northern part of Queens, it''s unlikely to be south of
      the Bowne Street Community Church. However, if it''s in the southern part of
      Queens, it could be south of the church.

    36b29ed2-81a7-47ba-87fa-7ddfd2b1e999: 'To determine if the Jerome Hardeman Early
      Childhood Center in Queens is located south of the Bowne Street Community Church
      in Queens, we need to consider the relative positions of these two locations
      within the borough of Queens. Queens is a large borough in New York City, and
      the specific locations of these two points are crucial in determining their
      relative positions.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: The Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center is
      located in Queens, and the Bowne Street Community Church is also located in
      Queens. Since both locations are within the same borough, we need to focus on
      their specific locations within Queens.


      2. **Understand the Geography of Queens**: Queens is a diverse and large borough
      with various neighborhoods and landmarks. To compare the positions of these
      two locations, we need to understand the general layout of Queens.


      3. **Consider the Neighborhoods**: The Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center
      is likely located in a neighborhood within Queens, and the Bowne Street Community
      Church is also likely in a specific neighborhood. We need to identify these
      neighborhoods and their relative positions.


      4. **Use Geographic Information**: Without specific addresses or coordinates,
      we can use general geographic information about Queens to make an educated guess.
      For example, if the Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center is located in a southern
      neighborhood of Queens, and the Bowne Street Community Church is in a northern
      neighborhood, we can reasonably assume that the Early Childhood Center is south
      of the Community Church.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided, we can make an educated guess
      about the relative positions of these two locations within Queens. However,
      without specific addresses or coordinates, the answer is not definitive. Based
      on general geographic principles and the assumption that the Jerome Hardeman
      Early Childhood Center is in a southern neighborhood and the Bowne Street Community
      Church is in a northern neighborhood, it''s reasonable to conclude that the
      Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center is likely south of the Bowne Street Community
      Church. However, a more accurate answer would require more detailed information.

      Childhood Center in Queens is located south of the Bowne Street Community Church
      in Queens, we need to consider the specific locations within Queens and their
      relative positions. Here''s a step-by-step breakdown:


      1. **Location of Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center**: The Jerome Hardeman
      Early Childhood Center is likely located in the southeastern part of Queens,
      given its association with the Jerome Hardeman Houses, which are public housing
      developments in the South Jamaica area. This area is relatively south within
      Queens.


      2. **Location of Bowne Street Community Church**: The Bowne Street Community
      Church is located in Flushing, Queens. Flushing is a neighborhood in northeastern
      Queens, near the border with Long Island.


      3. **Relative Positions within Queens**: Given that the Jerome Hardeman Early
      Childhood Center is likely in the southeastern part of Queens and the Bowne
      Street Community Church is in northeastern Queens, we need to consider their
      relative positions. Generally, points in southeast Queens are south of points
      in northeast Queens.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the likely locations of the Jerome Hardeman Early
      Childhood Center and the Bowne Street Community Church within Queens, and considering
      their relative positions, it''s reasonable to conclude that the Jerome Hardeman
      Early Childhood Center is likely located south of the Bowne Street Community
      Church. However, without exact addresses, we can only make an educated guess
      based on general geographic principles.

      positions of these locations within the borough.


      1. **Geography of Queens**: Queens is one of the five boroughs of New York City.
      It''s the largest borough by area and is located to the east of Manhattan and
      Brooklyn. Queens is a large borough with diverse neighborhoods and geography.

      Early Childhood Center is likely located in one of the neighborhoods in Queens.
      Without a specific address or neighborhood, we can''t pinpoint its exact location,
      but we can assume it''s within Queens.


      3. **Location of Bowne Street Community Church**: Bowne Street is a street in
      the Flushing neighborhood of Queens. The Bowne Street Community Church is likely
      located on this street, making it part of the Flushing neighborhood in Queens.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: To determine if one location is south of another,
      we need to consider their relative positions within the borough. Since both

      addresses or neighborhoods for the Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center and
      the Bowne Street Community Church. Therefore, it''s challenging to determine
      if one is located south of the other without more specific information. However,
      we can make some general assumptions based on the borough''s geography. Flushing,
      where the Bowne Street Community Church is likely located, is in the northern
      part of Queens. Without knowing the specific location of the Jerome Hardeman
      Early Childhood Center, it''s difficult to say if it''s located south of the
      Bowne Street Community Church.

      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are in Queens and likely in close
      proximity based on their names, it''s unlikely that one is significantly south
      of the other. However, without specific addresses, it''s challenging to determine
      the exact directional relationship. Based on general principles of urban geography,
      it''s more likely that these locations are in close proximity to each other

      School in Manhattan is located south of Juniper Valley Park Running Track in
      Queens, we need to consider the general geography of New York City and the relative
      positions of Manhattan and Queens, as well as the specific locations within
      these boroughs.


      1. **Manhattan and Queens Geography**: Manhattan and Queens are two of the five
      boroughs of New York City. Manhattan is generally located south of Queens, but
      this relationship can vary depending on the specific locations within these
      boroughs.


      2. **Great Oaks Charter School Location**: Great Oaks Charter School is located
      in Manhattan, but without a specific address, we can''t pinpoint its exact location.
      However, knowing it''s in Manhattan means it''s generally south of most parts
      of Queens.


      3. **Juniper Valley Park Running Track Location**: Juniper Valley Park is located
      in Middle Village, Queens. This area is in the central part of Queens, north
      of the southern border with Brooklyn.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the Great Oaks Charter School is in Manhattan
      and Juniper Valley Park Running Track is in Queens, we need to consider their
      relative positions. Manhattan as a whole is generally south of Queens, and Juniper
      Valley Park is in the central part of Queens, north of the southern border.
      This means that the Great Oaks Charter School, being in Manhattan, is likely
      south of Juniper Valley Park Running Track in Queens.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Manhattan
      and Queens, and considering that the Great Oaks Charter School is in Manhattan

      are west or southwest of points in Queens, but it depends on the specific locations
      within these boroughs.


      2. **Great Oaks Charter School Location**: The Great Oaks Charter School is

      1. **Brooklyn and Staten Island Geography**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City, located in the southwestern part of the city, while Staten
      Island is located to the south of Brooklyn, across the Narrows. This means that
      generally, points in Brooklyn are north of points in Staten Island.


      2. **Young Israel of Vanderveer Park Location**: Young Israel of Vanderveer
      Park is located in the Vanderveer Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is in
      the southeastern part of Brooklyn.


      3. **W Brighton I Houses Building 1 Location**: The W Brighton I Houses are
      located in the West Brighton neighborhood of Staten Island. This area is in
      the northwestern part of Staten Island.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Young Israel of Vanderveer Park is in
      southeastern Brooklyn and W Brighton I Houses Building 1 is in northwestern
      Staten Island, we need to consider their relative positions. Brooklyn as a whole
      is generally north of Staten Island, but the specific locations of these two
      points need to be considered. The Vanderveer Park neighborhood in Brooklyn,
      being more southeast, and the West Brighton neighborhood in Staten Island, being
      more northwest, means that Young Israel of Vanderveer Park could potentially
      be north or south depending on the exact latitude, but generally, points in
      southeastern Brooklyn are north of points in northwestern Staten Island.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the southeastern location of Young Israel of Vanderveer
      Park within Brooklyn and the northwestern location of W Brighton I Houses Building
      1 within Staten Island, it''s reasonable to conclude that Young Israel of Vanderveer
      Park is likely north of W Brighton I Houses Building 1 in Staten Island. However,
      the exact determination requires precise latitude comparisons, which aren''t

      9 in Manhattan is located south of East Drive Over The Loch in Manhattan, we
      need to consider the geography of Manhattan and the specific locations of these
      places within the borough.


      1. **Manhattan''s Geography**: Manhattan is a long and narrow island, oriented
      roughly north-south. It''s divided into various neighborhoods, with the southern
      part being generally more urban and the northern part being more residential
      and parkland.


      2. **Johnson Houses Location**: Johnson Houses are located in the East Harlem
      neighborhood of Manhattan, which is in the northeastern part of the island.
      The exact location of Building 9 isn''t specified, but it''s likely in the same
      general area.


      3. **East Drive Over The Loch Location**: The Loch is a small body of water
      in Central Park, located in the northern part of the park. East Drive is one
      of the main roads that winds through Central Park, and it passes over the Loch.
      This means the East Drive Over The Loch is in the northern part of Central Park,
      which is in the northern part of Manhattan.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Johnson Houses are in East Harlem, which
      is in the northeastern part of Manhattan, and the East Drive Over The Loch is
      in the northern part of Central Park, which is in the northern part of Manhattan,
      we can make a comparison. Generally, points in the northeastern part of Manhattan
      are south of points in the northern part of Central Park.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geography of Manhattan and the locations of
      Johnson Houses Building 9 and East Drive Over The Loch, it''s reasonable to
      conclude that Johnson Houses Building 9 is likely located south of East Drive
      Over The Loch. However, without the exact latitude and longitude of these locations,
      this is an educated guess based on general geographic principles.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      tip of Manhattan is where the Financial District is located, while the northern
      end of the island is where Harlem and Washington Heights are situated.


      2. **Johnson Houses Building 9 Location**: The Johnson Houses are located in
      the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, which is in the northeastern part
      of the borough. This neighborhood is north of Central Park.


      3. **East Drive Over the Loch Location**: The East Drive Over the Loch is part
      of Central Park, which is located in the middle of Manhattan. It''s a road that
      runs north-south through the park, and the "Loch" is a man-made lake within
      the park.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the Johnson Houses Building 9 is in East
      Harlem, which is north of Central Park, and the East Drive Over the Loch is
      within Central Park, it''s clear that the Johnson Houses Building 9 is north
      of the East Drive Over the Loch.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative positions of these two locations within
      Manhattan, it''s evident that the Johnson Houses Building 9 in Manhattan is
      north of the East Drive Over the Loch in Manhattan.

      5. **Conclusion**: Since "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5" is a more specific
      location within "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4," it means that "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP

      3. **South Bronx Community Charter High School Location**: The South Bronx Community
      Charter High School is likely located in the southern part of the Bronx, given
      its name and the common association of "South Bronx" with the southern part
      of the borough.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: To determine if one location is south of another,
      we need to consider their relative positions within the borough. If both locations

      the general geography of New York City and the relative positions of Manhattan
      and Queens, as well as the specific locations within these boroughs.


      1. **Manhattan and Queens Geography**: Manhattan and Queens are two of the five
      boroughs of New York City. Manhattan is located directly west of Queens. This
      means that generally, points in Manhattan are west of points in Queens, but
      it depends on the specific locations within these boroughs.


      2. **Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge Location**: The specific location of Karma Hookah
      Bar & Lounge in Manhattan isn''t provided, but we can assume it''s somewhere
      in the general Manhattan area.


      3. **Peter Chahales Park Location**: Peter Chahales Park is located in the Astoria
      neighborhood of Queens. Astoria is in the northwestern part of Queens, near
      the East River and the border with Manhattan.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the exact location of Karma Hookah Bar
      & Lounge in Manhattan isn''t provided, and Peter Chahales Park is in the northwestern
      part of Queens, we can consider their relative positions. Manhattan as a whole
      is generally west of Queens, but the specific locations of these two points
      need to be considered. Since Peter Chahales Park is in the northwestern part
      of Queens, which is relatively close to Manhattan, and Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge
      could be anywhere in Manhattan, it''s difficult to determine if the bar is south
      of the park without more specific location information.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the uncertainty of the specific locations, it''s challenging
      to definitively say if Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge in Manhattan is south of Peter
      Chahales Park in Queens. The final answer would depend on the exact latitude
      of the bar in Manhattan. Without this information, we can''t make a definitive
      determination.

      in Queens is located south of Riverdale Avenue Middle School in Brooklyn, we
      need to consider the geography of New York City and the relative positions of
      these two locations. Let''s break it down:


      1. **New York City Boroughs**: New York City is divided into five boroughs:
      Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Brooklyn and Queens
      are the two boroughs in question here.


      2. **Relative Positions of Brooklyn and Queens**: Brooklyn and Queens are adjacent
      boroughs. Brooklyn is generally west and southwest of Queens. This means that
      generally, points in Brooklyn are west or southwest of points in Queens, but
      it depends on the specific locations within these boroughs.


      3. **Springfield Playground Location**: Springfield Playground is located in
      Springfield Gardens, a neighborhood in the southeastern part of Queens. This
      area is relatively south within Queens.


      4. **Riverdale Avenue Middle School Location**: Riverdale Avenue Middle School
      is located in Canarsie, a neighborhood in the southeastern part of Brooklyn.
      This area is relatively south within Brooklyn.


      5. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Springfield Playground is in southeastern
      Queens and Riverdale Avenue Middle School is in southeastern Brooklyn, we need
      to consider their relative positions. Queens is generally east of Brooklyn,
      but the specific locations of these two points need to be considered. The Springfield
      Playground, being more southeast in Queens, and Riverdale Avenue Middle School
      being more southeast in Brooklyn, means the playground could potentially be
      south or north depending on the exact latitude, but generally, points in southeast
      Queens are east of points in southeast Brooklyn.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the southeastern location of Springfield Playground

      triangle could potentially be north or south depending on the exact latitude,
      but generally, points in north Manhattan are north of points in south Bronx.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the northern location of the Colonel Charles Young
      Triangle within Manhattan and the southern location of the Bronx International
      Academy within the Bronx, it''s reasonable to conclude that the Colonel Charles
      Young Triangle is likely north of the Bronx International Academy. However,
      the exact determination requires precise latitude comparisons, which aren''t
      provided. Based on general geographic principles, though, we can make an educated
      guess.

      hills, parks, and waterfront areas.


      2. **Village Preschool Location**: Without a specific address, it''s challenging
      to pinpoint the exact location of the Village Preschool. However, "The Village"
      is a neighborhood in Staten Island, generally located in the central part of
      the island. This suggests that the preschool is likely located in a central
      area.


      3. **Atlantis Marina & Yacht Club Location**: The Atlantis Marina & Yacht Club

      of Staten Island, with the two boroughs being separated by the Narrows, a strait
      connecting the Upper and Lower New York Bay.


      2. **Luna Park Houses Location**: Luna Park Houses is located in Coney Island,
      Brooklyn, which is at the southernmost end of Brooklyn, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      3. **Bancroft Avenue OVR SIRT S SHR Location**: Bancroft Avenue OVR SIRT S SHR
      is in Staten Island. Without a more specific address, it''s difficult to pinpoint
      its exact location within Staten Island, but it''s likely in the northern part
      of the island, given that the Staten Island Railway (SIRT) runs through the
      central and northern parts of the borough.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Luna Park Houses is in the southernmost

      Brooklyn are located south of the Bancroft Avenue Overpass over the Staten Island
      Railway South Shore Line in Staten Island, we need to consider the general geography
      of New York City and the relative positions of Brooklyn and Staten Island, as
      well as the specific locations within these boroughs.


      1. **Brooklyn and Staten Island Geography**: Brooklyn and Staten Island are
      two of the five boroughs of New York City. Brooklyn is located northwest of
      Staten Island. This means that generally, points in Brooklyn are north or northwest
      of points in Staten Island, but it depends on the specific locations within
      these boroughs.


      2. **Luna Park Houses Location**: The Luna Park Houses are located in the Coney
      Island neighborhood of Brooklyn. This area is in the southwestern part of Brooklyn,
      near the coast.


      3. **Bancroft Avenue Overpass Location**: The Bancroft Avenue Overpass over
      the Staten Island Railway South Shore Line is located in the Tottenville neighborhood
      of Staten Island. This area is in the southern part of Staten Island.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the Luna Park Houses are in southwestern
      Brooklyn and the Bancroft Avenue Overpass is in southern Staten Island, we need
      to consider their relative positions. Brooklyn as a whole is generally northwest
      of Staten Island, but the specific locations of these two points need to be
      considered. The Luna Park Houses, being more southwest in Brooklyn, and the
      Bancroft Avenue Overpass being more south in Staten Island, means the Luna Park
      Houses could potentially be north or south depending on the exact latitude,
      but generally, points in southwest Brooklyn are north of points in south Staten
      Island.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the southwestern location of the Luna Park Houses within

      United Nations in Manhattan is located south of the Belgium Consulate in Manhattan,
      we need to consider the specific addresses of these locations and their relative
      positions within Manhattan.


      1. **Addresses**: To accurately determine the relative positions, we need the
      exact addresses. Without specific addresses, we can only make assumptions based
      on general knowledge about the locations of consulates and missions in Manhattan.


      2. **General Location of Consulates and Missions**: Consulates and missions
      to the United Nations are often located in the Midtown East area of Manhattan,
      particularly around the United Nations Headquarters. This area is generally
      north of most parts of Manhattan.


      3. **Assuming Locations**: Without specific addresses, we can assume that both
      the Italy Mission and the Belgium Consulate are located in the Midtown East
      area, given their nature as diplomatic missions.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Given the assumption that both locations are in the
      same general area of Midtown East, it''s unlikely that one would be significantly
      south of the other. Consulates and missions are often clustered in a relatively
      small area around the United Nations.

      Mission to the United Nations is located significantly south of the Belgium
      Consulate. They are likely in the same general area. However, for a precise

      1. **Understanding Manhattan''s Geography**: Manhattan is a borough of New York
      City. It''s generally elongated from north to south, with Central Park roughly
      dividing it into eastern and western halves.


      2. **Location of Italy Mission to the UN**: The Italy Mission to the UN is likely
      located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, which is home to the United

      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the Italy Mission to the UN is in eastern
      Midtown and the Belgium Consulate is in central Midtown, we need to consider
      their relative positions. Midtown Manhattan is relatively compact, and the east-west
      distance is smaller than the north-south distance.

      Transformer in Manhattan is located south of the Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob
      in Manhattan, we need to consider the specific locations of these two points
      within Manhattan and their relative positions.


      1. **Manhattan Geography**: Manhattan is a long, narrow island, with its north-south
      axis being much longer than its east-west axis. The island is divided into different
      neighborhoods, each with its own character and landmarks.


      2. **FDNY Academy Con Ed Transformer Location**: The FDNY Academy is located
      on Randall''s Island, which is technically part of Manhattan but separated from
      the main island by the Harlem River. The Con Ed Transformer is likely a part
      of the academy''s infrastructure.


      3. **Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob Location**: Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob
      is likely a religious school or institution. Without a specific address, we
      can''t pinpoint its exact location, but we can make some assumptions based on
      common patterns in Manhattan.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Randall''s Island, where the FDNY Academy is located,
      is in the northeastern part of Manhattan. It''s relatively north within the
      borough. Without a specific location for the Yeshiva, we can only make assumptions
      based on general patterns in Manhattan. Many religious institutions are located
      in the Upper East Side, Upper West Side, or in the neighborhoods of Midtown
      Manhattan. These areas are generally north of Randall''s Island.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the northeastern location of the FDNY Academy on Randall''s
      Island and the likelihood of the Yeshiva being located in more central or northern
      parts of Manhattan, it''s reasonable to conclude that the FDNY Academy Con Ed
      Transformer is likely south of the Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob. However,

      positions of the two schools within the borough.


      1. **Brooklyn Geography**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York
      City. It is located south of Queens, east of Manhattan, and north of Staten
      Island. The borough is generally rectangular in shape, with the northern border
      being the East River.


      2. **Relative Positions**: Since both schools are in Brooklyn, we need to consider
      their specific locations within the borough. Without knowing the exact addresses,
      we can make an educated guess based on the borough''s geography.


      3. **North-South Axis**: Generally, in New York City, the north-south axis runs
      roughly along the East River. This means that points in the northern part of
      Brooklyn are generally north of points in the southern part.


      4. **Assumptions**: Without exact addresses, we can make some assumptions based
      on the names of the schools. "Mount Roraima" might suggest a location in the
      hilly or elevated parts of Brooklyn, which are typically in the northern and
      central parts of the borough. "School of Creativity and Innovation" might suggest
      a location in a more urban or developed area, which are more common in the southern
      and central parts of Brooklyn.

      is located south of Madiba Prep Middle School in Brooklyn, we need to consider
      the general geography of Brooklyn and the specific locations of these two schools
      within the borough.


      1. **Brooklyn Geography**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York
      City. It''s a large borough with a diverse geography, but for the purposes of
      this question, we''ll consider its general north-south orientation.


      2. **PS 26 Jesse Owens Location**: PS 26 Jesse Owens is located in Brooklyn.
      Without a specific address, we can assume it''s somewhere within the borough.


      3. **Madiba Prep Middle School Location**: Madiba Prep Middle School is also
      located in Brooklyn. Without a specific address, we can assume it''s somewhere
      within the borough.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Since both schools are in Brooklyn, we need to consider
      their relative positions within the borough. Without specific addresses, it''s
      challenging to determine their exact locations. However, we can make a general
      assessment based on the common understanding of Brooklyn''s geography.


      5. **Brooklyn''s North-South Orientation**: Brooklyn, in general, has a north-south
      orientation. The northern parts of Brooklyn are generally closer to Manhattan,
      while the southern parts are closer to the ocean.


      6. **Assumption and Conclusion**: Without specific addresses, we can only make
      an assumption based on the general north-south orientation of Brooklyn. It''s
      reasonable to assume that both schools are located within the same general area
      of Brooklyn. Given this assumption, we can conclude that PS 26 Jesse Owens is
      not necessarily located south of Madiba Prep Middle School. They could be located
      in similar latitudes, or Madiba Prep Middle School could even be south of PS
      26 Jesse Owens. The specific answer would require more detailed information
      about their exact locations.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      positions, we need to know the specific locations of these schools within Brooklyn.


      2. **PS 26 Jesse Owens Location**: Without a specific address, we can''t pinpoint
      its exact location within Brooklyn. However, based on its name, we can assume
      it''s named after the famous athlete Jesse Owens, which could give some indication
      of its location, but it''s not definitive.


      3. **Madiba Prep Middle School Location**: Again, without a specific address,
      we can''t pinpoint its exact location within Brooklyn. The name "Madiba" is
      often associated with Nelson Mandela, but it''s unclear if this school is named
      after him or something else.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Without specific addresses, it''s difficult to determine
      the exact locations of these schools within Brooklyn. Brooklyn is a large borough
      with a diverse geography, so schools could be located in different neighborhoods,
      which could be north, south, east, or west of each other. We don''t have enough
      information to determine if PS 26 Jesse Owens is south of Madiba Prep Middle
      School.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific addresses and the large and diverse
      geography of Brooklyn, it''s not possible to definitively answer if PS 26 Jesse
      Owens is located south of Madiba Prep Middle School. More information is needed
      to make this determination.

      2 in Brooklyn is located south of Trinity CME Methodist Church in Brooklyn,
      we need to consider the general geography of Brooklyn and the relative positions
      of these specific locations within the borough.


      1. **Brooklyn Geography**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York
      City. It''s located on the western end of Long Island. Generally, in Brooklyn,
      locations are described as being in the north, south, east, or west of the borough,
      with downtown Brooklyn being considered the center.


      2. **Unity Plaza 17,24,25A Building 2 Location**: Without specific addresses,
      we can assume that Unity Plaza is a housing complex or development in Brooklyn.
      The term "Building 2" suggests it''s a specific building within the complex.

      we know that Trinity CME Methodist Church is located somewhere in Brooklyn.
      Churches are often central to communities and can be found in various neighborhoods

      Building 2 is located south of Trinity CME Methodist Church in Brooklyn. Both
      locations could be in different parts of the borough, making their relative
      positions uncertain. However, based on general principles, it''s possible that
      Unity Plaza, being a housing complex, might be located in a residential area,
      while Trinity CME Methodist Church, being a community church, might be located

      and East New York is in the eastern part of the borough, we need to consider
      their relative positions. Gowanus is generally north of East New York. However,
      the specific locations of these two points need to be considered. The Gowanus
      Houses, being more northwest in Brooklyn, and the Moffat Street Community Garden
      being more east in Brooklyn, means that the Gowanus Houses could potentially
      be north or south depending on the exact latitude, but generally, points in
      northwest Brooklyn are north of points in east Brooklyn.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the northwestern location of the Gowanus Houses within
      Brooklyn and the eastern location of the Moffat Street Community Garden within
      Brooklyn, it''s reasonable to conclude that the Gowanus Houses Building 8 is
      likely north of the Moffat Street Community Garden in Brooklyn. However, the
      exact determination requires precise latitude comparisons, which aren''t provided.

      in the Bronx is located south of the Morris II Houses Building 14 in the Bronx,
      we need to consider the geography of the Bronx and the relative positions of
      these two locations within the borough.


      1. **Understanding the Bronx**: The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New
      York City. It''s the northernmost borough and is located north of Manhattan
      and Queens.


      2. **Highbridge Senior Center Location**: Highbridge is a neighborhood in the
      Bronx, located in the western part of the borough. The Highbridge Senior Center
      is likely located within this neighborhood.


      3. **Morris II Houses Building 14 Location**: Morrisania is another neighborhood
      in the Bronx, located in the central part of the borough. The Morris II Houses
      are likely located within this neighborhood.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Highbridge is in the western part of
      the Bronx and Morrisania is in the central part, we need to consider their relative
      positions. The Bronx is generally north-south oriented, with the northern part
      being the highest in latitude and the southern part being the lowest. Highbridge,
      being in the western part, would be more west than Morrisania, but the north-south
      relationship would depend on the specific latitudes of these neighborhoods.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without knowing the exact latitude of these neighborhoods,
      it''s difficult to determine with certainty whether the Highbridge Senior Center
      is located south of the Morris II Houses Building 14. However, given that Highbridge
      is in the western part of the Bronx and Morrisania is in the central part, and

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: We have two locations - Central Park Cedar Hill
      and Grace St. Paul''s Lutheran Church, both in Manhattan.


      2. **Understand the Geography of Manhattan**: Manhattan is a long, narrow island
      with a north-south orientation. Central Park is located in the middle of Manhattan,
      spanning several blocks from north to south.


      3. **Determine the Relative Positions of the Locations**: Central Park Cedar
      Hill is a specific area within Central Park, located in the southern part of
      the park. Grace St. Paul''s Lutheran Church is located at 123 West 86th Street,
      which is also in the southern part of Manhattan, but north of Central Park.


      4. **Consider the Directions**: Since both locations are in the southern part
      of Manhattan, we need to consider their specific locations within this region.


      5. **Analyze the Geography of Central Park**: Central Park is a large park that
      covers a significant portion of Manhattan. It''s divided into various sections,
      including Cedar Hill, which is located in the southern part of the park.


      6. **Compare the Locations**: Central Park Cedar Hill is located south of Grace
      St. Paul''s Lutheran Church, as it''s situated further south within the southern
      region of Manhattan.


      **Conclusion**: Given that Central Park Cedar Hill is located in the southern
      part of Central Park, which is in the southern part of Manhattan, and considering
      the location of Grace St. Paul''s Lutheran Church at West 86th Street, it''s

      Bldg 7 in the Bronx is located south of Fordham University Dealy Hall in the
      Bronx, we need to consider the general geography of the Bronx and the specific
      locations of these two points. Here are the steps:


      1. **Understand the Geography of the Bronx**: The Bronx is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City. It''s located north of Manhattan and is the northernmost borough
      of the city.


      2. **Identify Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7 Location**: Pelham Parkway Houses
      is a public housing complex in the Bronx. It''s located in the northeast part
      of the borough, near the New England Thruway (I-95) and Pelham Parkway.


      3. **Identify Fordham University Dealy Hall Location**: Fordham University is
      a private university in the Bronx. Dealy Hall is a building on the university''s
      Rose Hill campus, which is located in the northwest part of the borough, near
      the Fordham Road and Southern Boulevard intersection.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Given that Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7 is in the
      northeast part of the Bronx and Fordham University Dealy Hall is in the northwest
      part of the borough, we need to consider their relative positions. Generally,
      points in the northeast are north and east of points in the northwest.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of the Bronx and the specific
      locations of Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7 and Fordham University Dealy Hall,
      it''s reasonable to conclude that Pelham Parkway Houses Bldg 7 is likely north
      and east of Fordham University Dealy Hall. This means that Pelham Parkway Houses
      Bldg 7 is NOT south of Fordham University Dealy Hall.


      The final answer is: NO

      7 in the Bronx is located south of Fordham University Dealy Hall in the Bronx,
      we need to consider the general geography of the Bronx and the specific locations
      of these places within the borough.


      1. **General Bronx Geography**: The Bronx is the northernmost of the five boroughs
      of New York City. Within the Bronx, there are various neighborhoods and landmarks.


      2. **Pelham Parkway Houses Location**: Pelham Parkway Houses is a housing complex
      located in the northeast Bronx, near the border with Westchester County. Building
      7 is a specific building within this complex.


      3. **Fordham University Dealy Hall Location**: Fordham University is located
      in the northwestern part of the Bronx, near the border with Westchester County.
      Dealy Hall is a specific building on the campus.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Both Pelham Parkway Houses Building 7 and Fordham
      University Dealy Hall are located in the northern part of the Bronx. However,
      Pelham Parkway Houses is in the northeast, and Fordham University is in the
      northwest. This means that Pelham Parkway Houses is generally east of Fordham
      University.


      5. **Directional Analysis**: South is a direction. To determine if one place
      is south of another, we need to consider their relative positions. Since Pelham
      Parkway Houses is east of Fordham University, it''s not directly south. However,
      the Bronx is relatively narrow, so east and west directions can also be considered
      as approximately north and south directions, respectively.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of the Bronx and the locations
      of Pelham Parkway Houses Building 7 and Fordham University Dealy Hall, it''s
      reasonable to conclude that Pelham Parkway Houses Building 7 is not directly
      south of Fordham University Dealy Hall. However, given the narrow geography
      of the Bronx, it might be considered approximately south, especially if we''re
      not considering a strict southward direction.

      School Annex in the Bronx and The New School for Leadership and Journalism,
      also in the Bronx.


      2. **Understand the Geography of the Bronx**: The Bronx is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City. It''s located north of Manhattan and is the northernmost borough
      of the city.


      3. **Consider Relative Positions**: Since both locations are within the Bronx,
      we need to consider their relative positions within the borough.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Without specific addresses, we can''t precisely determine
      their positions, but we can make educated guesses based on typical school and
      educational institution distributions within the Bronx.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are within the Bronx, and without
      precise addresses, it''s difficult to definitively say whether one is south
      of the other. However, based on general patterns of school locations within
      the Bronx, it''s possible that the Harry H Gordon School Annex and The New School

      3. **Comparing Locations**: To determine the relative positions of these two
      points, we need to consider their latitudes within Manhattan. The Upper East
      Side, where PS 59 is located, is generally north of Times Square, where TKTS
      is located. This is because Manhattan is a long, narrow island, with the northern
      part generally being further north than the southern part.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the locations provided, TKTS Times Square is located
      south of PS 59 Beekman Hill International School. Times Square is a central
      point within Manhattan, and the Upper East Side, where PS 59 is located, is
      generally north of this central point. Therefore, TKTS Times Square is south
      of PS 59 Beekman Hill International School.

      Stroud Playground, being more north in Brooklyn, and August Martin High School
      being more southeast in Queens, means the playground could potentially be north
      or south depending on the exact latitude, but generally, points in north-central
      Brooklyn are north of points in southeast Queens.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the north-central location of Stroud Playground within
      Brooklyn and the southeastern location of August Martin High School within Queens,
      it''s reasonable to conclude that the Stroud Playground Comfort Station is likely
      north of August Martin High School in Queens. However, the exact determination
      requires precise latitude comparisons, which aren''t provided. Based on general
      geographic principles, though, we can make an educated guess.

    4bbe11dc-1290-4e0c-8abb-f0c642cfc6cd: 'To determine if the Cypress Hills Library
      in Brooklyn is located south of Gregory''s Garden in Brooklyn, we need to consider
      the general geography of Brooklyn and the relative positions of these two locations
      within the borough.


      1. **Brooklyn Geography**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York
      City. It''s located in the western part of Long Island. The borough is generally
      elongated in a north-south direction, with the southern tip of Brooklyn being
      Coney Island and the northern tip being Greenpoint.


      2. **Cypress Hills Library Location**: The Cypress Hills Library is located
      in the Cypress Hills neighborhood of Brooklyn. Cypress Hills is in the northeastern
      part of Brooklyn, close to the border with Queens.


      3. **Gregory''s Garden Location**: Gregory''s Garden is a community garden in
      Brooklyn. Without more specific information, we can assume it''s located somewhere
      within the borough of Brooklyn.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the Cypress Hills Library is in the northeastern
      part of Brooklyn and Gregory''s Garden is in Brooklyn, we need to consider their
      relative positions. Since we don''t have a specific location for Gregory''s
      Garden, we can''t make a precise determination, but we can make some general
      assumptions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic principles of Brooklyn, the
      northeastern location of the Cypress Hills Library means it''s likely north
      of many other locations within Brooklyn, including Gregory''s Garden. However,
      without a specific location for Gregory''s Garden, we can''t be certain. It''s
      possible that Gregory''s Garden is located in the northeastern part of Brooklyn,

      Street Settlement, being in the southern part of Manhattan, and Al Mamoor School
      being in Queens, means the Henry Street Settlement could potentially be south
      or west of Al Mamoor School, depending on the exact latitude and longitude of
      the school.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the southern location of the Henry Street Settlement
      within Manhattan and the unspecified location of Al Mamoor School within Queens,
      it''s reasonable to conclude that the Henry Street Settlement CCC Montgomery
      St is likely south of Al Mamoor School in Queens. However, the exact determination

    e88efc53-336c-4260-943d-8f4502bac03d: 'To determine if the Motor Parkway Pedestrian
      Bridge Over Alley Park in Queens is located south of the Stein Senior Center
      in Manhattan, we need to consider the geography of New York City and the relative
      positions of Queens and Manhattan.


      1. **Queens and Manhattan Geography**: Queens and Manhattan are two of the five
      boroughs of New York City. Manhattan is located west of Queens. This means that
      generally, points in Queens are east of points in Manhattan, but it depends
      on the specific locations within these boroughs.


      2. **Motor Parkway Pedestrian Bridge Over Alley Park Location**: The Motor Parkway
      Pedestrian Bridge is located in Queens, likely referring to the Long Island
      Motor Parkway, an early automobile road that ran through parts of Queens. Alley
      Park is also in Queens, in the eastern part of the borough.


      3. **Stein Senior Center Location**: The Stein Senior Center is located in Manhattan,
      likely referring to the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Center for Elder Abuse Prevention
      at the Hebrew Home at Riverdale. Riverdale is in the northwestern part of the
      Bronx, but it''s not clear if this is the exact location of the Stein Senior
      Center.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the Motor Parkway Pedestrian Bridge is
      in Queens, likely in the eastern part, and the Stein Senior Center is in Manhattan,
      likely in the northwestern part, we need to consider their relative positions.
      Queens as a whole is generally east of Manhattan, but the specific locations
      of these two points need to be considered. The Motor Parkway, being in the eastern
      part of Queens, and the Stein Senior Center being in the northwestern part of
      Manhattan (if that''s indeed the location), means the bridge could potentially
      be north or south depending on the exact latitude, but generally, points in
      eastern Queens are east of points in northwestern Manhattan.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the eastern location of the Motor Parkway Pedestrian
      Bridge within Queens and the northwestern location of the Stein Senior Center
      within Manhattan, it''s reasonable to conclude that the Motor Parkway Pedestrian
      Bridge Over Alley Park is likely east of the Stein Senior Center in Manhattan.
      However, the exact determination requires precise latitude comparisons, which
      aren''t provided. Based on general geographic principles, though, we can make
      an educated guess.

      and the general geography of the area.


      3. **Assuming Locations**: Given the names "Raritan Bay Light 42" and "Raritan
      Bay Light 58," we can assume they are located in the Raritan Bay area, which
      is near Staten Island, New York. The numbers 42 and 58 might be related to their

      down the bay or waterway, while lower numbers indicate a location closer to
      the entrance.


      4. **Comparing Numbers**: Raritan Bay Light 42 and Raritan Bay Light 58 are
      both located in Raritan Bay. Based on their numbers, it''s likely that Light
      58 is further down the bay (southeast) than Light 42.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography of Staten Island, Raritan Bay,
      and the numbering system for lighthouses, it''s reasonable to conclude that
      Raritan Bay Light 42 is likely located north of Raritan Bay Light 58 in Staten
      Island. However, without exact coordinates, this is an educated guess based
      on the general principles of lighthouse numbering and geography.

    9ab59682-72a6-420e-b5d2-af2c8f8c7353: 'To determine if Raritan Bay Light 42 is
      located south of Raritan Bay Light 58, we need to consider the geography of
      Staten Island and the relative positions of these two locations.


      1. **Staten Island Geography**: Staten Island is the southernmost borough of
      New York City. It''s bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and the Raritan
      Bay to the west.


      2. **Raritan Bay Light Locations**: Both Raritan Bay Light 42 and Raritan Bay
      Light 58 are presumably lighthouses located in Raritan Bay, which is west of
      Staten Island. The numbers (42 and 58) might refer to their specific locations
      along the bay.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Without specific coordinates, we can''t determine
      the exact relative positions of these lighthouses. However, we can make an educated
      guess based on the general geography of Staten Island and Raritan Bay.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both lighthouses are located in Raritan Bay, which
      is west of Staten Island, and Staten Island is the southernmost borough, it''s
      unlikely that Raritan Bay Light 42 would be located south of Raritan Bay Light
      58. Both lighthouses are likely located north of the southernmost point of Staten
      Island, given their positions in Raritan Bay.

      located south of Raritan Bay Light 58, we need to consider the geography of
      Staten Island and the locations of these two lights within it.


      1. **Staten Island Geography**: Staten Island is the southernmost of the five
      boroughs of New York City. It''s located southwest of Manhattan and is surrounded
      by water on all sides. The western part of Staten Island faces the Raritan Bay,
      which is a part of the Atlantic Ocean.


      2. **Raritan Bay Light Locations**: Without more specific information about
      the locations of Raritan Bay Light 42 and Raritan Bay Light 58, we can only
      make assumptions based on their names. The term "Raritan Bay Light" suggests
      that these are lighthouses or navigational aids located in or near Raritan Bay.
      Given that Staten Island faces Raritan Bay to the west, we can assume that these
      lights are on the western coast of Staten Island.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Since both Raritan Bay Light 42 and Raritan Bay
      Light 58 are likely located on the western coast of Staten Island, they are
      in relatively close proximity to each other. Without more specific information
      about their exact locations, it''s difficult to determine if one is definitively
      south of the other. The numbers "42" and "58" might refer to their positions
      along the coast, but this is uncertain without additional context.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the available information, it''s not possible to definitively
      say if Raritan Bay Light 42 is located south of Raritan Bay Light 58. Both lights
      are likely on the western coast of Staten Island, but their exact positions
      relative to each other are unclear. More specific information about their locations

      the geography of Staten Island and the locations of Raritan Bay Light 42 and
      Raritan Bay Light 58. Let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Geography of Staten Island**: Staten Island is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City. It''s the southernmost borough and is separated from New Jersey
      by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull. The northern part of Staten Island
      is generally considered to be the area north of the Staten Island Expressway,
      while the southern part is everything south of that.


      2. **Locations of Raritan Bay Light 42 and 58**: These are likely reference
      points or landmarks within Staten Island. Without more specific information,
      we can''t pinpoint their exact locations. However, based on their names, they
      are likely located on or near the Raritan Bay, which is on the southwestern
      side of Staten Island.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Given that these locations are likely on the southwestern
      side of Staten Island, which is generally south within the borough, it''s likely
      that both Raritan Bay Light 42 and 58 are located in the southern part of Staten
      Island.


      4. **Comparison**: To determine if Raritan Bay Light 42 is located south of
      Raritan Bay Light 58, we need to know their relative positions within the southern
      part of Staten Island. Without specific coordinates or a map, it''s difficult
      to make a definitive determination. However, if they are both in the southern
      part of Staten Island, it''s possible that one is south of the other, depending
      on their exact locations.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the general geography
      of Staten Island, it''s reasonable to conclude that both Raritan Bay Light 42
      and Raritan Bay Light 58 are located in the southern part of Staten Island.
      However, without more specific information about their exact locations, it''s
      not possible to definitively say whether one is located south of the other.

      of New York City. It is located in the southwest part of the city, separated
      from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull.


      2. **Location of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42 and RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58**: Without specific
      coordinates, we can''t pinpoint the exact locations of these two points. However,
      we can make some assumptions based on their names and the geography of Staten
      Island.


      3. **Assumptions**: RARITAN BAY is a bay located south of Staten Island and
      north of New Jersey. Given the naming convention, it''s likely that RARITAN
      BAY LIGHT 42 and RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 are two points or landmarks along the
      Raritan Bay shoreline.


      4. **Relative Positions**: If these points are indeed along the Raritan Bay
      shoreline, it''s likely that they are both south of most of Staten Island. This
      is because the Raritan Bay shoreline is the southern boundary of Staten Island.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the assumptions and the geography of Staten Island,
      it''s reasonable to conclude that both RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42 and RARITAN BAY
      LIGHT 58 are likely located south of most of Staten Island. Therefore, it''s
      also likely that RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42 is not south of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58,
      but rather they are both south of Staten Island.

      1. **Queens and Brooklyn Geography**: Queens and Brooklyn are two of the five
      boroughs of New York City. Brooklyn is located directly west of Queens. This
      means that generally, points in Brooklyn are west of points in Queens, but it

      of Jamaica. Jamaica is in the central part of Queens, but slightly eastward.


      3. **Bushwick Houses Building 8 Location**: The Bushwick Houses are located
      in the neighborhood of Bushwick in Brooklyn. Bushwick is in the north-central
      part of Brooklyn.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the Civil Court is in central-east Queens

      in Manhattan is located south of Roosevelt in Queens, we need to consider the
      geography of New York City and the relative positions of Manhattan and Queens.


      1. **Manhattan and Queens Geography**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City, located in the center and surrounded by water. Queens is another
      borough, located east of Manhattan and connected by bridges and tunnels.


      2. **General Electric Building Location**: The General Electric Building is
      located in Midtown Manhattan, specifically at 570 Lexington Avenue. Midtown
      Manhattan is generally considered the central part of Manhattan.


      3. **Roosevelt Location**: Roosevelt is a neighborhood in Queens. It''s located
      in the southeastern part of Queens, close to the border with Nassau County on
      Long Island.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Manhattan is generally north of Queens, given their
      relative positions in New York City. Midtown Manhattan, where the General Electric
      Building is located, is more central and slightly north within Manhattan. Roosevelt
      in Queens is in the southeastern part of the borough, which is generally south
      and east of Manhattan.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geography of New York City and the relative
      positions of Manhattan and Queens, it''s reasonable to conclude that the General
      Electric Building in Midtown Manhattan is indeed north of Roosevelt in Queens.
      While there may be exceptions due to the irregular shape of the boroughs and
      specific locations, the general trend holds true.

      general geography of New York City and the relative positions of Manhattan and
      Queens, as well as the specific locations within these boroughs.


      1. **Manhattan and Queens Geography**: Manhattan and Queens are two of the five
      boroughs of New York City. Manhattan is located southwest of Queens. This means
      that generally, points in Manhattan are south or southwest of points in Queens,
      but it depends on the specific locations within these boroughs.


      2. **General Electric Building Location**: The General Electric Building, also
      known as 570 Lexington Avenue, is located in Midtown Manhattan, specifically
      in the Turtle Bay neighborhood. It''s relatively central within Manhattan.


      3. **Roosevelt Location**: Roosevelt is a neighborhood in western Queens, located
      south of Astoria and north of Jackson Heights. It''s relatively north within
      Queens.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the General Electric Building is in central
      Manhattan and Roosevelt is in western Queens, we need to consider their relative
      positions. Manhattan as a whole is generally southwest of Queens, but the specific
      locations of these two points need to be considered. The General Electric Building,
      being more central in Manhattan, and Roosevelt being more north in Queens, means
      the building could potentially be north or south depending on the exact latitude,
      but generally, points in central Manhattan are south of points in northern Queens.

      Adventist Church in Manhattan is located south of Co-op City Building 32B in
      the Bronx, we need to consider the geography of New York City and the relative
      positions of Manhattan and the Bronx.


      1. **Manhattan and the Bronx Geography**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City, and it''s located south of the Bronx. The Bronx is the northernmost
      borough of New York City.


      2. **Dyckman Spanish 7 Day Adventist Church Location**: The Dyckman Spanish
      7 Day Adventist Church is located in the northern part of Manhattan, specifically
      in the Inwood neighborhood. This area is close to the northern tip of Manhattan.


      3. **Co-op City Building 32B Location**: Co-op City is a large housing cooperative
      located in the northeast part of the Bronx. It''s relatively far north within
      the Bronx.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that the Dyckman Spanish 7 Day Adventist Church

      the Bronx, but the specific locations of these two points need to be considered.
      The Dyckman Spanish 7 Day Adventist Church, being in the northern part of Manhattan,
      and Co-op City Building 32B being in the northeast Bronx, means that the church
      is likely south of the Co-op City building.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of New York City and the specific
      locations of the Dyckman Spanish 7 Day Adventist Church in Manhattan and Co-op
      City Building 32B in the Bronx, it''s reasonable to conclude that the church

      and Justice High School in Brooklyn is located south of IS 192 The Linden in
      Queens, we need to consider the geography of New York City and the relative
      positions of Brooklyn and Queens, as well as the specific locations within these
      boroughs.


      1. **Brooklyn and Queens Geography**: Brooklyn and Queens are two of the five
      boroughs of New York City. Brooklyn is located southwest of Queens. This means
      that generally, points in Brooklyn are south or southwest of points in Queens,
      but it depends on the specific locations within these boroughs.


      2. **El Puente Academy Location**: El Puente Academy is located in Williamsburg,
      Brooklyn. Williamsburg is in the northern part of Brooklyn, close to the Williamsburg
      Bridge that connects Brooklyn to Manhattan.


      3. **IS 192 The Linden Location**: IS 192 The Linden is located in Flushing,
      Queens. Flushing is in the northeastern part of Queens, near LaGuardia Airport.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that El Puente Academy is in northern Brooklyn
      and IS 192 The Linden is in northeastern Queens, we need to consider their relative
      positions. Brooklyn as a whole is generally southwest of Queens, but the specific
      locations of these two points need to be considered. El Puente Academy, being
      in northern Brooklyn, and IS 192 The Linden being in northeastern Queens, means
      El Puente Academy could potentially be north or south depending on the exact
      latitude, but generally, points in northern Brooklyn are north of points in
      northeastern Queens.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the northern location of El Puente Academy within Brooklyn

      Island, we need to consider the geography of Staten Island and the relative
      positions of these two locations. Here''s a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Understand the geography of Staten Island**: Staten Island is one of the
      five boroughs of New York City. It is located south of Manhattan and is generally
      considered the southernmost borough of the city.


      2. **Identify the locations**: The Reformed Church SI is likely located in the
      central or southern part of Staten Island. The specific location of Markham
      Gardens Building 10 is not specified, but it is part of the Markham Gardens
      housing complex, which is in the northern part of Staten Island.


      3. **Consider the relative positions**: Given the general geography of Staten
      Island and the locations of these two places, it''s likely that the Reformed
      Church SI is located south of Markham Gardens Building 10. This is because the
      Reformed Church SI is in the central or southern part of the island, while Markham
      Gardens is in the northern part.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Staten Island and the relative
      positions of the Reformed Church SI and Markham Gardens Building 10, it''s reasonable
      to conclude that the Reformed Church SI is likely located south of Markham Gardens
      Building 10. However, without exact addresses or coordinates, this is an educated
      guess based on the general layout of Staten Island.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      consider the general geography of New York City and the relative positions of
      Staten Island and Brooklyn, as well as the specific locations within these boroughs.


      1. **Staten Island and Brooklyn Geography**: Staten Island and Brooklyn are
      two of the five boroughs of New York City. Staten Island is located southwest
      of Brooklyn. This means that generally, points in Staten Island are south or
      southwest of points in Brooklyn, but it depends on the specific locations within
      these boroughs.


      2. **Terrace Playground Location**: Terrace Playground is located in the West
      Brighton neighborhood of Staten Island. This area is in the central-north part

      part of Brooklyn.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Terrace Playground is in central-north
      Staten Island and PS 207 is in southeastern Brooklyn, we need to consider their
      relative positions. Staten Island as a whole is generally southwest of Brooklyn,
      but the specific locations of these two points need to be considered. The Terrace
      Playground, being more north in Staten Island, and PS 207 being more southeast
      in Brooklyn, means the playground could potentially be north or south depending
      on the exact latitude, but generally, points in north Staten Island are north
      of points in southeast Brooklyn.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the central-north location of Terrace Playground within
      Staten Island and the southeastern location of PS 207 within Brooklyn, it''s

    c1cc3029-bf25-433d-989d-1569d84b87d8: 'To determine if Two Bridges Senior Housing
      in Manhattan is located south of Holy Trinity Church of Ukrainiane in Brooklyn,
      we need to consider the general geography of New York City and the relative
      positions of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as the specific locations within
      these boroughs.


      1. **Manhattan and Brooklyn Geography**: Manhattan and Brooklyn are two of the
      five boroughs of New York City. Manhattan is located to the northwest of Brooklyn.
      This means that generally, points in Manhattan are north or northwest of points
      in Brooklyn, but it depends on the specific locations within these boroughs.


      2. **Two Bridges Senior Housing Location**: Two Bridges Senior Housing is located
      in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, specifically in the Two Bridges neighborhood.
      This area is in the southeastern part of Manhattan.


      3. **Holy Trinity Church of Ukrainiane Location**: The Holy Trinity Church of
      Ukrainiane is located in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. Greenpoint
      is in the northwestern part of Brooklyn, close to the East River.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Given that Two Bridges Senior Housing is in southeastern
      Manhattan and the Holy Trinity Church of Ukrainiane is in northwestern Brooklyn,
      we need to consider their relative positions. Manhattan as a whole is generally
      northwest of Brooklyn, but the specific locations of these two points need to
      be considered. The Two Bridges neighborhood, being more southeast in Manhattan,
      and the Greenpoint neighborhood, being more northwest in Brooklyn, means the
      Senior Housing could potentially be north or south depending on the exact latitude,
      but generally, points in southeast Manhattan are south of points in northwest
      Brooklyn.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the southeastern location of Two Bridges Senior Housing
      within Manhattan and the northwestern location of the Holy Trinity Church of
      Ukrainiane within Brooklyn, it''s reasonable to conclude that the Two Bridges
      Senior Housing is likely south of the Holy Trinity Church of Ukrainiane in Brooklyn.
      However, the exact determination requires precise latitude comparisons, which
      aren''t provided. Based on general geographic principles, though, we can make
      an educated guess.
