      - Places in New York are generally east of places in Illinois.

      - West Caroga Lake, despite having "West" in its name, is still located in New
      York state.

      - Loon Lake in Lake County, Illinois would be in the northeastern part of Illinois.


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      - Since Illinois is west of New York, Loon Lake (in Illinois) would be west
      of West Caroga Lake (in New York).

      - Therefore, West Caroga Lake is NOT west of Loon Lake, but rather east of it.

      - West Caroga Lake is in New York state, which is in the northeastern United
      States.

      - Loon Lake (Lake County) is in Illinois, which is in the midwestern United

      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - New York is significantly east of Illinois on the US map.

      - Illinois is west of New York.


      Step 3: Since the lakes are within their respective states, they would generally
      follow the same relative positioning.

      - A lake in New York would be east of a lake in Illinois.

      - Therefore, West Caroga Lake in NY would be east of Loon Lake in Illinois.


      Step 4: The name "West Caroga Lake" might be confusing, but it''s likely named
      in relation to another local feature (perhaps an "East Caroga Lake") and not
      in relation to its national positioning.


      NO, West Caroga Lake, NY is not located west of Loon Lake, Illinois. It is located
      east of it.'

      east of locations in California.

      - Lake Worth, being in Texas, would therefore be east of Diamond Valley Lake
      in California.

      - "West of" would mean Lake Worth is further west than Diamond Valley Lake,

      - Barbee Lake is located in northern Indiana, in the northeastern part of the
      state.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions in terms of east-west orientation.

      - New York state is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest, west of New York state.


      Step 3: Compare their specific east-west positions.

      - Gardiners Bay, being on the eastern end of Long Island, is quite far east
      in the United States.

      - Barbee Lake in Indiana is significantly west of New York.


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Gardiners Bay is located on the eastern end of Long Island, New York, between
      the North and South Forks of Long Island. New York is on the east coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Barbee Lake, IN is located.

      Barbee Lake is in Indiana, which is in the Midwest region of the United States.
      Indiana is significantly west of New York.

      Since New York is on the east coast and Indiana is in the Midwest, places in
      Indiana (including Barbee Lake) are generally west of places in New York (including
      Gardiners Bay).


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Henrys Lake is in Idaho, likely in the eastern part of Idaho since it''s mentioned
      specifically.


      Step 3: Compare the geographic positions.

      - Since Idaho is west of South Dakota, and these lakes are within their respective
      states, it''s highly likely that Henrys Lake in Idaho is west of Lake Kampeska
      in South Dakota.

      - Even if Lake Kampeska is in western South Dakota and Henrys Lake is in eastern

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Little Squam Lake is in New Hampshire (NH), which is in the northeastern United
      States.

      - Higgins Lake is in Michigan (MI), which is in the north-central/midwestern
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of New Hampshire and Michigan.

      - New Hampshire is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Michigan is significantly west of New Hampshire, positioned in the Great Lakes
      region.


      Step 3: Determine relative east-west positioning.

      - Since New Hampshire is an eastern state and Michigan is more centrally located
      in the US, any lake in New Hampshire would be east of a lake in Michigan.

      - Little Squam Lake in NH would be east of Higgins Lake in MI.


      Step 4: Consider the specific question about westward positioning.

      - The question asks if Little Squam Lake is located west of Higgins Lake.

      - Based on the analysis above, Little Squam Lake is east (not west) of Higgins
      Lake.

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Otsego Lake is in New York (NY), which is in the eastern part of the United
      States.

      - Geneva Lake is in Wisconsin (WI), which is in the midwestern part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west relationship of these states.

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Wisconsin is in the Midwest, significantly west of New York.


      Step 3: Apply this general state relationship to the specific lakes.

      - Since Otsego Lake is in New York, it must be east of Wisconsin.

      - Since Geneva Lake is in Wisconsin, it must be west of New York.

      - Therefore, Otsego Lake (NY) must be east of Geneva Lake (WI), not west.

      - Canada Lake is in New York (NY) state in the eastern US

      - Lake Waubesa is in Wisconsin (WI) state in the midwestern US


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of New York and Wisconsin.

      - New York state is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Wisconsin is located in the north-central/midwestern United States, west of
      New York


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Wisconsin is significantly west of New York

      - Therefore, Lake Waubesa (in Wisconsin) would be west of Canada Lake (in New
      York)

      - This means Canada Lake is EAST of Lake Waubesa, not west of it
