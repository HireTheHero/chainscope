      is located west of Matagorda Bay in Texas, we need to compare their longitudinal
      positions, because longitude determines east-west positioning on the globe.


      **Step 1: Locate Lake Monroe, Florida**

      - Lake Monroe is located in central Florida, near the cities of Sanford and
      DeBary.

      - The approximate longitude of Lake Monroe is around **-81.3 degrees** (west).


      **Step 2: Locate Matagorda Bay, Texas**

      - Matagorda Bay is on the southeastern coast of Texas.

      - The approximate longitude of Matagorda Bay is around **-96.0 degrees** (west).


      **Step 3: Compare Longitudes**

      - The more negative the longitude (in the western hemisphere), the farther west
      the location is.

      - Lake Monroe: ~ -81.3

      - Matagorda Bay: ~ -96.0


      Since -96.0 < -81.3, Matagorda Bay is farther west than Lake Monroe.


      **Conclusion:**

      Lake Monroe is east of Matagorda Bay.

      of both places:


      1. **Willapa Bay, WA** is located in southwestern Washington state, along the
      Pacific coast. It is close to the border with Oregon and lies at a relatively
      western longitude in the continental United States.


      2. **Fairy Lake, MT** is located in Montana, specifically in the northern part
      of the state near the Bridger Mountains, northeast of Bozeman.


      3. Montana is an inland state to the east of Washington. Even though Fairy Lake
      is in western Montana, it is still considerably east of any coastal location
      in Washington.


      4. On a map, you can observe that the longitude of Willapa Bay is farther west
      than any location in Montana, including Fairy Lake.


      Therefore, based on their geographic positions:


      **NO**, Fairy Lake, MT is not located west of Willapa Bay, WA.'

      compare their longitudinal coordinates, since longitude determines east-west
      positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes, Maine.

      - This chain of lakes is located in north-central Maine, near Baxter State Park.

      - Maine is in the northeastern United States and is one of the easternmost states.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Namakagon, Wisconsin.

      - Lake Namakagon is in northwestern Wisconsin, in the Chequamegon National Forest.

      - Wisconsin is located in the north-central part of the United States, west
      of Maine.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Maine is clearly east of Wisconsin geographically.

      - Therefore, any location in Maine, including the Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes,
      is east of any location in Wisconsin, including Lake Namakagon.


      Conclusion:

      Since Maine is to the east of Wisconsin, the Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes is east

      is located west of Saguaro Lake, AZ, we need to consider the geographic locations
      (longitudes) of both lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Joe Pool Lake, TX.

      - Joe Pool Lake is located in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex area, in north-central
      Texas.

      - This places it in the eastern part of Texas.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Saguaro Lake, AZ.

      - Saguaro Lake is located in central Arizona, near Phoenix.

      - This places it in the western part of Arizona.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Texas is generally east of Arizona.

      - Therefore, a lake in eastern Texas (Joe Pool Lake) is almost certainly east
      of a lake in central Arizona (Saguaro Lake).


      Conclusion:

      Joe Pool Lake is east of Saguaro Lake.
