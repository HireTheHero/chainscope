      2. **Bighorn Mountains, WY**: These mountains are located in north-central Wyoming.


      Next, we need to ascertain their relative positions:


      - **Michigan** is east of Wyoming. Specifically, Saginaw Bay is on the eastern
      side of Michigan.

      - The **Bighorn Mountains** are situated in Wyoming, which is to the west of
      Michigan.


      Since Saginaw Bay is on the eastern side of Michigan and Wyoming is west of
      Michigan, it follows that Saginaw Bay is actually east of the Bighorn Mountains.


      Based on this information, the answer to the question "Is Saginaw Bay, MI located
      west of Bighorn Mountains, WY?" is:


      NO.'
