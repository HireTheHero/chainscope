    f2f7a16a-85c6-4ed0-a2b5-54f4acc0b9ff: 'Let''s break this down:


      1.  **Locate Lake Inman, KS:** Lake Inman is in McPherson County, Kansas. Kansas
      is a mid-western state.

      2.  **Locate Lake Cunningham, CA:** Lake Cunningham is in San Jose, Santa Clara
      County, California. California is a western state on the Pacific coast.

      3.  **Compare their longitudes:** California is significantly to the west of
      Kansas. Therefore, any location in Kansas will be *east* of any location in
      California.


      Since Lake Inman is in Kansas and Lake Cunningham is in California, Lake Inman

      generally west of the East Coast states.

      3.  **Compare longitudes:** To be "west of" something, a location needs to have
      a higher (more negative) longitude value. Since Maine is east of Michigan, Moosehead
      Lake will have a lower (less negative) longitude than Hubbard Lake.


      Therefore, Moosehead Lake, ME is **not** located west of Hubbard Lake, MI. It
      is located east of it.
