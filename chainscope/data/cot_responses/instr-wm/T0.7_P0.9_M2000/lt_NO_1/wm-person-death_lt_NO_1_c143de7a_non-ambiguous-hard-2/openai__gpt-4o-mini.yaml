      2. **Research John of Islay**: John of Islay, also known as John MacDonald,

      He died on August 15, 1038.

      he is known to have been a figure associated with the early medieval period.
      However, I do not have a specific date of death readily available for him.


      Now, to determine if Nicolas Psaume died at an earlier date than Stephen I of
      Hungary, we would need to know the date of Nicolas Psaume''s death. Since that
      information is not clear or available, we cannot definitively compare the two
      dates.


      Based on the information at hand, since we cannot confirm the date of death
      for Nicolas Psaume, I cannot definitively say "YES" or "NO" to the question.
