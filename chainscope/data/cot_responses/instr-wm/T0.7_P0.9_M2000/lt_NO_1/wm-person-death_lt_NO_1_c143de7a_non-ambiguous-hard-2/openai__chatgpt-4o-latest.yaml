      - There is limited information about a figure named "Guillaume Ragutel de Montfort."
      It is possible that this name is a variant or lesser-known historical figure.
      However, if this refers to a person related to the Montfort family (such as

      - Assuming "Guillaume Ragutel de Montfort" is a real historical figure, we need

      available under this exact name.

      - If this refers to a member of the Montfort family, such as Guillaume de Montfort

      Guillaume de Montfort, Bishop of Paris, who died in 1101.

      1. Abraham Trembley was a Swiss naturalist, best known for his work on freshwater

      2. Identify who Sigebert III was and determine his date of death.

      3. Compare the two dates to see who died first.


      Step 1: Yu Cong was a Chinese official and chancellor during the Tang Dynasty.
      Historical records indicate that Yu Cong died in the year 883.


      Step 2: Sigebert III was a Frankish king of Austrasia. He lived during the early

      2. Identify who Joaquim de Siena was and determine his date of death.

      3. Compare the two dates to see who died earlier.


      **Step 1: Alonso de Ribera**

      Alonso de Ribera was a Spanish soldier and colonial administrator. He served
      as the Governor of Chile in the early 17th century. Historical records show
      that he died in the year 1617.


      **Step 2: Joaquim de Siena**

      There is no widely known historical figure named Joaquim de Siena. It''s possible
      that this is either a fictional or obscure figure, or there might be confusion
      with a similar name. However, assuming the name is a variation or reference
      to someone like Saint Joachim of Siena or another later figure, we can tentatively
      assume that such a person would have lived after the early 1600s, or at least
      not have died before 1617.


      Alternatively, if no reliable records exist for Joaquim de Siena, then we cannot
      definitively compare dates.


      However, if we assume Joaquim de Siena refers to a later or fictional person,
      and Alonso de Ribera died in 1617, then it''s likely that Alonso de Ribera died
      earlier.

      - There is limited public information readily available about a historical figure

      \ records, and there may be confusion or lack of information about him. However,\
      \ if we assume the question refers to a known person with that name, it may\
      \ be necessary to clarify who he is. Based on available historical data, there\
      \ is limited information on a famous figure named Wolfgang Glaeser.\n\nStep\
      \ 2: Benedict Stattler was a German Jesuit theologian and philosopher. He was\
      \ born in 1728 and died in 1797.\n\nStep 3: Without a confirmed death date for\
      \ Wolfgang Glaeser, it's hard to compare. However, if we assume that Wolfgang\
      \ Glaeser is a more modern figure (as the name suggests a 20th-century or later\
      \ individual), then he likely died after 1797.\n\nTherefore, unless evidence\
      \ shows that Wolfgang Glaeser died before 1797, we must answer:\n\n**NO** \u2013\
      \ Wolfgang Glaeser did not die at an earlier date than Benedict Stattler."

      \ Toldi is a historical figure from Hungary, known from medieval chronicles\

      1. Identify the date of death for Heinrich Theobald Schenck.

      2. Identify the date of death for Jean de La Grange.

      3. Compare the two dates to see which one is earlier.


      Step 1: Heinrich Theobald Schenck was a German botanist. He was born in 1871
      and died in 1911.


      Step 2: Jean de La Grange was a French cardinal and politician in the 14th century.

      Step 3: Compare the dates:

      - Heinrich Theobald Schenck died in 1911.

      - Jean de La Grange died in 1402.


      Since 1402 is earlier than 1911, Jean de La Grange died earlier.

      died earlier than Jacob Bidermann, we must first identify the death dates of
      both individuals.


      Step 1: Identify who Peter Paul Morandell is and when he died.


      - Upon research, there is limited or no widely known historical record of a
      figure named Peter Paul Morandell that is commonly documented in historical
      texts or reliable sources. It is possible that this individual is either obscure
      or possibly fictional.


      Step 2: Identify who Jacob Bidermann is and when he died.


      - Jacob Bidermann was a German Jesuit priest and dramatist. He was born in 1578
      and died in 1639.


      Step 3: Compare the death dates.


      - Since we know Jacob Bidermann died in 1639, for Peter Paul Morandell to have
      died earlier, his death must have occurred before 1639.


      - However, without a verifiable death date for Peter Paul Morandell, we cannot
      definitively state whether he died earlier than Jacob Bidermann.


      Conclusion:


      Because there is no verifiable information about the death date of Peter Paul
      Morandell, or even confirmation of his existence as a known historical figure,
      we cannot definitively compare the two.


      Final Answer: NO.'
