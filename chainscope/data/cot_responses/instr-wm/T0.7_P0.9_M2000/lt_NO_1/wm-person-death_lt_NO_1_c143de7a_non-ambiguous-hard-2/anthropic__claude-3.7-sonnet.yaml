      Abdur Rahman bin Awf was one of the companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad
      and among the ten promised Paradise. He died around 652 CE (32 AH in the Islamic
      calendar).


      Step 2: Identify who Poppaea Sabina was and when she died.

      Poppaea Sabina was the second wife of Roman Emperor Nero. Historical records
      indicate she died in 65 CE.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Abdur Rahman bin Awf died around 652 CE.

      Poppaea Sabina died around 65 CE.


      Step 4: Determine which date came first.

      65 CE is earlier than 652 CE.


      Therefore, Poppaea Sabina died before Abdur Rahman bin Awf, not the other way
      around.

      65 CE came before 652 CE, meaning Poppaea Sabina died before Abdur Rahman bin

      Wait - I need to double-check my facts. Looking more carefully at the dates:

      - Abdur Rahman bin Awf died in 652 CE (or possibly 654 CE)

      - Actually, I made an error. Abdur Rahman bin Awf died in 32 AH, which converts
      to approximately 652-653 CE


      So the correct comparison:

      - Abdur Rahman bin Awf: died around 652 CE

      - Poppaea Sabina: died in 65 CE


      Since 65 CE is earlier than 652 CE, Poppaea Sabina died at an earlier date than
      Abdur Rahman bin Awf.


      NO, Abdur Rahman bin Awf did not die at an earlier date than Poppaea Sabina.'

      Step 4: Determine if Deussen died at an earlier date than Sala.

      Since Deussen died in 1919, which is later than Sala''s death in 1637, Deussen
      did NOT die at an earlier date than Sala.


      NO'

      when each person died.


      Step 1: Identify when Paul Deussen died.

      Paul Deussen was a German Indologist and philosopher who lived from 1845 to
      1919.


      Step 2: Identify when Angelo Sala died.

      Angelo Sala was an Italian physician and chemist who lived from 1576 to 1637.


      Step 3: Compare the death dates.

      - Paul Deussen died in 1919

      - Angelo Sala died in 1637


      Step 4: Determine which death occurred earlier.

      1637 is earlier than 1919, so Angelo Sala died at an earlier date than Paul
      Deussen, not the other way around.


      NO, Paul Deussen did not die at an earlier date than Angelo Sala.'
    f85a6cb5-4a75-46e5-8a39-bf3f5d92c684: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      who died earlier, Paul Deussen or Angelo Sala.


      Step 1: Find when Paul Deussen lived and died.

      Paul Deussen was a German Indologist and philosopher who lived from 1845 to
      1919.


      Step 2: Find when Angelo Sala lived and died.

      Angelo Sala was an Italian physician and chemist who lived from 1576 to 1637.


      Step 3: Compare their death dates.

      - Paul Deussen died in 1919

      - Angelo Sala died in 1637


      Step 4: Determine who died earlier.

      1637 is earlier than 1919, so Angelo Sala died earlier than Paul Deussen.


      Since the question asks if Paul Deussen died at an earlier date than Angelo
      Sala, and we''ve established that Angelo Sala died earlier (1637) than Paul
      Deussen (1919), the answer is:

      when each person died and comparing the dates.


      Step 1: Identify Karl Joseph Eberth.

      Karl Joseph Eberth was a German pathologist and bacteriologist who lived from
      1835 to 1926. He died in 1926.


      Step 2: Identify Pierre Moulu.

      Pierre Moulu was a French Renaissance composer who lived approximately from
      1480 to 1550. He is believed to have died around 1550.


      Step 3: Compare the death dates.

      - Karl Joseph Eberth died in 1926

      - Pierre Moulu died around 1550


      Step 4: Determine which death occurred earlier.

      1550 is earlier than 1926 by approximately 376 years.


      Since Pierre Moulu died in the 16th century (around 1550) and Karl Joseph Eberth
      died in the 20th century (1926), Moulu died at an earlier date.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO

      (Karl Joseph Eberth did not die at an earlier date than Pierre Moulu; it was
      the opposite.)'

      - Christoph Christian von Dabelow was a German jurist who lived from 1768 to
      1830.

      died in 1830 and John V died in 1507, Dabelow did NOT die earlier than John
      V.

      Domenico Grimani was a Venetian cardinal and patron of the arts who died on
      August 27, 1523.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      J. Neil Schulman died in 2019, while Domenico Grimani died in 1523.

      2019 is later than 1523 (by nearly 500 years).


      Step 4: Determine if Schulman died at an earlier date than Grimani.

      Since 2019 is later than 1523, Schulman did NOT die at an earlier date than
      Grimani. In fact, he died almost 500 years after Grimani.

      - He died on August 10, 1575.

      - Nicolas Psaume died in 1575

      Wait, I need to be careful about the question wording. The question asks if
      Levita died at an "earlier date" than Elisabeth.


      Since 1549 is earlier than either 1662 or 1680, the answer is:


      YES. Elia Levita did die at an earlier date than Elisabeth of Bohemia.'
    fddd3cbe-3d60-49da-9252-71f4bc78b85e: 'I need to determine when Elia Levita and
      Elisabeth of Bohemia died, and then compare these dates.


      Step 1: Identify when Elia Levita died.

      Elia Levita was a Renaissance Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer who died in
      1549.


      Step 2: Identify when Elisabeth of Bohemia died.

      Elisabeth of Bohemia (also known as Elisabeth of the Palatinate or Princess
      Elisabeth) was a philosopher who corresponded with Descartes. She died in 1680.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Elia Levita died in 1549.

      Elisabeth of Bohemia died in 1680.

      1549 is earlier than 1680.


      Therefore, Elia Levita died at an earlier date than Elisabeth of Bohemia.


      YES'

      Franz Ziereis was the commandant of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp
      during World War II. He was shot while attempting to escape after the liberation
      of the camp and died on May 24, 1945, from his wounds.

      James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond (also known as "The White Earl") was an Anglo-Irish
      nobleman who died on August 23, 1452.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Franz Ziereis died in 1945.

      James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond died in 1452.

      who died earlier.


      Step 1: Identify when John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury died.

      John Montacute (also spelled Montagu) was executed on January 5, 1400 CE. He
      was involved in the Epiphany Rising against King Henry IV of England and was
      beheaded as a result.


      Step 2: Identify when Widukind of Corvey died.

      Widukind of Corvey was a Saxon historian who wrote the "Res gestae saxonicae"
      (Deeds of the Saxons). He died around 973 CE, though some sources place his
      death as late as circa 1004 CE.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Even using the latest possible estimate for Widukind''s death (c. 1004 CE),
      this would still be before John Montacute''s death in 1400 CE.


      Step 4: Determine the answer.

      Since Widukind of Corvey (died c. 973-1004 CE) died before John Montacute (died
      1400 CE), John Montacute did NOT die at an earlier date than Widukind.

      1639 is earlier than 1976, so Bidermann died before Morandell.


      The question asks if Morandell died at an earlier date than Bidermann. Since
      Morandell died in 1976 and Bidermann died in 1639, Morandell did NOT die earlier
      than Bidermann.

      - Jakob Bagge died in 1577

      Since 1151 comes before 1577 chronologically, Adeliza of Louvain died 426 years
      before Jakob Bagge.


      NO, Jakob Bagge did not die at an earlier date than Adeliza of Louvain. Adeliza
      died earlier.'

      when each historical figure died.


      Step 1: Identify when Jakob Bagge died.

      Jakob Bagge was a Swedish naval officer who lived in the 16th century. He died
      on June 25, 1577.


      Step 2: Identify when Adeliza of Louvain died.

      Adeliza of Louvain (also known as Adelaide or Adelicia) was the second wife
      of King Henry I of England. She died on April 23, 1151.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Jakob Bagge died in 1577, while Adeliza of Louvain died in 1151.

      1577 comes after 1151 chronologically.


      Step 4: Determine if Bagge died at an earlier date than Adeliza.

      Since 1577 is later than 1151, Jakob Bagge did NOT die at an earlier date than
      Adeliza of Louvain. In fact, he died approximately 426 years after her.


      NO'
