    f9a22c4f-b94c-4f8e-a580-f580b9786f04: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me find when John Montacute died:

      - John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury died on January 5, 1400

      - He was executed during the Epiphany Rising against Henry IV of England


      2. Next, let me find when Widukind of Corvey died:

      - Widukind of Corvey died around 973 CE

      - He was a Saxon chronicler who wrote the Res gestae saxonicae


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Widukind died in 973

      - Montacute died in 1400

      - 973 comes before 1400


      4. Therefore, Widukind died first, not Montacute


      NO (John Montacute did not die at an earlier date than Widukind)'
