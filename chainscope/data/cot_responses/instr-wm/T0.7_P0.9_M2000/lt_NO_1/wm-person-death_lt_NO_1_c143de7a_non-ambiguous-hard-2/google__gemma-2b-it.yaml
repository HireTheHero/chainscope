      **Step 1:**

      The passage does not specify the date of Alexander VI''s death, only that he
      died at an earlier date than Svein Knutsson.


      **Step 2:**

      Svein Knutsson died in 1205.


      **Step 3:**

      The passage does not provide the date of Alexander VI''s death, so we cannot
      determine if it was earlier or later than Svein Knutsson.
