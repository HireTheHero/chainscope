      1. **Karl Joseph Eberth**: He was a German pathologist and bacteriologist, best

      was born in 1835 and died in 1926.

      half of the 16th century, but his exact death date is unknown.

      2. John V, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, was a historical figure who lived from 1439

      - Christoph Christian von Dabelow died in 1828.

      - John V, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, died in 1507.

      the last King of Deheubarth. Nest ferch Rhys lived during the late 11th and
      early 12th centuries and is believed to have died around 1136.

      - Richard de Bury died in 1345.

      the first Bishop of Nusco. He is known to have died in the year 1093.


      Without a clear historical record or documentation of the death date for Rupert
      of Nassau-Sonnenberg, it is impossible to definitively compare the two dates.
      However, if we assume Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg is not a well-documented historical
      figure, it would be speculative to assert his death date relative to Amatus
      of Nusco''s without further evidence.


      Given the lack of information on Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg, the most accurate
      answer based on available information is:


      NO.'
    d1906cd4-28e4-47bf-8568-66aabcb436ba: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the death dates of both Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg and Amatus of Nusco.


      1. **Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg**: Historical records indicate that Rupert
      of Nassau-Sonnenberg died in the year 1390.


      2. **Amatus of Nusco**: Amatus of Nusco, who was a monk and historian, is believed
      to have died around the year 1090.


      Now, comparing the two dates:

      - Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg died in 1390.

      - Amatus of Nusco died around 1090.


      Since 1090 is earlier than 1390, Amatus of Nusco died earlier than Rupert of
      Nassau-Sonnenberg.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'

      died earlier than Amatus of Nusco, we need to establish the death dates for
      both individuals.


      1. **Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg:** He was a historical figure from the 14th
      and 15th centuries, specifically known to have died in 1390.


      2. **Amatus of Nusco:** He was an Italian bishop and saint from the 11th century,
      known to have died in 1093.


      Comparing the two death dates:


      - Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg died in 1390.

      - Amatus of Nusco died in 1093.


      Since 1093 is earlier than 1390, Amatus of Nusco died at an earlier date than
      Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg.

      determine the death dates of both historical figures.


      1. **Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg**: There is limited information about this
      specific figure, but assuming you are referring to Rupert (or Ruprecht) of Nassau,
      a medieval noble, historical records suggest he lived during the 13th or 14th
      century. Without precise dates, it is challenging to pinpoint his exact death
      date.


      2. **Amatus of Nusco**: Amatus of Nusco was an Italian Benedictine monk and
      bishop who lived during the 11th century. He is believed to have died around
      1093.


      Given that Amatus of Nusco died in the 11th century, and assuming Rupert of
      Nassau-Sonnenberg refers to a figure from the 13th or 14th century, it is reasonable
      to conclude that Amatus of Nusco died earlier.
