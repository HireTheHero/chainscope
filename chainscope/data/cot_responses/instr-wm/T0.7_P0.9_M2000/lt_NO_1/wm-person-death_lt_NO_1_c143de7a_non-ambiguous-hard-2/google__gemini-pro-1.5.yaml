    fd5a1e6c-4e48-4209-aa46-c4f6d6cecf43: '* **Step 1: Find the death date of Alonso
      de Ribera.**  Alonso de Ribera died in 1617.


      * **Step 2: Find the death date of Joaquim de Siena.** Joaquim de Siena appears
      to be a fictional character; there''s no historical record of anyone by that
      name with a connection to Alonso de Ribera or the relevant historical period.  Therefore,
      we cannot determine their death date.


      * **Step 3: Compare the death dates.** Since we don''t have a death date for
      Joaquim de Siena, we cannot compare the two.


      **Answer:** NO
