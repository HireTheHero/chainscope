      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - South Dakota is east of Utah

      - Box Elder, SD is further east than Murray, UT

      - This means Box Elder, SD is east of Murray, UT, not west


      4. Therefore, the answer is: NO


      The answer is NO, Box Elder, SD is not located west of Murray, UT.'

    3fd3ba4c-4d08-4422-a4f4-acf60d85cc14: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. La Vergne is a city in Tennessee, located near Nashville in the central part
      of the state.


      2. Hurst is a city in Texas, located in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.


      3. Tennessee is located east of Texas in the United States.


      4. Since Tennessee is east of Texas, any city in Tennessee (like La Vergne)
      will be east of any city in Texas (like Hurst).


      5. Therefore, La Vergne is NOT west of Hurst.

      location. After checking, I cannot find a definitive location for a place called
      "Whiskey Creek, FL".


      3. However, even without a precise location for Whiskey Creek, I can use the
      known location of Cascades, VA.


      4. Virginia is located on the East Coast, east of the center of the United States.


      5. Florida is also located on the East Coast, but further south.


      6. Since both locations are on the East Coast, their east-west positioning will
      depend on their specific coordinates.


      7. Looking at a map, Cascades, VA is actually east of Florida.


      8. Therefore, Cascades, VA is NOT west of any location in Florida.

      Knightsville is in west-central Indiana, in Clay County

      Helotes is in south-central Texas, near San Antonio


      Comparing their locations:

      - Indiana is east of Texas

      - Knightsville is further east in Indiana

      - Helotes is in western Texas


      Therefore, Knightsville is definitely east of Helotes.

      1. First, locate Brasher Falls, NY:

      - Brasher Falls is in northern New York state

      - It is near the border with Canada

      - Specifically, it is in St. Lawrence County, in the northeastern part of New
      York


      2. Next, locate Sault Ste. Marie, MI:

      - This city is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan

      - It is also near the Canadian border

      - It sits at the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula


      3. Compare their relative positions:

      - Brasher Falls is east of Sault Ste. Marie

      - Brasher Falls is in New York, which is east of Michigan

      - If you drew a line between these two points, it would run from west to east
