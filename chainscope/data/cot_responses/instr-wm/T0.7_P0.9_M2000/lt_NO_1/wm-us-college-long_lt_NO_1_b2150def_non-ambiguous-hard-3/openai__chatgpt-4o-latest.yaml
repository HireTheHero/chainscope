      College in Georgia is located west of Jarvis Christian College in Texas, we
      need to consider the geographic locations (longitude) of both colleges.


      Step 1: Identify where Altamaha Technical College is located.

      - Altamaha Technical College is located in Jesup, Georgia.


      Step 2: Identify where Jarvis Christian College is located.

      - Jarvis Christian College is located in Hawkins, Texas.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions of Georgia and Texas on the map.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern region of the United States.

      - Texas is located to the west of Georgia, in the south-central region of the
      United States.


      Step 4: Understand longitude.

      - Longitude increases as you move west across the United States.

      - Therefore, any location in Georgia will generally have a smaller (more eastern)
      longitude value than a location in Texas.


      Step 5: Apply that to the two colleges.

      - Since Jesup, GA (Altamaha Technical College) is in Georgia, and Hawkins, TX
      (Jarvis Christian College) is in Texas, Jesup is east of Hawkins.


      Therefore, Altamaha Technical College is located east of Jarvis Christian College.

      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Kentucky is in the Eastern Time Zone (and parts in Central), and lies east
      of Kansas.

      - Kansas is located further west than Kentucky in the Central Time Zone.


      Therefore, Springfield, KY (St. Catharine College) is east of Wichita, KS (Friends
      University).

      (ODU), located in Norfolk, Virginia, is west of Southeast Kentucky Community
      and Technical College (SKCTC), located in Cumberland, Kentucky, we need to consider
      the relative longitudes of both locations.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Old Dominion University.

      - ODU is located in Norfolk, Virginia, which is in the southeastern part of
      Virginia, near the Atlantic coast.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical
      College.

      - SKCTC is located in Cumberland, Kentucky, which is in southeastern Kentucky,

      Step 3: Understand relative positions.

      - Norfolk, Virginia is on the eastern edge of Virginia.

      - Cumberland, Kentucky is inland and west of the Virginia coast.


      Step 4: Determine geographic relation.

      - Since Norfolk is on the eastern seaboard and Cumberland is further inland,
      it is reasonable to conclude that Cumberland, KY (SKCTC) is located west of
      Norfolk, VA (ODU).

      in Virginia is located west of Arkansas State University in Paragould, Arkansas,
      we need to compare their geographical longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Hampton University.

      - Hampton University is located in Hampton, Virginia.

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Arkansas State University in Paragould.

      - Paragould is a city in northeastern Arkansas.

      - Arkansas is located west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider the general longitude.

      - Longitude increases as you move west.

      - Virginia has a lower (more eastern) longitude than Arkansas.


      Step 4: Conclusion.

      - Since Hampton, VA is in the eastern part of the US and Paragould, AR is further
      west, Hampton University is east of Arkansas State University in Paragould.

      \ NY, Middlesex University (in Waltham) is not west of Syracuse University.\n\
      \n**Answer: NO**"
    cf6d63cd-8f3f-4b20-bdb4-0b4ba4364b1c: "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\
      \n1. **Identify the locations of the two institutions:**\n\n   - **Middlesex\
      \ University, MA**: First, we clarify that there is no current institution officially\
      \ called \"Middlesex University\" in Massachusetts. However, there is a \"Middlesex\
      \ Community College\" in Massachusetts, with campuses in Bedford and Lowell.\
      \ We assume this is what is being referred to.\n\n   - **Syracuse University\
      \ School of Education, NY**: This is a well-known division of Syracuse University,\
      \ located in Syracuse, New York.\n\n2. **Determine geographical coordinates\
      \ or relative positions:**\n\n   - **Bedford/Lowell, MA**: These towns are in\
      \ eastern Massachusetts, near Boston. They are located in the eastern part of\
      \ the state.\n\n   - **Syracuse, NY**: Located in central New York state.\n\n\
      3. **Compare longitudinal positions (east-west alignment):**\n\n   - Massachusetts\
      \ is generally east of New York state.\n\n   - Specifically, Lowell and Bedford,\
      \ MA are significantly east of Syracuse, NY.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since\
      \ Bedford/Lowell, MA (Middlesex Community College) is east of Syracuse, NY,\
      \ it is **not** located west of Syracuse.\n\nAnswer: **NO**."
    f6c7aee0-08c2-499e-b2cd-d3f2a58cd57f: "To determine whether Middlesex University,\
      \ MA is located west of Syracuse University School of Education, NY, let's break\
      \ the problem down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify Locations**:\n   - Syracuse\
      \ University is located in Syracuse, New York.\n   - Middlesex University is\
      \ not a commonly known institution in Massachusetts. However, there may be confusion\
      \ with \"Middlesex Community College\" or a fictional/incorrect reference to\
      \ a university in Middlesex County, MA. For the purpose of this question, we\
      \ will assume it refers to a college or university in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.\n\
      \n2. **Find Geographic Coordinates or General Location**:\n   - Syracuse, NY\
      \ is located in central New York State, at approximately longitude 76.1\xB0\
      W.\n   - Middlesex County, MA (e.g., Lowell or Bedford, Massachusetts) is located\
      \ in eastern Massachusetts, at approximately longitude 71.3\xB0W.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ Longitudes**:\n   - Locations with smaller (less negative) longitudes are\
      \ further west.\n   - Syracuse, NY (76.1\xB0W) is further west than Middlesex\
      \ County, MA (71.3\xB0W).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Since Middlesex County,\
      \ MA is east of Syracuse, NY, the institution referred to as \"Middlesex University,\
      \ MA\" would also be east of Syracuse University.\n\nFinal Answer: NO."
