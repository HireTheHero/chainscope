      I''ve identified the central question: comparing the geographical positions
      of Williston State College and Eastern Washington University. My next step is
      pinpointing the specific locations of these two institutions. I''m focusing
      on their names to begin the process.



      **Pinpointing Specific Locations**


      I''ve successfully identified the locations, now down to the city and state
      of both institutions. Next, I need to compare their geographical positions.
      Recalling US geography, I know Washington is on the West Coast, and North Dakota
      is in the Midwest. This allows me to derive the core comparison.



      **Evaluating Relative Longitude**


      I''ve finalized the data gathering and comparison of geographical positions.
      I now need to synthesize my findings. I am preparing a step-by-step reasoning
      to confirm my answer, taking into consideration the question''s phrasing. Finally,
      I will provide a simple "YES" or "NO" response. I am confident in my analysis.

      the city of Williston, in the state of North Dakota (ND).

      2.  **Locate Eastern Washington University:** Eastern Washington University
      is located in the city of Cheney, in the state of Washington (WA).

      3.  **Compare the states:** The state of Washington is on the Pacific coast
      of the United States. The state of North Dakota is in the Upper Midwest region.

      4.  **Determine relative position:** On a map of the United States, the entire
      state of Washington is located to the west of the entire state of North Dakota.
      Therefore, any location in North Dakota is east of any location in Washington.

      5.  **Conclusion:** Williston State College, ND is located to the *east* of
      Eastern Washington University, WA.

      GA. Therefore, Jarvis Christian College is west of Altamaha Technical College.



      **Revising Geographical Conclusion**


      I''ve revised my understanding of the geographical relationship.  The initial
      analysis was incorrect. By comparing the states, I now recognize that Hawkins,
      TX is west of Jesup, GA. This confirms that Jarvis Christian College is west
      of Altamaha Technical College, which is now Coastal Pines Tech. The earlier
      reasoning was flawed; I''ve corrected it.



      **Formulating the Final Response**


      I''ve carefully revisited the previous steps to consolidate the response. Step
      1 confirmed Coastal Pines Tech''s Jesup, GA location, and Step 2 pinpointed
      Jarvis Christian College in Hawkins, TX. Step 3 highlighted Georgia''s eastern
      position relative to Texas, solidifying that Jesup is east of Hawkins. The final
      conclusion will be clearly formulated, answering the initial geographical question.

      \ Bellarmine University is located in Louisville, Kentucky. The longitude of\
      \ Louisville, KY is approximately 85.7\xB0 W.\n\n3.  **Finally, we compare the\
      \ longitudes.** For locations in the Western Hemisphere, a place is \"west\"\
      \ of another if it has a larger longitude value (e.g., 85.7\xB0 W is west of\
      \ 77.1\xB0 W). Since 85.7 is a larger number than 77.1, Bellarmine University\

      needed to make the geographical comparison.



      **Establishing Geographical Relationships**


      I''ve completed the geographical analysis, systematically pinpointing both locations
      and comparing their positions relative to each other. Alabama lies east of Texas,
      making Troy, AL, east of Tyler, TX. Therefore, the answer is no, Troy University
      is not west of the University of Texas at Tyler. The conclusion is now fully
      solidified.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of Troy University:** Troy University is located
      in the city of Troy, in the state of Alabama (AL).

      2.  **Identify the location of the University of Texas at Tyler:** The University
      of Texas at Tyler is located in the city of Tyler, in the state of Texas (TX).

      3.  **Compare the geographical positions of the two states:** The state of Alabama
      is located to the east of the state of Texas on a map of the United States.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since Troy, Alabama, is east of Tyler, Texas, it is not
      west of it.

      (GMC) is west of Dallas Baptist University (DBU). My initial step is to gather
      the geographical coordinates for both locations to compare them. The goal is
      to determine a definitive answer by examining the relative longitude of the
      two universities.



      **Mapping Out the Details**


      I''ve successfully pinpointed the cities: Milledgeville, Georgia, and Dallas,
      Texas. Now, the crucial phase is comparing their longitudes. I intend to move
      on to Step 3: comparing the longitudinal positions, and then Step 4: forming
      the definitive answer.



      **Evaluating the Geographical Relationship**


      I''ve now reached Step 3: comparing the longitudes. Analyzing their locations,
      I''ve determined Georgia is east of Texas. Thus, GMC is *not* west of DBU. My
      next step is to formulate the final answer, with a definitive ''no''.



      **Refining the Approach**


      I''ve reviewed the complete process. Step 3, the comparison, has been thoroughly
      analyzed; I considered relative positioning and derived that Texas is west of
      Georgia. Consequently, I see a need to explicitly state the final conclusion:
      GMC is not west of DBU. My work is nearly complete, awaiting final presentation
      formatting.



      **Concluding the Investigation**


      I''ve meticulously evaluated each step, culminating in the final determination.
      The location comparisons are complete, and the geographical relationship established.
      The answer is a simple "NO", meticulously derived from the comparative longitude
      analysis, following the step-by-step approach as requested.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Find the location of Georgia Military College:** The main campus is located
      in Milledgeville, Georgia.

      2.  **Find the location of Dallas Baptist University:** It is located in Dallas,
      Texas.

      3.  **Compare the two locations:** On a map of the United States, the state
      of Georgia is located to the east of the state of Texas.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, Georgia Military College in Georgia is located
      east of Dallas Baptist University in Texas, not west of it.

      My initial assessment focused on the core question: Determining if SUNY Oneonta
      is west of Judson University. To approach this, I began by deconstructing the
      prompt. I identified the primary entities: SUNY Oneonta in New York and Judson
      University. Then, I considered that a simple map or geographical data is needed
      for verification.



      **Evaluating Locational Relationships**


      I''m now zeroing in on the specific cities. I''ve pinpointed Oneonta, NY and
      Elgin, IL as our key comparison points. My focus has shifted to the ''west of''
      aspect, which translates to longitude. I''m recalling general US geography to
      determine if New York is west of Illinois. This will provide the answer I seek.



      **Refining the Comparative Analysis**


      My thinking has progressed to the heart of the geographical comparison. I''ve
      pinpointed the key locations: Oneonta, NY, and Elgin, IL. Now, my focus is the
      ''west of'' criterion, which I recognize as a longitude issue. I''m leveraging
      my existing US geographical knowledge. Specifically, I''m mentally visualizing
      the relative positions of New York and Illinois to quickly determine the correct
      relationship.


      I''m now confident in the methodology, focusing on dissecting the initial question.
      I''ve broken down the locations and the comparative term "west of". In reviewing
      my assumptions, I''m noting that the final response depends on a clear understanding
      of US geography.


      I''ve clarified the exact meaning of "west of" concerning latitude and longitude,
      as I recall the location of Elgin in relation to Oneonta. From my understanding
      of US geography, I know that Elgin is west of Oneonta, so I''ll need to answer
      the user accordingly. I''m formulating the steps for a succinct explanation.



      **Synthesizing the Geographical Evidence**


      I''m now integrating the geographical data. I''ve dissected the prompt, establishing
      that I need to determine if Oneonta, NY, is west of Elgin, IL. My focus has
      narrowed to longitude, and US geography confirms that Illinois is indeed west
      of New York. From this I can now respond correctly.

      located in Elgin, Illinois.

      3.  **Compare the locations:** The state of Illinois is geographically located
      to the west of the state of New York.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, Oneonta, New York is east of Elgin, Illinois.
      The statement that SUNY Oneonta is west of Judson University is false.

      \nI've established the primary question: determining if Bentley University lies\
      \ west of Cornerstone University, a straightforward geographical query. My focus\
      \ is now on breaking down the question's components to pinpoint the necessary\
      \ steps for a definitive \"YES\" or \"NO\" response.\n\n\n**Confirming Geographical\
      \ Positions**\n\nI've gathered the necessary data points: Waltham, MA's longitude\
      \ at approximately 71.23\xB0 W and Grand Rapids, MI's longitude at around 85.67\xB0\
      \ W. A quick comparison reveals that Grand Rapids is significantly west of Waltham,\
      \ and therefore west of Bentley University. So, I need to finalize the response.\n\
      \n\n**Formulating a Definitive Answer**\n\nI've carefully considered the geographical\
      \ positions. Determining longitude values for Bentley University in Waltham,\
      \ MA, and Cornerstone University in Grand Rapids, MI was straightforward. Comparing\
      \ those values (71.23\xB0 W vs. 85.67\xB0 W) I found Cornerstone is farther\
      \ west. Thus, the final answer must be 'No' because Bentley isn't west of Cornerstone.\n\
      \n\n**Refining the Response Structure**\n\nI've finalized my geographical analysis\

      I''ve meticulously analyzed the geographical locations, using Montgomery, AL
      and Jacksonville, TX as the key comparison points. While the initial goal was
      determining whether the locations'' longitudes confirmed the statement, my refined
      analysis involved comparing those coordinates. I''ve concluded that the relationship
      between the two locations is the opposite of the user''s inquiry, confirming
      the conclusion: Air University is not west of Lon Morris College.

      I''ve just finished the meticulous step-by-step reasoning. I pinpointed the
      locations and compared them. I found that the statement "Regis University is
      west of BYU Honors Program" is false because Denver, Colorado, is east of Provo,
      Utah. This conclusive answer satisfies the initial query.



      **Analyzing Spatial Orientation**


      I''ve streamlined my analysis by comparing city and state pairs. Denver, Colorado,
      and Provo, Utah, are the two points of reference. Visualizing their positions,
      I''m confident that Denver lies east of Provo. Consequently, the initial proposition
      is false. To provide a definitive answer, I will phrase it as a simple "No"
      to the question of Regis University''s relative positioning.

      of D''Youville University and Grand Valley State University. Now, I''m identifying
      the specific entities involved, noting that D''Youville is in New York and Grand
      Valley State is in Michigan. Next, I''ll need to consider the locations of each
      university.



      **Analyzing Geographical Coordinates**


      I''ve confirmed the locations: Buffalo, NY, and Allendale, MI. My next step
      is to evaluate their relative longitudes, comparing Buffalo and Allendale''s
      positions. Thinking about it more simply, I know Michigan is west of New York,
      and Allendale is in the western half of Michigan, which should easily answer
      the question.



      **Formulating the Reasoning**


      I''m now formalizing the step-by-step reasoning. I will begin by stating the
      core question and listing the known facts about each university''s location.
      Then, I will detail the comparative geographical analysis of Buffalo and Allendale,
      culminating in the final determination about the relative east-west positions,
      which is east of, and the final answer to the original question.



      **Concluding the Analysis**


      I''ve methodically processed the information. I''ve confirmed D''Youville''s
      Buffalo location and Grand Valley State''s Allendale location. Comparing their
      geographical positions, I determined that Michigan is west of New York, and
      Allendale is west of Buffalo. Finally, I''ve clarified that, in answer to the
      question, D''Youville is *not* west of Grand Valley.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate D''Youville University:** D''Youville University is located in
      Buffalo, New York.

      2.  **Locate Grand Valley State University:** Grand Valley State University''s
      main campus is in Allendale, Michigan.

      3.  **Compare the locations:** Buffalo, NY, is in the far western part of New
      York State. Allendale, MI, is in the western part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.

      4.  **Determine relative position:** The state of Michigan is geographically
      west of the state of New York. Therefore, Allendale, Michigan is located west
      of Buffalo, New York. This means D''Youville University is to the *east* of
      Grand Valley State University.

      position of the two universities. My initial step involves breaking down each
      location. The University of West Alabama is definitively in Alabama, according
      to the provided data. Next, I''ll process the location of the University of
      Texas at Arlington.



      **Pinpointing the Solution**


      I''ve now pinpointed the geographical challenge. Initially, I''ll pinpoint the
      locations within the states. I know University of West Alabama is in Livingston,
      AL. Next, I''m determining where the University of Texas at Arlington School
      of Architecture is located, as this is a more specific point. Then I will compare
      the two locations, and determine which direction you must move in to travel
      between them.



      **Confirming Geographical Relationship**


      I''ve now streamlined my approach. I''ve definitively confirmed the geographical
      challenge and the required geographical comparison. The plan is to first identify
      the precise locations of both universities, which I now have, in the form of
      city/state. Then, I will directly compare their locations using US geography
      as the base, to make a determination. The final step will be a simple "Yes"
      or "No" answer.



      **Analyzing the Locations**


      I''ve thoroughly analyzed the states and cities. I''ve found that University
      of West Alabama is in Livingston, AL, and the University of Texas at Arlington
      is in Arlington, TX. My focus has now shifted to comparing the geographical
      positions of these two specific locations, with a determination based on longitude.
      I am ready to assemble the response.




      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the first location:** The University of West Alabama is located
      in Livingston, Alabama.

      2.  **Identify the second location:** The University of Texas at Arlington School
      of Architecture is located in Arlington, Texas.

      3.  **Compare the locations on a map:** The state of Texas is geographically
      located to the west of the state of Alabama.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the University of West Alabama (in Alabama) is
      located to the *east* of the University of Texas at Arlington (in Texas).

      I''ve started by identifying the core question: Is East Stroudsburg University
      west of Robert Morris University Illinois? Then, I broke it down. I need the
      locations of both universities. This geographical puzzle is coming together.



      **Defining Geographical Context**


      I''ve pinned down the locations: East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, and Chicago,
      Illinois. Pennsylvania is in the east, while Illinois is in the Midwest. Now,
      the mental task is comparing their relative positions on a map.



      **Formulating a Solution**


      I''ve laid out the steps to answer the geographical question logically. I have
      pinpointed the locations of the two universities and considered that Robert
      Morris University Illinois now exists as part of Roosevelt University, while
      its historical location remains the key. I''m finalizing the comparative positions
      of Pennsylvania and Illinois, to definitively conclude the relative positions.



      **Concluding the Comparison**


      I''ve just completed the systematic comparison of the two universities'' locations.
      I identified their geographical coordinates, considered the merger of Robert
      Morris University Illinois, and then reasoned about their relative positions.
      Finally, I have formulated the definitive "NO" answer, affirming that East Stroudsburg
      University is not located west of the former Robert Morris University Illinois.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **First, locate East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania.** As its name
      suggests, it is in the city of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.

      2.  **Next, locate Robert Morris University Illinois.** This university was
      located in Chicago, Illinois (it has since merged with Roosevelt University).

      3.  **Finally, compare the two locations on a map of the United States.** The
      state of Illinois is geographically west of the state of Pennsylvania. Therefore,
      Chicago, IL, is west of East Stroudsburg, PA.

      4.  The question asks if East Stroudsburg University (in Pennsylvania) is west
      of Robert Morris University (in Illinois). Based on the facts, it is the other
      way around; East Stroudsburg University is east of Robert Morris University.

      of Pennsylvania west of Robert Morris University Illinois? Now, I''m breaking
      this down. I need to know the specific locations of both universities. I''m
      thinking geographic coordinates will be useful to determine the answer.



      **Assessing Geographic Coordinates**


      I''m now proceeding with the core locations. I have pinpointed East Stroudsburg,
      Pennsylvania, as well as Chicago, Illinois, which was the previous location
      of Robert Morris University Illinois. Next, I plan to find the longitude coordinates
      for these two locations so that I can compare them directly. This should allow
      me to answer the initial question.



      **Pinpointing the Relative Locations**


      I''ve finalized the location research, confirming East Stroudsburg University
      is in East Stroudsburg, PA, and Robert Morris University Illinois was formerly
      located in Chicago, IL. After this, I compared their longitudes, finding Chicago
      has a greater west longitude, and thereby is further west than East Stroudsburg.
      This allows me to formulate a precise, definitive answer.



      **Outlining the Reasoning Process**


      I''m now consolidating the findings to draft a concise, step-by-step answer.
      I''m ensuring the answer clearly addresses the core question, presenting the
      locations, comparing them geographically, and then providing a definitive yes/no
      response.

      Its main campus was located in Chicago, Illinois (before it merged with Roosevelt
      University in 2020).

      3.  Finally, we compare the two locations on a map of the United States. The
      state of Illinois is geographically west of the state of Pennsylvania.

      4.  Therefore, East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania is located *east*
      of the former Robert Morris University in Illinois. The question asks if it
      is located *west* of it.

      Lima campus, lies west of Nebraska Medicine- Bellevue. To accomplish this, I''m
      deconstructing the location information into individual components. I''ve separated
      "Ohio State University, Lima Campus, OH" and "Nebraska Medicine- Bellevue" to
      analyze their positions independently.



      **Determining State Relationship**


      I''m now analyzing the relative positions of Ohio and Nebraska to address the
      core question. Initial investigations confirm that Nebraska is west of Ohio,
      given its location in the Great Plains, significantly west of the Midwest/Great
      Lakes region where Ohio is situated. Further, I''ve confirmed that the states
      do not share a border.



      **Analyzing Final Conclusions**


      I''ve just finished the final step. I''ve broken down the locations into city
      and state. After a thorough mapping check of the states'' relative positions,
      my conclusion is clear: the Ohio State University, Lima Campus is *not* located
      west of Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue. I''ve double-checked my work to ensure the
      logic holds.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the state for each location. Ohio State University,
      Lima Campus is in Lima, **Ohio (OH)**.

      2.  Next, we identify the state for the second location. Nebraska Medicine-
      Bellevue is in Bellevue, **Nebraska (NE)**.

      3.  Then, we determine the geographical relationship between these two states.
      On a map of the United States, the state of Ohio is located to the east of the
      state of Nebraska.

      4.  Therefore, any location in Ohio will be to the east of any location in Nebraska.

      5.  The question asks if the location in Ohio is *west* of the location in Nebraska.
      Since Ohio is east of Nebraska, this is incorrect.

      My initial assessment focused on identifying the core question: whether the
      Ohio State University, Lima Campus is west of Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue. I
      began by breaking down the locations into "Location A" (Ohio State University,
      Lima Campus, OH) and "Location B" (Nebraska Medicine- Bellevue, NE) to facilitate
      a direct comparison.



      **Assessing Geographical Relationship**


      I''ve mapped out the locations: Lima, Ohio (Location A) and Bellevue, Nebraska
      (Location B), and their respective states. My current focus is refining the
      longitude comparison. I''ve confirmed that Nebraska is indeed west of Ohio.
      Now, I''m examining the relative positions of Lima and Bellevue within their
      respective states, ensuring the initial state-level comparison holds true even
      at the city level.



      **Refining Geographical Positioning**


      I''m now zeroing in on the precise positioning.  I''ve established Nebraska''s
      westerly location relative to Ohio. My current efforts are centered on meticulously
      comparing Lima and Bellevue''s specific longitudes within their respective states.  I''m
      confident in my initial assessment, but striving for an even more definitive
      answer by examining the finer details.



      **Determining Geographical Relationship**


      I''ve clarified the crucial step: comparing the longitudes, which boils down
      to a simple east-west comparison. I am now confidently progressing to step 4,
      the decisive phase where I''ll pinpoint the exact relationship between Lima
      and Bellevue based on their longitude coordinates. I''m focusing intently on
      this next stage to ensure precision in determining the answer.

      I''ve moved on to the next phase: actually comparing the longitudinal positions.
      The initial city and state identification is complete. I''m visualizing a US
      map now to confirm Nebraska''s position relative to Ohio. I''ve concluded that
      any location in Ohio will be east of any location in Nebraska. Now, the next
      step is to apply this to the specific locations in question.



      **Clarifying Relative Positions**


      I''m now integrating the geographical data. I''ve broken down the state-level
      information and confirmed that Ohio is east of Nebraska. With this foundational
      knowledge, I''ve confirmed that Lima, Ohio, is east of Bellevue, Nebraska. The
      answer, based on the question, is no: Lima is not west of Bellevue. The final

      I''ve zeroed in on the primary question: determining if George Wythe University,
      UT, resides west of Bay Area Medical Academy, CA. My focus is now on the geographical
      aspect, specifically the comparison of the longitudes of these two locations.



      **Pinpointing Geographical Coordinates**


      I''m now zeroing in on the precise geographical coordinates. I''ve pinpointed
      Cedar City, UT, and San Francisco, CA, as our key locations. Current efforts
      are geared toward retrieving their respective longitudes to accurately determine
      their relative west/east positions.



      **Revising Location Proximity**


      I''ve refined the locations to Cedar City, UT, and San Francisco, CA, representing
      the Bay Area. Through geographical knowledge and longitude lookup, I''ve confirmed
      that the Bay Area (San Francisco) is indeed west of Cedar City. This comparison
      of longitudes now solidifies the conclusion to the core question.



      **Evaluating the Spatial Relationship**


      I''ve clarified the institutions'' locations: George Wythe University in Cedar
      City, UT, and Bay Area Medical Academy in San Francisco, CA. My analysis of
      their longitudes clearly indicates San Francisco (the Bay Area) is west of Cedar
      City. This helps definitively answer the core question.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **First, we need to identify the location of George Wythe University, UT.**
      George Wythe University was a private, unaccredited university located in Cedar
      City, Utah.

      2.  **Second, we need to identify the location of Bay Area Medical Academy,
      CA.** Bay Area Medical Academy has locations in the San Francisco Bay Area in
      California, such as San Francisco and San Jose.

      3.  **Third, we compare the geographical positions of these two locations.**
      Utah is a state located to the east of California. Therefore, Cedar City, Utah,
      is geographically east of the San Francisco Bay Area, California.

      4.  **Finally, we answer the question.** The question asks if George Wythe University
      (in Utah) is *west of* Bay Area Medical Academy (in California). Since Utah
      is east of California, the statement is false.

      I''ve meticulously analyzed the data. I''ve confirmed, by comparing longitudes,
      that Spring Arbor, MI is indeed west of Manchester, NH. This leads me to confidently
      conclude that the initial statement is false, as Manchester, NH is east of Spring
      Arbor, MI. I''ve created a detailed response.



      **Synthesizing Findings**


      I''ve methodically broken down the user''s query. I''ve pinpointed that Michigan''s
      position is west of New Hampshire. I compared the longitudes of Manchester,
      NH, and Spring Arbor, MI to substantiate this. My reasoning is now crystal clear,
      culminating in a response built on well-founded geographical comparisons.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of the first university:** The University of New
      Hampshire at Manchester is located in Manchester, New Hampshire.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second university:** Spring Arbor University
      is located in Spring Arbor, Michigan.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations of the two states:** New Hampshire
      is an East Coast state. Michigan is a Midwestern state.

      4.  **Determine their relative positions:** Geographically, Michigan is located
      to the west of New Hampshire. Therefore, Spring Arbor, MI, is west of Manchester,
      NH.

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Manchester, NH is
      west of Spring Arbor, MI. Since Manchester, NH is to the *east* of Spring Arbor,
      MI, the statement is false.

      into its core components: UWF and UTSA. Now I''m preparing to compare their
      locations to answer the user''s question.



      **Mapping Relative Locations**


      I''ve established both locations: Pensacola, Florida, and San Antonio, Texas.
      My next step is analyzing their relative positions. I know Texas lies west of
      Florida. Now, I''m pinpointing Pensacola''s location in the Florida Panhandle.



      **Comparing Geographic Longitude**


      I''m now determining the geographic relationship between Pensacola, Florida,
      and San Antonio, Texas. My analysis shows that Texas is west of Florida. I''ve
      pinpointed both cities: Pensacola in Florida''s Panhandle, and San Antonio in

      I''ve broken down the core question into its essential components. First, I
      identified that the user seeks a geographical comparison. Now, I''m pinpointing
      the specific locations needed: Montana State University and Concordia University
      Portland. This will allow me to analyze their relative positions.



      **Mapping the Longitudes**


      I''ve now successfully found the longitudes for both locations. Bozeman, MT,
      sits at approximately -111 degrees, while Portland, OR, is around -122 degrees.
      This makes the longitude of Bozeman, MT, have a lower absolute value (is less
      "west") than Portland. I''m almost ready to answer the user.



      **Evaluating the Findings**


      I''ve meticulously compared the longitudes now. Having determined that the longitude
      of Montana State University is approximately -111 degrees, while Concordia University
      Portland''s is around -122 degrees, it''s clear that Portland is further west.
      Consequently, the final "no" answer is logically sound and requires no further
      refinement.



      **Synthesizing the Conclusion**


      I''ve now comprehensively reviewed the entire process. I''ve re-evaluated each
      step, ensuring the logic is sound and that the answer directly addresses the
      initial query. The findings consistently support a "NO" answer, which I''m ready
      to present in a final, concise format for the user. I am confident in this assessment.

      1.  **Identify the location of Montana State University, MT.** Montana State
      University is located in the city of Bozeman, Montana.

      2.  **Identify the location of Concordia University Portland, OR.** Concordia
      University was located in the city of Portland, Oregon.

      3.  **Compare the geographical positions.** To determine which is further west,
      we can look at their longitudes or simply their positions on a map of the United
      States. Oregon is a coastal state on the Pacific Ocean, while Montana is an
      inland state to the east of Oregon. Therefore, Portland, Oregon is located west
      of Bozeman, Montana.

      4.  **Answer the question.** The question asks if Montana State University is
      west of Concordia University Portland. Since Bozeman, MT is east of Portland,
      OR, the statement is false.

      I''ve started by identifying the core question: is Purdue Fort Wayne west of
      Graceland? Now, I''m breaking it down. I need the locations of each university.
      This seems straightforward, so the next step involves finding the coordinates.



      **Determining Relative Positions**


      I''ve pinpointed the locations: Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Lamoni, Iowa. Reviewing
      my mental map of the United States, I''ve placed Indiana east of Iowa. Consequently,
      Fort Wayne is east of Lamoni. I have also re-read the user''s question, and
      am prepared to answer it correctly.



      **Evaluating the Geographical Data**


      I''ve now synthesized the location data. Knowing the relative positions of Indiana
      and Iowa is key. I''ve logically deduced that Indiana is east of Iowa. Thus,
      since Purdue Fort Wayne is in Indiana, it must be east of Graceland University,
      which is in Iowa. Therefore, I can now confidently provide a definitive answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **First, we need to find the location of Purdue University Fort Wayne, IN.**
      As the name suggests, it is located in the city of Fort Wayne, in the state
      of Indiana.

      2.  **Next, we need to find the location of Graceland University, IA.** This
      university is located in the city of Lamoni, in the state of Iowa.

      3.  **Finally, we compare the locations.** On a map of the United States, the
      state of Indiana is located to the east of the state of Iowa. Therefore, Fort
      Wayne, Indiana is east of Lamoni, Iowa.


      The question asks if Purdue University Fort Wayne is located **west** of Graceland
      University. Since it is located to the east, the answer is no.

      \ easternmost part of Maine, often called \"Downeast Maine.\" Its approximate\
      \ longitude is 67.46\xB0 W.\n\n2.  **Find the location of the Community College\
      \ of Vermont, VT.** The Community College of Vermont has multiple campuses throughout\

      \ to the west of the entire state of Maine. For a specific point, we can use\
      \ its administrative center in Montpelier, VT. The approximate longitude of\
      \ Montpelier is 72.57\xB0 W.\n\n3.  **Compare the longitudes.** In the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, a location with a larger longitude number (e.g., 72.57\xB0 W)\
      \ is farther west than a location with a smaller longitude number (e.g., 67.46\xB0\
      \ W).\n\n4.  **Conclusion.** Since the Community College of Vermont's longitude\
      \ (approx. 72.57\xB0 W) is a larger number than the University of Maine at Machias's\
      \ longitude (approx. 67.46\xB0 W), the Community College of Vermont is located\

      I''m now identifying the core question: whether Bethel University in Tennessee
      is located west of Drury University in Missouri. This will require a yes or
      no response. My plan is to locate each university''s city and state to determine
      their geographical positions. This will be the initial step in the analysis.



      **Mapping the Universities'' Locations**


      I''ve determined that Bethel University is in McKenzie, Tennessee, and Drury
      University is in Springfield, Missouri. My next task is to pin down their longitudes
      accurately. Once I have those coordinates, I can compare them directly to determine
      the relative positions of the universities. The goal is to derive the geographical
      relationship and answer the core question definitively.



      **Refining the Geographical Analysis**


      I''ve revised the analysis to ensure accuracy. Initially, I will locate the
      cities of the universities, McKenzie, TN, and Springfield, MO. Next, I plan
      to determine their longitudes. Since I previously made a mistake, I have to
      correct and re-evaluate the coordinates and relative positions of each location.
      Finally, I will clearly state the YES/NO answer, correcting any initial errors.



      **Formulating a Definitive Answer**


      I''ve carefully examined the longitudes: McKenzie, TN, has a longitude of approximately
      -88.5, and Springfield, MO, has a longitude of approximately -93.3. Since -93.3
      is more negative than -88.5, Springfield is further west. Consequently, Bethel
      University, being in McKenzie, TN, is not located west of Drury University in
      Springfield, MO. Therefore, the definitive answer is NO.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the city and state for each university.

      2.  Bethel University, TN is located in McKenzie, Tennessee.

      3.  Drury University, MO is located in Springfield, Missouri.

      4.  Next, we compare the geographical locations of McKenzie, Tennessee, and
      Springfield, Missouri. Springfield, Missouri is geographically west of McKenzie,
      Tennessee.


      Therefore, Bethel University, TN is located *east* of Drury University, MO.

      I''ve identified two entities for the analysis: Middlesex University, MA, and
      Syracuse University School of Education, NY. Right now, I''m focusing on the
      first entity, Middlesex University, to pinpoint its actual location in Massachusetts.



      **Mapping Geographical Coordinates**


      I''ve successfully pinpointed the two entities. Middlesex University, as the
      question suggests, seems to be a UK institution with no campuses in MA, and
      a community college appears to be the most appropriate match. I''m taking that
      as a proxy for the Middlesex entity. Additionally, I''ve located Syracuse University''s
      School of Education in Syracuse, New York. My next step will be to compare the
      longitudes to establish their geographical relationship, specifically determining
      which is west of the other.



      **Revising the Geographical Conclusion**


      I''ve refined the comparison of the two entities'' geographical locations. Now,
      my analysis confirms that the community college I''m using as a proxy for Middlesex
      is *east* of Syracuse University. This conclusion directly addresses the question''s
      spatial relationship. I''m now certain of the answer and can proceed to formulate
      a definitive response.



      **Formulating a Definitive Answer**


      I''ve carefully considered the geographical positions and confirmed that Syracuse,
      New York, lies west of Lowell, Massachusetts, where the community college is.
      The initial ambiguity has been resolved. My conclusion directly answers the
      question, establishing that Middlesex University (or, in this case, the proxy
      community college) is *not* west of Syracuse University. I can now proceed with
      structuring the complete response and formulate the final answer to deliver
      to the user.



      **Concluding the Geographic Analysis**


      I''ve finalized my analysis and determined that the community college (representing
      "Middlesex, MA") is indeed east of Syracuse University. This confirms the opposite
      directional relationship stated in the original question. I''m now certain of
      the answer and ready to present it as a complete and coherent response.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the first location:** "Middlesex University, MA" is likely a
      reference to Middlesex Community College, which has campuses in Lowell and Bedford,
      Massachusetts. Middlesex University itself is a British institution. We will
      use Lowell, Massachusetts as the reference point.

      2.  **Identify the second location:** Syracuse University School of Education
      is part of Syracuse University, which is located in the city of Syracuse in
      Central New York.

      3.  **Compare the geographic positions:** Massachusetts is located to the east
      of New York State. Therefore, Lowell, Massachusetts is east of Syracuse, New
      York.

      4.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Middlesex (in Massachusetts)
      is located *west* of Syracuse (in New York). Since Massachusetts is east of
      New York, this is incorrect.

      \ the two entities to be investigated: Middlesex University (MA) and Syracuse\
      \ University School of Education (NY). My initial search suggests Middlesex\
      \ isn't a recognized accredited institution. I need to verify this assumption\
      \ before proceeding.\n\n\n**Calculating Geographic Distance**\n\nNow, I'm working\
      \ on the geographic relationship between Lowell, MA (representing Middlesex\
      \ County/Community College) and Syracuse, NY. I've found their approximate longitudes:\
      \ 71.3\xB0 W for Lowell and 76.1\xB0 W for Syracuse. The next step is comparing\
      \ these figures to establish a directional relationship between the locations.\n\
      \n\n**Refining the Locations**\n\nI've clarified the locations: Middlesex, MA,\
      \ is represented by Lowell, and Syracuse, NY, is the second point. Latitude/longitude\
      \ figures are being used for pinpoint accuracy. Lowell is approximately 71.3\xB0\
      \ W, and Syracuse is 76.1\xB0 W. The longitude comparison confirms Syracuse\
      \ is west of Lowell.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Relationship**\n\nI've confirmed\
      \ the initial assessment: Middlesex, MA, is represented by Lowell, and Syracuse,\

      \ Community College in Lowell, MA. After cross-referencing locations and longitudes,\
      \ Lowell's longitude, 71.3\xB0W, is less than Syracuse's 76.1\xB0W. This confirms\

      \ School of Education, NY\" is located in the city of Syracuse, in central New\
      \ York State.\n3.  **Compare the geographic positions:** Massachusetts is a\
      \ state located on the Atlantic coast. New York State is located to the west\
      \ of Massachusetts.\n4.  **Determine the relationship:** Since the entirety\
      \ of Massachusetts is east of central New York, any location in Middlesex County,\
      \ MA, will be east of Syracuse, NY. Therefore, Middlesex is not west of Syracuse.\n\

      \ -71.3\xB0. The final geographical relationship is now clear.\n\n\n**Determining\
      \ Final Conclusion**\n\nI've completed my analysis. I now have the locations\
      \ and respective longitudes. I've formulated a step-by-step reasoning for the\
      \ user, clearly explaining the logic and conclusion. I'm ready to communicate\
      \ the answer, which is now clear. I've concluded that Syracuse University School\
      \ of Education, NY, is west of Middlesex Community College, Lowell, MA.\n\n\n\
      **Refining the Logical Flow**\n\nThe user's query about Middlesex University,\
      \ MA, and Syracuse University, NY, now has a conclusive answer. I've refined\
      \ my initial assumptions about \"Middlesex University,\" settling on Middlesex\
      \ Community College in Lowell, MA, after eliminating the confusion regarding\
      \ a non-existent \"Middlesex University\" in that location. My reasoning is\
      \ now clear: Locate both, compare longitudes, and present a concise explanation.\
      \ The concluding \"no\" directly addresses the user's initial question.\n\n\n\
      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the first location:**\
      \ \"Middlesex University, MA\". There is no institution by this name in Massachusetts.\
      \ The user is likely referring to Middlesex Community College, which has primary\
      \ campuses in Lowell and Bedford, Massachusetts. Both are in Middlesex County,\
      \ MA.\n2.  **Identify the second location:** \"Syracuse University School of\
      \ Education, NY\". This is located on the campus of Syracuse University in Syracuse,\
      \ New York.\n3.  **Compare the geographical positions:** Massachusetts is located\
      \ on the Atlantic coast, east of New York State. Syracuse is in central New\
      \ York.\n4.  **Determine relative direction:** Geographically, any location\
      \ in Massachusetts is east of Syracuse, New York. Therefore, Middlesex Community\
      \ College is east of Syracuse University. The question asks if Middlesex is\
      \ *west* of Syracuse.\n\nNO"

      \nI've begun defining the two entities in question: Middlesex University in\
      \ Massachusetts and Syracuse University School of Education in New York. Currently,\
      \ I'm focusing on the first institution. Initial searches suggest \"Middlesex\
      \ Community College\" as the likely match in Massachusetts. Next step: refining\
      \ the search to confirm or adjust this initial identification.\n\n\n**Mapping\
      \ Geographical Locations**\n\nHaving pinpointed Middlesex Community College\
      \ (Lowell, MA) and Syracuse University School of Education (Syracuse, NY), I've\
      \ determined their respective longitudes: approximately -71.3\xB0 W and -76.14\xB0\
      \ W. This reinforces that the second entity is indeed west of the first. I am\
      \ now working on understanding this relationship and how to communicate it clearly\
      \ and concisely.\n\n\n**Clarifying Geographical Relationship**\n\nI've clarified\
      \ the geographical relationship between the two locations. After confirming\
      \ both institutions and their approximate longitudes, I am now focusing on accurately\
      \ articulating the directional relationship. The longitudes are: Middlesex Community\
      \ College (Lowell, MA) -71.3\xB0 W and Syracuse University School of Education\
      \ (Syracuse, NY) -76.14\xB0 W. I need to formulate a response to the question\
      \ given the findings. My current train of thought centers around crafting a\
      \ clear and concise explanation using the identified longitudes to formulate\
      \ an answer.\n\n\n**Analyzing Positional Relationships**\n\nHaving gathered\
      \ the necessary data, I've conducted a thorough comparative analysis. My initial\
      \ assumption about Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts appears accurate,\
      \ and I've confirmed Syracuse University School of Education's New York location.\
      \ Further analysis of the longitudes has given me the ability to confidently\
      \ conclude that Middlesex is east of Syracuse, leading me to reject the premise\
      \ of the question. Now, I will be constructing an easy-to-understand explanation\
      \ that details each step in my reasoning.\n\n\n</think>Here is the step-by-step\
      \ reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the location of the first institution:** \"Middlesex\
      \ University, MA\" does not exist. The prominent institution with a similar\
      \ name is Middlesex Community College, which has campuses in Lowell and Bedford,\
      \ Massachusetts.\n2.  **Determine the longitude of Middlesex Community College:**\
      \ The Lowell, MA campus is at approximately 71.3\xB0 W longitude.\n3.  **Identify\
      \ the location of the second institution:** The Syracuse University School of\
      \ Education is located on the main campus of Syracuse University in Syracuse,\
      \ New York.\n4.  **Determine the longitude of Syracuse University:** Syracuse,\
      \ NY is at approximately 76.1\xB0 W longitude.\n5.  **Compare the longitudes:**\
      \ For a location to be \"west\" of another, it must have a greater West longitude\
      \ value. Since 76.1\xB0 W (Syracuse) is a greater West longitude than 71.3\xB0\
      \ W (Middlesex), Syracuse University is west of Middlesex Community College.\
      \ Therefore, Middlesex Community College is east of Syracuse University.\n\n\
