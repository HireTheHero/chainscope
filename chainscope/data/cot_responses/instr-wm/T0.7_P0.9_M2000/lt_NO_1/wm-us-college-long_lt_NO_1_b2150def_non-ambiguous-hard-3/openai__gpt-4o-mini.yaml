      we need to consider their geographic locations.


      1. **Locate St. Mary''s University**: St. Mary''s University is located in San
      Antonio, Texas. San Antonio is situated in the south-central part of Texas.


      2. **Locate University of Louisiana at Lafayette**: The University of Louisiana

    f1fc2494-2c90-4569-a13a-49adb7183c99: "To determine whether Middlesex University\
      \ in Massachusetts is located west of Syracuse University School of Education\
      \ in New York, we need to establish the geographic locations of both universities.\n\
      \n1. **Middlesex University, MA**: This university is located in the town of\
      \ Bedford, Massachusetts. Bedford is in the eastern part of Massachusetts, relatively\
      \ close to Boston.\n\n2. **Syracuse University, NY**: Syracuse University is\
      \ located in Syracuse, New York, which is in the central part of the state.\n\
      \n3. **Comparing Locations**: \n   - Bedford, MA (Middlesex University) is located\
      \ to the east of Syracuse, NY.\n   - Therefore, since Bedford is east of Syracuse,\
      \ Middlesex University cannot be west of Syracuse University.\n\nBased on this\
      \ reasoning, the answer is:\n\nNO"
