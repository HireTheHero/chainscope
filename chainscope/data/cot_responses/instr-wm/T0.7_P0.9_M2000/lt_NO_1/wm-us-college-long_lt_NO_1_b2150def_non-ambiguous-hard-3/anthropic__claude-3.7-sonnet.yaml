      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of Nebraska-Lincoln is in Lincoln, Nebraska

      - University of Northern Colorado is in Greeley, Colorado


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the states.

      - Nebraska is generally east of Colorado (Colorado is directly west of Nebraska)

      - Lincoln is in eastern Nebraska

      - Greeley is in northern Colorado, but not at the far eastern edge of Colorado


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Since Nebraska is east of Colorado, and Lincoln is not at the far western
      edge of Nebraska (it''s actually in the eastern part), while Greeley is not
      at the far eastern edge of Colorado, Lincoln must be east of Greeley.

      - University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is in Gainesville, Florida

      - McNeese State University is in Lake Charles, Louisiana


      Step 2: Consider their general geographic positions.

      - Florida is located east of Louisiana in the United States

      - Gainesville, FL is in the north-central part of Florida

      - Lake Charles, LA is in the southwestern part of Louisiana


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Since Florida is east of Louisiana, and these cities maintain that same general
      relationship, the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center would be
      east of McNeese State University.

      - When we say something is "west of" another location, we mean it has a more
      westerly position.


      Therefore, University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is NOT west of
      McNeese State University. It is east of it.

      in Tennessee is located west of Drury University in Missouri.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Bethel University is in McKenzie, Tennessee

      - Drury University is in Springfield, Missouri


      Step 2: I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these locations.

      - Tennessee is generally east of Missouri in the United States

      - McKenzie, TN would be east of Springfield, MO


      Step 3: To confirm this, I can consider that Missouri borders Tennessee''s western
      neighbor (Arkansas), which means Missouri is west of Tennessee.


      Step 4: Since Bethel University is in Tennessee (an eastern state relative to
      Missouri) and Drury University is in Missouri (a western state relative to Tennessee),
      Bethel University must be east of Drury University, not west.

      of Bethel University in Tennessee and Drury University in Missouri to answer
      whether Bethel is west of Drury.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Bethel University is in McKenzie, Tennessee

      - Drury University is in Springfield, Missouri


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Tennessee and Missouri.

      - Tennessee is east of Missouri in the United States


      Step 3: More specifically, McKenzie, TN is in the northwestern part of Tennessee,
      while Springfield, MO is in the southwestern part of Missouri.


      Step 4: Even though McKenzie is in the western part of Tennessee, and Springfield
      is in the southern part of Missouri, Missouri as a whole is still west of Tennessee.

      there isn''t actually a "Middlesex University" in Massachusetts. There is a
      Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts, but not a university with that
      exact name. Middlesex County is in eastern Massachusetts.

      - Syracuse University School of Education is located in Syracuse, New York,
