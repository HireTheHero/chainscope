      and New Mexico is generally west of Arkansas, a university in Arkansas will
      almost certainly be located *east* of a university in New Mexico.


      Therefore, Henderson State University, AR is **not** located west of Eastern
      New Mexico University, NM. It is located east.


      The answer is **NO**.'

      **Step 1: Locate Touro College, NY**

      Touro College has multiple campuses in New York City. The main administrative
      offices are often associated with their Manhattan locations, which are generally
      *east* of Central Park. For the purpose of a general geographical comparison,
      NYC is on the East Coast of the US.


      **Step 2: Locate Central State University, OH**

      Central State University is located in Wilberforce, Ohio. Ohio is a Midwestern
      state.


      **Step 3: Compare their relative longitudes.**

      New York City (and Touro College) is significantly *east* of Ohio (and Central
      State University).


      **Conclusion:** Touro College, NY is located *east* of Central State University,
      OH.


      Therefore, the answer to "Is Touro College, NY located west of Central State
      University, OH?" is:

      Touro College has multiple campuses in New York City. The main administrative
      offices are often associated with their Manhattan locations, which are **east
      of Central Park**. Even if we consider other campuses in Brooklyn or Queens,
      they are still within the greater New York City area.


      **Step 2: Locate Central State University, OH**

      Central State University is located in Wilberforce, Ohio. Ohio is a state **west
      of New York**.


      **Step 3: Compare their relative positions**

      New York City (and the entire state of New York) is geographically east of Ohio.
      Therefore, any location in New York will be east of any location in Ohio, assuming
      a standard east-west comparison.


      **Conclusion:**

      Touro College, NY is located **east** of Central State University, OH.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Touro College, NY located west of
