    bf5e1138-d87f-4896-97b5-08a800a8ab6a: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Ohio Northern University:

      - Ohio Northern University is in Ada, Ohio

      - Ada is located in northwestern Ohio


      2. Next, I''ll locate Des Moines University:

      - Des Moines University is in Des Moines, Iowa

      - Des Moines is located in central Iowa


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Ohio is east of Iowa

      - Northwestern Ohio is further east than central Iowa

      - Any point in Ohio will be east of a point in Iowa


      4. Therefore, Ohio Northern University is east of Des Moines University, not
      west.

      1. First, I''ll locate Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri

      2. Then, I''ll locate Newman University in Wichita, Kansas

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      St. Louis, Missouri is located in the eastern part of Missouri, near the Mississippi
      River.

      Wichita, Kansas is located in the south-central part of Kansas.


      Checking their relative positions:

      - St. Louis is east of Wichita

      - This means Saint Louis University is east of Newman University


      Therefore, Saint Louis University is NOT located west of Newman University.

      - St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina, which is
      in the southeastern part of the state


      2. Next, locate the University of Central Arkansas in Arkansas

      - This university is located in Conway, Arkansas, which is in the central part
      of the state


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - North Carolina is east of Arkansas

      - Laurinburg, NC is further east than Conway, AR


      4. Determine the west/east relationship

      - Since St. Andrews University (NC) is east of the University of Central Arkansas
      (AR), it is NOT west of it


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
