    29a6d4ab-2c66-4847-8d48-fc718992f588: '1. **Find the locations of the two universities:**  We
      need to determine the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) or general
      location (city, state) of both Aurora University and Drake University College
      of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.

      2. **Compare the longitudes:**  Longitude determines the east-west position.
      A location further west has a smaller  (more negative) longitude value. We will
      compare the longitude of Aurora University to that of Drake University.

      3. **Determine if Aurora University is west of Drake University:** If Aurora
      University''s longitude is smaller than Drake University''s, then Aurora University
      is west of Drake University.


      Aurora University is in Aurora, Illinois.

      Drake University is in Des Moines, Iowa.


      Illinois is generally west of Iowa.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      Aurora University is in Aurora, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Drake University
      is in Des Moines, Iowa. Chicago is generally west of Des Moines. Therefore,
      Aurora University is likely west of Drake University.

      Southwest Recreation Center has a higher longitude value, it is west of McNeese
      State University.


      University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is in Gainesville, FL.

      McNeese State University is in Lake Charles, LA.


      Gainesville, FL is roughly at -82.3 degrees longitude.
