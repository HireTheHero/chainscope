      Let me think about the general geography of these states:


      1. North Dakota (ND) is in the upper Midwest of the United States, bordering
      Canada to the north.

      2. Washington state (WA) is in the Pacific Northwest, also bordering Canada
      to the north, but located on the west coast.


      Generally speaking, Washington state is west of North Dakota. However, I need

      Williston State College is located in Williston, North Dakota, which is in the

      Eastern Washington University is located in Cheney, Washington, which is in
      the eastern part of Washington state.

      Let me think about the geographical locations of these two institutions:


      1. Williston State College is in Williston, North Dakota (ND)

      2. Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington (WA)


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider the states'' relative
      positions:

      - Washington state is on the Pacific coast, in the northwestern United States

      - North Dakota is in the upper Midwest, several states east of Washington


      Even though Eastern Washington University has "Eastern" in its name (meaning
      it''s in the eastern part of Washington state), Washington state as a whole
      lies west of North Dakota on the map.

      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.
      West means having a greater longitude value (more negative in the western hemisphere).

      is in the northwest part of North Dakota).


      Even though Williston might be in western North Dakota, Washington state as

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Williston State College is in North Dakota (ND)

      - Eastern Washington University is in Washington state (WA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Washington state is located on the west coast of the United States, while North
      Dakota is in the upper Midwest region. Washington is entirely west of North
      Dakota.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within states

      - Eastern Washington University, despite having "Eastern" in its name (indicating
      it''s in the eastern part of Washington), is still in Washington state.

      - Williston State College is located in northwest North Dakota.


      ## Step 4: Compare locations

      Even though Williston is in the western part of North Dakota, and Eastern Washington
      University is in the eastern part of Washington, the entirety of Washington
      state is still west of North Dakota.

      First, let me identify the states:

      - Thomas Jefferson University is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Gateway Community and Technical College is in Kentucky (KY)


      Now, let me recall the general geographic relationship between these two states.
      Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the US, while Kentucky is more centrally
      located and to the west of Pennsylvania.


      Since Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky, and Thomas Jefferson University is in
      Pennsylvania while Gateway Community and Technical College is in Kentucky, then
      Thomas Jefferson University would be EAST of Gateway Community and Technical
      College, not WEST of it.


      So my answer will be NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Thomas Jefferson University is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Gateway Community and Technical College is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positioning of these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the eastern United States, while Kentucky is positioned
      more centrally and to the west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific institutions.

      Since Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky, Thomas Jefferson University (in PA)
      would be east of Gateway Community and Technical College (in KY) - not west
      of it.


      NO'

      University in Pennsylvania is west of Gateway Community and Technical College

      Thomas Jefferson University is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is in the
      eastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Gateway Community and Technical College is in Kentucky. Kentucky is generally
      west of Pennsylvania as a state. However, I need to be more precise about the
      location of Gateway Community and Technical College within Kentucky.


      Kentucky is positioned to the west and slightly south of Pennsylvania on a US
      map. Even the easternmost part of Kentucky would be west of Philadelphia, which
      is in the far eastern part of Pennsylvania.


      So Gateway Community and Technical College in Kentucky is west of Thomas Jefferson
      University in Pennsylvania.


      Wait, I need to be careful here. The question is asking if Thomas Jefferson
      University is west of Gateway Community and Technical College, not the other
      way around.


      So the question is asking: Is Thomas Jefferson (PA) west of Gateway (KY)?


      Since Thomas Jefferson is in eastern Pennsylvania, and Gateway is in Kentucky
      which is west of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson is NOT west of Gateway. Rather,
      Gateway is west of Thomas Jefferson.</think># Is Thomas Jefferson University,
      PA located west of Gateway Community and Technical College, KY?


      I''ll solve this step by step by identifying where each institution is located
      and determining their east-west relationship.


      Step 1: Locate Thomas Jefferson University, PA

      - Thomas Jefferson University is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

      - Philadelphia is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, near the Atlantic coast


      Step 2: Locate Gateway Community and Technical College, KY

      - Gateway Community and Technical College is in Kentucky

      - Kentucky is a state located west of Pennsylvania in the US map


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions

      - Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east

      - Kentucky is an inland state located to the west of Pennsylvania

      - Even the easternmost part of Kentucky would be west of Philadelphia


      Step 4: Determine the directional relationship

      - Since Gateway (in Kentucky) is west of Thomas Jefferson (in Pennsylvania),
      Thomas Jefferson cannot be west of Gateway

      - The reverse is true: Gateway is west of Thomas Jefferson


      NO, Thomas Jefferson University is not located west of Gateway Community and
      Technical College. It is east of it.'

      in Virginia is located west of Western Kentucky University in Kentucky, I need
      to compare their geographic locations.


      First, let me think about where these universities are located:


      1. Radford University is in Radford, Virginia, which is in the western part
      of Virginia.

      2. Western Kentucky University is in Bowling Green, Kentucky, which is in the
      southern part of Kentucky.


      Now, I need to think about the relative east-west positioning of these states
      and cities:


      Virginia is located east of Kentucky on the US map. Virginia borders Kentucky''s
      eastern side.


      So generally speaking, locations in Virginia would be east of locations in Kentucky,
      not west.


      Even though Radford University is in western Virginia, Virginia as a whole is
      still east of Kentucky. So Radford University should be east of Western Kentucky
      University, not west of it.</think># Is Radford University, VA located west
      of Western Kentucky University, KY?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia

      - Western Kentucky University is located in Bowling Green, Kentucky


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Virginia and Kentucky

      Virginia is located on the eastern side of the United States, while Kentucky
      is further west. In fact, Kentucky borders Virginia on Virginia''s western side.


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states

      Even though Radford is in western Virginia, and the other university has "Western"
      in its name, the overall state positions are what matter here. All of Virginia
      (including western Virginia) is east of Kentucky.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Radford University is NOT west of Western Kentucky University. It is east
      of it.'

      Generally speaking:

      - Nebraska is west of Ohio

      - Ohio is east of Nebraska


      So if Baldwin Wallace University is in Ohio, and Midland University is in Nebraska,

      - Nebraska (NE) is located in the central Great Plains region


      Step 2: Compare the states'' east-west positioning

      - Nebraska is significantly west of Ohio on the US map

      - Ohio is to the east of Nebraska

      Ohio (OH) is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United
      States.

      Nebraska (NE) is located in the central Great Plains region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Nebraska is significantly west of Ohio. On a map of the United States, Nebraska
      sits several states to the west of Ohio.


      Step 3: Since Baldwin Wallace University is in Ohio and Midland University is
      in Nebraska, their relative positions follow their states'' positions.


      Therefore, Baldwin Wallace University (in Ohio) is NOT west of Midland University
      (in Nebraska). It''s actually east of it.

      the Midwest region of the United States.


      2. Midland University is in Nebraska (NE). Nebraska is in the central part of

      When comparing locations in the United States, places further west have higher

      the relative positions of these locations on a map.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Ohio Northern University is in Ohio (OH)

      - Des Moines University is in Iowa (IA)


      Geographically, in the United States:

      - Iowa is west of Ohio. Iowa is in the Midwest region, while Ohio is more eastern.

      - Des Moines is the capital city of Iowa, located in the central part of the
      state

      - Ohio Northern University is likely in Ohio, which is entirely east of Iowa


      Since Iowa is west of Ohio, and Des Moines is in Iowa while Ohio Northern University
      is in Ohio, it would mean that Des Moines University is west of Ohio Northern
      University, not the other way around.


      So Ohio Northern University is NOT west of Des Moines University. Instead, it
      is east of Des Moines University.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the geographic locations of both universities and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Ohio Northern University is in Ohio (OH)

      - Des Moines University is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and Iowa.

      - On a US map, Iowa is located to the west of Ohio

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest, while Iowa is further west in
      the Midwest


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - Ohio Northern University is in Ada, Ohio

      - Des Moines University is in Des Moines, Iowa (the state capital)


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Iowa is entirely west of Ohio, and Des Moines University is in Iowa while
      Ohio Northern University is in Ohio, Ohio Northern University must be east of
      Des Moines University, not west.

      Ohio Northern University is located in Ada, Ohio. Ohio is in the eastern part
      of the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Des Moines University.

      Des Moines University is located in Des Moines, Iowa. Iowa is in the central

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Ohio is east of Iowa. Therefore,
      Ohio Northern University (in Ohio) would be east of Des Moines University (in
      Iowa), not west.


      So, Ohio Northern University is NOT located west of Des Moines University.</think>#

      I''ll solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: Ohio Northern University is in Ohio
      (OH), and Des Moines University is in Iowa (IA).


      2) Looking at the geographic locations of these states: Ohio is in the eastern

      3) When examining the relative positions on a US map, Ohio is located to the
      east of Iowa.

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania to its east and Indiana to its west

      - Iowa is several states west of Ohio (you would pass through Indiana, Illinois,
      and possibly part of Missouri or Wisconsin to get from Ohio to Iowa)


      Since Des Moines is in Iowa and Ada is in Ohio, and Iowa is west of Ohio, this
      means that Des Moines University is west of Ohio Northern University, not the

      - Iowa is located in the western part of the Midwest region

      - When looking at a US map, Iowa is clearly west of Ohio


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Since Des Moines is in Iowa and Ada is in Ohio, their relative positions follow
      the same relationship as their states

      - Des Moines is west of Ada


      Therefore, Ohio Northern University (in Ohio) is NOT west of Des Moines University
      (in Iowa). In fact, it''s the opposite - Des Moines University is west of Ohio

      3. Then I need to determine which one is further west.


      Wingate University is in Wingate, North Carolina. North Carolina is a state

      Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia. Georgia is also on the east coast,

      - Generally speaking, Georgia is west of North Carolina


      However, I need to be more precise about the exact locations. Georgia is mostly

      Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia.


      I need to determine which one is further west. In the United States:

      - North Carolina is east of Georgia

      - Georgia is west of North Carolina


      However, since these universities could be near the border, I need to be more

      Wingate, NC is in the western part of North Carolina, but North Carolina as
      a whole is east of Georgia.

      Waleska, GA is in the northern part of Georgia.


      Georgia is west of North Carolina, so generally speaking, a location in Georgia
      would be west of a location in North Carolina. Therefore, Reinhardt University
      in Georgia should be west of Wingate University in North Carolina.


      Wait, I should double-check this. Looking at the relative positions:

      - Wingate, NC is in the south-central part of North Carolina

      - Waleska, GA is in the north-central part of Georgia

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between North Carolina
      and Georgia.

      - North Carolina is located east of Georgia on the US map

      - Georgia is positioned west of North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Even though Wingate is in western North Carolina, and Reinhardt is in northern
      Georgia, the state boundary relationship is the determining factor here.

      - Georgia as a whole is west of North Carolina


      Step 4: Make the final determination based on the east-west relationship.

      Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia. Georgia is west of North

      Now I need to determine which one is further west. The United States generally

      KY?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these universities based
      on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Strayer University is in Virginia (VA)

      - Bellarmine University is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of these states.

      Let me think about the general geographical layout of these states:

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Michigan is in the midwestern United States


      When comparing east-west positions in the US, states further east have higher

      Specifically, I need to determine if Stony Brook is west of Pittsburgh.


      First, let me recall the general locations of these states:

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern United States, but generally south/southwest
      of New York


      Now for the specific cities:

      - Stony Brook is on Long Island, which is in the eastern part of New York state

      - Pittsburgh is in the western part of Pennsylvania


      Geographically speaking, when comparing east and west positions in the US:

      - Things further east have higher longitude values (closer to the Atlantic)

      locations of these two universities to determine if one is west of the other.


      Walsh University is located in Ohio (OH), and National Louis University is located
      in Illinois (IL).


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to know their relative positions
      on the map of the United States. Let me think about the geography of these states:


      - Ohio (OH) is in the eastern part of the Midwest region, bordering Pennsylvania
      to the east.

      - Illinois (IL) is also in the Midwest region, but it''s further west than Ohio.
      Illinois borders Indiana to the east, and Indiana borders Ohio to the west.


      So the general geographic relationship is:

      (East) Ohio -> Indiana -> Illinois (West)


      Since Illinois is west of Ohio, and Walsh University is in Ohio while National
      Louis University is in Illinois, Walsh University would be EAST of National
      Louis University, not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Walsh University is in Ohio (OH)

      - National Louis University is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located west of Indiana

      - Indiana is located west of Ohio

      - Therefore, Illinois is west of Ohio


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the universities.

      - Since Walsh University is in Ohio and National Louis University is in Illinois

      - And Illinois is west of Ohio

      - Walsh University must be east of National Louis University, not west of it

      - National Louis University is in Illinois (IL)


      Now I need to determine the relative positions of these states. In the United
      States, Illinois is west of Ohio. Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest
      region, while Illinois is further west in the Midwest.


      Since Walsh University is in Ohio, and National Louis University is in Illinois,
      and Illinois is west of Ohio, then Walsh University (OH) would be EAST of National
      Louis University (IL), not west.</think>To determine if Walsh University, OH
      is west of National Louis University, IL, I need to identify the geographic
      locations of both universities based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Walsh University is in Ohio (OH)

      - National Louis University is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region, while Illinois is
      located in the central/western part of the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      Illinois is positioned west of Ohio on the map of the United States.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion about the universities'' relative positions.

      Since Walsh University is in Ohio, and National Louis University is in Illinois,
      and Illinois is west of Ohio, Walsh University must be EAST of National Louis
      University, not west.

      2. University of Nebraska at Kearney (in Nebraska - NE)


      The question is specifically asking if Indiana University Northwest is located
      west of University of Nebraska at Kearney.


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these states:

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle-eastern part of the
      US

      - Nebraska (NE) is also in the Midwest, but further west than Indiana


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Indiana is east of Nebraska

      - Nebraska is west of Indiana


      Since Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana, and University of Nebraska
      at Kearney is in Nebraska, and Indiana is east of Nebraska, Indiana University
      Northwest would be east of University of Nebraska at Kearney, not west.


      So, Indiana University Northwest is NOT located west of University of Nebraska
      at Kearney.</think># Is Indiana University Northwest, IN located west of University

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region, in the eastern part of the central
      United States

      - Nebraska is also in the Midwest region, but is positioned further west than
      Indiana


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Indiana is east of Nebraska on a map of the United States

      - Therefore, a university in Indiana would be east of a university in Nebraska


      Since Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (east) and University of Nebraska
      at Kearney is in Nebraska (west), Indiana University Northwest is located EAST
      of University of Nebraska at Kearney, not west.

      Now, let''s think about the geography of these states:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, east of Illinois

      - Nebraska is also in the Midwest, but west of Indiana and Illinois


      In terms of east-west positioning, Nebraska is generally west of Indiana on

      University of Nebraska at Kearney is located in Kearney, Nebraska (NE).


      Now I need to determine which is further west. In the United States, states

      Indiana is in the Midwest, bordering Illinois to its west and Ohio to its east.

      Nebraska is also in the Midwest/Great Plains, but it''s significantly further

      So Nebraska is definitely west of Indiana. Since both universities are in their

      5) Nebraska is in the Great Plains region, significantly west of Indiana

      6) On a map of the US, Nebraska is positioned to the west of Indiana

      - Georgia is located on the eastern side of the United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean.

      - Louisiana is located to the west of Georgia, closer to the central United
      States.

      Georgia is on the southeastern coast of the United States, while Louisiana is
      further west along the Gulf Coast. In general, Louisiana is west of Georgia.


      Step 2: Now let''s think about the specific locations of these universities.

      Clayton State University is in Georgia, so it would be in the eastern state.

      University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Louisiana, so it would be in the more
      western state.


      Step 3: Since Georgia is east of Louisiana, and Clayton State University is

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Louisiana is located west of Georgia along the Gulf Coast


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, their relative

      - Clayton State University, being in Georgia, is east of Louisiana

      - University of Louisiana at Monroe, being in Louisiana, is west of Georgia

      - South Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Alabama is more inland but still in the southeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - South Carolina is generally east of Alabama

      Let me think about the general geographic locations:

      - Troy University is in Troy, Alabama

      - University of Texas at Tyler is in Tyler, Texas


      The United States is generally arranged with states on the East Coast (like
      Maine, New York, etc.), moving westward through the middle of the country, to
      the West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington).


      Alabama is in the southeastern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.

      to determine the locations of both universities and compare their positions
      relative to each other, specifically whether Columbia International University
      (in South Carolina) is west of Mississippi Valley State University (in Mississippi).


      First, let''s identify the states where these universities are located:

      - Columbia International University is in South Carolina (SC)

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi (MS)


      Now, I need to consider the geographic positions of these states. In the United
      States, Mississippi is west of South Carolina. South Carolina is on the east
      coast, while Mississippi is closer to the central part of the country, bordering
      the Mississippi River.


      To be even more precise:

      - South Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern United
      States

      - Mississippi is located in the deep south, with the Mississippi River forming
      its western border


      Since South Carolina is east of Mississippi, and the universities are in their
      respective states, Columbia International University (in SC) would be east of
      Mississippi Valley State University (in MS), not west of it.</think>I need to
      determine whether Columbia International University in South Carolina is located
      west of Mississippi Valley State University in Mississippi.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Columbia International University is in South Carolina (SC)

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - South Carolina is located on the eastern side of the United States, on the
      Atlantic coast.

      - Mississippi is located further west, in the south-central United States, bordering
      the Mississippi River.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      - Mississippi is clearly west of South Carolina.

      - Therefore, any university in South Carolina would be east of a university
      in Mississippi, not west.


      NO, Columbia International University (SC) is not located west of Mississippi
      Valley State University (MS). It is located east of it.'

      Columbia International University is in Columbia, South Carolina (SC).

      Mississippi Valley State University is in Itta Bena, Mississippi (MS).


      Now I need to determine which is farther west. I''ll think about the general
      geographic locations of these states:


      South Carolina is on the east coast of the US, in the southeastern region.

      Mississippi is also in the southeastern US, but it borders the Mississippi River
      on its western edge and is west of South Carolina.


      So Columbia, SC is east of Mississippi. Since Mississippi Valley State University
      is in Mississippi, and Columbia International University is in South Carolina,
      Columbia International University is east of Mississippi Valley State University.


      The question asks if Columbia International University is west of Mississippi
      Valley State University, which would be NO.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the geographic locations of both universities and compare
      them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Columbia International University is located in Columbia, South Carolina (SC)

      - Mississippi Valley State University is located in Itta Bena, Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - South Carolina is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Mississippi is located west of South Carolina, bordering the Mississippi River


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Mississippi is significantly west of South Carolina

      - Therefore, Columbia International University (in SC) is east of Mississippi
      Valley State University (in MS), not west of it


      NO, Columbia International University is not located west of Mississippi Valley
      State University. It is located to the east.'

      First, I need to understand the general geography:

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, New Mexico is west of Arkansas. The entire state of New
      Mexico is west of the entire state of Arkansas.


      So a university in New Mexico (Eastern New Mexico University) would almost certainly

      University in NM, not west of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these universities are located.

      - Henderson State University is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico is positioned west of Arkansas on the U.S. map


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the universities.

      Since New Mexico is west of Arkansas, Eastern New Mexico University (despite
      having "Eastern" in its name) is west of Henderson State University.


      NO, Henderson State University, AR is NOT located west of Eastern New Mexico

      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Henderson State University is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - On a U.S. map, New Mexico is significantly west of Arkansas


      Step 3: Consider their positions more precisely.

      - New Mexico borders Arizona to the west and Texas to the east

      - Arkansas borders Texas to its southwest

      - This confirms that New Mexico is entirely west of Arkansas


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the universities.

      - Since New Mexico is west of Arkansas, Eastern New Mexico University must be
      west of Henderson State University (not the other way around)


      NO'

      1. Henderson State University is in Arkansas (AR)

      2. Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico (NM)


      I need to determine which one is further west. In the United States, states
      are generally arranged from west to east as follows (for the states in question):

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern United States

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States


      New Mexico is definitely west of Arkansas. But the question asks specifically
      about these universities, not just the states.


      Henderson State University is in Arkansas, which is east of New Mexico.

      Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico, which is west of Arkansas.


      So generally, Henderson State University (in Arkansas) would be east of Eastern
      New Mexico University (in New Mexico).


      The question asks if Henderson State is west of Eastern New Mexico University.
      Since Henderson is in Arkansas (east) and Eastern New Mexico University is in
      New Mexico (west), Henderson State is NOT west of Eastern New Mexico University.
      It''s east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Henderson State University is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Eastern New Mexico University is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, while Arkansas is in
      the south-central United States.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      On a map of the United States, New Mexico is clearly west of Arkansas. New Mexico
      borders Arizona to its west and Texas to its east, while Arkansas is much further
      east, bordering Texas on its southwest corner.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific universities.

      Since Henderson State University is in Arkansas and Eastern New Mexico University
      is in New Mexico, Henderson State would be east of Eastern New Mexico University,
      not west of it.


      NO'

      2. Let me think about the geographic layout of the United States. Arkansas is
      located in the south-central United States, while New Mexico is in the southwestern
      United States.


      3. Generally speaking, New Mexico is west of Arkansas. If we move from east
      to west across the US, we would typically encounter Arkansas before New Mexico.


      4. Since Henderson State University is in Arkansas, and Eastern New Mexico University
      is in New Mexico, it''s likely that Henderson State is east of Eastern New Mexico
      University.


      5. To be precise: Arkansas borders Texas to its west, and New Mexico is west
      of Texas. So Arkansas is definitely east of New Mexico.


      6. Therefore, Henderson State University (in AR) would be located east of Eastern
      New Mexico University (in NM), not west of it.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a US map, New Mexico is significantly west of Arkansas

      - Arkansas is east of Texas, while New Mexico is west of Texas


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Henderson State University is in Arkansas, which is east of New Mexico,
      it cannot be west of Eastern New Mexico University.

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning, New Mexico is clearly west of Arkansas. On

      To answer this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these two
      universities, or more broadly, the relative positions of Arkansas and New Mexico.


      In the United States:

      - Arkansas is in the south-central region of the country

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern region of the country


      Looking at a map of the US, New Mexico is definitely west of Arkansas. Arkansas
      borders the Mississippi River to the east, while New Mexico borders Arizona
      to the west and is much closer to the Pacific coast.


      Since Henderson State University is in Arkansas and Eastern New Mexico University
      is in New Mexico, Henderson State University would be east of Eastern New Mexico
      University, not west of it.


      So the answer is NO, Henderson State University is not located west of Eastern
      New Mexico University. It''s east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - On a U.S. map, New Mexico is significantly west of Arkansas


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, their relative
      positions follow the same pattern.

      - Henderson State University (in Arkansas) must be east of Eastern New Mexico
      University (in New Mexico)

      - Not west of it

      Let me think about the general geographic locations:

      - Virginia (VA) is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Missouri (MO) is in the Midwest


      More specifically:

      - Virginia is in the eastern part of the United States

      - Missouri is much further west than Virginia


      Therefore, Marymount University in Virginia would be east of the University
      of Missouri-St. Louis, not west of it.


      When we say "west of," we mean that Marymount would need to be in a location
      that is further west (toward the Pacific Ocean) than the University of Missouri-St.
      Louis. Since Virginia is east of Missouri, this is not the case.</think>To determine
      if Marymount University in Virginia is located west of the University of Missouri-St.
      Louis in Missouri, I need to consider the relative geographic positions of these
      states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Marymount University is in Virginia (VA), which is on the East Coast of the
      United States.

      - University of Missouri-St. Louis is in Missouri (MO), which is in the Midwest.


      Step 2: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Virginia is located in the eastern portion of the United States.

      - Missouri is located much further west than Virginia.

      - St. Louis specifically is near Missouri''s eastern border, but it''s still
      substantially west of anywhere in Virginia.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - Since Virginia is east of Missouri, Marymount University must be east of (not
      west of) the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

      First, I need to determine the locations of both universities:


      1. Winston-Salem State University is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (NC)

      2. Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Mountain Home, Arkansas (AR)


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. To do this, I''ll consider
      the general geographic locations of North Carolina and Arkansas.


      The United States is oriented such that the east coast is on the right side
      of the map and the west coast is on the left side. Going from east to west:

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arkansas is more inland, significantly west of North Carolina


      So Arkansas is west of North Carolina. This means that Arkansas State University-Mountain
      Home (in AR) is west of Winston-Salem State University (in NC).


      Therefore, Winston-Salem State University is NOT west of Arkansas State University-Mountain
      Home. It''s the opposite - Winston-Salem State University is EAST of Arkansas
      State University-Mountain Home.</think># Is Winston-Salem State University,
      NC located west of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home, AR?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      - Winston-Salem State University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of these states.

      North Carolina is on the eastern side of the United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.

      Arkansas is more inland and is located west of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Since Arkansas is west of North Carolina, Arkansas State University-Mountain
      Home (in AR) must be west of Winston-Salem State University (in NC).


      Step 4: Therefore, Winston-Salem State University is NOT west of Arkansas State
      University-Mountain Home. Rather, it is east of it.

      First, let me think about the general geographic locations:

      - Winston-Salem State University is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (NC)

      - Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Mountain Home, Arkansas (AR)


      Now I need to determine which is further west. Let me consider the relative
      positions of North Carolina and Arkansas on the US map:

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States, not on the coast


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is west of North Carolina. So if I''m looking at
      a map of the US, Arkansas would be to the west of North Carolina.


      Since Winston-Salem State University is in North Carolina, and Arkansas State

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      North Carolina is located on the eastern side of the United States, along the
      Atlantic coast.

      Arkansas is located in the south-central United States, west of the Mississippi
      River.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      Arkansas is significantly west of North Carolina on any US map. All of Arkansas
      is west of all of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific universities.

      Since Winston-Salem State University is in North Carolina, and Arkansas State
      University-Mountain Home is in Arkansas, the Winston-Salem campus must be east
      of (not west of) the Mountain Home campus.

      Given the general geography of the US, Arkansas is west of North Carolina. So
      Winston-Salem (in NC) should be east of Mountain Home (in AR), not west of it.

      Southeast (in Indiana) is located west of Wichita State University (in Kansas),
      I need to compare their geographic locations.


      Let me consider the states first:

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest, generally in the eastern part of the Midwest

      - Kansas (KS) is also in the Midwest, but further west than Indiana


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Indiana is east of Illinois, which is east of Missouri, which is east of Kansas

      - So Indiana is clearly east of Kansas


      Now for the specific universities:

      - Indiana University Southeast is in New Albany, Indiana (southern Indiana near
      Louisville, KY)

      - Wichita State University is in Wichita, Kansas (south central Kansas)


      Since Indiana as a whole is east of Kansas, and these universities don''t change
      that relationship (they''re not at extreme edges that would reverse the relationship),
      Indiana University Southeast must be east of Wichita State University.


      If Indiana University Southeast is east of Wichita State University, then it
      is NOT west of Wichita State University.</think># Reasoning About Geographic
      Locations


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general positions.

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region, in the eastern part of the
      Midwest.

      - Kansas (KS) is also in the Midwest, but positioned considerably further west.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west relationship of these states.

      - On a map of the United States, Indiana is east of Illinois, which is east
      of Missouri, which borders Kansas to the east.

      - This means Indiana is definitely east of Kansas.


      Step 3: Look at the specific universities.

      - Indiana University Southeast is in New Albany, Indiana (southern Indiana).

      - Wichita State University is in Wichita, Kansas (south central Kansas).


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      - Since Indiana is east of Kansas, and the specific locations of these universities
      don''t alter this relationship, Indiana University Southeast must be east of
      Wichita State University.

      - If it''s east, it cannot be west.


      NO, Indiana University Southeast is not located west of Wichita State University.'

      First, let me recall where these states are located:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is in the northeastern United States, on the East Coast.

      - Michigan (MI) is in the Midwest region of the United States, bordering the
      Great Lakes.


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude):

      - Massachusetts is located further east in the United States

      - Michigan is located further west than Massachusetts


      Now specifically for these universities:

      - Bentley University is in Waltham, Massachusetts

      - Cornerstone University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan


      Since Massachusetts is east of Michigan, and these cities follow the same pattern,

      Is Bentley University, MA located west of Cornerstone University, MI?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' locations

      - Massachusetts (MA) is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the Midwest region


      ## Step 2: Compare the states'' positions

      - Massachusetts is significantly east of Michigan on a map of the United States

      - States on the East Coast (like MA) are east of Midwestern states (like MI)


      ## Step 3: Locate the specific universities

      - Bentley University is in Waltham, Massachusetts

      - Cornerstone University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan


      ## Step 4: Determine relative positioning

      Since Massachusetts is east of Michigan, Bentley University (in MA) must be
      east of Cornerstone University (in MI), not west of it.

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      1. Air University is in Alabama (AL), specifically in Montgomery, Alabama.

      2. Lon Morris College was in Texas (TX), specifically in Jacksonville, Texas.

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is in the south-central United States, west of Alabama


      Generally speaking, locations in Alabama are east of locations in Texas. Since

      Kansas is located in the central part of the United States, in the Great Plains
      region.


      Geographically, Kansas is west of Kentucky. Therefore, if St. Catharine College
      is in Kentucky and Friends University is in Kansas, then St. Catharine College
      would be east of Friends University, not west.


      So the answer is NO, St. Catharine College, KY is not located west of Friends
      University, KS. It''s actually east of it.</think>I need to determine the geographical
      locations of these two colleges and compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each college is located.

      - Friends University is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states on a U.S. map.

      - Kentucky is located in the eastern half of the United States

      - Kansas is located in the central United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positioning).

      - Kansas is significantly west of Kentucky

      - Kentucky is east of Kansas


      Since St. Catharine College is in Kentucky (east) and Friends University is
      in Kansas (west), St. Catharine College is NOT west of Friends University -
      it''s actually east of it.

      - Denver, CO (where Regis University is located) is east of Provo, UT (where

      To determine this, I need to:

      1. Locate Old Dominion University in Virginia

      2. Locate Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College in Kentucky

      3. Determine which is further west


      First, Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia. (I''m not sure

      (ODU) in Virginia is west of Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College
      in Kentucky, I need to locate both institutions on a mental map and compare
      their east-west positions.


      First, let me place these institutions:


      1. Old Dominion University is in Norfolk, Virginia, which is on the eastern
      coast of Virginia near the Chesapeake Bay.


      2. Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is in Kentucky, likely
      in the southeastern part of the state as the name suggests (probably in the

      - Norfolk, VA is on the far eastern part of Virginia

      - Southeast Kentucky would be in the eastern part of Kentucky, but Kentucky
      as a whole is west of Virginia


      Therefore, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA would be east of Southeast
      Kentucky Community and Technical College, not west of it.


      Also, I notice there''s "POD, VA" in the question. I''m not familiar with "POD"
      as a location in Virginia - ODU is in Norfolk, VA. This might be a typo or abbreviation

      ## Step 1: Locate both institutions

      - Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia (not "POD, VA" - that
      appears to be an error in the question). Norfolk is on the eastern coast of
      Virginia near the Chesapeake Bay.

      - Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is located in southeastern

      ## Step 2: Compare east-west positions

      - On a US map, Kentucky is located west of Virginia.

      - Norfolk, Virginia is on the far eastern side of Virginia.

      - Even the southeastern part of Kentucky, which is the eastern part of the state,
      is still west of Norfolk, Virginia.


      ## Step 3: Draw conclusion

      Since Old Dominion University (in Norfolk, VA) is located on the eastern coast

      which is west of Virginia, Old Dominion University is EAST of the Kentucky institution,

      relative east-west positioning of two educational institutions:


      1. Old Dominion University in POD, VA (should be Norfolk, VA)

      2. Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College in KY


      Let me think about where these locations are:


      Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia, which is on the eastern
      coast of Virginia near the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean.


      Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is in Kentucky, which is
      west of Virginia. Specifically, it''s in the southeastern part of Kentucky,
      as the name suggests, which would be in the Appalachian region.


      Geographically, Virginia is east of Kentucky. The eastern part of Virginia (where
      Norfolk is) is definitely east of even the easternmost parts of Kentucky.


      So, if we''re comparing:

      - Old Dominion University (Norfolk, VA): Eastern Virginia, on the Atlantic coast

      - Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College (KY): Southeastern Kentucky,
      in the Appalachian region


      Norfolk, VA is definitely east of any part of Kentucky. Therefore, Old Dominion
      University is NOT west of Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College.</think>#
      Is Old Dominion University west of Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical
      College?


      I need to determine the east-west positioning of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify locations

      - Old Dominion University is in Norfolk, Virginia (not "POD, VA" as mentioned
      - that appears to be an error)

      - Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is in southeastern Kentucky


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Virginia is located east of Kentucky on the US map

      - Norfolk is on Virginia''s eastern coast, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Southeast Kentucky is in the Appalachian region, inland


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - Norfolk, VA (where Old Dominion University is located) is significantly east
      of any part of Kentucky

      - Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College must therefore be west
      of Old Dominion University

      relative geographic locations of two universities:

      1. University of West Alabama in Alabama (AL)

      2. University of Texas at Arlington School of Architecture in Texas (TX)


      Specifically, it''s asking if the University of West Alabama is located west
      of the University of Texas at Arlington School of Architecture.


      To answer this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these two places.


      Generally speaking:

      - Alabama (AL) is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Texas (TX) is a state in the south-central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Texas is typically west of Alabama. On a
      map of the United States, Alabama is to the east of Texas.


      So if University of West Alabama is in Alabama, and University of Texas at Arlington
      is in Texas, then the University of West Alabama would be EAST of the University
      of Texas at Arlington, not west of it.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO.</think># Is University of West Alabama, AL
      located west of University of Texas at Arlington School of Architecture, TX?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - University of West Alabama is in Alabama (AL)

      - University of Texas at Arlington is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states

      Looking at a map of the United States:

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Texas is positioned to the west of Alabama


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      Despite its name containing "West," the University of West Alabama is located
      in Alabama, which is east of Texas. The "West" in its name refers to its location
      in western Alabama, not its position relative to other states.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - University of West Alabama is not located west of University of Texas at
      Arlington School of Architecture. It is actually located to the east.'

      geographic locations of two universities and asking me to determine which one
      is more westerly.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      1. University of West Alabama (UWA) is in Alabama (AL)

      2. University of Texas at Arlington School of Architecture is in Arlington,
      Texas (TX)


      To determine which is more west, I need to compare their longitudes. In the
      US, locations with more negative longitudes (or higher absolute values for western
      longitudes) are more westerly.


      General geographic knowledge tells me that Texas is west of Alabama in the United
      States. Texas borders the western states of New Mexico and Oklahoma, while Alabama
      is in the southeastern US, bordering Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi.


      So just from state locations alone, I can determine that a university in Texas
      would be west of a university in Alabama, regardless of the "West" in the University
      of West Alabama''s name (which likely refers to the western part of Alabama,
      not the western US).


      Therefore, the University of Texas at Arlington would be west of the University
      of West Alabama.


      So the question asks: "Is University of West Alabama, AL located west of University
      of Texas at Arlington School of Architecture, TX?"


      The answer would be NO, because UWA is east of UT Arlington.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of West Alabama is in Alabama (AL)

      - University of Texas at Arlington School of Architecture is in Arlington, Texas
      (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Alabama and Texas.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central/southwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Despite having "West" in its name, the University of West Alabama is in Alabama,
      which is significantly east of Texas on the map

      - Arlington, Texas is much further west geographically than any location in
      Alabama


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on geographic facts.

      - Any location in Alabama would be east of Arlington, Texas


      NO, the University of West Alabama is not located west of the University of

      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - Arlington, Texas is significantly west of any location in Alabama

      - The "West" in University of West Alabama refers to its location in western

      - Slippery Rock University is located in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Lake Michigan College is located in Benton Harbor, Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and Michigan.

      - Pennsylvania is in the eastern/mid-Atlantic region of the United States

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region, west of Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania borders Ohio to its west, while Michigan is even further west
      beyond Ohio


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Slippery Rock is in western Pennsylvania

      - Benton Harbor is in southwestern Michigan near Lake Michigan

      - Even though Slippery Rock is in western PA, all of Pennsylvania is east of
      Michigan

      Maryland to the south.


      Michigan (MI) is in the Great Lakes region of the upper Midwest. It consists
      of two peninsulas - the Upper Peninsula and the Lower Peninsula, separated by
      the Straits of Mackinac.


      Generally speaking, Michigan is west of Pennsylvania. So a college in Michigan
      would likely be west of a college in Pennsylvania.


      Lake Michigan College is likely near Lake Michigan (given its name), which would
      put it on the western side of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.


      Slippery Rock University is in Pennsylvania, which is entirely east of Michigan.

      United States.

      - Lake Michigan College is in Michigan (MI), which is in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and Michigan.

      - Pennsylvania is located east of Michigan.

      - Michigan is positioned west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: More specifically, Lake Michigan College is likely near Lake Michigan

      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Shorter University is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United
      States.

      - Oklahoma Baptist University is in Oklahoma (OK), which is in the south-central
      United States.


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. The United States
      generally has states arranged from west to east as you move from the Pacific
      Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.


      Georgia is located on the eastern side of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United States, west of Georgia.


      Since Oklahoma is west of Georgia, and the universities are in these respective
      states, Oklahoma Baptist University must be west of Shorter University.


      So the answer is NO - Shorter University is NOT located west of Oklahoma Baptist
      University. Rather, it''s the opposite: Shorter University is EAST of Oklahoma
      Baptist University.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Georgia is positioned along the eastern side of the United States, near the
      Atlantic Ocean.

      - Oklahoma is positioned in the central part of the country, significantly west
      of Georgia.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      Since Oklahoma is west of Georgia, Oklahoma Baptist University must be west
      of Shorter University (not the other way around).

      - Oklahoma Baptist University is in Oklahoma (OK), which is in the central-southern
      United States


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Oklahoma. The entire state of Georgia
      is located east of Oklahoma on the US map. Georgia borders the Atlantic Ocean
      on the east, while Oklahoma is several states away from the east coast.


      Since Shorter University is in Georgia, and Oklahoma Baptist University is in

      To solve this, I''ll need to compare the relative east-west positions of these
      two universities.


      First, let me think about the states:

      - Ottawa University is in Kansas (KS)

      - Colorado State University Pueblo is in Colorado (CO)


      Geographically, Colorado is directly west of Kansas. The eastern border of Colorado
      touches the western border of Kansas. So generally, locations in Colorado tend
      to be west of locations in Kansas.


      However, I need to be careful because the specific locations within each state
      matter. If Ottawa University is in far western Kansas, and CSU Pueblo is in
      far eastern Colorado, then the answer might not be as straightforward.


      Let me think about the specific cities:

      - Ottawa is a city in eastern Kansas

      - Pueblo is a city in southern Colorado, but importantly, it''s not on the eastern
      edge of Colorado


      Since Ottawa is in eastern Kansas, and Pueblo is not on the eastern edge of
      Colorado, it''s very likely that CSU Pueblo is west of Ottawa University.


      So my reasoning is:

      1. Colorado is west of Kansas

      2. Ottawa is in eastern Kansas

      3. Pueblo is not on the far eastern edge of Colorado

      4. Therefore, CSU Pueblo (in Colorado) should be west of Ottawa University (in
      Kansas)</think># Is Ottawa University, KS located west of Colorado State University

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Consider state locations

      Kansas (KS) and Colorado (CO) are neighboring states, with Colorado located
      directly west of Kansas.


      ## Step 2: Consider city locations

      Ottawa, KS is located in eastern Kansas.

      Pueblo, CO is located in southern Colorado, but not at the eastern edge of Colorado.


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudes

      Since Colorado is entirely west of Kansas, and Ottawa is in the eastern part

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Kansas is located directly east of Colorado

      2. University of Northern Colorado in Colorado (CO)


      I need to think about the geographical locations of these states and cities.


      Nebraska (NE) is a state in the Midwest region of the United States. Lincoln
      is the capital city of Nebraska, located in the southeastern part of the state.


      Colorado (CO) is a state in the Mountain West region of the United States. The

      - Colorado (west of Nebraska)

      Greeley, CO (where University of Northern Colorado is located) is in the northern

      College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in Iowa (IA)

      2. Determine which one is further west (has a more western longitude)

      3. Answer whether Aurora University is west of Drake University College


      Step 1: Find the locations

      - Aurora University is in Aurora, Illinois

      - Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is in Des Moines,
      Iowa


      Step 2: Compare their longitudes

      Illinois is generally east of Iowa. Iowa borders Illinois on Illinois'' western
      side. Des Moines, Iowa is in central Iowa, while Aurora, Illinois is in northeastern
      Illinois (near Chicago).


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Iowa is west of Illinois. Des Moines (where
      Drake University is) is in central Iowa, which would put it west of Aurora,
      Illinois (which is in the northeast part of Illinois near Chicago).


      So Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa should be west of Aurora University
      in Aurora, Illinois.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      - Illinois and Iowa share a border, with Iowa being directly west of Illinois

      - Aurora, IL is in northeastern Illinois (in the Chicago metropolitan area)

      - Des Moines, IA is in central Iowa


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Iowa is west of Illinois, and Des Moines is roughly in the central part
      of Iowa, while Aurora is in the northeastern part of Illinois, Drake University
      must be west of Aurora University.


      NO, Aurora University is NOT located west of Drake University College of Pharmacy

      - Aurora is in northeastern Illinois, near Chicago

      - Des Moines (where Drake University is located) is in central Iowa


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Since Iowa is west of Illinois geographically, and these cities follow that

      The University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies is located
      in Richmond, Virginia. Richmond is in the eastern part of the United States,
      in the mid-Atlantic region.


      ## Step 2: Locate Western Kentucky University-Owensboro

      Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is located in Owensboro, Kentucky. Kentucky
      is west of Virginia, and Owensboro is in the western part of Kentucky.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      - Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Kentucky is inland and significantly west of Virginia

      - Moving from Virginia to Kentucky means moving westward

      locations of these two universities:


      1. Fort Valley State University in Georgia (GA)

      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.
      West means having a greater longitude value (more negative in the Western Hemisphere).


      First, let''s think about the general locations of Georgia and Texas in the
      United States:

      - Georgia is on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States, bordering Mexico


      In general, Texas is west of Georgia. So generally speaking, locations in Texas
      tend to be west of locations in Georgia.


      Fort Valley State University is in Fort Valley, Georgia.

      The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas.


      Based on the general geographic locations of these states, it''s very likely
      that The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More in Texas is west of Fort
      Valley State University in Georgia.


      Therefore, Fort Valley State University is NOT west of The College of Saints
      John Fisher & Thomas More. The relationship is the opposite.</think># Determining

      & Thomas More, TX


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two institutions based on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Fort Valley State University is in Georgia (GA)

      - The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Georgia is positioned significantly east of Texas on the US map

      - Texas extends much further west than any part of Georgia


      Since Fort Valley State University is in Georgia (an eastern state) and The
      College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas (a more western state),
      Fort Valley State University cannot be west of the Texas institution.

      1. Fort Valley State University is located in Fort Valley, Georgia (GA).

      2. The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is located in Texas (TX).


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. In the United States, states
      that are further west have a higher longitude (more negative longitude value,
      since the US is in the western hemisphere).


      Georgia is in the southeastern United States, while Texas is in the south-central/southwestern
      United States. Generally speaking, Texas is west of Georgia.


      So if Fort Valley State University is in Georgia, and The College of Saints
      John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas, then Fort Valley State University would
      be EAST of The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More, not west of it.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO, Fort Valley State University is not located

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States.

      - Texas is in the south-central/southwestern United States.

      - On a US map, Texas is clearly west of Georgia.


      Step 3: Draw my conclusion based on these states'' positions.

      Since Fort Valley State University is in Georgia, and The College of Saints
      John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas, and Texas is west of Georgia, then Fort
      Valley State University must be east of The College of Saints John Fisher &

      to determine the geographical locations of Widener University, DE and Huntington
      University, IN, and then compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - Widener University is in Delaware (DE)

      - Huntington University is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine their relative east-west positioning.

      The United States generally has states arranged with eastern states on the right
      (east) side of the map and western states on the left (west) side.


      Delaware (DE) is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Delaware is significantly east of Indiana.
      Delaware borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Indiana is several states
      inland.


      Therefore, Widener University in Delaware would be east of Huntington University

      Delaware is on the eastern seaboard of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      Indiana is in the Midwest region, several states inland from the East Coast.


      ## Step 3: Determine east-west relationship

      On a west-to-east axis, the United States runs from the Pacific Ocean to the
      Atlantic Ocean. Indiana is significantly west of Delaware.


      Therefore, Widener University (in Delaware) is NOT west of Huntington University

      Looking at a US map, Oklahoma is east of New Mexico. Oklahoma borders New Mexico

      - Oklahoma Wesleyan University is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - New Mexico Highlands University is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      Oklahoma Wesleyan University is in Oklahoma (OK).

      New Mexico Highlands University is in New Mexico (NM).


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to consider the geographic
      positions of these states.


      Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of the United States. It borders
      Texas to the south, Arkansas to the east, Missouri to the northeast, Kansas
      to the north, Colorado to the northwest, and New Mexico to the west.


      New Mexico is located in the southwestern region of the United States. It borders
      Arizona to the west, Utah to the northwest, Colorado to the north, Oklahoma
      to the northeast, and Texas to the east/southeast.


      So Oklahoma is east of New Mexico. That means Oklahoma Wesleyan University (which
      is in Oklahoma) would be east of New Mexico Highlands University (which is in
      New Mexico).

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States

      - Looking at a map, New Mexico is positioned west of Oklahoma


      Step 3: Consider the universities'' positions within their states.

      - Even if Oklahoma Wesleyan is in western Oklahoma and New Mexico Highlands
      is in eastern New Mexico, the overall state positions would be the determining
      factor for such distant locations.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on geographic positioning.

      - Since New Mexico as a whole is west of Oklahoma, New Mexico Highlands University
      would be west of Oklahoma Wesleyan University.

      - Conversely, Oklahoma Wesleyan University would be east of New Mexico Highlands

      Now I need to determine which one is more west (or east). In the US, states
      that are more west have a lower longitude value.


      Let''s think about the geographic positions of Virginia and Ohio:

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is more inland, in the Midwest region


      In terms of east-west positioning, Ohio is generally west of Virginia. Virginia
      borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Ohio is further inland.


      So if Stratford University is in Virginia and Xavier University is in Ohio,
      then Stratford University would be east of Xavier University, not west of it.</think>I
      need to determine if Stratford University in Virginia is located west of Xavier
      University in Ohio by examining their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      Ohio is located inland, in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positioning.

      Looking at a US map, Ohio is positioned to the west of Virginia. Ohio is approximately
      in the middle of the country, while Virginia is on the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Determine the universities'' locations.

      Stratford University would be in Virginia (east).

      Xavier University would be in Ohio (west of Virginia).


      Therefore, Stratford University in Virginia would be EAST of Xavier University
      in Ohio, not west of it.

      1. Stratford University is (or was) located in Virginia (VA)

      2. Xavier University is located in Ohio (OH)


      To determine which is further west, I need to know their relative positions
      on the map. The United States generally has states arranged so that moving west
      means increasing longitude (going from right to left on a typical US map).


      Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Virginia is on the
      East Coast.


      Geographically:

      - Virginia is positioned on the Atlantic Coast in the eastern part of the US

      - Ohio is located inland, west of Virginia


      Since Ohio is west of Virginia, and the universities are in these respective
      states, Xavier University (in Ohio) would be west of Stratford University (in
      Virginia).


      Therefore, Stratford University in VA is NOT located west of Xavier University

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      - Virginia is positioned further east in the United States

      - Ohio is positioned further west than Virginia


      Step 4: Apply this state-level relationship to the universities.

      - Since Stratford University is in Virginia (eastern state) and Xavier University
      is in Ohio (more western state), Stratford would be east of Xavier, not west.

      2. Wayne State University is located in Detroit, Michigan (MI).


      Now I need to consider the relative east-west positions of these locations.


      Pennsylvania is in the eastern part of the United States, while Michigan is
      in the Midwest.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Pennsylvania is to the east of Michigan

      - Scranton, PA would be east of Detroit, MI

      - Therefore, Marywood University (in Scranton, PA) would be east of Wayne State
      University (in Detroit, MI)

      - Marywood University is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Wayne State University School of Social Work is located in Detroit, Michigan
      (MI)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      Looking at the United States map:

      - Pennsylvania is in the eastern part of the United States

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region

      - Pennsylvania is positioned to the east of Michigan


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - Scranton, PA (where Marywood University is located) is east of Detroit, MI
      (where Wayne State University is located)

      - Therefore, Marywood University is east of Wayne State University, not west

      The question specifically asks if Ohio State University, Lima Campus is west
      of Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States

      - Nebraska is in the central part of the United States, west of Ohio


      Since Ohio is east of Nebraska, any location in Ohio would be east of a location

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States

      - Nebraska is located in the Central Great Plains region of the United States


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positions of these states.

      - Nebraska is significantly west of Ohio on the U.S. map

      - Ohio is entirely east of Nebraska


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within these states.

      - Lima is in western Ohio, but even western Ohio is still east of Nebraska

      - Bellevue is in eastern Nebraska, but even eastern Nebraska is still west of
      Ohio


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on this east-west relationship.

      2. California State University, Bakersfield in California (CA)


      I need to determine which one is farther west.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Nevada (NV) is generally east of California (CA)

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Nevada borders California to the east


      Since Nevada is east of California, it''s likely that Roseman University (in
      NV) is east of CSU Bakersfield (in CA).


      However, I should consider the specific locations of these universities within
      their states, as states have irregular shapes and border areas could have exceptions.


      Bakersfield is in the southern Central Valley of California, not directly on
      the coast but still well within California.


      Roseman University of Health Sciences is likely in Las Vegas or Henderson, Nevada,
      which are in the southern part of Nevada.


      Given the geography of the western United States, it''s very unlikely that any
      part of Nevada would be west of a location in central/southern California like
      Bakersfield.


      Therefore, Roseman University (in NV) is almost certainly east of CSU Bakersfield
      (in CA), not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities.


      Step 1: Let me identify the states'' general positions.

      California is the westernmost continental US state, located on the Pacific coast.
      Nevada is directly east of California.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      California State University, Bakersfield is located in Bakersfield, which is
      in the southern Central Valley of California.


      Roseman University of Health Sciences is located in Nevada (with campuses in
      Henderson and Summerlin), which lies entirely east of California''s eastern
      border.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      Since Nevada is east of California, and Bakersfield is well within California''s
      borders (not at the eastern edge), Roseman University must be east of CSU Bakersfield.


      For something to be west of CSU Bakersfield, it would need to be closer to the
      Pacific Ocean, but Roseman is in Nevada, which is in the opposite direction.

      First, let me identify the states:

      - Eastern Michigan University is in Michigan (MI)

      - Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA)


      Now I need to think about the geographic locations of these states. In the United
      States:

      - Michigan is in the Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes

      - Iowa is also in the Midwest, but is west of Michigan


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Michigan is east of Iowa. Iowa borders the
      Mississippi River on its east side, while Michigan is located east of Illinois
      and Wisconsin.


      Since Eastern Michigan University is in Michigan (as the name suggests), and
      Michigan is east of Iowa, that means Eastern Michigan University is east of
      Mount Mercy University in Iowa.


      Therefore, Eastern Michigan University is NOT west of Mount Mercy University.
      It''s east of it.</think># Is Eastern Michigan University west of Mount Mercy
      University?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) Eastern Michigan University College of Health and Human Services is located
      in Michigan (MI), as indicated in the question.


      2) Mount Mercy University is located in Iowa (IA), as indicated in the question.


      3) Looking at the geographic positions of these states: Michigan is in the eastern
      part of the Midwest region, while Iowa is in the central/western part of the
      Midwest.


      4) Michigan is positioned to the EAST of Iowa on the US map.


      5) Since Eastern Michigan University is in Michigan, and Michigan is east of
      Iowa, Eastern Michigan University must be east of Mount Mercy University (which
      is in Iowa).


      Therefore, Eastern Michigan University is NOT located west of Mount Mercy University
      - it''s located east of it.

      Eastern Michigan University is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Michigan is in
      the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United States.


      Mount Mercy University is located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Iowa is also in the
      Midwest region but is further west than Michigan.


      When comparing states from east to west:

      - Michigan is east of Iowa

      - Therefore, Eastern Michigan University (in Michigan) would be east of Mount
      Mercy University (in Iowa)


      If Eastern Michigan University is east of Mount Mercy University, then it is
      NOT west of Mount Mercy University.</think>I need to determine the relative

      - Eastern Michigan University College of Health and Human Services is in Ypsilanti,
      Michigan

      - Mount Mercy University is in Cedar Rapids, Iowa


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Michigan and Iowa.

      - Michigan is in the eastern part of the Midwest region

      - Iowa is in the central part of the Midwest region

      - Michigan is positioned to the east of Iowa


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - States further east have higher longitude values (closer to the East Coast)

      - Michigan is east of Iowa on a map of the United States

      - Therefore, Eastern Michigan University (in Michigan) is east of Mount Mercy
      University (in Iowa)


      Since Eastern Michigan University is east of Mount Mercy University, it cannot
      be west of it.

      Now I need to determine which is further west. In the United States:

      - Michigan is in the Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes

      - Iowa is also in the Midwest, but is west of Michigan


      Generally, states in the US follow this west-to-east order in this region:

      Iowa is west of Illinois, which is west of Indiana, which is west of Michigan.


      So Iowa is west of Michigan, which means that Mount Mercy University (in Iowa)
      is west of Eastern Michigan University (in Michigan).


      The question asks if Eastern Michigan University is west of Mount Mercy University.
      Since Eastern Michigan is actually east of Mount Mercy, the answer would be

      - Michigan is located in the eastern portion of the Midwest region, bordering
      the Great Lakes.

      - Iowa is located in the western portion of the Midwest region.

      - On a map of the United States, Iowa is positioned to the west of Michigan.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - Since Iowa is west of Michigan, Mount Mercy University (in Iowa) is west of
      Eastern Michigan University (in Michigan).

      First, let me think about the general locations of Michigan and Iowa states.
      Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, in the eastern part of the Midwest. Iowa
      is located in the Midwest, west of Illinois and Wisconsin.


      If we look at a map of the United States from west to east:

      - Mountain states (NV, ID, MT, WY, UT, CO, AZ, NM)

      - Great Plains states including Iowa

      - Midwest states including Michigan

      - Eastern states


      Iowa is generally west of Michigan. So any location in Iowa would typically
      be west of locations in Michigan.


      Therefore, Eastern Michigan University (in Michigan) would be east of Mount
      Mercy University (in Iowa), not west of it.</think>To determine if Eastern Michigan

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Michigan is in the eastern part of the Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes.

      Iowa is in the central Midwest, west of Illinois and Wisconsin.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      Looking at a US map, Iowa is clearly west of Michigan. Iowa is approximately
      in the middle of the continental US, while Michigan is further to the east.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the universities.

      Since Eastern Michigan University is in Michigan (eastern) and Mount Mercy University

      I need to find the specific locations of these universities and determine their

      Robert Morris University is located in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, which is
      near Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania.


      Now, I need to determine which is further west. In the United States, when moving

      - The Atlantic Ocean is on the east coast

      - Then come the eastern states like New Jersey

      - Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey

      - Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania


      Since Stockton University is in New Jersey near the Atlantic coast, and Robert
      Morris University is in western Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh), Robert Morris
      University would be further west than Stockton University.

      Jersey and Robert Morris University in Pennsylvania.


      First, let me recall the locations:

      - Stockton University is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - Robert Morris University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      New Jersey is generally east of Pennsylvania on the US map. Pennsylvania borders
      New Jersey to the west.


      Let me be more specific about the locations:

      - Stockton University is in Galloway, NJ, which is in the southeastern part
      of New Jersey, near Atlantic City

      - Robert Morris University is in Moon Township, PA, which is near Pittsburgh
      in western Pennsylvania


      Given these locations:

      - Stockton University is in eastern NJ

      - Robert Morris University is in western PA


      Since NJ is already east of PA, and Stockton is in eastern NJ while Robert Morris
      is in western PA, Stockton University is definitely east of Robert Morris University.


      So, is Stockton University west of Robert Morris University? No, it''s east
      of it.</think>I''ll solve this step by step by determining the relative east-west
      positions of these universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Stockton University is located in Galloway, New Jersey

      - Robert Morris University is located in Moon Township (near Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Jersey is located east of Pennsylvania on the US map

      - Pennsylvania borders New Jersey on its eastern side


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Stockton University is in the eastern part of New Jersey (near the Atlantic
      coast)

      - Robert Morris University is in the western part of Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about their east-west relationship.

      Given that New Jersey is already east of Pennsylvania, and considering their
      specific locations within their respective states (eastern NJ vs. western PA),
      Stockton University is clearly east of Robert Morris University, not west.

      Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania. Don''t

      - Indiana, PA is in western Pennsylvania

      - Dayton, OH is in western Ohio


      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, and Dayton is in western Ohio while Indiana
      is in western Pennsylvania, it''s very likely that Dayton, OH is west of Indiana,

      University in North Carolina is located west of the University of Central Arkansas
      in Arkansas.


      First, let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - North Carolina (NC) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arkansas (AR) is in the south-central part of the United States, west of the
      Mississippi River


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is west of North Carolina. This means that locations
      in North Carolina would typically be east of locations in Arkansas, not west.


      To be more specific:

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina

      - University of Central Arkansas is in Arkansas


      Since Arkansas is west of North Carolina, the University of Central Arkansas
      would be west of St. Andrews University. This means St. Andrews University is
      NOT west of University of Central Arkansas, but rather east of it.</think>To

      - North Carolina (NC) is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - Arkansas (AR) is located in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - Arkansas is significantly west of North Carolina on the U.S. map.

      - North Carolina is in the Eastern time zone, while Arkansas is in the Central
      time zone.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific universities.

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina, which is on the east coast.

      - University of Central Arkansas is in Arkansas, which is much further west.


      Therefore, St. Andrews University (NC) cannot be west of the University of Central
      Arkansas (AR). It is east of it.

      2. University of Central Arkansas is in Arkansas (AR)


      Now I need to compare their geographical positions, specifically whether St.

      The United States generally has states arranged from east to west. North Carolina
      is on the east coast, while Arkansas is more inland and western compared to

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern US

      - Arkansas is in the south-central US, west of the Mississippi River


      North Carolina is definitely east of Arkansas. Since St. Andrews is in North
      Carolina and University of Central Arkansas is in Arkansas, that means St. Andrews
      is east of UCA, not west of it.

      United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Arkansas is significantly west of North Carolina

      - Any location in North Carolina would be east of most locations in Arkansas

      Since St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (an eastern state) and University

      Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania (PA).

      Otterbein University is in Ohio (OH).


      Generally speaking, Ohio is west of Pennsylvania in the United States. Pennsylvania
      borders the Atlantic coast in the east, while Ohio is more inland and to the
      west of Pennsylvania.


      So geographically speaking, it would be unlikely that Lincoln University in

      To be more precise:

      - Lincoln University is located in Chester County, Pennsylvania

      - Otterbein University is located in Westerville, Ohio (near Columbus)


      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, Otterbein University would be west of Lincoln

      First, let me identify where each university is located:

      - Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Otterbein University is in Ohio (OH)


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Ohio. The states are adjacent, with
      Ohio bordering Pennsylvania on its western side. So a location in Pennsylvania
      would typically be east of a location in Ohio, not west.


      To be more specific about these universities:

      - Lincoln University is in southeastern Pennsylvania, near the Maryland border

      - Otterbein University is in Westerville, Ohio, which is in the central part
      of Ohio


      Given these locations, Lincoln University in PA would be east of Otterbein University

      3) Geographically, Ohio is west of Pennsylvania in the United States

      4) More specifically, Lincoln University is in southeastern Pennsylvania

      5) Otterbein University is in Westerville, which is in central Ohio

      6) Since Pennsylvania is east of Ohio, Lincoln University must be east of Otterbein

      3. Pennsylvania is a state on the east coast of the United States, while Ohio
      is located more inland, to the west of Pennsylvania.


      4. Generally speaking, locations in Ohio would be west of locations in Pennsylvania.


      5. Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania (PA), and Otterbein University is in
      Ohio (OH).


      6. Since Pennsylvania is east of Ohio, Lincoln University (in PA) would be east

      So the answer would be NO.</think>To determine whether Lincoln University, PA
      is located west of Otterbein University, OH, I need to consider the geographic

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located on the eastern side of the United States, while
      Ohio (OH) is located to the west of Pennsylvania.

      Even without knowing the precise locations of these universities within their
      respective states, the fact that they''re in different states is sufficient
      in this case.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, Otterbein University (in Ohio) must be west
      of Lincoln University (in Pennsylvania).


      Therefore, Lincoln University, PA is NOT located west of Otterbein University,
      OH. It''s actually east of it.

      For step 3: To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare
      their longitudes. The United States is oriented such that the west coast (including
      the Bay Area in California) is the westernmost part of the continental US, and
      locations get progressively more eastern as you move right on a map. Since Utah

      Looking at US geography, states to the east have lower longitudes than states
      to the west. New Hampshire is definitely east of Michigan on a map of the United
      States. Therefore, University of New Hampshire at Manchester would be east of
      Spring Arbor University, not west of it.

      Determining if University of New Hampshire at Manchester is west of Spring Arbor
      University


      I need to figure out the relative east-west positions of these two universities
      by examining their locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states and their geographic positions

      - University of New Hampshire at Manchester is in New Hampshire (NH), which
      is located in the northeastern United States

      - Spring Arbor University is in Michigan (MI), which is in the midwestern United
      States


      ## Step 2: Compare the relative east-west positions

      - New Hampshire is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Michigan is in the Midwest, significantly west of New Hampshire

      - On a map of the US, Michigan is clearly west of New Hampshire


      ## Step 3: Determine the specific cities'' locations

      - Manchester is in eastern New Hampshire

      - Spring Arbor is in Michigan


      ## Conclusion

      Since New Hampshire is east of Michigan on the US map, the University of New
      Hampshire at Manchester must be east of Spring Arbor University, not west of
      it.

      1. University of New Hampshire at Manchester is in Manchester, New Hampshire
      (NH), which is in the northeastern United States.

      2. Spring Arbor University is in Spring Arbor, Michigan (MI), which is in the
      midwestern United States.


      Now, to determine which is more west, I need to consider their relative positions

      - New Hampshire is one of the easternmost states in the US, part of the New
      England region

      - Michigan is in the Midwest, and is significantly west of New Hampshire


      In the United States, when comparing east-west positions, locations further
      east have higher longitude values (closer to the east coast), and locations
      further west have lower longitude values (closer to the west coast).


      Given that Michigan is significantly west of New Hampshire, Spring Arbor University

      locations of University of West Florida (UWF) in Florida and University of Texas
      at San Antonio (UTSA) in Texas.


      First, let me think about their general geographic locations:

      - University of West Florida is in Florida, likely in the western part of Florida
      based on its name

      - University of Texas at San Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas


      Now, Florida is east of Texas in the United States. The western part of Florida
      is still east of Texas. Even the westernmost part of Florida''s panhandle is
      still east of Texas.


      San Antonio is in south-central Texas, not on the far eastern edge of Texas.
      This means that University of Texas at San Antonio is definitely west of any
      location in Florida.


      Therefore, University of West Florida cannot be west of University of Texas
      at San Antonio. Instead, it would be east of UTSA.</think># Is University of
      West Florida, FL located west of University of Texas at San Antonio, TX?


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of both
      universities.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. University of West Florida (UWF) is located in Pensacola, Florida, which
      is in the western panhandle of Florida.


      2. University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is located in San Antonio, Texas,
      which is in south-central Texas.


      3. While UWF has "West" in its name, this refers to its location within Florida
      (western part of the state).


      4. In terms of U.S. geography, Texas is located west of Florida. Even the westernmost
      part of Florida''s panhandle is still east of Texas.


      5. San Antonio, Texas is significantly west of any point in Florida.


      Therefore, University of West Florida is NOT west of University of Texas at
      San Antonio, but rather east of it.


      ## Answer: NO'
    fef3c637-e325-4361-933e-7ee3c1293635: '<think>I need to figure out the relative
      locations of these two universities.


      University of West Florida (UWF) is located in Pensacola, Florida, which is
      in the western panhandle of Florida.


      University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is located in San Antonio, Texas.


      To determine which is further west, I need to compare their longitudes. The
      US states are arranged such that:

      - Texas is west of Florida

      - However, Florida has a panhandle that extends westward


      Let me think about their approximate positions:

      - Pensacola (UWF) is at the far western edge of Florida''s panhandle

      - San Antonio (UTSA) is in south-central Texas


      Despite Pensacola being at the western edge of Florida, Texas is significantly
      further west than Florida''s panhandle. San Antonio is likely to be further
      west than Pensacola.


      So the University of Texas at San Antonio should be west of the University of
      West Florida, not the other way around.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of West Florida is located in Pensacola, in Florida''s western
      panhandle.

      - University of Texas at San Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas, which is in south-central
      Texas.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Florida and Texas.

      - While Florida is generally east of Texas, Florida''s panhandle extends westward.

      - Pensacola is at the far western end of Florida''s panhandle.

      - San Antonio is located in south-central Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Despite "West Florida" in its name and being in Florida''s westernmost region,
      Pensacola is still east of San Antonio.

      - Texas extends much further west than Florida''s panhandle reaches.


      NO, University of West Florida is NOT located west of University of Texas at
      San Antonio. It is east of it.'

      - Connecticut is on the east coast

      - Ohio is in the midwest, which is west of the east coast


      Since Connecticut is on the east coast and Ohio is in the midwest, Connecticut

      Step 2: Identify where Premier Flight Academy is located.

      Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH). Ohio is located in the Midwest region
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is clearly to the east
      of Ohio. The east coast states (including Connecticut) are east of the Midwest
      states (including Ohio).


      Step 4: Determine the answer to the question.

      Since University of Bridgeport (in Connecticut) is to the east of Premier Flight

      Let''s think about the general locations of the states first:

      - West Virginia (WV) is in the eastern United States, part of the Appalachian

      - Missouri (MO) is in the Midwest, further west than West Virginia


      Just from state locations, a university in West Virginia would typically be

      - William Woods University is in Fulton, MO, which is in central Missouri


      The eastern location of Shepherd University within West Virginia puts it even

      Step 2: Locate the universities within their states.

      - Shepherd University is in Shepherdstown, in the eastern panhandle of West

      I''ll think about the general geographic positions of Maryland (MD) and Ohio

      Maryland is on the east coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.
      It''s in the Mid-Atlantic region.


      Ohio is more inland, in the Midwest region, west of Maryland.


      Generally speaking, states on the east coast (like Maryland) are east of Midwestern

      Since UMBC is in Maryland, and MVNU is in Ohio, the general geographic relationship

      2) Maryland is located on the East Coast of the United States

      3) Ohio is located in the Midwest region, inland from the East Coast

      4) Looking at a map of the US, Maryland is clearly east of Ohio


      5) Baltimore County is in the central-eastern part of Maryland

      1. First, let me identify where Oklahoma Panhandle State University, OK is located.
      As the name suggests, it''s in the Oklahoma Panhandle, which is the narrow western
      extension of Oklahoma. Looking at a mental map, the Oklahoma Panhandle is in
      the far western part of Oklahoma.


      2. Next, I need to identify where Adams State University, CO is located. This
      university is in Colorado. I need to recall where specifically in Colorado it
      is.


      Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado, which is in south-central
      Colorado, in the San Luis Valley.


      3. Now I need to compare their east-west positions. Oklahoma borders Colorado
      to the east. The Oklahoma Panhandle specifically borders the southeastern part
      of Colorado.


      Given that Oklahoma is east of Colorado, and the Oklahoma Panhandle is the westernmost
      part of Oklahoma that borders Colorado, I need to determine if Oklahoma Panhandle
      State University is west of Adams State University.


      Since Alamosa (home of Adams State) is in south-central Colorado, and the Oklahoma
      Panhandle is east of Colorado, Oklahoma Panhandle State University must be east
      of Adams State University, not west.</think># Is Oklahoma Panhandle State University,
      OK located west of Adams State University, CO?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, in the Oklahoma
      Panhandle (the westernmost part of Oklahoma).

      - Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado, in the south-central
      part of Colorado.


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - Colorado is directly west of Oklahoma.

      - Even though Oklahoma Panhandle State is in the westernmost part of Oklahoma,
      it''s still east of Colorado''s border.

      - Alamosa (where Adams State is located) is well within Colorado''s borders.


      Step 3: Make the east-west comparison.

      - Since Oklahoma is east of Colorado, and Oklahoma Panhandle State University
      is in Oklahoma, it must be east of any location in Colorado, including Adams
      State University.

      2. Adams State University is in Colorado (CO).


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. The western part of the US
      has lower longitude values (as longitude decreases going westward in the US).


      The Oklahoma panhandle is the narrow strip of Oklahoma that extends westward.

      Colorado, as a whole, is west of Oklahoma.


      However, the question is specifically about Adams State University in Colorado

      Adams State is located.


      Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado, which is in south-central Colorado,
      near the New Mexico border.


      Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in Goodwell, Oklahoma, which is in the
      Oklahoma panhandle.

      First, let''s identify where each university is located:

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in Goodwell, Oklahoma, in the Oklahoma
      panhandle region

      - Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado, in south-central Colorado


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider their geographical positions:


      1. Oklahoma is generally east of Colorado on a US map

      2. The Oklahoma panhandle is the westernmost part of Oklahoma, extending along
      Colorado''s southern border

      3. Alamosa, Colorado (home of Adams State) is located in south-central Colorado

      4. Goodwell, Oklahoma (home of Oklahoma Panhandle State) is in the Oklahoma
      panhandle


      Even though the Oklahoma panhandle extends westward, it is still east of most
      of Colorado, including Alamosa. Colorado as a whole sits west of Oklahoma, including
      the panhandle region.


      Therefore, Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located EAST of Adams State
      University, not west.

      1. Oklahoma Panhandle State University (OPSU) is located in Oklahoma, specifically

      (since longitude decreases as you move west in the US).


      Oklahoma is generally east of Colorado. However, the Oklahoma panhandle extends
      westward, so I need to be more specific about the locations.


      Let me try to recall the specific locations:

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in Goodwell, Oklahoma, in the panhandle
      region.

      - Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado, which is in the south-central
      part of Colorado.


      Colorado is west of Oklahoma generally, but the Oklahoma panhandle extends westward.

      Actually, let me reconsider. The Oklahoma panhandle is quite far west, and Alamosa
      is in south-central Colorado, not the western edge. It''s possible that OPSU
      could be further west.


      I need to be careful here without specific longitude coordinates. Let me think

      the locations of both institutions and compare their east-west positioning.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Touro College is in New York (NY)

      - Central State University is in Ohio (OH)


      In the United States, New York is located on the east coast, while Ohio is in
      the Midwest region. Geographically, Ohio is west of New York.


      Since Touro College is in New York, and Central State University is in Ohio,
      and Ohio is west of New York, it follows that Touro College is EAST of Central
      State University (not west).


      Therefore, the answer is NO - Touro College, NY is not located west of Central
      State University, OH. It''s located east of it.</think>I need to determine the
      relative east-west positions of these two colleges.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Touro College is located in New York (NY)

      - Central State University is located in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region, west of New York


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Ohio is west of New York, any institution in New York would be east
      of an institution in Ohio

      - Therefore, Touro College (NY) is east of Central State University (OH), not
      west of it

      Now I need to think about the geographical positions of these states relative
      to each other.


      New York is on the east coast of the United States, while Ohio is more inland,
      in what''s often called the Midwest region.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States, if we move from east to west,
      we would go from:

      - East Coast (including New York)

      - Moving westward through Pennsylvania

      - Then into Ohio

      - And continuing westward to other Midwest states


      This means that New York is EAST of Ohio, not west of it.


      Therefore, Touro College in NY would be EAST of Central State University in
      OH, not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between New York and Ohio.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, inland from the East Coast

      - On a west-to-east basis, Ohio is west of New York (or equivalently, New York
      is east of Ohio)


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the colleges.

      - Since Touro College is in New York, and Central State University is in Ohio

      - And New York is east of Ohio (not west)

      - Therefore, Touro College would be east of Central State University, not west
      of it

    a4f6ec37-c0e2-4484-9a7b-9d29661ad9ca: '<think>Let me break this down step by step:


      1. I need to determine the locations of University Center Rochester, MN and
      South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center, SD.


      2. University Center Rochester is in Rochester, Minnesota (MN)


      3. South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is in South Dakota (SD)


      4. Now I need to determine the relative positions of these states. Minnesota
      is east of South Dakota. South Dakota borders Minnesota on Minnesota''s western
      side.


      5. Since Rochester is in Minnesota, and Minnesota is east of South Dakota, University
      Center Rochester (in MN) would be east of any location in South Dakota, including

      6. Therefore, University Center Rochester is NOT west of South Dakota Public

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University Center Rochester is in Rochester, Minnesota (MN)

      - South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Minnesota and South Dakota.

      - Minnesota is located east of South Dakota

      - South Dakota borders Minnesota on Minnesota''s western border


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific institutions.

      - Since Rochester is in Minnesota (eastern state), and the other institution
      is in South Dakota (western state), University Center Rochester must be east
      of the South Dakota institution.

      - If University Center Rochester is east, it cannot be west of the South Dakota
      institution.

      to determine the geographical locations of two institutions:

      1. University Center Rochester in Minnesota (MN)

      2. South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center in South Dakota (SD)


      Then I need to determine if the first is west of the second.


      First, let''s establish where these places are located:


      Rochester, MN is in southeastern Minnesota, near the eastern border of the state.


      South Dakota is a state that is west of Minnesota. So any location in South
      Dakota would be west of any location in Minnesota, generally speaking.


      So if University Center Rochester is in Minnesota, and South Dakota Public Universities
      and Research Center is in South Dakota, then the University Center Rochester
      would be EAST of the South Dakota institution, not west.


      Therefore, the answer should be NO, University Center Rochester, MN is NOT located
      west of South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center, SD.</think>I need
      to determine if University Center Rochester in Minnesota is west of South Dakota
      Public Universities and Research Center in South Dakota.


      Step 1: Let me identify the states where these institutions are located.

      - University Center Rochester is in Minnesota (MN)

      - South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Minnesota is located east of South Dakota

      - South Dakota borders Minnesota on Minnesota''s western side


      Step 3: Since Rochester, MN is in southeastern Minnesota, and South Dakota is
      entirely west of Minnesota, any location in Minnesota (including Rochester)
      would be east of any location in South Dakota.


      Step 4: Therefore, University Center Rochester must be east of South Dakota
      Public Universities and Research Center, not west of it.


      NO'

      Step 1: Let me identify where Rochester, MN is located.

      Rochester is in southeastern Minnesota.


      Step 2: Let me identify where South Dakota is relative to Minnesota.

      South Dakota is directly west of Minnesota. Minnesota''s western border meets
      South Dakota''s eastern border.


      Step 3: Since Rochester is in southeastern Minnesota, and South Dakota is west
      of Minnesota, logically Rochester must be east of any location in South Dakota.


      Step 4: Therefore, University Center Rochester, MN would be east of South Dakota
      Public Universities and Research Center, SD (regardless of where exactly in
      South Dakota the latter is located).


      If Rochester is east of South Dakota, then it cannot be west of South Dakota.
      So the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - University Center Rochester is in Rochester, Minnesota

      - South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is in South Dakota


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Minnesota and South Dakota.

      - Minnesota is located east of South Dakota

      - South Dakota shares its eastern border with Minnesota''s western border


      Step 3: Rochester, MN is located in southeastern Minnesota, which places it
      even further east within the state.


      Step 4: Compare the locations.

      Since Rochester is in Minnesota (which is east of South Dakota), University
      Center Rochester must be east of any location in South Dakota, including the
      South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center.


      Therefore, University Center Rochester is NOT west of South Dakota Public Universities
      and Research Center.

      To determine which is further west, I need to know the general geographic positions
      of Montana and Oregon.


      The western United States, from east to west, generally goes:

      - The Mountain states (including Montana)

      - The Pacific states (including Oregon)


      Oregon is on the Pacific coast, while Montana is inland to the east of Oregon.
      This means that Oregon is west of Montana, and consequently, Concordia University
      Portland (in Oregon) would be west of Montana State University (in Montana).


      So Montana State University is NOT west of Concordia University Portland. It''s
      east of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Montana State University is in Montana (MT)

      - Concordia University Portland is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states.

      Oregon is a Pacific coast state, while Montana is an inland state in the Rocky
      Mountain region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the map.

      Oregon lies directly to the west of Montana. The Pacific states (including Oregon)
      are generally west of the Mountain states (including Montana).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Oregon is west of Montana, Concordia University Portland (OR) would be
      west of Montana State University (MT), not the other way around.

      First, let me consider the locations:

      1. New Orleans University in Louisiana - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana,
      near the Gulf of Mexico.

      2. Lee College in Texas - I need to identify where in Texas this is located.


      Lee College is in Baytown, Texas, which is near Houston in the eastern part

      - Louisiana is generally east of Texas

      - New Orleans is in the eastern part of Louisiana

      - Baytown (where Lee College is) is in the eastern part of Texas


      Since Texas is west of Louisiana, and New Orleans is in the eastern part of
      Louisiana, while Baytown is in the eastern part of Texas, New Orleans University
      would be east of Lee College.


      Therefore, New Orleans University is NOT west of Lee College; it''s east of

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Louisiana and Texas.

      - Louisiana is located east of Texas

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana

      - Baytown (where Lee College is) is in eastern Texas


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Even though Baytown is in eastern Texas, all of Louisiana (including New Orleans)
      is still further east than eastern Texas

      - New Orleans is significantly east of Baytown

      Now, let''s think about the specific locations within these states:

      - Regent University is in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which is on the eastern
      coast of Virginia.

      - Owensboro, Kentucky is in the western part of Kentucky.


      Given that Virginia is already east of Kentucky, and Regent University is on
      the eastern side of Virginia, while Owensboro is in the western part of Kentucky,
      Regent University would be east of Owensboro Community and Technical College,
      not west.


      So is Regent University, VA located west of Owensboro Community and Technical
      College, KY? No, it''s actually east of it.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Regent University is in Virginia Beach, Virginia (on the east coast)

      - Owensboro Community and Technical College is in Owensboro, Kentucky (in the
      western part of Kentucky)


      Step 2: Consider the states'' positions.

      - Virginia is on the eastern side of the United States

      - Kentucky is inland and west of Virginia


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - Kentucky is west of Virginia

      - Owensboro is in western Kentucky, making it even further west

      - Virginia Beach (where Regent University is located) is on the eastern coast
      of Virginia


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      - Maine borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east

      - Moving westward from Maine, you encounter New Hampshire, and then Vermont


      Step 3: Since Machias is in Maine, and Community College of Vermont is in Vermont,

      1. Bethel University in Tennessee (TN)

      2. Drury University in Missouri (MO)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Bethel University is located west of Drury
      University.


      To answer this, I need to know the approximate locations of these universities
      within their respective states, and also the relative positions of Tennessee
      and Missouri.


      Let me think about the geographic layout of these states:

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern United States

      - Missouri is in the midwestern United States, somewhat west of Tennessee


      More specifically, Tennessee is directly east of Missouri (though they don''t
      share a border - Arkansas is between them).


      Now, regarding the specific universities:

      - Bethel University in Tennessee is likely somewhere within Tennessee

      - Drury University in Missouri is likely somewhere within Missouri


      Since Missouri as a state is west of Tennessee as a state, a university in Tennessee
      (Bethel) would generally be east of a university in Missouri (Drury), not west
      of it.


      Therefore, Bethel University in TN is likely east of Drury University in MO,
      not west of it.</think>I need to determine if Bethel University in Tennessee
      is located west of Drury University in Missouri.


      Step 1: Let me consider the geographic positions of the states.

      - Missouri is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the Southeast region of the United States


      Step 2: Looking at their relative positions on a map:

      - Missouri is positioned west of Tennessee

      - Tennessee is positioned east of Missouri (with Arkansas between them)


      Step 3: Since universities are located within their respective states:

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee, which is east of Missouri

      - Drury University is in Missouri, which is west of Tennessee


      Step 4: Regardless of their specific locations within each state, a university
      in Tennessee would be east of a university in Missouri due to the states'' positions.


      NO, Bethel University in Tennessee is not located west of Drury University in
      Missouri. It is located east of it.'

      First, let me identify where these universities are:

      1. Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN)

      2. Drury University is in Missouri (MO)


      Now I need to determine their east-west relationship. In the US, states have
      the following general east-west arrangement:

      - Tennessee (TN) is in the southeastern United States

      - Missouri (MO) is in the midwestern United States


      Looking at the general map of the United States, Missouri is generally west
      of Tennessee. Therefore, Bethel University in Tennessee would be EAST of Drury
      University in Missouri, not west.


      So the answer should be NO, Bethel University in TN is not located west of Drury
      University in MO.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Drury University is in Missouri (MO)

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Missouri is located in the midwestern United States

      - Looking at a map of the US, Missouri is positioned to the west of Tennessee


      Step 3: Apply this state relationship to the universities.

      - Since Missouri is west of Tennessee, a university in Tennessee would be east
      of a university in Missouri

      - Therefore, Bethel University (TN) would be east of Drury University (MO),
      not west of it

      - Drury University is located in Springfield, Missouri


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Tennessee and Missouri.

      - Tennessee is positioned east of Missouri in the United States

      - Tennessee and Missouri share a partial border, with Tennessee being to the
      east/southeast of Missouri


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - McKenzie, TN (Bethel University) is in the western part of Tennessee

      - Springfield, MO (Drury University) is in the southwestern part of Missouri

    aae00cb9-f456-4796-9a16-3698c50a5835: '<think>This question asks me to determine
      if Middlesex University in Massachusetts is located west of Syracuse University
      School of Education in New York.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of both institutions

      2. Compare their east-west positions (longitudes)


      First, let me clarify Middlesex University in MA. I believe this is referring
      to Middlesex Community College, which has campuses in Bedford and Lowell, Massachusetts.


      Syracuse University School of Education is in Syracuse, New York.


      Geographically:

      - Massachusetts is generally east of New York State

      - Syracuse is in central New York state

      - Middlesex (Bedford/Lowell area) is in eastern Massachusetts


      In the United States, locations further west have higher longitude values (when
      using negative values as is conventional for the Western Hemisphere).


      Eastern Massachusetts is definitely east of central New York. So Middlesex University
      (or College) would be east of Syracuse University, not west of it.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Middlesex University (or Middlesex Community College) is in Massachusetts,
      with campuses typically in the Bedford/Lowell area in eastern Massachusetts.

      - Syracuse University School of Education is in Syracuse, New York, located
      in central New York state.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Massachusetts and New York.

      - Massachusetts is located to the east of New York State.

      - Syracuse is in central New York.

      - The Bedford/Lowell area (where Middlesex would be) is in eastern Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Any location in eastern Massachusetts would be east of central New York, not
      west.

      - Moving from Syracuse to Middlesex would mean traveling eastward, not westward.


      NO'
