      is in eastern New York, the Southern Oregon Coast Range is definitely located
      west of, and not south of, Otisco Lake.


      The answer is: NO.'

      States.


      2. Swiftcurrent Lake is located in Glacier National Park, Montana, which is
      in the northeastern part of the United States.


      3. Montana is east of Washington.


      4. Since Montana is east of Washington, any location in Montana would be considered
      north of a location in Washington.


      5. Therefore, Swiftcurrent Lake is north of the Salish Sea.


      6. So, the Salish Sea is NOT located south of Swiftcurrent Lake.

      - It is in the western part of the state, near the border with Tennessee


      2. Next, let''s locate Searles Lake in California:

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States

      - North Carolina is east of California


      4. Since North Carolina is east of California, any location in North Carolina
      (like Black Mountains) would be north of locations in California (like Searles

      - New Hogan Lake is located in Calaveras County, California

      - It is in the central part of California, east of San Francisco


      2. Next, I''ll locate Tomales Bay, CA on a map:

      - Tomales Bay is located in Marin County, California

      - It is northwest of San Francisco, near the coast


      3. Compare their relative positions:

      - New Hogan Lake is in the central/eastern part of California

      - Tomales Bay is in the coastal/northwestern part of California

      - This means New Hogan Lake is actually EAST of Tomales Bay, not south


      4. Therefore, the statement is FALSE.


      NO'
