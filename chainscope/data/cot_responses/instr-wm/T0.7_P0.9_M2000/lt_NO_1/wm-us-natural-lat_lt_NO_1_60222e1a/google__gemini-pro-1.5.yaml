      in northern California.


      2. **Locate Tomales Bay:** Tomales Bay is in Marin and Sonoma Counties on the
      Pacific coast of northern California.


      3. **Compare locations:** The Sierra Nevada are east of the Pacific coast.  Therefore,
      New Hogan Lake is east of Tomales Bay.  East/West relationships are irrelevant
      to North/South relationships.  We need to determine if New Hogan Lake is at
      a lower latitude than Tomales Bay.


      4. **Consider Latitude:**  Generally, locations further north have higher latitude.  Since
      the Sierra Nevada foothills are inland and generally south of the coastal region
      of northern California, New Hogan Lake is likely at a lower latitude.


      5. **Confirm:** A quick check of a map confirms New Hogan Lake is significantly
      south of Tomales Bay.
