      2. **Understand the geography**: California is a large state, and these locations
      are relatively far apart. Cuddeback Lake is in the southeastern part of the
      state, while Lake Mojave is in the southern part of the state, near the Arizona
      and Nevada borders.


      3. **Consider the specific locations**: Cuddeback Lake is situated in the Mojave
      Desert, which is in the southeastern part of California. Lake Mojave is located
      along the Colorado River, near the California-Arizona-Nevada border.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Given that Cuddeback Lake is in the southeastern
      part of California and Lake Mojave is in the southern part of the state near
      the border with Arizona and Nevada, we need to consider their relative positions
      north-south.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since Cuddeback Lake is in the southeastern part of California
      and Lake Mojave is in the southern part of the state near the border with Arizona
      and Nevada, Cuddeback Lake is generally south of Lake Mojave. However, the precise
      north-south alignment of these locations would depend on their exact latitudes,
      which might require more detailed geographic information.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      Lake is situated in the central part of Colorado.


      4. **Compare the locations**: The Front Range runs north-south, and Marston
      Lake is in the central part of Colorado, relatively close to the Front Range.
      However, it''s important to note that the Front Range is not a single point
      but a mountain range, so its position relative to Marston Lake can vary.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the north-south orientation of the Front Range and
      the central location of Marston Lake, it is not accurate to say that the Front
      Range is located **south** of Marston Lake. Instead, parts of the Front Range
      are to the north, south, and east of Marston Lake, depending on the specific
      location along the range.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

    0095a1a4-e9e6-49ab-99d9-c3f56d7bba11: 'To determine if the Never Summer Mountains,
      CO, are located south of the Navesink Highlands, NJ, we need to consider their
      geographical locations and compare them.


      1. **Identify the locations**: The Never Summer Mountains are located in northern
      Colorado, specifically in Grand County and Jackson County. They are a part of
      the Rocky Mountains. The Navesink Highlands are located in Monmouth County,
      New Jersey, in the northeastern part of the state.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Colorado is a state in the western United States,
      while New Jersey is a state in the northeastern part of the country. The Rocky
      Mountains run through Colorado, while the Navesink Highlands are a small mountain
      range in New Jersey.


      3. **Consider the relative positions**: Colorado is much farther west than New
      Jersey, which is on the East Coast. In terms of north-south orientation, Colorado
      is generally considered part of the western United States, while New Jersey
      is in the northeastern part of the country.


      4. **Compare the specific locations**: The Never Summer Mountains are in northern
      Colorado, which is relatively far north in the state. The Navesink Highlands
      are in northeastern New Jersey, which is in the northern part of the state.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical locations and the general orientation
      of the states, the Never Summer Mountains in Colorado are not located south
      of the Navesink Highlands in New Jersey. In fact, they are considerably farther
      west and slightly north of the Navesink Highlands.

      \ at 42.0\xB0N latitude.\n- Bear Lake, UT, is approximately at 42.0\xB0N latitude.\n\
      \nThis means Lake Chaubunagungamaug, MA, is at a similar latitude as Bear Lake,\

      south of Jenks Lake, CA, we need to consider the geographical locations of both
      lakes.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the specific locations
      of Show Low Lake and Jenks Lake. Show Low Lake is located in the White Mountains
      of Arizona, while Jenks Lake is situated in the San Bernardino National Forest
      in California.


      2. **Consider Proximity**: Both Arizona and California are neighboring states,
      and the White Mountains of Arizona are relatively close to the San Bernardino
      National Forest in California.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Given the proximity of the two locations, we need
      to consider their relative positions in terms of north-south alignment.


      4. **Geographic Analysis**: Show Low Lake is located in the eastern part of
      Arizona, while Jenks Lake is in the southern part of California. Generally,
      California is considered to be south of Arizona in terms of north-south alignment.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic understanding of the United
      States, Show Low Lake, AZ, is not located south of Jenks Lake, CA. Instead,
      Show Low Lake is more east and slightly north of Jenks Lake, given their respective
      locations within their states.

      This means Shinall Mountain, AR, is at approximately the same latitude as Stoneman\
