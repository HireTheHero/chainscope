      - Woman Lake is positioned more northward in Cass County

      - Ten Mile Lake is positioned more southward in Cass County


      4. Therefore, Ten Mile Lake is located south of Woman Lake.

    bdd89449-42d3-44f8-9634-f1d54c9987ca: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) New Hogan Lake is located in Calaveras County, in the Sierra Nevada foothills
      of central California


      2) Tomales Bay is located along the coast of Marin County, north of San Francisco


      3) Looking at their relative positions on a map:

      - New Hogan Lake is east of Sacramento

      - Tomales Bay is northwest of San Francisco

      - New Hogan Lake is at approximately the same latitude as Tomales Bay, perhaps
      slightly north


      4) Since they are at similar latitudes (with New Hogan Lake possibly being slightly
      further north), New Hogan Lake cannot be south of Tomales Bay
