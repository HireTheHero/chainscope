      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 29205 is a ZIP code in South Carolina (SC)

      - 32601 is a ZIP code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the states.

      - South Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast, north of Florida

      - Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since South Carolina is entirely north of Florida, any location in South Carolina
      must be north of any location in Florida.

      - ZIP code 29205 (in SC) must therefore be north of ZIP code 32601 (in FL)


      Step 4: Determine the answer to the question "Is 29205, SC located south of
      32601, FL?"

      - Since 29205 is in South Carolina, which is north of Florida where 32601 is

      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Washington and Oregon.

      - Washington state is located directly north of Oregon state.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in

      Step 3: Looking at the first three digits:

      - 316xx is in southern Georgia

      - 331xx is in southern Florida


      Step 4: Geographically, Florida is generally south of Georgia, as Georgia is

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Georgia and Florida.

      Georgia is located north of Florida in the United States. Florida extends southward

      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbers themselves.

      In the US zip code system, generally (though not perfectly), lower numbers in

      - 31632 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 33187 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Georgia and Florida.

      Georgia is generally north of Florida, since Florida extends south from Georgia''s
      southern border.


      Step 3: Look at the zip codes themselves.

      In the US zip code system, lower numbers generally (but not always) indicate
      more northern locations within a region.

      - 31632 (GA) has a lower number than 33187 (FL)

      - This suggests 31632 might be more northern, but I need to verify this pattern
      for these specific states.


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      ZIP code 31632 appears to be in southern Georgia, near the Florida border.

      ZIP code 33187 is in southern Florida, near Miami.


      Step 5: Compare the north-south positions.

      Southern Georgia is still north of southern Florida, especially Miami area (33187).

      31632 in GA would be north of 33187 in FL.


      NO, 31632, GA is not located south of 33187, FL. It is located north of it.'

      - 31632 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 33187 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Georgia and Florida.

      Georgia is located north of Florida in general. Florida extends south from Georgia.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbers.

      In the US postal system, zip codes tend to increase from north to south within
      regions. Lower zip codes in this region typically indicate more northern locations.

      - 31632 (GA) has a lower number than 33187 (FL)

      - This suggests 31632 is likely further north


      Step 4: The specific question asks if 31632, GA is south of 33187, FL.

      Based on both the state locations (GA is north of FL) and the zip code numbers
      (31632 is lower than 33187), 31632, GA is almost certainly north of 33187, FL,

      Step 2: Consider the geographic implications of the ZIP codes.

      - In the US ZIP code system, codes generally increase as you move from north
      to south and from east to west.

      - However, there are exceptions, especially at state boundaries.


      Step 3: Compare the ZIP codes.

      - 31632 (GA) has a lower number than 33187 (FL)

      - Lower ZIP codes in this region typically indicate more northern locations


      Step 4: Consider the states.

      - Georgia is generally north of Florida

      - ZIP code 31632 is in southern Georgia, likely near the Florida border

      - ZIP code 33187 is in southern Florida (in the Miami area)

      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Georgia and Florida.

      Georgia is generally north of Florida, as Florida is the southernmost state
      in the continental US.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbers.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      tend to be in the northeastern parts of the country, and higher numbers toward
      the southwest. Within a region, this pattern isn''t perfect, but it provides
      a clue.


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      31632 (GA) has a lower number than 33187 (FL). Given the general zip code pattern

      33187, not south of it.


      Step 5: Check the specific locations.

      31632 is in Lenox, Georgia, in the southern part of Georgia.

      33187 is in Miami-Dade County, in the very southern part of Florida.


      Since Georgia is north of Florida, and 31632 is in southern Georgia while 33187

      two zip codes and compare their north-south relationship.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 40108 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)

      - 35951 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Kentucky is located north of Alabama in the United States.

      - Kentucky borders Tennessee to its south, and Tennessee borders Alabama to
      its south.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Even the southernmost parts of Kentucky would generally be north of locations
      in Alabama.

      - The numbering of zip codes doesn''t directly correlate with latitude, so I
      need to rely on the state locations.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since 40108 is in Kentucky, and 35951 is in Alabama, and Kentucky is north
      of Alabama, the Kentucky zip code must be north of the Alabama zip code.


      NO (40108, KY is not south of 35951, AL - it is north of it)'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.

      - 40108 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Kentucky is generally north of Alabama in the United States.


      Step 3: Let me check the specific locations of these zip codes.

      - 40108 appears to be in Ekron, Kentucky, which is in the northern part of Kentucky

      - 35951 appears to be in Albertville, Alabama, which is in the northeastern
      part of Alabama


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      Kentucky is entirely north of Alabama. Even the southernmost point of Kentucky
      is north of the northernmost point of Alabama. Therefore, any location in Kentucky
      (including 40108) would be north of any location in Alabama (including 35951).


      Since 40108, KY is north of 35951, AL (not south), the answer is:

      To determine this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south position)


      ## Step 1: Identifying the locations

      - 40108 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)

      - 35951 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)


      ## Step 2: Geographical knowledge

      - Kentucky is a state that borders the northern part of Tennessee

      - Alabama is located south of Tennessee

      - Therefore, Alabama is generally south of Kentucky


      ## Step 3: Specific zip code locations

      - Kentucky zip codes starting with 40xxx are typically in the north-central
      part of Kentucky

      - Alabama zip codes starting with 35xxx are in the northern part of Alabama

      - Even northern Alabama is still south of most of Kentucky


      ## Conclusion

      Since 40108 is in Kentucky and 35951 is in Alabama, and Kentucky is located
      north of Alabama, zip code 40108, KY is NOT south of zip code 35951, AL. It

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 40108 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Kentucky is located north of Alabama in the United States.


      Step 3: While specific zip codes within states could potentially cross this
      general pattern, the numbering of these zip codes actually confirms the standard
      geography:

      - The first three digits of zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower
      numbers are in the northeast and higher numbers are in the southwest.

      - 35xxx (Alabama) is a lower zip code prefix than 40xxx (Kentucky), which aligns
      with Alabama being south of Kentucky.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Kentucky is north of Alabama, and the specific zip code 40108 is in Kentucky
      while 35951 is in Alabama, 40108 is located north of 35951, not south.

      Step 3: Consider zip code patterns.

      - While specific zip codes can vary within states, the general geographic fact
      that Kentucky is entirely north of Alabama means that any location in Kentucky
      would be north of any location in Alabama.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since 40108, KY is in Kentucky, and 35951, AL is in Alabama, and Kentucky

      - 24523 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative north-south positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia in the United States

      - This suggests that locations in PA would typically be north of locations in
      VA


      Step 3: However, I should verify if this specific case follows the general pattern.

      - Looking at the specific zip codes: 15683 is in southwestern PA

      - 24523 is in central/southern VA

      - Even in southwestern PA, locations are still north of central/southern VA


      Step 4: Conclusion based on geographic positions:

      - 15683 (PA) is located in a state that is north of Virginia

      - The specific location of this zip code is still north of 24523 in VA


      NO (15683, PA is not located south of 24523, VA - it''s located north of it)'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 15683 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 24523 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and Virginia.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state that borders Virginia''s northern neighbor
      (Maryland)

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania (with Maryland in between)


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers are in the eastern/northeastern
      parts of the country

      - 15xxx zip codes are in western Pennsylvania

      - 24xxx zip codes are in central/southern Virginia


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Pennsylvania is north of Virginia, and these specific zip codes follow
      the standard geographic distribution within their states, a location in Pennsylvania
      (15683) would be north of a location in Virginia (24523).

      - Therefore, 15683, PA is NOT south of 24523, VA. It is north of it.

      - 77360 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Arkansas and Texas.

      - Arkansas is generally located north of Texas in the United States.

      - Arkansas borders the northern part of Texas.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Zip codes in the US generally increase from north to south within regions.

      - 72xxx series is used in Arkansas

      - 77xxx series is used in Texas


      Step 4: Compare the locations.

      - Since Arkansas is north of Texas, and these zip codes follow the standard
      pattern, 72601 in Arkansas would be north of 77360 in Texas.

      - This means 72601, AR is NOT south of 77360, TX.

      - Indiana is located north of Kentucky (Kentucky is directly south of Indiana).


      Step 2: Looking at the zip codes:

      - 46565 is a zip code in Indiana

      - 42141 is a zip code in Kentucky


      Step 3: Since Indiana is north of Kentucky, and these zip codes are in their
      respective states, a zip code in Indiana (46565) would be north of a zip code
      in Kentucky (42141).

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 46565 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 42141 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Indiana and Kentucky.

      - Indiana is located north of Kentucky in the United States.

      - Kentucky borders Indiana to the south.


      Step 3: Check if this general state relationship applies to these specific zip
      codes.

      - Indiana zip codes typically begin with 46-47

      - Kentucky zip codes typically begin with 40-42

      - These zip codes (46565 in IN and 42141 in KY) follow the standard pattern
      for their states


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since 46565 is in Indiana, which is north of Kentucky, and 42141 is in Kentucky,
      which is south of Indiana, the zip code 46565, IN would be located north of

      Step 1: Let me think about the general geography of these two states. Indiana
      is located north of Kentucky, as Kentucky borders the southern part of Indiana.


      Step 2: ZIP codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend
      to be in the eastern and northern parts of the country, while higher numbers
      tend to be in the western and southern parts.


      Step 3: The ZIP code 46565 is in Indiana, and it starts with a higher number
      (46) than the ZIP code 42141 in Kentucky, which starts with 42.


      Step 4: However, the general pattern of ZIP codes doesn''t always determine
      north-south relationships precisely, especially for states that are adjacent
      to each other.


      Step 5: The crucial factor is that Indiana is geographically positioned north
      of Kentucky, regardless of the specific ZIP codes. Any location in Indiana would
      be north of Kentucky, not south.


      NO - 46565, IN is not located south of 42141, KY. It is located north of it
      because Indiana is north of Kentucky.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 24482 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA)

      - 27896 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of VA and NC.

      - Virginia is located north of North Carolina on the US East Coast

      - In general, Virginia ZIP codes would be north of North Carolina ZIP codes


      Step 3: Check if there might be exceptions.

      - While there could be unusual border situations, the standard arrangement of
      these states is clear

      - Virginia''s southern border meets North Carolina''s northern border

      - ZIP codes follow this general north-south arrangement


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      - Since 24482 is in Virginia, and 27896 is in North Carolina, and Virginia is
      north of North Carolina, the Virginia ZIP code would be north of the North Carolina

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 54180 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 60651 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine their relative geographic positions.

      - Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois in the United States.

      - To be more precise, I need to check these specific zip codes.


      Step 3: Check the specific zip codes.

      - 54180 is in northeastern Wisconsin (likely in or near Green Bay area)

      - 60651 is in Chicago, Illinois (northern Illinois)


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Wisconsin zip codes in the 541xx range are typically in the northeastern part
      of the state

      - Chicago zip codes (606xx) are in the northern part of Illinois

      - Even the southernmost parts of Wisconsin are generally north of Chicago


      Step 5: Make the determination.

      - Since 54180 is in Wisconsin and 60651 is in Chicago, Illinois, and Wisconsin
      is north of Illinois, 54180 would be north of 60651, not south.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both zip codes.

      - 54180 is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 60651 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Wisconsin and Illinois.

      - Wisconsin is located north of Illinois in the United States.

      - Wisconsin borders Illinois on Illinois''s northern border.


      Step 3: Look at the specific zip codes.

      - Wisconsin zip codes generally start with 53 or 54, with northern Wisconsin
      areas typically having 54 as the first two digits.

      - Illinois zip codes generally start with 60-62, with 60 and 61 covering the
      northern parts of the state.

      - 60651 is in Chicago, which is in the northeastern part of Illinois.

      - 54180 is in northeastern Wisconsin.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Since Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and 54180 is in Wisconsin while 60651
      is in Illinois, 54180 must be north of 60651.

      - Therefore, 54180, WI cannot be south of 60651, IL.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 28602 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29404 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      North Carolina is generally located north of South Carolina. The states share
      a border with NC to the north of SC.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      In the US postal system, zip codes tend to start with lower numbers in the northeast
      and increase as you move south and west. However, this is a general pattern
      with many exceptions, especially within neighboring states.


      Step 4: Analyze these specific zip codes.

      28602 (in NC) has a lower first digit (2) than 29404 (in SC), which has a first
      digit of (2) as well but a higher second digit (9 vs 8). This suggests that
      28602 is likely further north within the general zip code numbering scheme.


      Step 5: Combine geographic knowledge with zip code information.

      Since North Carolina is north of South Carolina, and the zip code numbering
      generally supports this (28xxx in NC vs 29xxx in SC), 28602, NC would be north

      Let me think step by step:


      1) 28602 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      2) 29404 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)

      3) Generally, North Carolina is located north of South Carolina

      4) US zip codes are organized such that the first three digits (the "sectional
      center facility" or SCF) generally follow geographic patterns

      5) Zip codes starting with 286xx are in the Hickory area of North Carolina

      6) Zip codes starting with 294xx are in the Charleston area of South Carolina

      7) Hickory, NC is in the western part of North Carolina

      8) Charleston, SC is in the eastern coastal part of South Carolina

      9) Even though there might be some local variations in the north-south positioning,
      the general geography of the states means that locations in North Carolina (including
      Hickory) are north of locations in South Carolina (including Charleston)


      Therefore, 28602 (Hickory, NC) is NOT south of 29404 (Charleston, SC). It is
      north of it.

      south of 29404, SC. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 28602 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29404 is a ZIP code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between North Carolina and South
      Carolina.

      - North Carolina is generally located north of South Carolina (as suggested
      by the "North" and "South" in their names)


      Step 3: Consider the ZIP code numbering system.

      - In the US postal system, ZIP codes generally follow a pattern where lower
      numbers are assigned to areas in the northeastern US, and numbers increase as
      you move south and west

      - The first digit indicates a broad geographic region (2 covers the mid-Atlantic
      states)

      - The first three digits identify the sectional center facility


      Step 4: Compare the ZIP codes.

      - 28602 (NC) starts with 286

      - 29404 (SC) starts with 294

      - The 294 prefix is higher than 286, which typically indicates a more southern
      or western location


      Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on the state locations and ZIP code patterns.

      - North Carolina is north of South Carolina

      - The ZIP code pattern (286xx vs 294xx) aligns with this north-south relationship


      NO, 28602, NC is not located south of 29404, SC. It is located north of it.'

      - 28602 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29404 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      Generally, North Carolina is north of South Carolina, which suggests that a
      NC zip code would typically be north of a SC zip code.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      The first digits of zip codes in the US roughly correspond to geographic regions,
      with lower numbers generally being more northern within the same region.

      - 28602 (NC) starts with "286"

      - 29404 (SC) starts with "294"


      Since both zip codes are in the same region (the Carolinas) and 286xx is a lower
      number than 294xx, this further suggests that 28602 is likely north of 29404.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geographic knowledge.

      28602 is in Hickory, NC, which is in the western part of North Carolina.

      29404 is in Charleston, SC, which is in the southeastern coastal part of South
      Carolina.

      Step 1: Let me identify the states.

      - 72364 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 70711 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Arkansas and Louisiana.

      - Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - While zip codes aren''t perfectly geographic, they generally follow patterns.

      - Arkansas zip codes typically start with 716-729

      - Louisiana zip codes typically start with 700-714


      Step 4: Compare the specific locations.

      - Since 72364 is in Arkansas, and Arkansas is north of Louisiana, this zip code
      is likely north of any Louisiana zip code.

      - 70711 is in Louisiana, which is south of Arkansas.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 72364 is a zip code in Arkansas (AR)

      - 70711 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana in the United States.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      In the US zip code system, lower numbers generally (but not always) correspond
      to more eastern and northern locations, while higher numbers tend to be more
      western and southern. However, this pattern isn''t reliable for comparing across
      state boundaries.


      Step 4: Compare specific locations.

      72364 is in Arkansas, likely in the southern part of the state based on the
      zip code pattern within AR.

      70711 is in Louisiana, which is entirely south of Arkansas.


      Step 5: Make a conclusion based on state boundaries.

      Since Louisiana is geographically south of Arkansas, and these zip codes are
      in their respective states, 72364 (in AR) must be north of 70711 (in LA), not
      south.

      located directly north of Louisiana in the United States.


      3) Looking at zip code patterns, in the US, zip codes generally increase from

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 18210 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 22406 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, bordering New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
      Maryland, West Virginia, and Ohio.

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, as it borders Maryland which is south of
      Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: More specifically, let me think about these zip codes.

      - Zip codes generally increase as you move south to north on the East Coast.

      - 18xxx zip codes are typically in northeastern Pennsylvania.

      - 22xxx zip codes are typically in northern Virginia.


      Step 4: The zip code 18210 is lower than 22406, which normally would suggest
      it''s further north, not south. This confirms the general state positioning.


      Step 5: Specifically, 18210 is in Carbon County, PA in the northeastern part
      of Pennsylvania, while 22406 is in Stafford County, VA in the northern part
      of Virginia.


      NO, 18210, PA is not located south of 22406, VA. It is located north of it,

      Step 3: While specific zip codes might have unusual arrangements, the overall
      state positions are clear. Pennsylvania borders Virginia''s northern neighbor
      (Maryland), and Pennsylvania is definitively north of Virginia.


      Step 4: Since 18210 is in Pennsylvania and 22406 is in Virginia, and Pennsylvania
      is north of Virginia, then 18210 must be north of 22406.

      Step 2: Now I need to determine their relative north-south positions. In the
      US, zip codes generally follow patterns where lower numbers are in the eastern
      parts of the country, but within the same first digit, the second and third
      digits often indicate north-south positioning.


      Step 3: However, rather than relying on zip code patterns, I should consider
      the actual geographic locations:

      - Gallup, NM (87301) is located in northwestern New Mexico

      - Green Valley, AZ (85614) is located in southern Arizona, near the Mexican
      border


      Step 4: Comparing these locations on a map, Green Valley is significantly further
      south than Gallup. Gallup is in the northern half of New Mexico, while Green
      Valley is very close to the Mexican border in the southern part of Arizona.


      NO, 87301 (Gallup, NM) is NOT located south of 85614 (Green Valley, AZ). It
      is actually located north of it.'
