      and south to north.  While 46565 is numerically higher than 42141, the state
      context overrides the numerical difference.  Since Indiana is north of Kentucky,

      but they share a border.


      2. **Consider border proximity:** Since the states border each other, zip codes
      in southern Oklahoma could be south of zip codes in northern Texas.  We need
      to determine if this is the case here.
