      1. **Locate 72364, AR**: This zip code corresponds to the area of West Memphis
      in Arkansas.

      2. **Locate 70711, LA**: This zip code corresponds to the area of Baton Rouge

      Next, we need to consider the geographical locations of these two places:


      - **West Memphis, AR** is located just across the Mississippi River from Memphis,
      TN, and is situated in the northeastern part of Arkansas.

      - **Baton Rouge, LA** is located in the southeastern part of Louisiana.


      Now, we need to assess their relative positions:


      - West Memphis is north of Baton Rouge. When looking at a map, we can see that
      West Memphis is positioned to the north of Baton Rouge, which is further south
      in the state of Louisiana.


      Based on the analysis, we conclude that:


      72364, AR (West Memphis) is **not** located south of 70711, LA (Baton Rouge).
