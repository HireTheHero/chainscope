      07852 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      22134 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).


      In general, I know that:

      1. New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States

      2. Virginia is located in the southeastern United States, south of New Jersey


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - New Jersey is north of Virginia on the US east coast

      - Therefore, locations in NJ would typically be north of locations in VA


      Since 07852 is in NJ and 22134 is in VA, the NJ zip code would be north of the
      VA zip code, not south of it.


      Therefore, 07852, NJ is NOT located south of 22134, VA. It''s located north
      of it.</think>I need to determine if 07852, NJ is south of 22134, VA by examining

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 07852 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 22134 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is located in the mid-Atlantic region, south of New Jersey

      - On a north-south axis, New Jersey is north of Virginia


      Step 3: Apply this state-level knowledge to the zip codes

      - Since 07852 is in New Jersey, and 22134 is in Virginia

      - And New Jersey is north of Virginia

      - Then 07852 would be north of 22134, not south of it

      07852 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      22134 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Broadly speaking, New Jersey is a northeastern state, and Virginia is a mid-Atlantic

      zip codes to be sure.


      07852 appears to be the zip code for Hackettstown, NJ

      22134 appears to be the zip code for Dumfries, VA or Triangle, VA area


      New Jersey is entirely north of Virginia on the US east coast. Virginia is south
      of Maryland, which is south of Pennsylvania and Delaware, which are south of
      New Jersey.

      - 22134 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States, while Virginia is in
      the mid-Atlantic region. Looking at a map of the US, New Jersey is positioned
      north of Virginia along the eastern seaboard.


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      The entire state of New Jersey lies north of Virginia. Between them are Delaware,
      Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania. Since 07852 is in New Jersey and 22134
      is in Virginia, the New Jersey zip code must be north of the Virginia zip code.

    9448694a-f456-4b38-af89-dee6a680aefd: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to find out where these zip codes are located and then determine their relative
      positions.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 84009, UT is a zip code in Utah (UT)

      - 86326, AZ is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)


      In terms of general geography of the US, Utah is located north of Arizona. Utah
      shares its southern border with Arizona.


      However, I need to be more specific about these particular zip codes, as zip
      codes near the border could have different relative positions than the general
      state relationship.


      Let me think about the zip code numbering system. In general, the first three
      digits of a zip code indicate a sectional center facility or a major city. The
      first digit typically indicates a group of states, with lower numbers in the
      northeast and higher numbers in the west and southwest.


      84XXX is typically Utah

      86XXX is typically Arizona


      Given that Utah is north of Arizona, and these zip codes follow the standard
      pattern, 84009, UT should be north of 86326, AZ.


      Therefore, 84009, UT is NOT south of 86326, AZ. It would be north of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 84009 is in Utah (UT)

      - 86326 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geography of these states.

      Utah is located directly north of Arizona. They share a border, with Utah being
      the northern neighbor.


      Step 3: Check if these specific zip codes might be exceptions to the general
      state positions.

      84009 is in South Jordan, Utah, which is in the northern half of Utah.

      86326 is in Cottonwood, Arizona, which is in central Arizona.


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Since Utah is north of Arizona, and these zip codes are in standard locations
      within their respective states, 84009 (UT) must be north of 86326 (AZ), not
      south of it.

      to figure out the relative locations of two zip codes:

      1. 84009, UT (Utah)

      2. 86326, AZ (Arizona)


      Let me think about the geography of these states first. Utah is north of Arizona
      in the United States. Utah borders Arizona''s northern edge.


      Now, I need to determine where these specific zip codes are located within their
      respective states:


      84009 is in Utah. Utah zip codes generally start with 840-847.

      86326 is in Arizona. Arizona zip codes generally start with 850-865.


      Since this is a zip code in Utah (84009), it''s in Utah somewhere. And since
      86326 is in Arizona, it''s in Arizona somewhere.


      Given that Utah is north of Arizona, generally speaking, locations in Utah would
      be north of locations in Arizona. However, I need to be careful because:

      1. The specific zip codes might be near the border

      2. The Utah zip code could be in southern Utah while the Arizona zip code could
      be in northern Arizona


      Without specific geographic coordinates for these zip codes, I can make a reasonable
      inference based on the general geographic relationship between Utah and Arizona.
      Since Utah is north of Arizona, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, the most likely answer is that 84009, UT is north of 86326, AZ, not
      south.</think># Is 84009, UT located south of 86326, AZ?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 84009 is in Utah (UT)

      - 86326 is in Arizona (AZ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between states

      Utah is located directly north of Arizona on the US map. Utah shares its southern
      border with Arizona''s northern border.


      ## Step 3: Consider possible locations within each state

      Even if 84009 is in southern Utah and 86326 is in northern Arizona, the Utah
      zip code would still be north of the Arizona zip code because of the states''
      positions relative to each other.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Utah is north of Arizona geographically, and these zip codes are in their
      respective states, 84009, UT must be north of 86326, AZ, not south of it.

      Let me think about these zip codes:

      - 84009 is in Utah (UT)

      - 86326 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Generally speaking, Utah is north of Arizona. Most of Utah is above Arizona
      on a map of the United States. This gives me an initial guess that 84009, UT
      would be north of 86326, AZ (not south).


      However, to be precise, I should consider the specific locations of these zip
      codes, as states have irregular shapes. Utah is mostly north of Arizona, but
      I need to check the specific zip codes.


      84009 is a zip code in Utah, likely in the northern or central part of the state.

      86326 is a zip code in Arizona, and without specific knowledge of where it is
      in Arizona, I would guess it''s not in the far northern part of Arizona that
      borders Utah.


      Based on general geography knowledge, Utah is north of Arizona, so a Utah zip
      code is very likely to be north of an Arizona zip code, not south of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes
      by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 84009 is in Utah (UT)

      - 86326 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Utah is located directly north of Arizona on the US map. Utah shares its southern
      border with Arizona''s northern border.


      Step 3: Consider zip code numbering and locations

      Generally, Utah zip codes (starting with 840-847) are all north of most Arizona
      zip codes (starting with 85-86).


      Step 4: Specific locations

      - 84009 is in the Salt Lake City area of Utah

      - 86326 is in central Arizona (Cottonwood area)


      Since Utah is geographically north of Arizona, and these specific zip codes
      follow the standard geographic distribution within their states, 84009 in Utah
      would be north of 86326 in Arizona, not south.

      84009 in Utah (UT) is located south of zip code 86326 in Arizona (AZ).


      To answer this, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these
      zip codes. Generally, in the US:

      - Utah (UT) is located north of Arizona (AZ)

      - Lower zip code numbers don''t necessarily correlate with geographic location


      Let me think about the states specifically:

      - Arizona (AZ) is directly south of Utah (UT)

      - Utah shares its southern border with Arizona

      - In general, locations in Utah would be north of locations in Arizona


      The question is asking about specific zip codes though, not just the states.
      In this case:

      - 84009 is a zip code in Utah

      - 86326 is a zip code in Arizona


      Since Utah is north of Arizona, and these zip codes appear to be standard postal
      codes for their respective states (not unusual outliers), the zip code in Utah
      (84009) would be north of the zip code in Arizona (86326), not south of it.</think>To

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 84009 is in Utah (UT)

      - 86326 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Utah is located directly north of Arizona in the United States.

      - They share a border, with Utah above and Arizona below.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Since these appear to be standard zip codes for their respective states (not
      unusual outliers), their relationship would follow the general state geography.

      - A location in Utah (84009) would generally be north of a location in Arizona
      (86326).

      - 40475, KY is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: I need to recall the relative positions of Indiana and Kentucky.

      Indiana is located north of Kentucky. Kentucky borders Indiana to the south.
      The Ohio River forms much of the boundary between these two states, with Indiana

      Since we''re comparing 46013 (IN) with 40475 (KY), and Indiana is generally
      north of Kentucky, it''s likely that 46013 is north of 40475, not south.


      But to be more precise, I should consider that both states have some geographic
      variation and border areas might have more complex relationships. However, the
      general relationship between these states is that Indiana is north of Kentucky.


      So, 46013, IN is most likely north of 40475, KY, not south of it.</think># Is
      46013, IN located south of 40475, KY?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 46013 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 40475 is in Kentucky (KY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship of these states

      Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky on the US map. The two states
      share a border, with Indiana positioned above Kentucky.


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      Zip code 46013 is in Indiana, which means it must be north of the Indiana-Kentucky
      border.

      Zip code 40475 is in Kentucky, which means it must be south of the Indiana-Kentucky
      border.


      ## Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Since 46013 is in Indiana (a northern state relative to Kentucky) and 40475
      is in Kentucky (a southern state relative to Indiana), 46013 cannot be south
      of 40475.

      97236 is a zip code in Oregon. Oregon is generally north of California on the
      west coast of the United States.


      95425 is a zip code in California.


      Based on the general geographic knowledge, Oregon is north of California. This
      would suggest that 97236, OR would be north of 95425, CA, not south.


      However, I should be careful because zip codes don''t always follow a strict
      north-to-south numbering pattern, and there could be exceptions along state
      borders. Let me think more precisely about these specific zip codes.


      97xxx zip codes are indeed in Oregon, with higher numbers generally in the northern
      part of the west coast.

      95xxx zip codes are in California, with numbers in this range typically in northern
      California.

      Oregon is located directly north of California along the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Check if there might be any exceptions based on specific zip code locations

      While zip codes don''t always follow perfect north-south patterns, the general
      numbering system and state locations are reliable indicators here. Oregon zip
      codes (97xxx) are consistently north of California zip codes (95xxx).


      Step 4: Make my determination

      Since Oregon is north of California, and these zip codes follow the standard

      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - Oregon is located north of California on the west coast of the United States

      - So generally, locations in Oregon would be north of locations in California


      Now let''s check the specific zip codes:

      2. 95425 is a zip code in California (CA)

      3. I need to determine if the Oregon zip code is south of the California zip

      Generally speaking, Oregon is north of California on the U.S. West Coast. This
      would suggest that 97236, OR is NOT south of 95425, CA, but rather north of
      it.


      However, I should be careful because zip codes don''t perfectly follow a north-to-south
      progression, and there could be exceptions depending on the specific locations.
      Let me think about what I know about zip code patterns:


      In the United States, zip codes tend to start with lower numbers in the northeast
      and increase as you go west and south. For example:

      - 0xxxx: Northeast (Maine, NH, VT, MA, RI, etc.)

      - 1xxxx: Northeast/Mid-Atlantic (NY, PA, etc.)

      - 9xxxx: West Coast (CA, OR, WA, AK, HI)


      Within the 9xxxx range:

      - Oregon zip codes typically start with 970-979

      - Washington zip codes typically start with 980-994


      Since 97236 is in the Oregon range and 95425 is in the California range, and
      Oregon is north of California, the Oregon zip code (97236) is almost certainly
      north of the California zip code (95425), not south of it.</think>I need to
      determine if a zip code in Oregon is south of a zip code in California.


      Step 1: Consider the general geographic positions of the states.

      Oregon is located directly north of California on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Look at the zip code patterns.

      US zip codes follow patterns where:

      - California zip codes typically begin with 900-961

      - Oregon zip codes typically begin with 970-979


      Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 97236 is an Oregon zip code

      - 95425 is a California zip code

      CA (California).


      I need to determine if 97236, OR is located south of 95425, CA.


      First, let me think about the general geography of Oregon and California:

      - Oregon is a state located north of California on the US West Coast

      - Generally speaking, Oregon locations are north of California locations


      Now, let''s look at the specific zip codes:

      - 97236 is in Oregon (OR)

      - 95425 is in California (CA)


      Based on the general geography, since Oregon is north of California, it would
      be unusual for a location in Oregon to be south of a location in California.
      The typical arrangement would be that Oregon zip codes are north of California
      zip codes.


      So my reasoning suggests that 97236, OR is likely NOT south of 95425, CA, but
      is instead north of it.


      Let me double-check by thinking about any unusual geographical arrangements.
      There could be exceptions if:

      1. The zip code in Oregon is in the very southern part of Oregon

      2. The zip code in California is in the very northern part of California

      3. There''s some unusual geographic feature or border arrangement


      But even in these cases, it would be unusual for an Oregon location to be south
      of a California location due to the overall geographic arrangement of these
      states.</think># Is 97236, OR located south of 95425, CA?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider state locations

      Oregon (OR) is located entirely north of California (CA) on the US West Coast.


      ## Step 2: Analyze zip code patterns

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern
      US and higher numbers in the western US

      - Within the western region, northern areas typically have higher first digits
      than southern areas

      - 97xxx (Oregon) vs 95xxx (California) follows this pattern - Oregon has higher
      first digits than California


      ## Step 3: Confirm location

      Since Oregon is geographically north of California, and the zip code numbering
      pattern confirms this relationship (97xxx being further north than 95xxx), zip
      code 97236 in Oregon must be north of zip code 95425 in California.


      NO, 97236, OR is not located south of 95425, CA. It is located north of it.'

      2) 32601 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      The question is asking if the SC zip code is south of the FL zip code.


      Generally speaking, South Carolina is north of Florida in the United States.
      Florida is the southernmost state in the continental US, while South Carolina
      is several states to the north.


      Looking at zip codes more specifically:

      - Zip codes in the US roughly follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be
      in the northeastern parts of the country and higher numbers in the southwestern
      parts

      - The first digit of "2" in 29205 indicates it''s in a more northern region
      than the first digit of "3" in 32601


      So just from the zip code pattern, 29205 (SC) should be north of 32601 (FL),
      not south of it.


      Additionally, we know that South Carolina as a state is entirely north of Florida

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States, while South
      Carolina is located several states north of Florida.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code numbering pattern.

      The US zip code system generally follows a pattern where codes increase as you
      move from northeast to southwest. The first digit "2" in 29205 indicates a more
      northern region than the first digit "3" in 32601.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on both state geography and zip code patterns.

      Since South Carolina is entirely north of Florida, any location in SC (including
      29205) must be north of any location in FL (including 32601).

    99395cd4-3849-4c58-a90f-ef7fb60968f8: '<think>I''m asked to determine if 29205,
      SC is located south of 32601, FL.


      To answer this question, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative north-south positions

      3. Conclude whether the SC location is south of the FL location


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 29205 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 32601 is in Florida (FL)


      Geographically, South Carolina is a state that is north of Florida. Florida
      is the southernmost state in the continental US, while South Carolina is several
      states to the north.


      Given this general knowledge:

      - South Carolina is north of Florida

      - Therefore, any location in South Carolina (including 29205) would be north
      of locations in Florida (including 32601)

      - If 29205, SC is north of 32601, FL, then it is NOT south of it


      So, 29205, SC is not located south of 32601, FL.</think>To determine if 29205,
      SC is located south of 32601, FL, I''ll examine their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 29205 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 32601 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States, while South
      Carolina is located several states north of Florida.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since South Carolina is entirely north of Florida geographically, any location
      in South Carolina (including zip code 29205) must be north of any location in
      Florida (including zip code 32601).


      Step 4: Determine the answer

      If 29205 in SC is north of 32601 in FL, then it cannot be south of it.


      NO'
    c6a6c490-c8b5-4e6e-a351-13d8460eb8d4: '<think>Let me reason through this step
      by step:


      1) I need to determine if ZIP code 29205 in South Carolina is located south
      of ZIP code 32601 in Florida.


      2) First, I''ll note that South Carolina (SC) is generally north of Florida
      (FL) in the United States. Florida is the southernmost state in the continental
      US, while South Carolina is several states to the north.


      3) The ZIP codes themselves also give some indication of location. In the US
      ZIP code system, lower numbers tend to be assigned to the eastern and northeastern
      parts of the country, and higher numbers to the western and southern parts.


      4) 29205 (SC) has a lower first digit (2) than 32601 (FL) with first digit (3),
      which actually indicates that South Carolina''s ZIP is in a region that''s generally
      further north and east in the ZIP code assignment system.


      5) Given these two pieces of information - that South Carolina is geographically
      north of Florida, and that the ZIP code patterns support this - I can conclude
      that 29205, SC is located NORTH of 32601, FL, not south of it.</think># Is 29205,
      SC located south of 32601, FL?


      I need to analyze this geographically by looking at the states and their relative
      positions.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) 29205 is a ZIP code in South Carolina (SC)

      2) 32601 is a ZIP code in Florida (FL)

      3) Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States

      4) South Carolina is located several states north of Florida

      5) Any location in South Carolina would be north of a location in Florida

      6) Therefore, 29205 in SC must be north of 32601 in FL (not south)


      ## Answer: NO


      ZIP code 29205 in South Carolina is not located south of ZIP code 32601 in Florida.'

      to determine the locations of both zip codes and compare their geographical
      positions.


      1. 98229, WA - This is a zip code in Washington state

      2. 97227, OR - This is a zip code in Oregon state


      Geographically, Washington state is located north of Oregon state in the United
      States. Washington shares its southern border with Oregon.


      Since 98229 is in Washington (WA) and 97227 is in Oregon (OR), and Washington
      is north of Oregon, it follows that 98229 (WA) would be north of 97227 (OR),
      not south.


      Therefore, 98229, WA is NOT located south of 97227, OR. It''s located north
      of it.</think>I need to determine the relative locations of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 98229 is in Washington (WA)

      - 97227 is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Washington is located directly north of Oregon along the west coast of the
      United States.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering.

      - While zip codes don''t strictly follow a north-to-south pattern, the general
      numbering supports this geographic relationship. The "98" prefix is typically
      used for Washington, while the "97" prefix is used for Oregon.


      Step 4: Determine the relative position.

      - Since 98229 is in Washington and 97227 is in Oregon, and Washington is north
      of Oregon, the zip code 98229 must be north of 97227, not south.

      3. Determine their north-south relationship


      The US zip code system generally assigns codes geographically, with lower numbers

      geographic region (0-9 from east to west).


      98229 is in Washington state (WA)

      97227 is in Oregon state (OR)


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Washington is north of Oregon (WA is above OR on a map of the US)


      Now, the zip codes:

      - 98229 starts with "98" (Washington)

      - 97227 starts with "97" (Oregon)


      Even though 98229 has a higher number than 97227, the geographical fact that
      Washington state is located north of Oregon state is the determining factor
      here. Zip codes don''t always perfectly align with latitude (north-south position).

      is in Oregon (OR).


      2) Geographically, Washington state is located directly north of Oregon state.


      3) While the zip code number for Washington (98229) is higher than Oregon''s

      determine if the zip code 98229 in Washington (WA) is located south of zip code
      97227 in Oregon (OR).


      First, let me recall the geographical relationship between Washington and Oregon:

      - Washington is located north of Oregon on the west coast of the United States.


      Now, let me consider the zip codes:

      - 98229 is in Washington state

      - 97227 is in Oregon state


      Since Washington is generally north of Oregon, it would be unlikely that a Washington
      zip code would be south of an Oregon zip code. However, there could be some
      exceptions along the border areas.


      Let me think about the zip code numbering system. In the US postal system, zip
      codes generally follow geographic patterns where:

      - Lower numbers tend to be in the eastern US

      - Higher numbers tend to be in the western US


      Within a state or region, there''s often some north-south patterning, but it''s
      not perfectly consistent.


      For Washington state, zip codes generally start with 980-994.

      For Oregon state, zip codes generally start with 970-979.


      The fact that the Washington zip code (98229) has a higher first three digits
      than the Oregon zip code (97227) aligns with the general pattern that Washington
      zip codes are numbered higher than Oregon zip codes.


      Given that Washington is north of Oregon, and the zip code numbering generally
      follows state boundaries, it''s highly unlikely that 98229, WA would be south
      of 97227, OR.</think>I need to determine if the zip code 98229 in Washington

      Step 1: Consider the geographical relationship between Washington and Oregon.

      Washington state is located directly north of Oregon state on the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Analyze the zip codes.

      98229 is in Washington state

      97227 is in Oregon state


      Step 3: Apply geographical knowledge.

      Since Washington is positioned entirely north of Oregon, any location in Washington
      (including 98229) must be north of any location in Oregon (including 97227).


      Step 4: Check for possible exceptions.

      There are no unusual border arrangements between these states that would create
      exceptions to this north-south relationship.


      NO - 98229, WA is not located south of 97227, OR. It is located north of it.'

      locations.


      Washington state is located north of Oregon state in the United States. Generally
      speaking, locations in Washington would be north of locations in Oregon.


      Also, looking at the zip code numbers themselves: US zip codes tend to increase
      as you go from east to west, and also generally increase as you go from south
      to north. So the fact that 98229 (WA) has a higher number than 97227 (OR) suggests
      that the Washington location might be further north and/or west.


      Given that Washington state is north of Oregon state, and the zip code numbering
      pattern supports this, I can conclude that 98229, WA is not south of 97227,

      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow geographic patterns, with numbers increasing
      from east to west and south to north.

      - The Washington zip code (98229) has a higher number than the Oregon zip code
      (97227), which is consistent with Washington being north of Oregon.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      First, I need to recall the geographic relationship between Washington and Oregon.
      Washington state is located directly north of Oregon on the west coast of the
      United States.


      Given this general geographic relationship, a zip code in Washington (WA) would

      However, I should also consider the specific locations of these zip codes, as
      border areas could have exceptions to the general north-south relationship.


      The first digits of US zip codes generally follow geographic patterns:

      - 9xxxx covers the west coast states

      - 98xxx is typically northern Washington

      - 97xxx is typically Oregon


      Since 98229 is in Washington and 97227 is in Oregon, and Washington is north

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Washington state is located directly north of Oregon state on the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      In the US zip code system, the first three digits generally indicate geographic
      regions. The pattern 982xx indicates northern Washington, while 972xx indicates
      northern Oregon.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state and zip code geography.

      Since Washington is north of Oregon, and these particular zip codes follow the

      Since Washington is north of Oregon, generally speaking, locations in Washington

      98229 appears to be a zip code in Bellingham, WA, which is in the northern part
      of Washington state near the Canadian border.


      97227 appears to be a zip code in Portland, OR, which is in the northern part

      Step 1: Consider the geographic relationship between Washington and Oregon states.

      Washington state is located directly north of Oregon state.


      Step 2: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      US zip codes generally increase from east to west and from south to north. The
      higher number (98229) is in Washington, while the lower number (97227) is in
      Oregon.

      - 97227 is in Oregon (OR)


      Geographically, Washington state is located north of Oregon state. This is a

      Step 2: Consider the zip code relationship.

      - Washington zip codes typically start with 98 or 99

      - Oregon zip codes typically start with 97

      - The geographic fact that Washington is north of Oregon means that any Washington

      code 31632 in Georgia is located south of ZIP code 33187 in Florida.


      First, I''ll look at the latitudes:

      - 31632 has "316" as the first three digits of the ZIP code. The first digit
      "3" generally corresponds to the southeastern US states.

      - 33187 has "331" as the first three digits, also in the southeastern US.


      The key information here is that ZIP codes generally follow some geographical
      patterns, but I need to be careful because they don''t perfectly align with
      latitude.


      In general, for US ZIP codes, lower numbers in the first three digits tend to
      be assigned to areas more in the north within a region, and higher numbers tend
      to be more in the south. However, this is complicated by the fact that we''re
      comparing a Georgia ZIP code with a Florida ZIP code.


      Georgia is generally north of Florida. Florida extends southward into the Gulf
      of Mexico. The ZIP code 31632 is in Georgia, while 33187 is in Florida.


      The first digits (3 in both cases) indicate they''re both in the southeastern
      US. The second digit (1 vs 3) suggests that 31632 would be more northern than
      33187, because lower second digits generally correspond to more northern areas
      within the same first-digit region.


      So, based on the ZIP code patterns, 31632 in Georgia is likely north of 33187
      in Florida, not south of it.</think>To determine if 31632, GA is south of 33187,
      FL, I need to analyze the geographic relationship between these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 31632 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 33187 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states

      - Georgia is located directly north of Florida

      - Florida extends southward below Georgia


      Step 3: Analyze the ZIP code patterns

      - In the U.S. ZIP code system, within the same region, lower numbers typically
      indicate more northern locations

      - 31632 has a lower number than 33187

      - This suggests 31632 is more northern within the same general region


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations

      - ZIP code 31632 is in southern Georgia

      - ZIP code 33187 is in southern Florida (in the Miami-Dade area)

      - Southern Florida extends much further south than any part of Georgia


      Therefore, 31632, GA is NOT located south of 33187, FL. In fact, it''s the opposite
      - 31632 is located north of 33187.

      to determine if zip code 31632 in Georgia (GA) is located south of zip code
      33187 in Florida (FL).


      First, let me consider the general geography of Georgia and Florida:

      - Georgia is generally north of Florida, as Florida is the southernmost state
      in the continental United States.

      - However, specific zip codes near the border could have different relative
      positions.


      To determine this more precisely, I need to understand what these specific zip
      codes represent:


      31632 is a zip code in Georgia (GA).

      33187 is a zip code in Florida (FL).


      Since zip codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend
      to be in the northeastern parts of the country and higher numbers in the southwestern
      parts, the fact that 31632 is a lower number than 33187 suggests it might be
      more northeastern.


      However, different states have their own ranges of zip codes, so I can''t rely
      solely on the numbers.


      Let me think about this more carefully:

      - Georgia zip codes generally start with 30, 31, or 39

      - Florida zip codes generally start with 32, 33, or 34


      Since 31632 is in GA and 33187 is in FL, and given the general geographic relationship
      between the states, it''s likely that 31632 is north of 33187.</think>I need

      Step 1: First, let''s consider the general geography of Georgia and Florida.

      Georgia is located north of Florida on the US map. Florida is the southernmost
      state in the continental United States.


      Step 2: Let''s look at the specific zip codes.

      31632 is in Georgia (GA)

      33187 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 3: Looking at specific locations:

      - 31632 is in south Georgia, likely in the southern part of the state near the
      Florida border

      - 33187 is in the Miami-Dade County area, which is in the southern tip of Florida


      Step 4: Making the comparison.

      Even though 31632 is in southern Georgia, it cannot be south of a zip code in
      southern Florida, since all of Georgia is north of southern Florida. Miami-Dade
      County (where 33187 is located) is one of the southernmost counties in the continental
      United States.

      to determine the relative locations of two US zip codes:

      1. 31632, GA (Georgia)

      2. 33187, FL (Florida)


      I need to figure out which one is located further south.


      First, let me think about the general geography. Georgia is generally north
      of Florida, as Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States.
      However, zip codes near the border could have different relative positions.


      For zip codes in the US, generally:

      - Lower numbers in the first three digits often correspond to more northeastern
      locations

      - Higher numbers often correspond to more southwestern locations


      In this case:

      - 31632 (GA) has a first three digits of 316

      - 33187 (FL) has a first three digits of 331


      The FL zip code has a higher first three digits, which typically would mean
      it''s further southwest. However, the state boundary complicates things.


      Since Florida is south of Georgia, and zip codes within each state generally
      follow regional patterns, we would expect most Georgia zip codes to be north
      of Florida zip codes.


      31632 is in Georgia, which is generally north of Florida.

      33187 is in Florida, which is generally south of Georgia.


      Based on this reasoning, 31632 (GA) should be north of 33187 (FL), not south.


      So the answer is NO, 31632, GA is not located south of 33187, FL.


      Actually, let me double-check my logic. I''m not 100% confident in my understanding
      of how zip codes are distributed. The fact that 31xxx is lower than 33xxx could
      potentially mean 31632 is actually further north and east than 33187. But I''m
      forgetting that we''re specifically told these are in GA and FL respectively.


      Given that 31632 is in Georgia and 33187 is in Florida, and Georgia is north
      of Florida, it would be unusual (though not impossible) for the Georgia zip
      code to be south of the Florida one.

      I''m going to rely on the general geography that Georgia is north of Florida.</think>#

      2) Looking at the general geography of these states, Florida is located south
      of Georgia. The entire state of Georgia borders the northern part of Florida.


      3) However, I need to check the specific zip codes since border areas could
      have exceptions.


      4) 31632 appears to be in southern Georgia, in Berrien County.


      5) 33187 is in Miami-Dade County, which is in the far southern part of Florida.


      6) Given that Miami-Dade County is near the southern tip of Florida, and even
      the southernmost parts of Georgia are still north of southern Florida, 31632

      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - Georgia is located north of Florida (Florida is the southernmost state in
      the continental US)

      - In the US zip code system, the first three digits typically indicate a general
      region


      Now, let''s examine these specific zip codes:

      - 31632 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 33187 is in Florida (FL)


      Based on the general geography, one would expect locations in Georgia to be
      north of locations in Florida. However, zip codes don''t follow a perfect north-to-south
      pattern, so I need to be careful.


      The first digits (3 in both cases) indicate these are both in the southeastern
      US.

      The second digits (1 for GA and 3 for FL) suggest different regions within the

      Generally, within the first digit region "3", lower second digits are typically

      south of 33187, FL, I need to:


      1. Identify where 31632, GA is located (latitude and longitude)

      2. Identify where 33187, FL is located (latitude and longitude)

      3. Compare their latitudes to determine which is further south (lower latitude
      number means further south in the northern hemisphere)


      I don''t have the exact coordinates for these zip codes in my knowledge, but
      I can reason about this using the zip code system and state locations:


      1. 31632 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      2. 33187 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Generally speaking, Florida is south of Georgia, as Georgia is directly north
      of Florida. However, the question is about specific zip codes.


      In the US zip code system, lower numbers generally (but not always) correspond
      to more northern/eastern areas, while higher numbers tend to be more southern/western.
      But this is not a strict rule - zip codes are assigned in clusters.


      Florida zip codes typically start with 32 or 33, while Georgia zip codes typically
      start with 30 or 31.


      Since 31632 is in Georgia and 33187 is in Florida, and Florida is generally
      south of Georgia, it would seem unlikely that a Georgia zip code would be south
      of a Florida zip code.


      However, I need to consider the possibility that this particular Georgia zip
      code might be in southern Georgia, near the Florida border, and the Florida
      zip code might be in northern Florida. But given that the Florida zip code starts
      with 33, it''s likely in southern Florida (33xxx codes tend to be used in the
      Miami area and southern Florida).


      So 31632 (GA) is almost certainly north of 33187 (FL).</think>I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general geographic relationship.

      Georgia (GA) is located directly north of Florida (FL) on the US east coast.


      Step 2: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      In the US zip code system, the first three digits generally indicate geographic
      regions. The zip code 31632 is in Georgia, while 33187 is in Florida.


      Step 3: Look at specific regions within states.

      Zip codes beginning with 316xx are typically in southern Georgia.

      Zip codes beginning with 331xx are typically in southern Florida (Miami-Dade
      County area).


      Step 4: Consider the latitude comparison.

      Southern Florida (including the Miami area where 33187 is located) is significantly
      further south than any point in Georgia, including the southernmost parts where
      31632 would be.


      NO - 31632, GA is not located south of 33187, FL.'

      Let''s break this down:

      - 08022 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      I need to determine if 12192, NY is south of 08022, NJ.


      In general, zip codes in the US follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to
      be in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country, while higher numbers
      tend to be in the western and southwestern parts. But this pattern primarily
      goes from east to west, not north to south.


      New York is generally north of New Jersey. However, this isn''t enough to determine
      the answer because the specific locations of these zip codes could vary from
      this general pattern.


      For these specific zip codes:

      - 12xxx zip codes in NY are typically in the eastern part of New York

      - 08xxx zip codes in NJ are typically in the southern part of New Jersey


      Given that New York is north of New Jersey, and these specific zip codes follow

      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 12192 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 08022 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between NY and NJ

      New York State is generally located north of New Jersey. There are some exceptions
      along the border, but this is the predominant geographic relationship.


      ## Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes

      - Zip codes starting with 121xx are typically in the eastern part of upstate

      - Zip codes starting with 080xx are typically in the southern/central region

      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Given that NY is generally north of NJ, and these specific zip codes follow
      the standard geographic distribution pattern (12192 being in upstate NY and
      08022 being in southern/central NJ), the NY location would be north of the NJ

      To determine if one location is south of another, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A lower latitude means further south.


      Let me break this down:

      1) 40108 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)

      2) 35951 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)


      In general, Kentucky is north of Alabama in the United States. Kentucky borders
      Tennessee on its southern edge, and Tennessee borders Alabama on its northern
      edge. So geographically speaking, Kentucky is typically north of Alabama.


      The zip code numbers themselves also give us a clue. In the US zip code system,
      lower numbers tend to be in the eastern parts of the country, with higher numbers
      in the western parts. The first digit often indicates a general region. The
      "4" in 40108 suggests it''s in a more northern region than the "3" in 35951.


      Given these facts:

      - Kentucky is generally north of Alabama

      - The zip code patterns suggest 40108 is likely in a more northern region than
      35951


      Therefore, 40108, KY would be NORTH of 35951, AL, not south of it.</think>I
      need to determine whether one zip code is south of the other by comparing their

      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      Kentucky (KY) is located north of Alabama (AL) in the United States. Kentucky
      borders Tennessee to its south, and Tennessee borders Alabama to its north.


      Step 2: Consider the general pattern of US zip codes.

      While zip codes don''t perfectly align with latitude, the first digit often
      correlates with geographic regions. The "4" in 40108 indicates a more northern
      region than the "3" in 35951, which aligns with Kentucky being north of Alabama.


      Step 3: Determine the relative position.

      Since Kentucky is north of Alabama, and these zip codes follow the standard
      regional pattern, 40108 in Kentucky would be north of 35951 in Alabama, not
      south of it.

      To answer this, I need to consider the general geographic positions of these
      states and potentially the specific locations of these zip codes.


      First, let''s think about the general geography:

      - Kentucky (KY) is a state that is generally north of Alabama (AL)

      - Alabama is in the deep south of the United States

      - Kentucky borders Tennessee, which borders Alabama to the north


      So generally speaking, locations in Kentucky tend to be north of locations in
      Alabama, not south. But let me think more specifically about these zip codes.


      Zip code 40108 is in Kentucky (KY). Kentucky is entirely north of Alabama, so
      any zip code in Kentucky would be north of any zip code in Alabama.


      Zip code 35951 is in Alabama (AL). Alabama is entirely south of Kentucky, so
      any zip code in Alabama would be south of any zip code in Kentucky.


      Therefore, zip code 40108 in Kentucky is NOT located south of zip code 35951

      if zip code 40108 in Kentucky (KY) is located south of zip code 35951 in Alabama
      (AL).


      Step 1: Consider the geographic relationship between Kentucky and Alabama.

      Kentucky is located in the central-eastern United States, while Alabama is in
      the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare the relative positions of these states.

      Kentucky is positioned entirely north of Alabama. Kentucky''s southern border
      connects with Tennessee, and Tennessee''s southern border connects with Alabama.


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the zip codes.

      Since 40108 is in Kentucky and 35951 is in Alabama, and Kentucky is entirely
      north of Alabama, zip code 40108 must be north of zip code 35951.

      To answer this, I need to:

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning)


      For 40108, KY:

      This is a zip code in Kentucky. Kentucky is generally north of Alabama in the

      For 35951, AL:

      This is a zip code in Alabama. Alabama is generally south of Kentucky.


      Based on the general geographic knowledge, Kentucky is north of Alabama. Therefore,

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Kentucky is located directly north of Tennessee, which is north of Alabama.
      The entire state of Kentucky is positioned north of Alabama on the US map.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      Since Kentucky is entirely north of Alabama geographically, any location in
      Kentucky (including zip code 40108) must be north of any location in Alabama
      (including zip code 35951).


      NO - 40108, KY is not located south of 35951, AL. It is located north of it.'

      - Kentucky is generally north of Alabama in the United States.


      This gives me an initial hypothesis that 40108, KY is likely NOT south of 35951,
      AL.


      However, I should be more precise. US zip codes aren''t perfectly ordered by
      latitude, but there is some geographic consistency in their numbering system.
      Lower zip code numbers tend to be in the eastern US, and they increase as you
      go west. The first digit roughly divides the country into regions:

      - Zip codes starting with 3 (like 35951) cover the southeastern states including
      Alabama

      - Zip codes starting with 4 (like 40108) cover states like Kentucky, Tennessee,
      and parts of the Midwest


      Since Kentucky is north of Alabama, and the zip code patterns align with this
      (4xxxx for Kentucky, 3xxxx for Alabama), it''s very likely that 40108, KY is
      NORTH of 35951, AL, not south of it.


      Therefore, 40108, KY is NOT located south of 35951, AL.</think># Is 40108, KY
      located south of 35951, AL?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      - 40108 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states

      Kentucky is located entirely north of Alabama in the United States. Kentucky
      borders Tennessee to its south, while Alabama is south of Tennessee.


      ## Step 3: Check zip code patterns

      The zip code numbering system in the US has some geographic correlation:

      - Zip codes starting with 3 (like 35951) cover southeastern states including
      Alabama

      - Zip codes starting with 4 (like 40108) cover states including Kentucky


      ## Conclusion

      Since Kentucky is positioned north of Alabama geographically, 40108 in Kentucky
      must be north of 35951 in Alabama, not south of it.

      south of 35951, AL, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations corresponding to these zip codes

      2. Determine their latitudes

      3. Compare the latitudes (lower latitude = more south)


      40108 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)

      35951 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)


      Let''s think about the general geography:

      - Kentucky is a state that borders the northern part of Tennessee

      - Alabama is south of Tennessee

      - In general, Kentucky is north of Alabama


      Based on the general locations of these states, it''s very likely that any location
      in Kentucky would be north of a location in Alabama, not south.


      So the location with zip code 40108 in Kentucky is likely north of the location
      with zip code 35951 in Alabama.


      Therefore, 40108, KY is not south of 35951, AL.</think>I need to determine if
      a location in Kentucky is south of a location in Alabama by comparing their
      geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider the general geographic arrangement of these states.

      Kentucky is located north of Tennessee, while Alabama is south of Tennessee.
      This means Kentucky is generally north of Alabama.


      Step 2: Think about the latitude coordinates.

      Locations in Kentucky typically have higher latitude values (more northerly)
      than locations in Alabama, which have lower latitude values (more southerly).


      Step 3: Apply this geographic knowledge to the specific zip codes.

      Since 40108 is in Kentucky and 35951 is in Alabama, the Kentucky zip code (40108)
      would be north of the Alabama zip code (35951), not south of it.

      of 35951, AL, I need to:


      1. Find the geographical locations (latitude/longitude) of both zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes - a lower latitude means further south


      40108 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)

      35951 is a zip code in Alabama (AL)


      I know generally that Kentucky is north of Alabama in the United States. Kentucky
      borders Tennessee to its south, and Tennessee borders Alabama to its south.
      So generally speaking, locations in Kentucky tend to be north of locations in
      Alabama.


      To be completely sure though, let''s think more specifically about these zip
      codes:


      US zip codes generally follow patterns where:

      - First digit indicates a large geographical region (4 for KY, 3 for AL)

      - Kentucky zip codes start with 4, which typically indicates more northern states
      than those starting with 3

      - Alabama zip codes start with 3, indicating more southern states


      Based on this general pattern of US zip codes, 40108 in Kentucky would be north
      of 35951 in Alabama, not south.


      So the answer is likely NO, 40108 KY is not south of 35951 AL.</think># Is 40108,
      KY located south of 35951, AL?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 40108 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Kentucky is located entirely north of Alabama in the United States. Kentucky''s
      southern border connects with Tennessee, and Tennessee''s southern border connects
      with Alabama.


      ## Step 3: Consider zip code patterns

      US zip codes follow general geographic patterns where lower first digits typically
      represent more southern/eastern regions. Alabama zip codes (3xxxx) generally
      represent locations south of Kentucky zip codes (4xxxx).


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Since Kentucky is geographically north of Alabama, any location in Kentucky
      (including 40108) would be north of, not south of, locations in Alabama (including
      35951).

      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is generally north of Virginia (VA) in the United States.

      - The northern border of Virginia touches the southern border of Pennsylvania.


      However, I need to be more specific since we''re talking about particular zip

      - Pennsylvania borders Virginia''s northern neighbor, Maryland


      Given that Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia, my initial guess would

      Looking at the geographic relationship between these states:

      2. Find the location of 24523, VA (Virginia)

      3. Compare which one is more south (has a lower latitude)


      Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia, which gives me an initial intuition

      15683 appears to be a zip code in Pennsylvania, likely in the southwestern part
      of the state.

      24523 appears to be a zip code in Virginia, likely in the central or western
      part of the state.


      Virginia as a whole is south of Pennsylvania. Even the northernmost parts of
      Virginia are generally south of the southernmost parts of Pennsylvania. Since
      15683 is in PA and 24523 is in VA, it''s very likely that 15683 is north of

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 15683 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 24523 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship of these states

      Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia. Pennsylvania shares its southern
      border with Maryland and West Virginia, while Virginia is south of those states.


      ## Step 3: Consider zip code patterns

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the northeast
      and higher numbers move south and west. The fact that the PA zip code (15xxx)
      has a lower number than the VA zip code (24xxx) further supports that the PA
      location is more northern.


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      Since Pennsylvania is geographically north of Virginia, and there are no unusual
      border configurations that would place any part of PA south of VA, the zip code
      15683 in PA must be north of 24523 in VA.

      Generally, Oregon is north of California, since California is the southernmost
      western state and Oregon is directly above it. So my initial assumption would
      be that any Oregon location would be north of any California location, not south.


      However, I should be more precise about these specific zip codes:


      97330 appears to be in Corvallis, Oregon, which is in the western part of Oregon.

      94585 appears to be in Suisun City, California, which is in the northern part
      of California.


      Even though 94585 is in northern California, California extends quite far north,
      but Oregon is still entirely north of California. So any location in Oregon,
      including 97330 (Corvallis), would be north of any location in California, including
      94585 (Suisun City).


      Therefore, 97330, OR is NOT south of 94585, CA. It is north of it.</think>#
      Is 97330, OR located south of 94585, CA?


      I need to determine the geographical relationship between these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 97330 is a zip code in Oregon (OR)

      - 94585 is a zip code in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions

      Oregon is located directly north of California on the west coast of the United
      States. The entire state of Oregon is north of California.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations

      - 97330 is in Corvallis, Oregon (western Oregon)

      - 94585 is in Suisun City, California (northern California)


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      Even though 94585 is in northern California, any location in Oregon will still
      be north of any location in California due to the states'' geographical arrangement.

      positions of two zip codes: 72601, AR (Arkansas) and 77360, TX (Texas).


      First, let me think about the general geography of these states. Arkansas is
      generally north of Texas, with Arkansas bordering the northeastern part of Texas.
      However, specific zip codes can vary in their relative positions, so I need
      to be more precise.


      For zip codes in the US, generally lower numbers are in the northeast and the
      numbers increase as you go south and west. So 72xxx would typically be north
      of 77xxx. Let''s verify this:


      - 72601 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 77360 is in Texas (TX)


      The first digit of US zip codes corresponds to a geographical region:

      - 0-1: Northeast

      - 2-3: Mid-Atlantic and Southeast

      - 4-5: Midwest

      - 6: Central

      - 7: South Central (including Texas and Arkansas)

      - 8-9: West


      Since both zip codes start with 7, they''re both in the South Central region.
      The second digit provides more specific location information within the region.


      For ZIP codes starting with 7:

      - 70-71: Louisiana

      - 72: Arkansas

      - 73-74: Oklahoma

      - 75-79: Texas


      Based on this pattern, 72xxx (Arkansas) is generally north of 77xxx (Texas).


      Therefore, 72601, AR is generally north of 77360, TX, not south of it.</think>To
      determine whether 72601, AR is south of 77360, TX, I need to analyze the geographical

      - 72601 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 77360 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Understand how US zip codes are organized.

      The first digit (7) places both in the South Central region. The second digits
      tell us more specific locations:

      - 72xxx zip codes are designated for Arkansas

      - 77xxx zip codes are designated for Texas


      Step 3: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Arkansas is positioned directly north of Texas. The entire state of Arkansas
      is north of most of Texas.


      Step 4: Verify the specific zip code locations.

      72601 is in Harrison, Arkansas, in the northern part of the state.

      77360 is in Oakhurst, Texas, in the eastern part of Texas.


      Based on these geographical positions, 72601 (Arkansas) is located north of

      \nLet me approach this geographically:\n\n1. First, I need to consider the general\

      \n2. Zip codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are\
      \ in the northeast and higher numbers are in the southwest. So 72601 would typically\
      \ be northeast of 77360 based just on the numbering pattern.\n\n3. More specifically:\n\
      \   - Arkansas zip codes generally start with 716-729\n   - Texas zip codes\
      \ generally start with 750-799\n\n4. 72601 is in Arkansas, which is generally\
      \ north of Texas. However, I need to be careful because Arkansas is east of\
      \ Texas, and the question specifically asks about \"south\" direction.\n\n5.\
      \ Looking at the specific location, 72601 is the zip code for Harrison, AR,\

      \ (72601) is in northern Arkansas, it would be north of a location in Texas\
      \ (77360).\n\n8. Therefore, 72601, AR is NOT south of 77360, TX. It's actually\

      \ and Texas.\nArkansas is positioned directly north of Texas on the US map.\
      \ While Texas extends further west and east than Arkansas, the general north-south\
      \ relationship is clear - Arkansas sits above Texas.\n\nStep 3: Check the specific\
      \ locations of these zip codes within their states.\n- 72601 (Harrison) is in\
      \ northern Arkansas\n- 77360 is in eastern Texas\n\nStep 4: Determine the north-south\

      south of 77044, TX, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes (a lower latitude means further south)


      73020 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK)

      77044 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Oklahoma is typically north of Texas

      - Oklahoma borders Texas on Texas''s northern border


      This general knowledge suggests that locations in Oklahoma are typically north
      of locations in Texas, which would mean 73020, OK would be north of 77044, TX,
      not south.


      However, we need to be precise since zip codes near the border could have different
      relationships. Let me reason about this more carefully:


      The central part of Oklahoma is definitely north of the central part of Texas.
      The zip code 73020 appears to be in central Oklahoma, while 77044 appears to
      be in southeast Texas (likely in the Houston area based on the numbering).


      Houston area zip codes (770xx-772xx) are in the southeastern part of Texas,
      which is far from the Oklahoma border and much further south than central Oklahoma.


      So a zip code in central Oklahoma (73020) would be north of a zip code in southeast
      Texas (77044).</think># Is 73020, OK located south of 77044, TX?


      Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to understand the geographical relationship between Oklahoma
      (OK) and Texas (TX). In general, Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas
      on the map of the United States.


      2) The zip code 73020 is in Oklahoma. Based on its prefix (730xx), it''s likely
      in the central part of Oklahoma.


      3) The zip code 77044 is in Texas. The 770xx prefix indicates it''s in the Houston
      area, which is in the southeastern part of Texas.


      4) Since Oklahoma borders Texas on Texas''s northern edge, and Houston is in
      the southern part of Texas, a location in Oklahoma would be north of Houston,
      not south of it.


      5) Therefore, 73020 in Oklahoma would be located north of 77044 in Texas.

      - 73020, OK is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 77044, TX is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine their relative north-south positions.

      In the US, Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas. The border between these
      two states runs east-west, with Oklahoma being north of Texas.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Since 73020 is in Oklahoma and 77044 is in Texas, and Oklahoma is north of Texas,
      then generally zip code 73020 would be north of zip code 77044.

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Oklahoma and Texas.

      Oklahoma shares its southern border with Texas, meaning Oklahoma is located
      directly north of Texas.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific zip codes.

      Since 73020 is in Oklahoma and 77044 is in Texas, and Oklahoma is positioned
      north of Texas, zip code 73020 would be north of zip code 77044.


      NO (73020, OK is not south of 77044, TX; it is north of it)'

      73020 is a ZIP code in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is generally north of Texas.


      Step 2: Let me find the location of 77044, TX.

      77044 is a ZIP code in Texas. Texas is generally south of Oklahoma.


      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, it would seem that 73020, OK would be NORTH

      However, I should check the specific locations of these ZIP codes more carefully,
      as the border between states isn''t a straight line, and there could be exceptions.


      73020 appears to be in the central part of Oklahoma, in the Oklahoma City area.

      77044 appears to be in the Houston area of Texas, which is in the southeastern

      - 73020 is in the central part of Oklahoma, in the Oklahoma City area

      - 77044 is in the Houston area, which is in the southeastern part of Texas


      Step 4: Compare their north-south positions.

      The Oklahoma City area is significantly north of Houston. Even though these

      Let''s break this down:

      1. First, I need to identify the approximate geographical locations of these
      zip codes

      2. Then compare their latitudes to determine which is further south (lower latitude
      = more south)


      For 73020, OK:

      This is a zip code in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is generally north of Texas, which
      suggests that it might be north of the Texas zip code. But I need to check the
      specific locations.


      For 77044, TX:

      This is a zip code in Texas. Texas is generally south of Oklahoma, but Texas
      is a large state and its northern parts can be further north than some parts
      of Oklahoma.


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I know that generally:

      - Oklahoma is positioned directly north of Texas

      - However, zip codes near the border could have a different relationship


      To answer this definitively, I''d need to know that:

      - 73020 is in central Oklahoma (near Oklahoma City area)

      - 77044 is in the Houston area of Texas, which is in southeast Texas


      Houston is much further south than central Oklahoma. So 77044, TX would be south
      of 73020, OK.

      determine if 73020, OK is located south of 77044, TX, I need to find the geographic

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 73020 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK), specifically for the Blanchard area

      - 77044 is a zip code in Texas (TX), in the Houston area


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Oklahoma and Texas.

      - Oklahoma is positioned directly north of Texas on the map

      - Houston is located in southeastern Texas, quite far south in the state


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Blanchard, OK (73020) is in central Oklahoma

      - Houston, TX (77044) is in southeast Texas, much farther south

      - The Houston area is significantly south of any point in Oklahoma

      Let me break it down:

      1. 54143, WI - This is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)

      2. 61611, IL - This is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      I need to determine if the Wisconsin zip code is south of the Illinois zip code.


      Generally speaking, Wisconsin is north of Illinois, as Illinois is directly
      south of Wisconsin on the map. So the typical assumption would be that a Wisconsin
      zip code would be north of an Illinois zip code, not south.


      However, state borders aren''t perfectly horizontal, so I need to consider the
      specific locations of these zip codes.


      54143 appears to be in northeastern Wisconsin, likely near the Michigan border.

      61611 appears to be in central Illinois.


      Since Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and these zip codes don''t appear to be
      in unusual border areas that might create exceptions, it''s very likely that
      54143, WI is north of 61611, IL, not south of it.</think># Is 54143, WI located

      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois on the US map. The entire state
      of Wisconsin is positioned north of Illinois.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific zip code locations

      - Wisconsin zip codes (including 54143) are generally at higher latitudes (more
      northern) than Illinois zip codes

      - Illinois zip codes (including 61611) are at lower latitudes (more southern)
      than Wisconsin zip codes

      \nStep 2: Let me think about the numeric pattern of ZIP codes.\nZIP codes generally\

      - 61611, IL (Illinois)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geography of these locations.

      Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois. Illinois borders Wisconsin to the
      south.


      Step 3: However, I need to check the specific zip codes since border areas can
      sometimes contradict the general state positions.


      54143 appears to be a zip code in northeastern Wisconsin, likely near the Michigan
      border.

      61611 appears to be a zip code in central Illinois.


      Step 4: Consider latitude (north-south positioning).

      Wisconsin zip codes typically start with 53xxx-54xxx and are at higher latitudes
      (more north).

      Illinois zip codes typically start with 60xxx-62xxx and are at lower latitudes
      (more south).

      - Illinois ZIP codes generally begin with 60-62

      The numbering follows a general north-to-south pattern in the US postal system.

      - 54143, WI is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 61611, IL is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      Now, I need to think about their geographic positions. Generally:

      - Wisconsin (WI) is located north of Illinois (IL) in the United States


      However, the specific zip codes could be near the border, so I should consider
      their specific locations rather than just the states.


      Let me think about US geography:

      - Wisconsin is directly north of Illinois

      - The northern part of Illinois borders the southern part of Wisconsin

      extends south of Illinois)

      and there might be portions where this general rule doesn''t apply. But in this
      case, the entire state of Indiana is north of Kentucky.


      So a zip code in Indiana (46565) would be north of a zip code in Kentucky (42141),
      not south of it.</think>To determine if 46565, IN is south of 42141, KY, I need

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 46565 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 42141 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Recall the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky

      - The Ohio River forms most of the border between these states

      - Kentucky is entirely south of Indiana


      Step 3: Apply this geographical knowledge to the specific zip codes.

      Since Indiana is completely north of Kentucky, any location in Indiana (including
      zip code 46565) must be north of any location in Kentucky (including zip code
      42141).

      to determine the locations of these two zip codes and compare their latitudes
      to see which one is further south.


      Step 1: Identify the zip codes and their states.

      - 46565 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 42141 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Recall the general geographic relationship between Indiana and Kentucky.

      Indiana is north of Kentucky. Kentucky borders Indiana to the south. The Ohio
      River generally forms the boundary between the two states.


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within each state.

      While the general relationship is that Indiana is north of Kentucky, I need
      to check if these specific zip codes might be exceptions. Some parts of states
      can extend further north or south than the general state-to-state relationship
      would suggest.


      However, for US zip codes, the first three digits generally indicate the geographic
      region, and the first digit especially correlates with latitude (roughly). The
      "4" at the beginning of both suggests they''re in the same general latitude
      band, but the "46" versus "42" suggests that 46565 is likely further north than
      42141.


      Given this information, I can conclude that 46565, IN is very likely north of
      42141, KY, not south of it.</think>I need to determine whether zip code 46565
      in Indiana is south of zip code 42141 in Kentucky.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic relationship between Indiana and Kentucky.

      Indiana is generally located north of Kentucky. The Ohio River forms the natural
      boundary between these two states, with Indiana on the north side and Kentucky
      on the south side.


      Step 2: Look at the zip code patterns.

      US zip codes tend to follow geographic patterns. Codes beginning with 4 cover
      several Midwestern states, but within this region:

      - Zip codes starting with 46-47 cover northern and central Indiana

      - Zip codes starting with 42 cover western Kentucky


      Step 3: Compare specific locations.

      Zip code 46565 is in northern Indiana, while 42141 is in southern Kentucky.
      This means that 46565 is clearly north of 42141, not south of it.

      To solve this, I need to know the relative positions of these zip codes. Let
      me think about the geography of the United States:


      1. Indiana (IN) is a state in the Midwest region of the United States.

      2. Kentucky (KY) is a state that borders Indiana to the south.


      Generally speaking, Kentucky is south of Indiana. That would suggest that a
      zip code in Indiana would NOT be south of a zip code in Kentucky.


      However, state borders aren''t perfect straight lines, and there could be exceptions
      depending on the exact locations. But in general, Indiana is north of Kentucky,
      so a zip code in Indiana (46565) is likely north of a zip code in Kentucky (42141).


      Therefore, 46565, IN is likely NOT south of 42141, KY.</think>I need to determine
      if zip code 46565, IN is located south of zip code 42141, KY.


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1. 46565 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)

      2. 42141 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)

      3. Geographically, the state of Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky

      4. Indiana and Kentucky share a border, with Indiana being the northern neighbor

      5. Since Indiana is north of Kentucky, locations in Indiana would generally
      be north of locations in Kentucky


      Given the geographical relationship between these two states, a zip code in
      Indiana (46565) would be located north of a zip code in Kentucky (42141), not
      south of it.

      To determine this, I need to know the relative positions of these locations.
      In the US, generally:

      - Indiana (IN) is north of Kentucky (KY)

      - Kentucky is south of Indiana


      Since Indiana is generally north of Kentucky, it would be unusual for a location
      in Indiana to be south of a location in Kentucky. But I should check if this
      could be an exception.


      Looking at the zip codes:

      - 46565 is in Indiana

      - 42141 is in Kentucky


      Without specific geographic coordinates, I can rely on the general geographic
      relationship between these states. Indiana borders Kentucky to the north, meaning
      virtually all of Indiana is north of Kentucky.


      Therefore, a location in Indiana (46565) would be north of a location in Kentucky
      (42141), not south of it.</think>I need to determine whether a zip code in Indiana

      Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky. The entire state of Indiana is
      generally north of Kentucky, as they share a border with Indiana being the northern
      neighbor.


      Step 2: Look at the specific zip codes.

      - 46565 is in Indiana

      - 42141 is in Kentucky


      Step 3: Apply the geographic relationship.

      Since Indiana is north of Kentucky, a location in Indiana (46565) would be north

      46565 is a zip code in Indiana (IN).

      42141 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY).


      Let me think about the geography of these states. Indiana is generally north
      of Kentucky. The entire state of Kentucky is south of Indiana, as they share
      a border with Indiana being the northern neighbor.


      Since 46565 is in Indiana, and 42141 is in Kentucky, and Indiana is north of
      Kentucky, it follows that 46565, IN would be north of 42141, KY (not south).


      Therefore, 46565, IN is NOT located south of 42141, KY. It is located north

      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 46565 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 42141 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      Indiana and Kentucky share a border, with Indiana positioned directly north
      of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the zip codes.

      Since Indiana is north of Kentucky, any zip code in Indiana (including 46565)
      would be north of any zip code in Kentucky (including 42141).

      30566 in Georgia (GA) is located south of the zip code 32818 in Florida (FL).
      To do this, I need to understand the geographical relationship between these
      two locations.


      First, let''s recall the general geography of the United States:

      - Georgia (GA) is a state located in the southeastern United States

      - Florida (FL) is also in the southeastern US, and is generally south of Georgia


      Now, let''s think about the zip codes:

      - 30566 is in Georgia

      - 32818 is in Florida


      Since Florida is generally south of Georgia, and 30566 is in Georgia while 32818
      is in Florida, the intuitive answer would be that 30566, GA is NOT south of
      32818, FL. Instead, it would be north of it.


      However, I should be careful about border areas, as the state borders aren''t
      perfectly horizontal lines. Let me think about the specific zip codes more precisely.


      ZIP code 30566 appears to be in northern Georgia.

      ZIP code 32818 appears to be in central Florida (likely in the Orlando area).


      Given this information, 30566 in GA would definitely be north of 32818 in FL,
      not south of it.</think>To determine if 30566, GA is south of 32818, FL, I need
      to analyze the geographical relationship between these locations.


      Step 1: Consider the general geography of Georgia and Florida.

      Georgia is located directly north of Florida in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Examine the zip code numbering pattern.

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly sequential by latitude, they do follow some
      geographical patterns. The first three digits generally indicate a sectional
      center facility.


      Step 3: Look at these specific zip codes.

      30566 is in Georgia (GA)

      32818 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 4: Determine their relative positions.

      Since Georgia is positioned north of Florida, and these zip codes are in their
      respective states, 30566 in Georgia would be north of 32818 in Florida, not
      south of it.

      codes, particularly their latitudes. A lower latitude means further south in
      the northern hemisphere (where both GA and FL are located).


      3) Let''s think about the states first: Georgia is generally north of Florida,
      as Florida is the southernmost state in the continental US. This suggests that
      locations in Georgia would typically be north of locations in Florida.


      4) However, I should be more precise by considering the specific zip codes.
      The numbering of US zip codes is not strictly geographical, but there are some
      patterns. The first digit in both zip codes (3) indicates they''re in the same
      general region (Southeast US).


      5) The second digits (0 for 30566 and 2 for 32818) suggest that 30566 is in
      a zone assigned earlier/more northern than 32818.


      6) Based on my knowledge of US geography, zip code 30566 is in Georgia, which
      is north of Florida. Zip code 32818 is in Florida, which is south of Georgia.

      1) First, I need to consider the states. Georgia (GA) is located directly north
      of Florida (FL) on the US map. Florida is the southernmost state in the continental
      United States.


      2) While zip codes don''t perfectly align with latitude, we can make some general
      observations about these specific codes.


      3) Zip code 30566 is in Georgia, which would generally be at a higher latitude
      (more northern) than locations in Florida.


      4) Zip code 32818 is in Florida, which would generally be at a lower latitude
      (more southern) than locations in Georgia.


      5) Even if we consider that some parts of Georgia might extend further south
      than some northern parts of Florida, the zip code 30566 is not in southern Georgia,

      To be more precise, I could try to recall the specific locations of these zip

      Looking at US geography, Georgia is positioned directly north of Florida. Florida
      is the southernmost continental US state, with Georgia bordering it on the north.

      two zip codes.


      First, I''ll analyze the state abbreviations:

      - GA is Georgia

      - FL is Florida


      Geographically, Florida is generally south of Georgia, as Georgia is directly
      north of Florida on the US map.


      Now looking at the zip codes:

      - 30566 is in Georgia

      - 32818 is in Florida


      Since Georgia is north of Florida, and these zip codes are in these respective
      states, it would generally mean that 30566, GA is NORTH of 32818, FL (not south).


      To be completely certain, I should consider that zip codes don''t always follow
      a perfect north-south pattern. However, the general pattern of US zip codes
      has lower numbers in the northeast and higher numbers as you move south and
      west. The fact that the Florida zip code (32818) has a higher number than the

      \ let's note that 30566 is in Georgia (GA) and 32818 is in Florida (FL).\n\n\
      In the US, Georgia is located north of Florida. Georgia borders Florida along\
      \ its southern border, with Florida being the southernmost state of the continental\
      \ US.\n\nZIP codes in the US typically follow patterns where lower numbers are\
      \ generally in the northeastern US and higher numbers tend to be in the western\
      \ and southern parts. \n\nThe first digit of the ZIP code represents a certain\
      \ group of states:\n- 3xxxx typically covers the southeastern states including\
      \ Georgia (GA) and Florida (FL)\n\nFor these specific ZIP codes:\n- 30566 is\
      \ in Georgia, which is in the \"30xxx\" range\n- 32818 is in Florida, which\
      \ is in the \"32xxx\" range\n\nSince both states are in the southeast and their\
      \ ZIP codes are similar, we need to consider the geographic reality. Florida\
      \ extends south of Georgia. All of Georgia is north of at least some part of\
      \ Florida.\n\nSo if 30566 is in Georgia, and 32818 is in Florida, then 30566\
      \ is almost certainly north of 32818, not south of it.</think># Is 30566, GA\
      \ located south of 32818, FL?\n\nI need to determine the relative positions\
      \ of these two zip codes by understanding their geographical locations.\n\n\
      ## Step 1: Identify the states\n- 30566 is in Georgia (GA)\n- 32818 is in Florida\
      \ (FL)\n\n## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states\n\
      Georgia is located directly north of Florida. Florida is the southernmost continental\
      \ US state, with Georgia bordering its northern edge.\n\n## Step 3: Consider\
      \ ZIP code patterns\nWhile both ZIP codes start with 3, the Georgia ZIP code\
      \ (30566) has a lower second digit than the Florida ZIP code (32818). In the\
      \ Southeast, lower ZIP codes in the 3xxxx range typically correspond to more\
      \ northern locations.\n\n## Step 4: Make the comparison\nSince 30566 is in Georgia,\
      \ which is entirely north of Florida, and 32818 is in Florida, the Georgia ZIP\
      \ code must be north of the Florida ZIP code, not south of it.\n\nNO"

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 03079 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 11561 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      To determine if one location is south of another, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A location with a lower latitude is further south than a location with a higher
      latitude.


      Let me think about the general geography of NH and NY:

      - New Hampshire is in New England, in the northeastern United States

      - New York state is south and west of New Hampshire


      However, since zip codes can represent specific areas within states, I can''t
      rely solely on state positions. I need to consider the specific locations.


      Zip code 03079 appears to be for Salem, NH, which is in the southern part of
      New Hampshire, near the Massachusetts border.


      Zip code 11561 appears to be for Long Beach, NY, which is on Long Island in
      southeastern New York.

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 03079 is Salem, New Hampshire

      - 11561 is Long Beach, New York (on Long Island)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographical positions

      - New Hampshire is in northern New England

      - Long Island is in southeastern New York, extending into the Atlantic Ocean


      ## Step 3: Compare north-south positions

      - Salem, NH is in southern New Hampshire, near the Massachusetts border

      - Long Beach, NY is on Long Island, which is significantly further south

      - New Hampshire (even its southern portions) is generally north of Long Island

      Let me think about the general geographic positions of these states:

      - West Virginia (WV) is generally north of North Carolina (NC)

      - WV is in the Appalachian region

      - NC is on the Atlantic coast, south of WV


      However, I shouldn''t rely just on state-level geography since specific zip

      US zip codes generally follow patterns where lower numbers tend to be in the
      eastern and northeastern parts of the country, with numbers increasing as you
      move west and south. But this is a very rough pattern with many exceptions.


      In this case, 26301 (WV) has a lower number than 27707 (NC), which might suggest
      WV is further northeast. This aligns with the general geographic knowledge that
      WV is north of NC.

      4. The first digits of ZIP codes in the US generally follow a pattern where

      - North Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast, southeast of West Virginia

      - West Virginia is positioned NORTH of North Carolina on a map

      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 26301, WV: This is a zip code in West Virginia (WV)

      - 27707, NC: This is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Now I need to determine their relative positions.


      West Virginia is generally located north of North Carolina in the United States.
      West Virginia borders Virginia to its south, and North Carolina is south of
      Virginia.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - West Virginia is a northern Appalachian state

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state along the Atlantic coast


      Since West Virginia is generally north of North Carolina, a zip code in West
      Virginia (26301) would be north of a zip code in North Carolina (27707).

      Step 2: Determine their geographic relationship

      West Virginia is located north of North Carolina in the United States. West
      Virginia borders Virginia to its south, while North Carolina is south of Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      While specific zip codes within states can sometimes create exceptions to general
      state positioning, in this case, the overall geographic relationship between
      these states is clear enough to determine the answer.

      - 22124 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 29418 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, while South
      Carolina is in the Southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions

      On a map of the United States, Virginia is positioned north of South Carolina.
      This is consistent across all zip codes in these states - any location in Virginia
      will be north of any location in South Carolina.


      Therefore, zip code 22124 in Virginia cannot be south of zip code 29418 in South
      Carolina.

      to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (north/south)


      Let me start by identifying the locations:


      22124 is in Virginia (VA). Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic region of the US.

      29418 is in South Carolina (SC). South Carolina is in the southeastern US.


      Generally speaking, Virginia is north of South Carolina. The entire state of
      Virginia is north of South Carolina''s northern border.


      So if 22124 is in Virginia and 29418 is in South Carolina, then 22124 would
      be north of 29418, not south of it.


      More specifically:

      - Zip code 22124 appears to be in the Oakton area of Virginia, in Fairfax County,
      which is in northern Virginia

      - Zip code 29418 appears to be in the North Charleston area of South Carolina


      This confirms that 22124, VA is north of 29418, SC, not south of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 22124 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 29418 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located entirely north of South Carolina on the US east coast. The
      entire state of Virginia is north of South Carolina''s northern border.


      Step 3: Check if there could be any exceptions with these specific zip codes.

      22124 is in Oakton, Fairfax County, in northern Virginia.

      29418 is in the North Charleston area of South Carolina.

      This confirms the standard state relationship - the Virginia zip code is still
      north of the South Carolina zip code.

      22124 is in VA (Virginia)

      29418 is in SC (South Carolina)


      Since Virginia is generally north of South Carolina, and without specific information

      1. Find the geographical locations (latitude/longitude) of both zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes to determine which one is more south (lower latitude
      = more south)


      39350 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)

      70047 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      Let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Mississippi is generally north of Louisiana

      - Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast and is one of the southernmost states in the
      US


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, based on state geography, it''s likely
      that a zip code in Mississippi would be north of a zip code in Louisiana, not
      south of it.


      Let me be more specific about these particular zip codes:

      - 39350 appears to be in central Mississippi

      - 70047 appears to be in southern Louisiana


      Given that Louisiana extends further south than Mississippi, and that 70047
      is likely in the southern part of Louisiana while 39350 is in central Mississippi,
      it''s highly likely that 39350, MS is located north of 70047, LA, not south
      of it.


      So the answer would be NO, 39350, MS is not located south of 70047, LA.</think>#
      Is 39350, MS located south of 70047, LA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by examining
      their locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 39350 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 70047 is in Louisiana (LA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      - Mississippi is generally positioned north of Louisiana

      - Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico and is one of the southernmost states
      in the continental US


      ## Step 3: Analyze these specific zip codes

      - 39350 is in central Mississippi (around Philadelphia/Neshoba County area)

      - 70047 is in southern Louisiana (in the St. Charles Parish area near New Orleans)


      ## Step 4: Compare latitudes

      Given that Louisiana extends further south than Mississippi, and particularly
      since 70047 is in southern Louisiana while 39350 is in central Mississippi,
      the Mississippi zip code must be north of the Louisiana zip code.


      # NO


      39350, MS is not located south of 70047, LA. It is located north of it.'

      - 07114 (NJ) is in Newark, New Jersey, which is in northern New Jersey near
      New York City


      Step 3: Consider the general geography of New York and New Jersey:

      - New Jersey is generally south of New York State

      - However, since New York is a large state, parts of it extend quite far south,
      and New Jersey is not entirely south of all of New York


      Step 4: Compare the specific locations:

      - Utica, NY (13502) is in central/upstate New York, well north of the New York
      City area

      - Newark, NJ (07114) is in northern New Jersey, just west of New York City

      - In terms of latitude, Utica is definitely further north than Newark

      I need to determine the geographic relationship between these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 13502 is in Utica, New York, located in central/upstate New York

      - 07114 is in Newark, New Jersey, located in northern New Jersey near NYC


      ## Step 2: Consider the north-south relationship

      - New York State is generally north of New Jersey

      - Specifically, Utica is located much further north in New York State

      - Newark is in the northern part of New Jersey, just west of NYC


      ## Step 3: Compare latitudes

      - Utica, NY is significantly further north than Newark, NJ

      - Central/upstate New York is at a higher latitude than northern New Jersey


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 13502 (Utica, NY) is NOT located south of 07114 (Newark, NJ). It is located

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 74104 is a ZIP code in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 77807 is a ZIP code in Texas (TX)


      To determine which is further south, I need to find their approximate locations.
      ZIP codes are organized geographically, but I''ll need to identify the cities/areas
      they belong to.


      74104 is likely in northeastern Oklahoma - probably in or near Tulsa, OK.

      77807 is likely in eastern or central Texas.


      In general geographic terms:

      - Oklahoma is north of Texas overall

      - However, I need to be precise about these specific ZIP codes since some parts
      of Oklahoma can be further south than some parts of northern Texas


      Based on my knowledge:

      - 74104 appears to be in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which is in the northeastern part
      of Oklahoma

      - 77807 appears to be in Bryan, Texas, which is in the east-central part of
      Texas


      Geographically, Texas extends much further south than Oklahoma. Bryan, TX (77807)
      would be south of the Oklahoma border, and definitely south of Tulsa, OK (74104).


      So, 74104, OK (Tulsa area) would NOT be south of 77807, TX (Bryan area). Tulsa
      is north of Bryan.</think># Is 74104, OK located south of 77807, TX?


      I need to determine the geographic relationship between these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 74104 is a ZIP code in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 77807 is a ZIP code in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      - Oklahoma is generally located north of Texas on the map

      - 74104 is in the Tulsa area of Oklahoma

      - 77807 is in the Bryan/College Station area of Texas


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - Tulsa, Oklahoma is in the northeastern part of Oklahoma

      - Bryan, Texas is in east-central Texas

      - When looking at their positions on a map, Tulsa (74104) is clearly north of
      Bryan (77807)


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Oklahoma''s southern border is north of central Texas, and Tulsa is not
      even in southern Oklahoma, ZIP code 74104 cannot be south of ZIP code 77807.


      NO'

      - 74104, OK is a zip code in Oklahoma

      - 77807, TX is a zip code in Texas


      Step 2: I need to recall the relative geographical positions of Oklahoma and
      Texas.

      Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas in the United States. The entire

      Step 3: Let me check if there might be any exceptions due to the specific locations
      of these zip codes.

      74104 appears to be in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which is in the northeastern part of
      Oklahoma.

      77807 appears to be in Bryan, Texas, which is in east-central Texas.


      Step 4: Determine the relative north-south positioning.

      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states without any unusual border configurations, 74104 in Oklahoma would be
      north of 77807 in Texas.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 74104 is a ZIP code in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 77807 is a ZIP code in Texas (TX)


      To determine which is further south, I need to know their approximate locations
      and compare their latitudes (lower latitude = further south).


      74104 is in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which is in the northeastern part of Oklahoma.

      77807 is likely in the Bryan-College Station area of Texas, which is in the
      east-central part of Texas.


      Geographically, Oklahoma is generally north of Texas since Texas is the southernmost
      state in the central United States and Oklahoma borders Texas on its north.


      So generally, locations in Oklahoma would be north of locations in Texas. However,
      I should be careful because the shapes of states are irregular, and there could
      be exceptions depending on the exact locations.


      Given that 74104 is in Oklahoma and 77807 is in Texas, and considering the general

      - 77807 is a ZIP code in the Bryan-College Station area of Texas


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Oklahoma and Texas.

      Oklahoma borders Texas on the north, meaning Oklahoma is generally positioned
      above Texas on a map.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      Tulsa is located in northeastern Oklahoma, while Bryan-College Station is in
      east-central Texas. Even considering the irregular shapes of state borders,
      Tulsa remains significantly north of Bryan-College Station.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on latitude.

      Since 74104 (Tulsa, OK) has a higher latitude than 77807 (Bryan-College Station,

      - 17961, PA (Pennsylvania)

      - 28401, NC (North Carolina)


      In the US, generally:

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the country

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern part of the country


      Geographically, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina. This is a general fact
      about the states. So, a location in Pennsylvania would typically be north of

      Therefore, 17961, PA would be north of 28401, NC, not south of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 17961 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      Even the southernmost parts of Pennsylvania are typically north of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on geographic position.

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify the approximate geographic location of each zip code

      2. Compare their north-south positions (latitudes)


      Let me think about the general geography of the US:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the northeastern part of the US

      - North Carolina (NC) is in the southeastern part of the US

      - Generally, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I know that Pennsylvania is generally

      In this case, Pennsylvania (17961) would be north of North Carolina (28401),

      Let me break this down:

      1. 14892 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      2. 27704 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      First, I need to establish the general geographical relationship between Virginia
      and North Carolina. Virginia is located north of North Carolina on the US East
      Coast. So in general, locations in Virginia tend to be north of locations in

      - 27896 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Virginia and North Carolina.

      Virginia is located directly north of North Carolina on the US East Coast.


      Step 3: Consider zip code patterns.

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in the
      northeastern parts of the country, and higher numbers toward the southwest.
      The zip code in NC (27896) has a higher number than the zip code in VA (24482),

      1. We have two zip codes: 24482 in Virginia (VA) and 27896 in North Carolina
      (NC).

      2. I need to determine if the location with zip code 24482 (in VA) is south
      of the location with zip code 27896 (in NC).


      First, I need to think about the general geography of Virginia and North Carolina.
      Virginia is generally north of North Carolina on the US East Coast. This gives
      me an initial suspicion that a VA zip code might not be south of an NC zip code,
      but I need to check the specific locations.


      However, just knowing the general positions of states isn''t enough, as some
      parts of one state might extend further south than parts of another state, especially
      along borders.


      Without specific geographical coordinates for these zip codes, I can''t give
      a definitive answer. Generally speaking though, Virginia is north of North Carolina,
      which suggests that a location in VA would typically be north of a location
      in NC, not south of it.


      So, based on the general geographical relationship between Virginia and North
      Carolina, I would say that 24482, VA is not south of 27896, NC. Instead, it''s
      likely north of it.


      So my answer would be NO.</think># Is 24482, VA located south of 27896, NC?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      Virginia (VA) and North Carolina (NC) are neighboring states on the US East
      Coast. Generally speaking, Virginia is located north of North Carolina.


      ## Step 2: Evaluate the specific zip codes

      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I can rely on the general geographic
      relationship between these states. Since 24482 is in Virginia and 27896 is in
      North Carolina, the Virginia location would typically be north of the North
      Carolina location.


      ## Step 3: Consider possible exceptions

      While state borders can be irregular, there are no major geographical anomalies
      where Virginia dips significantly south of North Carolina.

      - 24482, VA is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 27896, NC is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      In the US, Virginia is generally north of North Carolina. The states border
      each other, with Virginia being directly north of North Carolina.


      Since 24482 is in Virginia and 27896 is in North Carolina, we can generally
      say that the Virginia zip code is north of the North Carolina zip code.


      Therefore, 24482, VA would NOT be south of 27896, NC. It would be north of it.</think>#

      ## Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the zip codes

      Since 24482 is in Virginia (the northern state) and 27896 is in North Carolina

      south of it.</think>To determine if 58401, ND is located south of 68506, NE,
      I need to consider the geographic positions of these zip codes and their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 58401 is in North Dakota (ND)

      - 68506 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      North Dakota is located directly north of South Dakota, which is directly north
      of Nebraska. This means North Dakota is north of Nebraska on the map.


      Step 3: Consider if specific zip codes might change this relationship.

      While zip codes within a state can vary in location, they cannot change the
      fact that all of North Dakota is geographically north of all of Nebraska.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since 58401 is in North Dakota, and 68506 is in Nebraska, and North Dakota is
      entirely north of Nebraska, the zip code 58401 must be north of zip code 68506.

      to determine the geographic locations of these two zip codes and compare their
      north-south positions.


      58401 is in North Dakota (ND)

      68506 is in Nebraska (NE)


      I need to compare their latitudes to determine which one is further south.


      Geographically, North Dakota is a state that borders Canada to the north, and
      is positioned north of Nebraska. Nebraska is further south in the United States.


      In terms of the first digits of zip codes, generally lower numbers in the first
      digit correspond to northeastern states, and higher numbers correspond to western
      and southern states. But within the same first digit (5 or 6), the second digit
      generally indicates more specific regions.


      In this case, 58xxx zip codes are in North Dakota, and 68xxx zip codes are in
      Nebraska.


      Since North Dakota is north of Nebraska, and these zip codes are standard for
      these states, I can conclude that 58401, ND is north of 68506, NE, not south

      - 58401 is in North Dakota (ND)

      - 68506 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      North Dakota is located along the northern border of the United States (bordering
      Canada), while Nebraska is located in the central United States, south of North
      Dakota.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since North Dakota is positioned north of Nebraska on the map, zip codes in
      North Dakota would be north of zip codes in Nebraska.


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison.

      58401 (in North Dakota) would be north of 68506 (in Nebraska), not south.

      First, let me identify the states:

      - 58401 is in North Dakota (ND)

      - 68506 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Now, I need to think about the geographic positions of these states. In the
      United States:


      North Dakota is located in the northern part of the country, along the Canadian
      border. It''s one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.


      Nebraska is located south of North Dakota. Specifically, if you look at a US
      map:

      - North Dakota borders Canada to the north

      - South Dakota is directly below North Dakota

      - Nebraska is below South Dakota


      So in terms of north-south positioning, North Dakota is definitely north of
      Nebraska.


      Since 58401 is in North Dakota and 68506 is in Nebraska, and North Dakota is
      north of Nebraska, then 58401 (ND) is north of 68506 (NE), not south of it.


      Therefore, 58401, ND is NOT located south of 68506, NE.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these zip
      codes based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 58401 is in North Dakota (ND)

      - 68506 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      North Dakota is located along the Canadian border in the northern United States.
      Nebraska is located south of South Dakota, which itself is directly south of
      North Dakota.


      Step 3: Compare the positions.

      Since North Dakota is north of Nebraska on the map, any location in North Dakota
      (including 58401) would be north of any location in Nebraska (including 68506).

      1. 58401 is a zip code in North Dakota (ND).

      2. 68506 is a zip code in Nebraska (NE).


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to think about the geographical
      locations of these states.


      North Dakota is a northern state that borders Canada. Nebraska is located south
      of North Dakota.


      So generally speaking, any location in North Dakota would be north of any location
      in Nebraska, not south of it.

      - 58401 is in North Dakota (ND)

      - 68506 is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      North Dakota is positioned in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada to the north.

      Nebraska is positioned south of North Dakota in the central United States.


      Step 3: Determine the north-south relationship.

      Since North Dakota is entirely north of Nebraska on the map, any location in
      North Dakota (including 58401) would be north of any location in Nebraska (including
      68506).

      and Nebraska:

      - North Dakota is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - Nebraska is located south of North Dakota


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - North Dakota is north of South Dakota

      - South Dakota is north of Nebraska

      - So North Dakota is definitely north of Nebraska


      This means that any location in North Dakota would be north of any location

      The fact that the Wisconsin zip code starts with 54 and the Illinois zip code

      First, let me think about the general geography of Wisconsin and Illinois. Wisconsin
      is generally north of Illinois. Wisconsin is directly north of Illinois, bordering
      it on Illinois''s northern border.


      Additionally, US zip codes generally follow patterns. The first three digits

      generally correspond to the eastern and northeastern United States, with numbers
      increasing as you move west and south.


      54xxx would typically be in Wisconsin, and 60xxx would typically be in northeastern
      Illinois (Chicago area).


      Given that:

      2. The zip code prefixes (54xxx vs 60xxx) suggest 54180 is in Wisconsin and
      60651 is in Illinois

      3. The geographical relationship between these states means that locations in

      - Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois

      - The two states share a border, with Wisconsin being the northern neighbor


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      south of 15137, PA, I need to:


      1. Identify the geographic locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south position)


      Let me think about these locations:


      14204 is a zip code in New York (NY).

      15137 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).


      14204 is likely in the western part of New York state, as NY zip codes in the
      14xxx range are typically in that region (Buffalo area).

      15137 is likely in the western part of Pennsylvania, as PA zip codes in the
      15xxx range are typically in that region (Pittsburgh area).


      Geographically, New York state is generally north of Pennsylvania. Buffalo,
      NY is north of Pittsburgh, PA.


      Based on the general geography of these states and regions, 14204 in NY is very

      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      New York state is generally positioned north of Pennsylvania on a map, particularly
      in the western regions where these zip codes are located.


      Step 3: Compare specific locations.

      Buffalo, NY (where 14204 is located) is in the western part of New York near
      Lake Erie.

      The Pittsburgh area (where 15137 is located) is in the western part of Pennsylvania.

      Buffalo is positioned north of Pittsburgh.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Buffalo is north of the Pittsburgh area, zip code 14204 in NY is north

      1) 28602 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      2) 29404 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Generally speaking, states in the US have zip codes that follow patterns. The
      first three digits of a zip code (the "prefix") usually correspond to a geographical
      region.


      For North Carolina, zip codes generally start with 27, 28, or 29.

      For South Carolina, zip codes generally start with 29.


      So we have:

      - 28602 in NC

      - 29404 in SC


      Now, geographically, North Carolina is located north of South Carolina. That''s
      a general geographical fact about these two states.


      However, I need to check if this specific relationship holds for these particular
      zip codes. The question is whether 28602 (in NC) is south of 29404 (in SC).


      Since North Carolina is north of South Carolina, and these zip codes are in
      their respective states, 28602 (NC) should be north of 29404 (SC), not south
      of it.


      So the answer should be NO.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic
      positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 28602 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29404 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      North Carolina is positioned directly north of South Carolina on the US map.


      Step 3: Examine if there might be any exceptions for these specific zip codes.

      While zip code boundaries can sometimes cross state lines or have irregular
      patterns, the first digits of zip codes generally follow geographic patterns.
      The "2" at the beginning of both indicates they''re in the eastern US, and their
      respective state assignments confirm they follow the standard north-south arrangement
      of these states.


      Since 28602 is in North Carolina, which is north of South Carolina (where 29404
      is located), 28602 cannot be south of 29404.

      step.


      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 28602 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 29404 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is north of South Carolina (NC is above SC
      on a map). But I need to check if this specific zip code in NC is south of this
      specific zip code in SC.


      Looking at the first digits of the zip codes:

      - 28602 (NC) starts with 2

      - 29404 (SC) starts with 2


      In the US zip code system, the first digit generally represents a geographical
      region, with lower numbers typically being more northerly than higher numbers
      within the same first digit. So comparing 286xx with 294xx, the 286xx should
      generally be more northerly than 294xx.


      Since 286 < 294, this suggests that 28602 (NC) is likely north of 29404 (SC),
      which aligns with the general geography of NC being north of SC.


      So, 28602, NC is not south of 29404, SC. It should be north of it.</think>#

      29404 is in South Carolina (SC).


      2) Geographically, North Carolina is generally located north of South Carolina
      (NC is above SC on a map).


      3) Looking at the zip codes themselves: The first 3 digits of zip codes are
      helpful for determining relative location. Lower numbers in the same region
      typically indicate more northern locations.


      4) Comparing the codes: 28602 starts with 286, while 29404 starts with 294.
      Since 286 is less than 294, this reinforces that the NC location is more northern.


      5) Both geographic position of the states and the zip code numbering system
      indicate that 28602, NC would be north of 29404, SC, not south of it.

      relative positions of two ZIP codes in the US: 72364 in Arkansas (AR) and 70711
      in Louisiana (LA).


      I need to determine if 72364, AR is located south of 70711, LA.


      In the US ZIP code system, the first 3 digits of the ZIP code generally correspond
      to a specific region. For Arkansas (AR), ZIP codes typically start with 716-729,
      while Louisiana (LA) ZIP codes typically start with 700-714.


      However, the exact location of each ZIP code is not something I can determine
      just from the numbers themselves - I need to know their actual geographic coordinates.


      What I do know is that Arkansas is generally north of Louisiana. Louisiana borders
      the Gulf of Mexico and is one of the southernmost states in the continental
      US. Arkansas is directly north of Louisiana.


      So in general, a location in Arkansas would be north of a location in Louisiana,
      not south.


      Therefore, 72364, AR is likely north of 70711, LA, not south of it.</think>I
      need to determine whether ZIP code 72364 in Arkansas is south of ZIP code 70711
      in Louisiana.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic locations of Arkansas and Louisiana.

      Arkansas (AR) is a state that sits directly north of Louisiana (LA). Louisiana
      is one of the southernmost states in the continental US, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of states.

      Since Arkansas is positioned north of Louisiana geographically, locations in
      Arkansas will generally be north of locations in Louisiana.


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific ZIP codes.

      ZIP code 72364 in Arkansas must be north of ZIP code 70711 in Louisiana, not
      south of it.

      to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (north/south)


      Zip code 15061 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      Zip code 23832 is in Virginia (VA)


      Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia in the United States. The states
      border like this from north to south:

      - Pennsylvania

      - Maryland

      - Virginia


      So in general, locations in PA would be north of locations in VA. However, I
      should verify the specific zip codes to be certain, since borders are irregular
      and there could be exceptions.


      15061 is a zip code in Monaca, Pennsylvania, which is in western PA, near Pittsburgh.

      23832 is a zip code in Chesterfield, Virginia, which is in eastern/central VA,
      near Richmond.


      Looking at the geography:

      - 15061 (Monaca, PA) is in the northern state (Pennsylvania)

      - 23832 (Chesterfield, VA) is in the southern state (Virginia)

      - 15061 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 23832 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions

      Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia in the United States. The general
      arrangement from north to south is:

      - Pennsylvania

      - Maryland (in between)

      - Virginia


      ## Step 3: Check specific zip code locations

      - 15061 corresponds to the Monaca area in western Pennsylvania

      - 23832 corresponds to the Chesterfield area near Richmond, Virginia


      ## Step 4: Determine relative position

      Since Pennsylvania is north of Virginia, and these specific zip codes follow
      the normal geographic relationship of their states, 15061 PA is located NORTH
      of 23832 VA, not south.

      In the United States, in general:

      - Kentucky (KY) is north of Georgia (GA)

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States

      - Kentucky is more in the east-central United States


      This already gives me a strong indication that 40422, KY is likely north of
      31206, GA, not south.


      But to be more precise, let''s think about zip codes. In the US postal system:

      - The first digit of a ZIP code generally indicates a group of states

      - ZIP codes starting with 3 typically cover southeastern states (including Georgia)

      - ZIP codes starting with 4 typically cover states more in the central/east-central
      region (including Kentucky)


      The fact that the Georgia zip code starts with 3 and the Kentucky zip code starts
      with 4 aligns with the general geographic layout of these states, with Georgia
      being further south.

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      Kentucky is located north of Georgia in the United States. Georgia borders the
      Atlantic Ocean and is one of the southern states, while Kentucky is more centrally
      located and further north.


      Step 3: Check if there might be any unusual geographic quirks with these specific
      zip codes.

      While some zip codes near state borders can sometimes break the general north-south
      relationship between states, the significant distance between Kentucky and Georgia
      makes this unlikely. These zip codes appear to be well within their respective
      states.

    2e0daabc-f2e0-445a-b3ab-af290422483d: '<think>Let me solve this step by step:


      First, I need to identify what locations these zip codes correspond to:

      - 03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 10457 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      To determine if 03784, NH is south of 10457, NY, I need to compare their geographic
      positions.


      New Hampshire is a state in New England, in the northeastern United States.
      It''s generally north of New York State.


      However, I need to be more specific about the exact locations of these zip codes,
      since states cover large areas and their territories can have complex boundaries.


      Zip code 03784 appears to be in the Upper Valley region of New Hampshire, likely
      around the town of West Lebanon or Lebanon.


      Zip code 10457 is in the Bronx borough of New York City, which is in the southeastern
      part of New York State.


      When comparing these specific locations:

      - Upper Valley/Lebanon area of NH is in western NH near the Vermont border

      - The Bronx is in NYC in southeastern NY


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning), the Upper Valley region of New
      Hampshire is actually north of NYC/the Bronx. New Hampshire is generally north
      of New York City, even though parts of upstate New York may be further north
      than parts of New Hampshire.


      So 03784 NH is NOT south of 10457 NY - it''s north of it.</think># Is 03784,
      NH located south of 10457, NY?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 03784 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 10457 is in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Determine their specific locations

      - 03784 is in the Lebanon/West Lebanon area of New Hampshire, in the western
      part of the state

      - 10457 is located in the Bronx, New York City, in the southeastern part of
      New York State


      ## Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      - New Hampshire is generally positioned north of New York City

      - While parts of upstate New York are further north than parts of New Hampshire,
      the Bronx (10457) is in the southern part of New York State

      - The Lebanon area of New Hampshire (03784) is significantly further north than
      the Bronx


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 03784, NH is not south of 10457, NY. It is north of it.'

      step:


      1. First, I need to understand the locations of these zip codes.

      2. 03784 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      3. 10457 is in New York (NY)


      To determine which is further south, I need to know the relative geographical
      positions of these specific zip codes.


      New Hampshire is generally northeast of New York State. However, I need to check
      the specific locations of these zip codes.


      03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire. I believe this is for the Springfield,
      NH area.

      10457 is a zip code in New York. I believe this is in the Bronx (part of New
      York City).


      New York City (and the Bronx specifically) is located in the southeastern part
      of New York State, while New Hampshire is entirely north and east of New York
      City.


      So the Bronx (10457) would be south of any location in New Hampshire (03784).


      Therefore, 03784 (NH) is NOT south of 10457 (NY). Instead, 03784 is north of

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions.

      - 03784 appears to be in the Springfield area of New Hampshire

      - 10457 is in the Bronx, which is part of New York City in southern New York
      state


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New Hampshire is generally north of New York City

      - The Bronx (10457) is in the southern part of New York state

      - All of New Hampshire, including Springfield (03784), lies north of New York
      City


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on north-south positioning.

      Since New Hampshire locations (including 03784) are north of the Bronx (10457),
      the New Hampshire zip code cannot be south of the New York zip code.

      New Hampshire is a state in New England, in the northeastern United States.

      61104 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)

      37127 is a zip code in Tennessee (TN)


      Now, I need to consider the geographic relationship between these states. Generally
      speaking:

      - Illinois is a northern state, located in the Midwest

      - Tennessee is a southern state, located in the Southeast


      In terms of latitude:

      - Illinois is typically north of Tennessee

      - So a zip code in Illinois would generally be north of a zip code in Tennessee,
      not south


      The zip code numbers themselves don''t directly tell us the geographic relationship
      (zip codes aren''t assigned purely by latitude), so I''m basing this on the
      state locations.


      Since Illinois is north of Tennessee, 61104, IL would be north of 37127, TN,
      not south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 61104 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 37127 is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the Southeast region

      - Geographically, Illinois is positioned north of Tennessee on the map


      Step 3: Determine the relative position.

      - Since Illinois is north of Tennessee, a zip code in Illinois (61104) would
      be north of a zip code in Tennessee (37127)

      - Being north of Tennessee means it cannot be south of Tennessee


      NO

      3. Determine their relative north-south positions

      4. Conclude whether 61104 is south of 37127


      First, IL is Illinois and TN is Tennessee. Geographically, Illinois is generally

      Since Illinois is north of Tennessee on the map, it''s very likely that any
      city in Illinois would be north of a city in Tennessee. This means that 61104
      (IL) would be NORTH of 37127 (TN), not south of it.

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Tennessee
      is in the Southeast. Looking at a US map, Illinois is positioned north of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - 61104 is a zip code in Rockford, Illinois (northern Illinois)

      - 37127 is a zip code in the Nashville area, Tennessee (central Tennessee)


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Illinois is entirely north of Tennessee geographically, any location in
      Illinois (including 61104) would be north of locations in Tennessee (including
      37127).

    1ac60882-7981-4a75-a353-3477b327eb63: '<think>I need to determine whether zip
      code 61610 in Illinois is located south of zip code 38655 in Mississippi.


      First, let me think about this in terms of latitude, since "south of" refers
      to latitude (lower latitude numbers are further south).


      I know that:

      - 61610 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 38655 is in Mississippi (MS)


      Generally speaking, Illinois is north of Mississippi in the United States. Illinois
      is in the Midwest/Upper Midwest region, while Mississippi is in the Deep South.


      The zip codes themselves also give us some information. U.S. zip codes roughly
      follow a geographic pattern:

      - Lower zip code numbers tend to be in the northeast

      - Higher numbers tend to be in the west and south


      However, the first digit is most relevant for this general pattern, and both
      of these zip codes start with different digits (6 vs 3).


      The most important information here is actually in the first digits:

      - Zip codes starting with 6 are generally in Illinois and other parts of the
      Midwest

      - Zip codes starting with 3 are generally in the southeastern states including
      Mississippi


      The fact that 38655 starts with a 3 suggests it''s further south than 61610
      which starts with a 6.


      Combined with the fact that Mississippi is generally south of Illinois, I can
      conclude that 61610, IL is NOT south of 38655, MS. Rather, 61610 in Illinois
      is north of 38655 in Mississippi.</think># Is 61610, IL located south of 38655,
      MS?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 61610 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 38655 is in Mississippi (MS)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic locations of these states

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Mississippi
      is located in the Deep South. Geographically, Illinois is positioned substantially
      north of Mississippi.


      ## Step 3: Check zip code patterns

      U.S. zip codes follow a general pattern where lower numbers (especially first
      digits) tend to be in the eastern and southern parts of the country. The first
      digit "3" (as in 38655) covers southeastern states including Mississippi, while
      "6" (as in 61610) covers the Midwest region including Illinois.


      ## Step 4: Determine relative positions

      Since Illinois is north of Mississippi, zip code 61610 in IL would be north
      of zip code 38655 in MS, not south of it.

      First, let me identify the general geographic locations:

      - 61610 is in Illinois (IL), which is a northern state

      - 38655 is in Mississippi (MS), which is a southern state


      In the US, states that are further north generally have higher latitudes, and

      Illinois is located north of Mississippi in the US. Mississippi borders the
      Gulf of Mexico and is one of the southernmost states, while Illinois is in the

      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states.

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Mississippi
      is in the Deep South. On a map of the US, Illinois is positioned significantly
      north of Mississippi.


      Step 3: Consider the zip codes themselves.

      While zip codes don''t perfectly correlate with latitude, they generally follow
      geographic patterns. The lower number (38655) being in the southern state and
      the higher number (61610) being in the northern state is consistent with the

      Virginia is generally north of South Carolina in the United States. Virginia

      Looking at the geographic relationship between these states:

      - Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US

      - South Carolina is located in the Southeastern region, further south than Virginia

      - South Carolina shares a border with North Carolina, which in turn borders
      Virginia to the south


      Since South Carolina is generally south of Virginia, and zip codes follow a
      general pattern where lower numbers are typically in the northeastern US and
      higher numbers in the southwestern US, we can determine that 29033, SC is south

      When comparing locations north-to-south, I need to look at the latitude values.

      Let me reason through this:

      1. First, I need to recall the general geographic position of Virginia (VA)

      if one zip code location is south of another. Let me break this down:


      1. 24179 is in Virginia (VA)

      2. 29033 is in South Carolina (SC)


      To answer this, I need to determine the geographic locations of these zip codes
      and compare their latitudes. A location with a lower latitude is further south.


      Let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Virginia is north of South Carolina on the US east coast

      - Generally, locations in Virginia would be north of locations in South Carolina


      Since 24179 is in Virginia and 29033 is in South Carolina, it''s likely that
      24179 is north of 29033, not south.


      However, I should note that state borders aren''t perfectly horizontal, so there
      could be exceptions if we''re looking at locations near the state borders. But
      given that these zip codes don''t appear to be special edge cases (based on
      my knowledge), the general relationship between the states should hold.


      So my reasoning suggests that 24179, VA is NOT south of 29033, SC, but rather
      north of it.</think># Is 24179, VA located south of 29033, SC?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these zip codes by examining their
      states and geographical locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 24179 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 29033 is in South Carolina (SC)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states

      - Virginia is located north of South Carolina on the US East Coast

      - South Carolina borders North Carolina to its north, which in turn borders
      Virginia


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      - Since Virginia is entirely north of South Carolina on the map of the United
      States

      - Any location in Virginia (including zip code 24179) would be north of any
      location in South Carolina (including zip code 29033)

      - Therefore, 24179 in VA cannot be south of 29033 in SC

      1) We have two ZIP codes: 60625, IL and 37128, TN

      2) I need to determine if 60625, IL is south of 37128, TN


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 60625 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 37128 is in Tennessee (TN)


      Now, to determine which is further south, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these states and areas.


      Illinois is generally north of Tennessee in the United States. Illinois borders
      Wisconsin to the north and extends south to Kentucky, while Tennessee is further
      south, bordering Kentucky to the north and Mississippi/Alabama to the south.

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 60625 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 37128 is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Tennessee
      is in the Southeast. Looking at a map of the US, Illinois is positioned north
      of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions

      Since Illinois is north of Tennessee, zip code 60625 in Illinois would be north
      of zip code 37128 in Tennessee, not south of it.

      2. We need to determine if 60625, IL is south of 37128, TN.


      To answer this, I need to identify where these zip codes are located geographically:


      60625, IL - This is a zip code in Illinois. Illinois is a state in the northern
      part of the United States.


      37128, TN - This is a zip code in Tennessee. Tennessee is located in the southeastern
      United States.


      Geographically speaking, Illinois is north of Tennessee in the United States.
      This means that any location in Illinois would generally be north of any location
      in Tennessee, not south.


      So, 60625, IL would be north of 37128, TN, not south.</think># Is 60625, IL
      located south of 37128, TN?


      I need to determine the geographic relationship between these two zip codes.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the northern part of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - Illinois is positioned north of Tennessee on the map

      I need to determine if the first zip code (44094, OH) is located south of the
      second zip code (25601, WV).


      First, let me recall the general geographic relationship between Ohio and West
      Virginia. Ohio is generally north and west of West Virginia. West Virginia is
      located to the southeast of Ohio.


      Now, looking at the specific zip codes:


      44094 is in Ohio. Ohio zip codes generally start with 43-45. This zip code is
      likely in the northeastern part of Ohio, as the 440xx codes are typically in
      that region (near Cleveland).


      25601 is in West Virginia. West Virginia zip codes generally start with 24-26.
      This zip code is likely in the southern part of West Virginia.


      Given this information, it''s very unlikely that 44094, OH is south of 25601,
      WV. The general geography suggests that 44094 in Ohio would be north of 25601
      in West Virginia, since Ohio is generally north of West Virginia, and especially
      since 44094 is in northeastern Ohio.


      So my conclusion is that 44094, OH is NOT located south of 25601, WV. It''s
      likely located north of it.</think># Is 44094, OH located south of 25601, WV?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 44094 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 25601 is in West Virginia (WV)


      ## Step 2: Analyze the geographic relationship

      - Ohio is generally located north of West Virginia

      - Specifically, zip code 44094 is in Willoughby, Ohio, which is in the northeastern
      part of the state (near Lake Erie)

      - Zip code 25601 is in Logan County, which is in the southern part of West Virginia


      ## Step 3: Compare positions

      - Given that Ohio is north of West Virginia, and specifically that northeastern
      Ohio (44094) is substantially north of southern West Virginia (25601), the Ohio
      zip code must be north of the West Virginia zip code, not south

      To determine which is further south, I need to consider their latitudes. Lower

      Ohio is generally north of West Virginia. Ohio is one of the more northern states,
      bordering Lake Erie and Canada (across the lake), while West Virginia is more

      ## Step 3: Examine specific zip codes

      - 44094 is in Willoughby, Ohio, which is in the northeastern part of Ohio near

      44094 appears to be in northeastern Ohio, likely near Lake Erie. This would
      be in the northern part of Ohio.


      25601 is in West Virginia, which is south of Ohio. West Virginia is entirely

    56f0a6a5-624f-4bf3-8395-bca11ac93854: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      geographical positions of two US zip codes:

      1. 44094, OH (Ohio)

      2. 25601, WV (West Virginia)


      To determine if one location is south of another, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A lower latitude is further south.


      Let me think about the general geographical positions of these states:

      - Ohio (OH) is generally north of West Virginia (WV)

      - Ohio borders West Virginia to the north


      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 44094 is in Ohio, specifically in Willoughby, which is in the northeastern
      part of Ohio near Lake Erie

      - 25601 is in West Virginia, likely in the southern or central part of the state


      Given that Ohio is generally north of West Virginia, and 44094 is in the northeastern
      part of Ohio (which is quite far north), while 25601 is in West Virginia (which
      is south of Ohio), it''s very likely that 44094, OH is NOT south of 25601, WV.


      In fact, 44094 (Willoughby, OH) is quite far north in Ohio near Lake Erie, while
      West Virginia is entirely south of that area. So 44094, OH would be north of
      25601, WV.</think>To determine if 44094, OH is south of 25601, WV, I need to
      compare their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 44094 is a zip code in Willoughby, Ohio, located in the northeastern part
      of Ohio near Lake Erie.

      - 25601 is a zip code in West Virginia, in the central/southern part of the
      state.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Ohio and West Virginia.

      - Ohio is generally positioned north of West Virginia.

      - West Virginia borders Ohio to the southeast.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Being in northeastern Ohio near Lake Erie, 44094 is in one of the northernmost
      parts of Ohio.

      - The zip code 25601 in West Virginia would be south of the Ohio border.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since 44094 is in northern Ohio, and West Virginia lies south of Ohio, the
      zip code 44094 must be north of 25601.


      NO, 44094, OH is not located south of 25601, WV. It is located north of it.'
    9cedfe1a-c918-40a4-a368-9533871d29dd: '<think>Okay, so I''m being asked to determine
      if the location with zip code 44094 in Ohio (OH) is south of the location with
      zip code 25601 in West Virginia (WV).


      To determine this, I need to know the geographic locations (specifically the
      latitudes) of these zip codes. Generally, lower latitude numbers indicate more
      southern locations in the northern hemisphere (where both Ohio and West Virginia
      are located).


      Let me reason through what I know about these states and regions:


      1. Ohio (OH) is generally north of West Virginia (WV). Ohio borders Lake Erie
      to the north, while West Virginia is landlocked and positioned southeast of
      Ohio.


      2. Zip code 44094 is in Ohio. Without looking up the specific location, I know
      it''s somewhere in Ohio.


      3. Zip code 25601 is in West Virginia, somewhere in that state.


      Given the general geography of these states, it''s likely that a location in
      Ohio would be north of a location in West Virginia, not south. However, since
      states have irregular shapes and borders, there could be exceptions depending
      on the specific locations.


      Without being able to look up the exact coordinates, I''ll have to make an educated
      guess based on the general geography of these states. Ohio is generally north
      of West Virginia, so a zip code in Ohio would typically be north of a zip code
      in West Virginia, not south.</think># Is 44094, OH located south of 25601, WV?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 44094 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 25601 is in West Virginia (WV)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and West Virginia

      - Ohio is generally located north of West Virginia

      - Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north

      - West Virginia is positioned southeast of Ohio


      ## Step 3: Evaluate specific zip codes

      - Ohio zip codes starting with "440" are typically in the northeastern part
      of Ohio

      - West Virginia zip codes starting with "256" are in the southern part of West
      Virginia


      ## Step 4: Determine relative positions

      Since Ohio is generally north of West Virginia, and specifically zip code 44094
      (likely in northeastern Ohio) would be north of zip code 25601 (in southern
      West Virginia), the Ohio location would not be south of the West Virginia location.


      NO'
    b7b3a406-4830-4745-a185-be86cc7936aa: '<think>This question asks me to determine
      if 44094, OH (Ohio) is located south of 25601, WV (West Virginia).


      I need to determine the relative geographical locations of these two zip codes.


      Let me think about US zip codes. Zip codes in the US generally follow patterns
      where:

      - First digit: Represents a group of states, generally from east (lower numbers)
      to west (higher numbers)

      - First 3 digits: Represent sectional centers or large cities

      - Last 2 digits: Represent specific post offices or delivery zones


      For the first digit:

      0 = New England and some mid-Atlantic states

      1 = Some mid-Atlantic and NY area

      2 = DC, MD, VA, WV, NC

      3 = Southeast (SC, GA, FL, AL, TN, etc.)

      4 = OH, IN, KY, MI, etc.

      5 = Great Lakes region and some central states

      And so on westward...


      So 44094 starts with "4" which includes Ohio

      25601 starts with "2" which includes West Virginia


      From the general zip code geography, zip codes starting with "2" (like WV) are
      generally east of those starting with "4" (like OH). But east/west doesn''t
      tell us about north/south.


      Ohio is generally north of West Virginia, though they do share a border. The
      question is about specific zip codes, though.


      44094 appears to be in Ohio, likely in the northeastern part of the state based
      on the "44" prefix.

      25601 appears to be in West Virginia, likely in the southern part of the state
      based on the "25" prefix.


      Based on general geography, Ohio tends to be north of West Virginia, so 44094,
      OH is likely north of 25601, WV. But I should be careful about making assumptions
      about specific zip codes without more precise information.</think>To determine
      if 44094, OH is south of 25601, WV, I need to identify the locations of these
      zip codes and compare their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 44094 is a zip code in Ohio (OH), specifically for Willoughby, which is in
      the northeastern part of Ohio near Lake Erie.

      - 25601 is a zip code in West Virginia (WV), located in the southern part of
      that state.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and West Virginia.

      - Ohio is generally positioned north of West Virginia.

      - Northeastern Ohio (where 44094 is located) is significantly north of southern
      West Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare specific locations.

      - Willoughby, OH (44094) is close to Lake Erie at the northern edge of Ohio.

      - Zip code 25601 in southern WV is much further south in latitude.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on latitude.

      - 44094 (Willoughby, OH) has a higher latitude (more northerly position) than
      25601 in southern WV.


      NO, 44094, OH is NOT located south of 25601, WV. It is located north of it.'

      near Lake Erie.


      2) Next, I need to figure out where 25601, WV is located. 25601 is a zip code
      in West Virginia (WV). It appears to be in the southern part of West Virginia.


      3) Now I need to determine which is further north (or south). Ohio is generally
      north of West Virginia, with Ohio bordering Lake Erie at its northern border,
      and West Virginia being south of Ohio. However, I need to be careful because
      specific zip codes might not follow the general state positioning.


      4) For 44094 (Willoughby, OH), this is in the northeastern part of Ohio, right
      near Lake Erie, which is quite far north.


      5) For 25601 (in southern WV), this would be in the southern portion of West
      Virginia, which is definitely south of northeastern Ohio.


      Therefore, 44094 (OH) would be north of 25601 (WV), not south of it.</think>I

      Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.

      - 44094 is in Willoughby, Ohio, which is located in the northeastern part of
      Ohio near Lake Erie.

      - 25601 is in West Virginia, in the southern part of the state.


      Step 2: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Ohio is generally north of West Virginia.

      - More specifically, Willoughby (44094) is in the far northeastern part of Ohio,
      placing it quite far north.

      - Southern West Virginia (where 25601 is located) is significantly south of
      northeastern Ohio.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      Since 44094 in Ohio is north of 25601 in West Virginia, it is NOT located south
      of it.

      determine the relative locations of two zip codes: 27408 in North Carolina (NC)
      and 32092 in Florida (FL).


      First, I need to remember the general geography of these states:

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the US, north of South Carolina
      and south of Virginia

      - Florida is located at the southeastern corner of the US, south of Georgia


      In general, Florida is south of North Carolina. So if we''re looking at typical
      locations in these states, a NC zip code would be north of a FL zip code (not
      south).


      However, I need to check the specific zip codes to make sure. Let me reason
      through this:


      The zip code 27408 is in NC (North Carolina)

      The zip code 32092 is in FL (Florida)


      Zip codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the
      northeast and higher numbers are in the southwest and west. So 27xxx would generally
      be north of 32xxx.


      Given that 27408 is in North Carolina and 32092 is in Florida, and North Carolina

      Step 1: Consider the geographic locations of the states.

      North Carolina (NC) is located on the east coast of the US, significantly north
      of Florida (FL). Florida is the southernmost state on the eastern seaboard of
      the continental US.


      Step 2: Look at the relative positions of these states.

      North Carolina''s southern border connects with South Carolina, which then borders
      Georgia, which borders Florida to the north. This means North Carolina is positioned
      entirely north of Florida.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Since 27408 is in North Carolina and 32092 is in Florida, and North Carolina

      First, I need to think about the geography of the United States:

      - North Carolina (NC) is a state that''s north of Florida (FL)

      - Florida is the southernmost state on the east coast of the US

      - Generally, locations in North Carolina would be north of locations in Florida


      Since the question is about geographic location (south of), and the states are

      - 27408 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 32092 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Generally speaking, Florida is located south of North Carolina in the United

      North Carolina is further north.


      So geographically speaking, a location in North Carolina would typically be

      Carolina is located further north.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      North Carolina is located north of Florida on the US map. Since 27408 is in
      North Carolina and 32092 is in Florida, the North Carolina zip code must be

      To determine this, I need to know the geographic positions of these ZIP codes.
      Specifically, I need to determine their latitudes. Locations at lower latitudes
      are more southern than locations at higher latitudes in the northern hemisphere
      (where both NY and PA are located).


      Let me reason through what I know about these states:

      - New York (NY) is generally north of Pennsylvania (PA)

      - ZIP codes in the US often (but not always) follow geographic patterns


      Looking at the ZIP codes:

      - 12009 is a ZIP code in NY

      - 19362 is a ZIP code in PA


      While I don''t have the exact latitudes memorized for every ZIP code, I know
      that New York ZIP codes typically start with 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14, with lower

      1. I need to determine if 12009, NY is south of 19362, PA.

      2. To do this, I need to understand the geographical locations of these zip
      codes.


      In the US zip code system:

      - The first digit generally indicates a broad geographical region (0-9 from
      east to west)

      - First 3 digits often define a sectional center facility


      For 12009, NY:

      - First digit "1" typically covers areas in the northeast like New York

      - "120xx" would be a specific region within New York state


      For 19362, PA:

      - First digit "1" also indicates northeast

      - "193xx" would be a specific region within Pennsylvania


      Since both start with "1", they''re both in the northeastern US, but I need
      to be more precise.


      Generally speaking, New York state is north of Pennsylvania. However, I need
      to be sure about these specific zip codes.


      12009 appears to be in New York, and New York is generally north of Pennsylvania.

      19362 appears to be in Pennsylvania, which is generally south of New York.


      Based on the general geography of the US, New York (12009) would be NORTH of
      Pennsylvania (19362), not south.</think># Is 12009, NY located south of 19362,
      PA?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 12009 is in New York (NY)

      - 19362 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between NY and PA

      New York state is generally positioned north of Pennsylvania on the map. Pennsylvania
      borders New York along New York''s southern border.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific zip code regions

      - Zip codes beginning with "120" are typically in the eastern part of upstate
      New York

      - Zip codes beginning with "193" are typically in southeastern Pennsylvania


      ## Step 4: Make the north-south determination

      Even accounting for irregular state borders, locations in upstate New York (120xx)
      are positioned north of locations in southeastern Pennsylvania (193xx).


      Therefore, 12009, NY is NOT located south of 19362, PA. It is located north
      of it.

      of 07640, NJ, I need to identify the locations and compare their latitudes.


      First, let me identify what these zip codes correspond to:

      - 03303 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 07640 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their geographical
      positions. New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States, while New Jersey
      is also in the northeastern United States but more south.


      In general, New Hampshire is north of New Jersey. Looking at a map of the United
      States:

      - New Hampshire borders Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Canada

      - New Jersey is further south, bordering New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and
      the Atlantic Ocean


      So by state positioning alone, a location in New Hampshire (03303) would generally
      be north of a location in New Jersey (07640), not south.


      Therefore, 03303, NH is NOT south of 07640, NJ. It is north of it.</think>I

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 07640 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in
      the New England region. New Jersey is also in the northeastern US, but is positioned
      south of New England.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      On a map of the United States, New Hampshire is positioned north of New Jersey.
      All of New Hampshire is at a higher latitude than New Jersey.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since 03303 is in NH and 07640 is in NJ, and NH is entirely north of NJ, the
      zip code in NH cannot be south of the zip code in NJ.

      - New Hampshire is in New England, in the northeastern part of the US

      - New Jersey is on the east coast, south of New York


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - New Hampshire is further north than New Jersey

      - This means that locations in NH are generally north of locations in NJ, not

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard, south of New York.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - New Hampshire is positioned farther north than New Jersey.

      - All of New Hampshire is north of New Jersey on a map.

      New Hampshire is located in New England in the northeastern United States. New
      Jersey is also in the northeast, but is positioned south of New Hampshire.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes.

      Since New Hampshire is north of New Jersey, any location in New Hampshire (including

      - New Hampshire is positioned significantly north of New Jersey

      - All of New Hampshire is north of all of New Jersey


      Step 4: Determine the specific zip code locations

      Step 4: Confirm with zip code patterns.

      The US Postal Service assigned lower first digits to zip codes in the northeastern

      The question is asking whether the location with zip code 03303 in New Hampshire
      (NH) is south of the location with zip code 07640 in New Jersey (NJ).


      To determine this, I need to know the relative positions of these locations.


      First, let''s think about the states themselves:

      - NH (New Hampshire) is in New England, in the northeastern United States

      - NJ (New Jersey) is on the eastern seaboard, south of New York


      Geographically, New Hampshire is north of New Jersey. New Hampshire borders
      Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Quebec (Canada), while New Jersey is further
      south, bordering New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the Atlantic Ocean.


      Since the zip codes are in different states, and New Hampshire is generally
      north of New Jersey, it''s very likely that 03303, NH is north of 07640, NJ.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      New Hampshire is located in New England in the northeastern United States. New
      Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard, south of New York and north of Delaware.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      New Hampshire is entirely north of New Jersey on the map. NH is positioned significantly
      further north along the eastern coast compared to NJ.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since New Hampshire is geographically north of New Jersey, zip code 03303 in

      US zip code 73644 in Oklahoma is located south of the US zip code 75149 in Texas.


      Step 1: I should identify the approximate geographic locations of these zip
      codes.

      - 73644 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 75149 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: I need to recall the geographic relationship between Oklahoma and Texas.

      Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas. Oklahoma shares its southern border
      with Texas.


      Step 3: Since these are zip codes in different states, I need to determine their
      specific locations within their respective states.


      For zip code 73644 in Oklahoma, this would be somewhere in Oklahoma. For zip
      code 75149 in Texas, this would be somewhere in Texas.


      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, generally locations in Oklahoma would be north
      of locations in Texas.


      However, I need to be careful because:

      1. Oklahoma''s shape is somewhat rectangular with the panhandle extending westward

      2. Texas is a large state that extends further south than Oklahoma, but also
      has parts that extend northward


      Step 4: I need to be more specific about the locations of these zip codes within
      their states.


      73644 is in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is entirely north of central and eastern Texas.

      75149 is in Texas. Based on the zip code pattern, 751xx suggests this is in
      the northeastern part of Texas, likely in the Dallas area.


      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and 75149 is likely in the northeastern part
      of Texas near Dallas, which is close to the Oklahoma border, 73644 in Oklahoma
      is very likely north of 75149 in Texas, not south.

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      Oklahoma is positioned directly north of Texas on a map. They share a border
      with Oklahoma above Texas.


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations of these zip codes.

      - 73644 appears to be in western/central Oklahoma

      - 75149 is in northeast Texas (likely in the Dallas-Fort Worth area)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on relative positions.

      Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas, and 73644 is in Oklahoma while 75149
      is in Texas, the Oklahoma zip code must be north of the Texas zip code, not
      south of it.

      NM (New Mexico) is located south of 85614, AZ (Arizona).


      To answer this, I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these
      two zip codes.


      Let me think about how zip codes work in the US. Generally, the first digit
      of the zip code indicates a large geographical region, with lower numbers typically
      being in the eastern US and higher numbers in the western US. The first three
      digits typically identify a sectional center facility (SCF).


      In this case:

      - 87301 is in New Mexico (NM)

      - 85614 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Arizona and New Mexico are neighboring states, with Arizona to the west of New
      Mexico. But the question is about north-south positioning.


      From my knowledge of US geography:

      - Arizona zip codes beginning with 85 typically cover the southern part of Arizona

      - New Mexico zip codes beginning with 87 typically cover the northwestern part
      of New Mexico


      In the US, zip codes don''t perfectly align with latitude (north-south positioning),
      but I can make an educated assessment.


      Gallup, NM is in the 87301 zip code area, and it''s located in the northwestern
      part of New Mexico.

      85614 appears to be in the Green Valley area, which is in southern Arizona.

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 87301 is in New Mexico (NM)

      - 85614 is in Arizona (AZ)


      ## Step 2: Analyze the zip code regions

      - The 873xx zip codes are generally in the northwestern part of New Mexico

      - 85614 is in the Green Valley area of southern Arizona


      ## Step 4: Compare latitudes

      Northwestern New Mexico (Gallup area) is located north of southern Arizona (Green
      Valley).
