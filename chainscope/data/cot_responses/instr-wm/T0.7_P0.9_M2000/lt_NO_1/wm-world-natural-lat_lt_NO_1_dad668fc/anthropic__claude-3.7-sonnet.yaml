      Long Lake is in Alpena County, which is in the northeastern part of Michigan''s

      Step 2: Identify where "Crazy Lake" is located.

      This is challenging because "Crazy Lake" is not a well-known geographical feature
      with a standard name. There are various lakes with unusual nicknames around
      the world, but none widely known as "Crazy Lake" that would serve as a common
      reference point.

      make a reliable north-south comparison.


      Since I don''t have reliable information about the location of "Crazy Lake"
      to compare with Serra de Monchique''s position, I cannot provide a definitive
      YES or NO answer to whether Serra de Monchique is south of Crazy Lake.'

      While Palawan is generally southwest of Mindanao, Mount Mantalingajan is on
      southern Palawan, and Mount Balatukan is in northern Mindanao. This means Mount
      Mantalingajan is indeed south of Mount Balatukan.


      NO


      Actually, I need to correct my answer. After more careful consideration of the
      geography:


      YES


      Mount Mantalingajan is located south of Mount Balatukan. Mount Balatukan is
      in northern Mindanao, while Mount Mantalingajan is on the southern part of Palawan,
      which places it further south in terms of latitude.'

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both Mount Mantalingajan and Mount
      Balatukan in the Philippines.


      Step 2: Mount Mantalingajan is located on Palawan Island in the southwestern
      part of the Philippines. It''s the highest peak on Palawan.


      Step 3: Mount Balatukan is located in northern Mindanao, in the northeastern

      Step 4: Comparing their positions, Palawan Island (where Mount Mantalingajan

      Step 5: Since Mount Mantalingajan is on Palawan which is northwest of Mindanao,
      and Mount Balatukan is in northern Mindanao, Mount Mantalingajan is not south
      of Mount Balatukan. In fact, it''s generally northwest of it.

      Mount Mantalingajan is located on Palawan Island in the Philippines. Palawan
      is the southwestern-most major island of the Philippines.

      Mount Balatukan is located in Mindanao, which is the southernmost major island

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both Stanley Lake and Lake Rossignol.


      Step 2: Lake Rossignol is located in Nova Scotia, Canada. It''s in the southwestern
      part of the province.


      Step 3: There are multiple lakes named "Stanley Lake" in different parts of
      the world. The most notable ones are in:

      - Idaho, USA

      - Ontario, Canada

      - New Brunswick, Canada


      Step 4: Comparing locations:

      - Nova Scotia (Lake Rossignol) is located in eastern Canada

      - Idaho (Stanley Lake) is in the northwestern United States, which is south
      and west of Nova Scotia

      - Ontario (Stanley Lake) is west and slightly north of Nova Scotia

      - New Brunswick (Stanley Lake) is adjacent to Nova Scotia but slightly northwest


      Step 5: Regardless of which Stanley Lake we consider, none of them are south
      of Lake Rossignol. All potential Stanley Lakes are either west, northwest, or
      southwest of Lake Rossignol.

      Lake Maninjau is a caldera lake located in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Indonesia
      is in Southeast Asia.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Atlantic Ocean.

      The Atlantic Ocean is a major ocean that lies between the Americas to the west
      and Europe and Africa to the east.

      Lake Maninjau is located near the equator in Indonesia, which is in the Eastern
      Hemisphere.

      The Atlantic Ocean is primarily in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres between
      the Americas and Europe/Africa.


      Step 4: Determine north-south relationship.

      The Atlantic Ocean extends from the Arctic in the north to Antarctica in the
      south, covering both northern and southern hemispheres.

      Lake Maninjau is near the equator.


      Since the Atlantic Ocean extends both north AND south of Lake Maninjau''s latitude
      (the ocean extends all the way from the Arctic to Antarctica), parts of the
      Atlantic Ocean are indeed south of Lake Maninjau.

      Wait, I need to reconsider. While parts of the Atlantic Ocean are south of Lake
      Maninjau, the question asks if "Atlantic Ocean" as a whole is located south

      southern end.


      Step 5: Since Inferno Crater Lake is further up the valley (southward) from
      Frying Pan Lake, Inferno Crater Lake is indeed south of Frying Pan Lake.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      The Waimangu Valley actually runs from north to south, with the entrance at
      the north and Lake Rotomahana at the south. When walking through the valley
      from the entrance, visitors encounter Frying Pan Lake first, and then Inferno
      Crater Lake further along the path (to the south).


      So the correct answer is:


      YES.'

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both Buttle Lake and the Vancouver
      Island Ranges.


      Step 2: Vancouver Island Ranges (also called the Vancouver Island Mountains)
      form the backbone of Vancouver Island, running roughly northwest to southeast
      along the central part of the island.


      Step 3: Buttle Lake is a large lake located in Strathcona Provincial Park in
      central Vancouver Island.


      Step 4: Examining their relative positions, Buttle Lake is actually situated
      within the Vancouver Island Ranges, not south of them. The lake is nestled among
      these mountains in central Vancouver Island.


      Step 5: Since Buttle Lake is located within the Vancouver Island Ranges rather
      than south of them, the answer is NO.


      NO'

      counties Clare, Tipperary, and Galway. It''s part of the Shannon river system
      in the midwest region of Ireland.

      The Wicklow Mountains are located in eastern Ireland, primarily in County Wicklow
      (hence the name), just south of Dublin.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Looking at a map of Ireland, Lough Derg (Shannon) is located in the midwestern
      part of the country, while the Wicklow Mountains are in the east. On a north-south
      axis, Lough Derg is approximately at the same latitude as or slightly north
