      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. In such a case, I would choose
      NO, as I do not have evidence to support a YES answer.

      5. King Haakon Bay is located on the southwestern coast of South Georgia.


      6. Since the southwestern part of the island is south of the northeastern part,
      King Haakon Bay is indeed located south of King Edward Cove.

      1. First, let''s locate Farallones de Cali:

      - Farallones de Cali is a mountain range located in western Colombia

      - Specifically, it is in the Valle del Cauca department

      - It is part of the Cordillera Occidental (Western Mountain Range) of the Andes


      2. Next, let''s locate Chini Lake:

      - Chini Lake (or Lake Chini) is located in Malaysia

      - It is situated in the state of Pahang, on the Malay Peninsula


      3. Geographical comparison:

      - Farallones de Cali is in South America (Colombia)

      - Chini Lake is in Southeast Asia (Malaysia)

      - These locations are on completely different continents, separated by the Pacific
      Ocean


      4. Determining relative position:

      - Given their vast geographical separation, it is not meaningful to say one
      is "south" of the other

      - However, objectively, Farallones de Cali is geographically south of Chini
      Lake

      1. Lake Valencia is located in Venezuela, which is in South America.


      2. The Western Ghats are a mountain range located in India, which is in Asia.


      3. Venezuela and India are on different continents, separated by thousands of
      miles.


      4. To be south of the Western Ghats, Lake Valencia would need to be geographically
      located south of this mountain range.


      5. Since Lake Valencia is in South America and the Western Ghats are in India,
      Lake Valencia cannot be south of the Western Ghats.
