      2. **Lake Matano**: This is a lake located in Indonesia, specifically on the

      of the Great Dividing Range, situated in the northeastern part of the state.


      2. **Stormberg Mountains**: These are located in South Africa, specifically
      in the Eastern Cape province. The Stormberg forms part of a series of mountain
      ranges in the southern part of the country.


      Now, considering the geographic positions:


      - The Moonbi Range is in New South Wales, Australia, which is located in the
      Southern Hemisphere.

      - The Stormberg Mountains are in South Africa, also in the Southern Hemisphere.


      To determine which is south of the other, we consider their latitudinal positions:


      - The Moonbi Range is at a latitude of approximately 30 degrees south.

      - The Stormberg Mountains are at a latitude of approximately 31 degrees south.


      Since the Stormberg Mountains are located further south on the globe compared

    671296f9-ea07-47ee-b3f7-1686690b3ce0: 'To determine if Stanley Lake is located
      south of Lake Rossignol, we need to identify the geographical locations of both
      lakes and their relative positions.


      1. **Identify the location of Lake Rossignol**: Lake Rossignol is located in
      Nova Scotia, Canada. It is situated in the southwestern part of the province.


      2. **Identify the location of Stanley Lake**: There are several lakes named
      Stanley Lake, so we need to determine which one is being referred to. The most
      notable Stanley Lake is located in Idaho, United States. However, given the
      context of comparing it with Lake Rossignol, it''s more relevant to consider
      a Stanley Lake that might be geographically closer, potentially within Canada.


      3. **Compare their relative positions**: If we consider Stanley Lake in Idaho,
      it is situated well to the west and not relevant to a north-south comparison
      with Lake Rossignol in Nova Scotia. However, if there is a lesser-known Stanley
      Lake in Canada near Lake Rossignol, that would need to be considered.


      Assuming the question pertains to commonly known lakes, in this case, Stanley
      Lake in Idaho is significantly further west and slightly south of Lake Rossignol,
      but this doesn''t directly address a north-south comparison due to the large
      geographical distance between the two areas.

      1. **Gokyo Lakes**: This is a system of glacial lakes in the Khumbu region of
      Nepal, located in the Sagarmatha National Park. They are situated in the Himalayas,
      to the west of the Ngozumpa Glacier, the largest glacier in Nepal. The Gokyo
      Lakes are north of the town of Namche Bazaar and are part of the Everest region.


      2. **Mountain Lodge Lake**: This is not a well-known or commonly referenced
      geographical feature like Gokyo Lakes. There may be various smaller or less
      significant lakes with names including "Mountain Lodge Lake," but without additional
      context or a specific location, it is not possible to determine their exact
      position relative to Gokyo Lakes.


      Given the lack of precise, publicly recognized information about a specific
      "Mountain Lodge Lake," it is not possible to definitively say whether Gokyo

      central part of Tasmania, while the West Coast Range is located along the western
      edge of the island.


      By comparing their general locations, we find that the Great Western Tiers is
      more centrally located and slightly to the east compared to the West Coast Range,

      north of Idaho. Given the specific locations within these states, the Adirondack
      Mountains (and hence Adirondack Lake) are situated to the northeast of the Pioneer
      Mountains in Idaho.


      Based on these steps, Adirondack Lake is not located south of the Pioneer Mountains
      in Idaho.


      The answer is: NO.'
    eca545b8-63bb-4c59-b39b-4b7cba16c058: 'To determine whether Adirondack Lake is
      located south of the Pioneer Mountains in Idaho, we need to consider the geographical
      locations of both places:


      1. **Adirondack Lake**: This lake is part of the Adirondack Mountains, which
      are located in northeastern New York State. The Adirondack region is situated
      in the northeastern part of the United States.


      2. **Pioneer Mountains**: These are located in Idaho, which is in the northwestern
      part of the United States.


      Now, considering the relative positions of New York and Idaho within the United
      States:


      - New York is generally east and slightly north compared to Idaho.

      - The Adirondack Mountains (and thus Adirondack Lake) are in the northeastern
      part of New York State.


      Given this information, Adirondack Lake in New York is actually located east
      and slightly north of the Pioneer Mountains in Idaho. Therefore, Adirondack
      Lake is not south of the Pioneer Mountains.


      The answer is: NO.'
