      Philippines is generally south of Oman, Mount Tirad itself is located in the
      northern part of the Philippines. The Dhofar Mountains are in the southern part
      of Oman. Therefore, Mount Tirad is not directly south of the Dhofar Mountains.


      **Final Answer**: NO.'

      down step by step:


      1. **Locate the Margalla Hills**: The Margalla Hills are a hill range located
      in the northern part of Pakistan, near the capital city of Islamabad. They are
      part of the Himalayan foothills.


      2. **Locate the Temescal Mountains**: The Temescal Mountains are a small mountain
      range in Southern California, USA. They are located near the cities of Riverside
      and Corona.


      3. **Compare their locations**: The Margalla Hills are in Asia (Pakistan), while

      of water in Michigan. Union Lake is located in Oakland County, Michigan, while
      Haggetts Pond is also in Michigan but in a different region.


      2. **Determine their relative positions**: Union Lake is situated in southeastern
      Michigan, near the city of Pontiac. Haggetts Pond is located in the town of
      Andover, Massachusetts, which is in the northeastern United States.


      3. **Compare their geographical locations**: Since Haggetts Pond is in Massachusetts
      and Union Lake is in Michigan, Haggetts Pond is not located south of Union Lake.
      In fact, Massachusetts is northeast of Michigan.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on their geographical locations, Haggetts Pond is not
      south of Union Lake.

      Rockies, located on the border between Alberta and British Columbia, Canada.
      It is part of the Kootenay National Park.


      2. **Locate Edersee**: Edersee is a reservoir in northern Hesse, Germany. It
      is situated in central Germany, near the town of Waldeck.


      3. **Compare their locations**: Vermilion Pass is in North America, while Edersee
      is in Europe. Geographically, Canada (where Vermilion Pass is located) is northwest
      of Germany (where Edersee is located).

      1. **Locate Upper Rideau Lake**: Upper Rideau Lake is part of the Rideau Canal
      system in Ontario. It is situated in the eastern part of the province, near
      the town of Westport.


      2. **Locate Four Mile Lake**: Four Mile Lake is also in Ontario, but it is located
      further north, in the Muskoka region, near the town of Bracebridge.


      3. **Compare their latitudes**: Upper Rideau Lake is south of Four Mile Lake
      because the Muskoka region (where Four Mile Lake is located) is generally north
      of the Rideau Canal system.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Upper Rideau Lake is in a more southerly location compared
      to Four Mile Lake, the answer is YES.

      1. **Locate Four Mile Lake**: Four Mile Lake is situated in the Kawartha Lakes
      region of Ontario, Canada. It is part of a chain of lakes in this area.


      2. **Locate Upper Rideau Lake**: Upper Rideau Lake is part of the Rideau Canal
      system, which is located further south in Ontario, near the city of Kingston.


      3. **Compare their locations**: The Kawartha Lakes region (where Four Mile Lake
      is located) is generally north of the Rideau Canal system (where Upper Rideau
      Lake is located). Maps and geographical data confirm that Upper Rideau Lake

    e1b30e61-44d4-4063-ae51-76d8dc4af5f8: '### Step 1: Locate Upper Rideau Lake and
      Four Mile Lake in Ontario.


      Upper Rideau Lake and Four Mile Lake are both situated in Ontario, Canada. Upper
      Rideau Lake is part of the Rideau Canal system, which is a UNESCO World Heritage
      Site. Four Mile Lake is located in the Kawartha Lakes region, which is north
      of the Rideau Canal system.


      ### Step 2: Determine the relative positions of the two lakes.


      Given that the Rideau Canal system is generally south of the Kawartha Lakes
      region, Upper Rideau Lake should be located south of Four Mile Lake.


      ### Step 3: Verify the locations on a map.


      Upon consulting a map of Ontario, it is confirmed that Upper Rideau Lake is
      indeed south of Four Mile Lake. The Rideau Canal system runs from Kingston on
      Lake Ontario northward to Ottawa, while the Kawartha Lakes region is further
      north.


      ### Step 4: Conclude the answer.


      Based on the above reasoning, the answer to the question is YES.


      YES.'

      1. **Locate Prince Christian Sound**: Prince Christian Sound is a waterway in
      southern Greenland, connecting the Labrador Sea to the Irminger Sea. It is situated
      in the southernmost part of Greenland.


      2. **Locate Ringedalsvatnet**: Ringedalsvatnet is a lake in Norway, specifically
      in the Hardangervidda region. It is located in the southern part of Norway.


      3. **Compare their locations**: Greenland is northwest of Norway. Since Prince

      step to determine whether The Remarkables are located south of Lake Te Anau.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Locations

      First, I need to know where both The Remarkables and Lake Te Anau are located.


      - **The Remarkables**: This is a mountain range in the South Island of New Zealand,
      near the city of Queenstown.

      - **Lake Te Anau**: This is a large lake also located in the South Island of
      New Zealand, specifically in the Fiordland region.


      ### Step 2: Locate Them on a Map

      To compare their positions, I should visualize or refer to a map of New Zealand''s
      South Island.


      - **Queenstown (near The Remarkables)**: Located in the Otago region, towards
      the central part of the South Island.

      - **Lake Te Anau**: Situated further south in the Fiordland region.


      ### Step 3: Determine Relative Positions

      Now, I need to assess whether The Remarkables (near Queenstown) are south of
      Lake Te Anau.


      From the map:

      - Queenstown is north of Lake Te Anau.

      - Therefore, The Remarkables, being near Queenstown, are also north of Lake
      Te Anau.


      ### Step 4: Conclusion

      Based on the map and the locations:


      - **The Remarkables** are **not** south of **Lake Te Anau**; they are north
      of it.
