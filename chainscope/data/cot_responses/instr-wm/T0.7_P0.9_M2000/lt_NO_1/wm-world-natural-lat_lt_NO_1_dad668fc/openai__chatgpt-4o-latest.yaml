      \ department of Colombia.\n   - *Serran\xEDa del Baud\xF3* is a coastal mountain\

      \ their relative positions:**\n   - Guatap\xE9 is in the central-northwestern\
      \ part of Colombia, in Antioquia.\n   - Serran\xEDa del Baud\xF3 is located\
      \ further west, near the Pacific coast.\n   - To determine if El Pe\xF1\xF3\
      n de Guatap\xE9 is *south* of Serran\xEDa del Baud\xF3, we need to compare their\

      3. King Haakon Bay is located on the southern coast of South Georgia, toward
      the west.

      4. To determine if King Haakon Bay is south of King Edward Cove, we compare
      their relative positions.

      5. Since King Haakon Bay is on the southern coast and King Edward Cove is on
      the northeastern coast, King Haakon Bay is indeed further south.
