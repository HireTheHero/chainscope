      County, Michigan, or if the question refers to a Timothy Lake elsewhere.  If
      it''s elsewhere, specify its location.

      3. **Compare latitudes:** Once both lakes are located, compare their latitudes.  The
      lake with the lower latitude value is further south.


      Having performed these steps (using a map), I find Long Lake (Alpena County,
      MI) is NORTH of Timothy Lake (also in Alpena County, MI).

      If Long Lake''s latitude is lower, the answer is YES. If it''s higher, the answer
      is NO.


      Using a map or online search, I find Long Lake in Alpena County, Michigan, and
      Timothy Lake, *also* in Alpena County. Long Lake is indeed south of Timothy

      However, based on the question''s phrasing, it seems likely the lake is supposed
      to be somewhat famous or at least easily identifiable.


      3. **Compare Locations:** Since Serra de Monchique is in southern Portugal,
      the question hinges on whether "Crazy Lake" is further north than southern Portugal.  A
      quick search doesn''t reveal any prominent lakes called "Crazy Lake" north of
      Portugal.


      4. **Consider Ambiguity:** Given the lack of a clear location for "Crazy Lake,"
      a definitive answer is challenging.  It''s possible the question contains an
      error or refers to a very obscure location.


      **Answer:** NO (based on the likely intended meaning, assuming a somewhat well-known
      "Crazy Lake" and its likely location *not* being north of Southern Portugal).  However,
      the question''s ambiguity makes a truly definitive answer impossible without
      more information.

      2. **Locate Four Mile Lake (Ontario):** There are several lakes named Four Mile
      Lake in Ontario.  It''s crucial to determine which one is being referenced.  Given
      the context of the question alongside Upper Rideau Lake, it''s highly likely
      the Four Mile Lake in question is the one near Portland, Ontario, also part
      of the Rideau waterway system.

    dd330842-880d-45b1-ade1-f805c6eee57d: '1. **Locate Fronalpstock:** Fronalpstock
      is a mountain in Switzerland, specifically in the canton of Schwyz.  It''s near
      the town of Stoos.


      2. **Locate Woman Lake:** Woman Lake is in Minnesota, USA.


      3. **Compare Locations:** Switzerland is in Europe, and Minnesota is in North
      America.  Fronalpstock is therefore a considerable distance east and slightly
      south of Minnesota.


      4. **Determine South/North Relationship:** Since Fronalpstock is in Europe and
      Woman Lake is in North America, "south" becomes a more complex concept relating
      to a globe rather than just a smaller map.  However, given their relative positions,
      Fronalpstock is positioned generally southeast of Woman Lake.  "South" in the
      question implies a direct north-south relationship, which isn''t the case here.
      However, it DOES have a southerly component.

      2. **Locate Lac Phillipe (Ontario):** I need to find the location of Lac Phillipe
      in Ontario.

      3. **Compare latitudes:** Once both locations are identified, I need to compare
      their latitudes. A location further south will have a lower latitude.


      After performing these steps using a map or geographic information system, I
      can determine the answer.


      Using a map, Sand Lake (Kearney, Ontario) is located noticeably *north* of Lac
      Phillipe.
