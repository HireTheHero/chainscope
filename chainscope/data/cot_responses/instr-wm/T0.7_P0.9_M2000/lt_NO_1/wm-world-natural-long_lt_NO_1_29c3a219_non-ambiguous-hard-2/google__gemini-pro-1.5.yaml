      on the island of Corvo, also in the Azores.


      3. **Relative Position:**  Since both are on a relatively small island, and
      Mount Michael is a central peak, the Bay of Grama being on the *north* coast
      means it''s unlikely to be directly west.  West would imply a separate coastline.

      is north, slightly northwest, of Mount Michael.
