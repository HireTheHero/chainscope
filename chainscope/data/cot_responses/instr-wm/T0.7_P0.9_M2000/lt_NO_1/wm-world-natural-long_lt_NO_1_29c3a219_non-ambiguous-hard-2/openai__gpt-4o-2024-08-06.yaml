      - The Philippines, where the Caraballo Mountains are located, is in Southeast
      Asia.

      - Finland, where Lake Inari is located, is in Northern Europe.


      Geographically, Southeast Asia (the Philippines) is east of Northern Europe

      in Newfoundland and Labrador is located west of Gravelly Lake, we need to establish
      the geographical positions of both locations.


      1. **Identify the location of the Bay of Islands, Newfoundland and Labrador**:
      The Bay of Islands is located on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland
      in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.


      2. **Identify the location of Gravelly Lake**: Without specific context, Gravelly
      Lake could refer to any number of lakes with that name. However, given the context
      of Newfoundland and Labrador, it is likely a local or regional lake within or
      near the province. For a precise comparison, one would need the exact geographical
      coordinates or a well-known reference point for Gravelly Lake.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Assuming we are considering the Bay of Islands
      on the western coast of Newfoundland, it would be necessary to know the relative
      position of Gravelly Lake in Newfoundland and Labrador. If Gravelly Lake is
      not specifically known or not located on the west coast, it is reasonable to
      conclude that most locations in Newfoundland and Labrador are east of the Bay
      of Islands due to its west coast position.


      Based on the general understanding that the Bay of Islands is on the west coast
      of Newfoundland, without specific coordinates for Gravelly Lake, the assumption
      is:


      **NO**, the Bay of Islands is not located west of Gravelly Lake if Gravelly

      2. **Locate Gravelly Lake:** There are several lakes named Gravelly Lake, but

      However, there is no notable Gravelly Lake in Newfoundland and Labrador specifically
      referenced in common geographic databases.


      Assuming there is a local or lesser-known Gravelly Lake within Newfoundland
      and Labrador, it is important to identify whether it is to the east or west
      of the Bay of Islands.


      3. **General Geography of Newfoundland and Labrador:** The Bay of Islands is
      located on the western coast of Newfoundland. Therefore, most of the land area
      of Newfoundland and Labrador would be east of the Bay of Islands.


      Given the information and typical geographic layout:

      and not specifically on the extreme western part of the island, it is likely
      to be east of the Bay of Islands.

      1. **Identify the location of Lake Sarysu:** Lake Sarysu is located in Kazakhstan.
      It is one of the country''s largest lakes and is situated in the central part
      of Kazakhstan.


      2. **Identify the location of Lac de Montriond:** Lac de Montriond is located
      in France, specifically in the Haute-Savoie region of the French Alps.


      3. **Determine the relative positions:** Kazakhstan is generally to the east
      of France when looking at a world map. Specifically, since Lake Sarysu is in
      central Kazakhstan and Lac de Montriond is in eastern France, Lake Sarysu is
      east of Lac de Montriond.
