      3.  **Determine relative positions:** Scotland (UK) is to the east of New Jersey
      (USA) across the Atlantic Ocean.


      Therefore, Blackwater Reservoir (in Scotland) is located east of Navesink Highlands
      (in New Jersey).


      So, the answer to "Is Blackwater Reservoir located west of Navesink Highlands?"
      is NO.'

      \ A longitude of 76.9\xB0 W is further west than 74.0\xB0 W (larger West longitude\

      \ (e.g., in Virginia or Montana), the answer to the question is yes. The question\

      1.  **Locate Mount Franklin (New Hampshire):** Mount Franklin is part of the
      Presidential Range in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. This is in the northern
      part of the state.

      2.  **Locate Harper Lake:** A search for "Harper Lake New Hampshire" reveals
      a Harper Lake in Tuftonboro, NH. Tuftonboro is in Carroll County, in the Lakes
      Region, significantly south and slightly east of the Presidential Range.

      3.  **Compare their longitudes (or general west/east positions):** The Presidential
      Range (where Mount Franklin is) is generally to the north and west of Tuftonboro
      (where Harper Lake is).


      Therefore, Mount Franklin is indeed west of Harper Lake (Tuftonboro, NH).

    9a6fc18c-efc4-4c8f-8fa3-8970f6e34e8b: 'Okay, here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Woman Lake:** Woman Lake is located in Cass County, Minnesota,
      USA.

      2.  **Locate Detroit Lake:** The most prominent "Detroit Lake" is the one in
      Oregon, USA. There is also a city named Detroit Lakes in Minnesota, which is
      on a lake also called Detroit Lake (or Big Detroit Lake).

      3.  **Compare Woman Lake, MN, to Detroit Lake, OR:** Minnesota is significantly
      east of Oregon. Therefore, Woman Lake in Minnesota is east of Detroit Lake in
      Oregon.

      4.  **Compare Woman Lake, MN, to Detroit Lake (city), MN:** Woman Lake (Cass
      County) is located to the east/southeast of the city of Detroit Lakes (Becker
      County) within Minnesota.

      5.  **Conclusion:** In both prominent interpretations of "Detroit Lake," Woman
      Lake is located *east* of it, not west.

      2.  **Locate Adirondack Lake:** "Adirondack Lake" is not a specific, singularly
      named prominent lake. However, the Adirondack Mountains, which contain thousands
      of lakes (like Lake Placid, Saranac Lake, Tupper Lake, etc.), are located in
      northeastern New York State, USA. The USA is in North America.
