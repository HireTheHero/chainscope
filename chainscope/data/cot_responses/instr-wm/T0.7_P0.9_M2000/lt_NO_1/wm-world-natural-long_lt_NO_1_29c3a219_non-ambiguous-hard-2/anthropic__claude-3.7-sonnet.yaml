      the relative positions of Cobequid Bay and the Ogilvie Mountains.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Cobequid Bay.

      Cobequid Bay is located in Nova Scotia, Canada, on the eastern coast of North
      America. It''s part of the Bay of Fundy system on Canada''s Atlantic coast.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Ogilvie Mountains.

      The Ogilvie Mountains are located in northwestern Canada, specifically in Yukon
      Territory, near the border with Alaska.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      Nova Scotia (where Cobequid Bay is) is on Canada''s eastern coast, while Yukon
      Territory (where the Ogilvie Mountains are) is in northwestern Canada, much
      farther west.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Nova Scotia is on the eastern side of Canada and Yukon is on the western
      side, Cobequid Bay is east of the Ogilvie Mountains, not west of them.


      NO, Cobequid Bay is not located west of Ogilvie Mountains. It is located east
      of them.'

      The River Gannel is a small river in Cornwall, England, in the United Kingdom.
      It flows into the Atlantic Ocean near Newquay.


      Step 3: Compare their locations on a global scale.

      England (where River Gannel is) is in Western Europe, while the Qattara Depression
      is in North Africa. On a world map, England is north and east of Egypt.


      Step 4: Determine if Qattara Depression is west of River Gannel.

      Since Egypt is east and south of England, the Qattara Depression is east (not
      west) of River Gannel.


      NO'

      The Qattara Depression is a large depression in northwestern Egypt, in the Libyan
      Desert. It''s located in North Africa.

      And:

      - New York is an eastern state near the Atlantic Ocean

      - California is a western state on the Pacific Ocean

      - There are multiple "Honey Lakes" in the United States. The most notable Honey
      Lake is in northeastern California, near the Nevada border in the western United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States.

      - Therefore, any lake in New York would be east of a lake in California.


      Step 3: Verify there''s not another major Honey Lake in a different location.

      - While there might be smaller bodies of water named "Honey Lake" elsewhere,
      the most significant and well-known Honey Lake is in California.

      - Even if considering other smaller Honey Lakes in eastern states, Orange Lake

      Step 1: Let me recall the locations of Lake Tanganyika and the Gulf of Guinea.

      - Lake Tanganyika is one of the African Great Lakes, located in central/eastern
      Africa, spanning the borders between Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo,
      Burundi, and Zambia.

      - The Gulf of Guinea is on the western coast of Africa, along the Atlantic Ocean,
      bordering countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, etc.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the African continent.

      - Lake Tanganyika is in central/eastern Africa

      - The Gulf of Guinea is on the western coast of Africa


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - If we look at a map of Africa, the Gulf of Guinea is on the western side of
      the continent, facing the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Lake Tanganyika is located more toward the center and eastern part of the
      continent.

      - Therefore, Lake Tanganyika is east of the Gulf of Guinea, not west of it.


      NO, Lake Tanganyika is not located west of the Gulf of Guinea. It is located

      Step 1: Identify the location of Loch of Skene.

      Loch of Skene is located in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in the United Kingdom.
      Scotland is in the northern part of the UK, and this loch would be in northeastern
      Scotland.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Minnetonka.

      Lake Minnetonka is located in Minnesota, USA, specifically in the eastern part
      of the state, near Minneapolis.


      Step 3: Consider their positions on a world map.

      Scotland is located in Western Europe, while Minnesota is in the central northern
      United States. On a world map with standard orientation (north at top), Europe
      is east of North America.


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Since Scotland (where Loch of Skene is) is in Europe, and Minnesota (where Lake
      Minnetonka is) is in North America, Loch of Skene must be east of Lake Minnetonka,
      not west.

      without specifying a state for Harper Lake, I should check if there''s a Harper
      Lake in New Hampshire or nearby states.


      Step 4: There is a Harper Lake in northern New Hampshire, in Coos County.


      Step 5: Mount Franklin is located in the Presidential Range of the White Mountains
      in central/eastern New Hampshire.


      Step 6: Harper Lake in New Hampshire is located in the northern part of the
      state, while Mount Franklin is in the eastern part of central New Hampshire.


      Step 7: In New Hampshire, locations in the eastern part of the state would be
      east of locations in the northern part (since the state has a roughly vertical
      orientation with the northern part extending westward).

      Mount Franklin is a mountain in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, located
      in the Presidential Range.


      Step 2: Let me identify Harper Lake.

      There are multiple Harper Lakes in the United States. I need to determine which
      Harper Lake is being referenced. The most notable Harper Lakes are in states

      states.

      Even if there is a smaller Harper Lake in New Hampshire that I''m not familiar

      Lewis Hills is a mountain range located on the western coast of Newfoundland,
      Canada.


      Step 2: I need to identify where Horse Thief Lake is located.

      Horse Thief Lake is located in South Dakota, USA, near Mount Rushmore in the

      Newfoundland, Canada is located in eastern Canada on the Atlantic coast. South
      Dakota is located in the central United States.


      Step 4: Determine which is further west.

      South Dakota is significantly west of Newfoundland. This means that Horse Thief
      Lake is west of Lewis Hills, not the other way around.


      NO, Lewis Hills is not located west of Horse Thief Lake. Lewis Hills is east

      Step 1: Identify what Sermilik is and its location.

      Sermilik (or Sermilik Fjord) is located in Greenland, which is in the northeastern
      part of North America. Specifically, it''s on the southeastern coast of Greenland.


      Step 2: Identify where the Central Oregon Coast Range is located.

      The Central Oregon Coast Range is a mountain range in western Oregon, United
      States, running along the Pacific coast.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Greenland is located in the eastern part of North America

      - Oregon is located in the western United States

      - The Central Oregon Coast Range is on the western edge of Oregon, near the
      Pacific Ocean


      Step 4: Determine their positions relative to each other on a global map.

      Moving west from Oregon would take you across the Pacific Ocean toward Asia,
      not toward Greenland. Greenland is actually to the east of Oregon if you look

      Chicabal Lake is a crater lake located in Guatemala, Central America. It''s
      situated in the western highlands of Guatemala.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Moberly Lake (British Columbia).

      Moberly Lake is located in northeastern British Columbia, Canada.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Guatemala is in Central America, which is east of the Pacific Ocean and south
      of North America.

      - British Columbia is the westernmost province of Canada.

      - When comparing longitudinal positions, Guatemala (including Chicabal Lake)
      is located east of British Columbia (including Moberly Lake).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Chicabal Lake is in Guatemala (Central America) and Moberly Lake is in
      British Columbia (western Canada), Chicabal Lake is east of Moberly Lake, not
      west.


      NO, Chicabal Lake is not located west of Moberly Lake (British Columbia).'

      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify where the Celtic Sea is located. The Celtic Sea
      is a body of water in the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland and
      extending to the southwest of Great Britain.


      2) Next, I need to identify where Calabogie Lake is located. Calabogie Lake
      is in Ontario, Canada, specifically in eastern Ontario.


      3) Now I need to determine their relative positions. The Celtic Sea is located
      in Europe (off the western coast of Europe), while Calabogie Lake is in eastern
      Canada (North America).


      4) When comparing east-west positions globally, locations in Europe are generally
      east of locations in North America, since moving west from North America crosses
      the Pacific Ocean to reach Asia, and then further west to reach Europe.

      - The Celtic Sea is located off the south coast of Ireland, between Ireland
      and Great Britain, in the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Calabogie Lake is located in Ontario, Canada, in North America.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions using cardinal directions.
