      1. **Identify the Location of Heavenly Lake of Tianshan**: Heavenly Lake, also
      known as Tian Chi, is situated in the Tianshan mountain range in Xinjiang, China.


      2. **Locate the Unnamed Volcano (Ibugos)**: The Ibugos volcano is located in
      the Philippines, specifically on the island of Mindanao.


      3. **Determine the Relative Positions**: Heavenly Lake of Tianshan is in Central
      Asia (China), while the Ibugos volcano is in Southeast Asia (Philippines). Given
      that these two locations are in different regions of the world, we can conclude
      that they cannot be positioned in relation to one another in the way the question
      suggests.


      4. **Evaluate the Directions**: Since the Ibugos volcano is in the Philippines,
      it is not geographically west of Heavenly Lake of Tianshan, as it is located
      to the southeast of it.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      NO'

      1. **Heavenly Lake of Tianshan**: This lake is situated in the Tianshan mountain
      range, which is primarily located in Xinjiang, China. It is known for its stunning
      scenery and is a popular tourist destination.


      2. **Unnamed Volcano (Ibugos)**: The location of this volcano needs to be identified.
      If it is not widely known, we would generally need to look up its coordinates
      or geographical position.


      3. **Relative Locations**: Once we have the location of the Ibugos volcano,
      we can determine its position relative to Heavenly Lake. If it lies to the west
      of the lake, the answer would be YES; if it lies to the east, south, or north,
      the answer would be NO.


      Since I do not have access to real-time data or specific coordinates for Ibugos,
      I can''t definitively conclude its position relative to Heavenly Lake.


      Based on the reasoning steps and the lack of specific information, I cannot
      confidently provide a YES or NO answer without further data. However, if we
      assume that Ibugos is known and its location is west of Heavenly Lake, the answer
      would be YES.


      For the purpose of this exercise, my final answer is:


      **NO** (as I cannot confirm its location without additional data).'

      India.

      - **Alexandria, Egypt** (Lake Mariout) is situated in the northern part of Africa.

      - Kurukshetra is to the east of Alexandria, given that India is located east
      of Egypt on the globe.


      Finally, when we consider the relative positions:


      - Since Brahma Sarovar (Kurukshetra) is to the east of Lake Mariout (Alexandria),
      it cannot be west of it.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:


      **NO**.'

      United States. New York is east of Washington State.


      4. **Evaluate the westward position**: For Lake Oscawana to be west of Image
      Lake, it would need to be positioned further west in relation to Image Lake.
      However, since New York is east of Washington, Lake Oscawana cannot be west
      of Image Lake.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is NO.'
