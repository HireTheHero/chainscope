      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Cobequid Bay is located in Nova Scotia, Canada, on the eastern coast

      - Ogilvie Mountains are located in Yukon Territory, in northwestern Canada


      2. To determine relative positions, I''ll consider their locations:

      - Cobequid Bay is near the Atlantic Ocean, in eastern Canada

      - Ogilvie Mountains are near Alaska, in western Canada


      3. When comparing east-west positions:

      - Everything in Nova Scotia is east of Yukon Territory

      - Therefore, Cobequid Bay must be east of the Ogilvie Mountains


      4. Final check:

      - Since Cobequid Bay is east, not west, of the Ogilvie Mountains, the answer
      is no


      NO'

      - Minnesota is much further east, roughly in the middle of the country


      4. Therefore, Misquah Hills is EAST of Willapa Bay, not west of it.
