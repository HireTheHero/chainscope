      - Heavenly Lake (Tianchi) is located in the Tianshan Mountains

      - Specifically, it''s in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China

      NO


      The answer is NO because I do not have sufficient verified information to confirm

    9bf5ae06-63ef-4519-9f4a-5711c2b7eefe: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Lough Derg:

      - Lough Derg is actually located in County Clare, Ireland, not County Donegal

      - It is a large lake in the Shannon River system in western Ireland


      2. Next, I''ll consider Ahmic Lake:

      - Ahmic Lake is located in Ontario, Canada

      - It is in the Parry Sound District of Ontario


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Lough Derg is in Ireland (Europe)

      - Ahmic Lake is in Canada (North America)

      - These are on different continents, thousands of miles apart


      4. Determining west/east positioning:

      - Since they are on different continents, the concept of "west of" becomes complex

      - But generally, Ireland is east of Canada


      5. Conclusion:

      - Lough Derg is NOT west of Ahmic Lake


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      lakes in the Sindhupalchok District of Nepal.


      2. Glyderau is a mountain range located in Snowdonia National Park in Wales,

      4. They are thousands of miles apart, with an entire continent (Europe) and
      several countries separating them.

      1. First, Doo Lough is a lake located in County Mayo, Ireland. It''s in the
      western part of Ireland.


      2. Shadow Mountain Lake is located in Colorado, United States.


      3. These two locations are on different continents - Ireland and North America.


      4. Since they are on different continents, their geographical positioning relative

    e847a46b-8676-44d0-b560-f83c076714be: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate Paruthipattu Lake:

      - Paruthipattu Lake is located in Tamil Nadu, India

      - It is near Chennai in southern India


      2. Next, let''s locate Saimaa:

      - Saimaa is a large lake located in Finland

      - It is in the southeastern part of Finland


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Paruthipattu Lake is in southern India

      - Saimaa is in southeastern Finland

      - These locations are very far apart, on different continents


      4. To determine west/east relationship:

      - Paruthipattu Lake is east of Saimaa

      - The lake in India is much further east compared to the lake in Finland


      5. The specific question asks: "Is Paruthipattu Lake located west of Saimaa?"

      - Since Paruthipattu Lake is east of Saimaa, the answer is NOT west


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
