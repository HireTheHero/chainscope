      1. First, I''ll locate Kellyville, OK on a map

      - Kellyville is in Creek County, Oklahoma

      - It is located northwest of Tulsa


      2. Next, I''ll locate Meadows Place, TX on a map

      - Meadows Place is in Fort Bend County, Texas

      - It is located southwest of Houston


      3. Now I''ll compare their geographical positions

      - Kellyville is north of Tulsa, in northern Oklahoma

      - Meadows Place is in southern Texas, near Houston


      4. Comparing their relative positions

      - Kellyville is significantly north of Meadows Place

      - Meadows Place is much further south


      5. Conclusion: Kellyville, OK is NOT located south of Meadows Place, TX
