      - Rich Creek, VA is in Virginia (VA), which is a state in the eastern United
      States.

      - Folly Beach, SC is in South Carolina (SC), which is also a state in the eastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Let me consider the relative geographic positions of Virginia and South
      Carolina.

      - Virginia is north of South Carolina on the US east coast.

      - States on the US east coast are generally arranged from north to south as:
      Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New
      Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
      Florida.


      Step 3: Since Rich Creek is in Virginia, and Virginia is north of South Carolina
      (where Folly Beach is located), Rich Creek must be north of Folly Beach.


      Step 4: The question asks if Rich Creek is south of Folly Beach, which is the
      opposite of what I determined.

      - Even though Rich Creek is in southwestern Virginia, Virginia as a whole is
      north of South Carolina

      - Folly Beach being on the southern coast of SC places it very far south in
      the state

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Prior Lake is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the northern part of the US.

      - Lecompton is in Kansas (KS), which is in the central part of the US.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship of these states.

      - Minnesota borders Canada and is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous
      US.

      - Kansas is several states south of Minnesota.


      Step 3: Check specific locations.

      - Minnesota is entirely north of Kansas on a map.

      - Any city in Minnesota, including Prior Lake, would be north of any city in
      Kansas, including Lecompton.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Prior Lake is in Minnesota (north) and Lecompton is in Kansas (south),
      Prior Lake cannot be south of Lecompton.

      - Lecompton, KS is in Kansas, which is in the central part of the United States.


      Step 2: Let me consider their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Minnesota is located north of Kansas in the United States.

      Step 3: Check if there are any unusual geographic arrangements that might make
      this particular comparison different from the general state positions.

      - Prior Lake is in the southern part of Minnesota, but Minnesota''s southern

      - Lecompton is in Kansas, and even if it''s in the northern part of Kansas,

      - Lecompton, Kansas is in the central part of the US, in Kansas which is south
      of Nebraska.


      Step 2: Let me consider the north-south positioning.

      - Minnesota is located north of Kansas in the United States.

      - Therefore, cities in Minnesota would generally be north of cities in Kansas.


      Step 3: Check if there might be any unusual geographic positioning.

      - While specific cities might sometimes have surprising relative positions,
      Minnesota is entirely north of Kansas with no overlap in latitude.

      - Prior Lake is in the southern half of Minnesota, but even southern Minnesota
      is still north of northern Kansas.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geographic knowledge.

      - Since Prior Lake is in Minnesota and Lecompton is in Kansas, and Minnesota

      - Georgia (GA) is a state in the southeastern United States.

      - Generally, Georgia is located south of Kentucky.


      Step 2: Let me consider the specific cities.

      - Cynthiana is in Kentucky, which is the more northern state.

      - Cuthbert is in Georgia, which is the more southern state.


      Step 3: Since Georgia is south of Kentucky, and Cynthiana is in Kentucky while
      Cuthbert is in Georgia, Cynthiana must be north of Cuthbert (not south).

      Step 1: Consider the general geographic locations of Kentucky and Georgia within
      the United States.

      - Kentucky is a state in the upper South/lower Midwest region.

      - Georgia is a state in the Deep South, bordering Florida.


      Step 2: Compare the latitudes of these states.

      - Kentucky is generally north of Georgia.

      - Georgia is one of the southernmost states (excluding Florida).


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of these cities within their states.

      - Cynthiana is in northern Kentucky.

      - Cuthbert is in southwestern Georgia.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Even though Cynthiana might be in southern Kentucky, Kentucky as a whole is
      north of Georgia.

      - Cuthbert being in Georgia means it''s significantly further south than any

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both cities.

      - Chillicothe, OH is in Ohio, which is in the northern United States.

      - Oakboro, NC is in North Carolina, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Let me consider their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Ohio is generally north of North Carolina.

      - Cities in Ohio would typically be north of cities in North Carolina.


      Step 3: Let me verify this with geographical knowledge.

      - Ohio shares a border with Canada to its north and Kentucky to its south.

      - North Carolina is much further south, bordering South Carolina and Georgia.

      - All of Ohio is north of all of North Carolina on a map of the United States.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on these facts.

      - Since Chillicothe is in Ohio and Oakboro is in North Carolina, and Ohio is
      entirely north of North Carolina, Chillicothe must be north of Oakboro.

      - If Chillicothe is north of Oakboro, then it cannot be south of Oakboro.
