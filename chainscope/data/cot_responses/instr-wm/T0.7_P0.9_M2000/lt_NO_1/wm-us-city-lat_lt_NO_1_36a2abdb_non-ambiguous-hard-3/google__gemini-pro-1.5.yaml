      4. **Specific locations within the states:** While Iowa is generally north of
      Missouri, it''s possible for a city in southern Iowa to be south of a city in
      northern Missouri.  We need to verify the specific latitudes.

      5. **Research (or recall general knowledge):** Southeastern Iowa dips down quite
      a bit south. Portageville is in the Missouri Bootheel, the very southern tip
      of the state.


      Therefore, Columbus Junction, IA is likely NORTH of Portageville, MO.
