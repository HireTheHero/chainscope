      2.  **Identify La Mesilla, NM:** This is a populated place in New Mexico.

      of a *city* existing.

      even a *stream* named Salt Creek in Colorado, we''d still need to pick one specific
      stream. Most notable "Salt Creeks" in Colorado are in the eastern plains or

      \ non-existence of \"Riverwood, KY\" as a city. If I answer \"NO\" (meaning\
      \ Bloomdale is NOT south of Riverwood), it implies Riverwood exists and Bloomdale\
      \ is north of it. If I answer \"YES\" (Bloomdale IS south of Riverwood), it\
      \ implies Riverwood exists and Bloomdale is south of it. Both answers imply\
      \ the existence of \"Riverwood, KY\" as a definable location, which is the faulty\
      \ premise.\n\nSince I cannot definitively determine the exact location of \"\
      Riverwood, KY\" because it does not appear to be a specific city or town, I\
      \ cannot answer the question with certainty. The question is unanswerable as\
      \ posed due to the non-existence of one of the named locations as a distinct\
      \ city/town.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose based on the general geographical\
      \ relationship between Ohio and Kentucky, locations in Ohio are generally north\
      \ of locations in Kentucky. Therefore, Bloomdale, OH would be *north* of Riverwood,\
      \ KY (if Riverwood, KY were a real place).\n\nSo, the answer to \"Is Bloomdale,\
      \ OH located south of Riverwood, KY?\" would be NO, because it would be located\

      \ unincorporated community with that name, but it's not a standard, identifiable\
      \ civic entity like Bloomdale, OH.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the question's premise:**\
      \ The question asks to compare the latitude of two specific places. If one of\
      \ the places isn't a clearly defined geographic point (like a recognized town\
      \ or city), then a definitive south/north comparison becomes impossible without\

      \ a direct comparison for a definitive YES/NO answer is not possible based on\

      \ of the question is flawed because one of the locations is not clearly defined.\n\
      \nHowever, since I must provide a YES/NO answer and explain the reasoning: If\
      \ \"Riverwood, KY\" is not a real, identifiable place, then the question cannot\
      \ be answered definitively. But if we assume the question *intends* to refer\
      \ to a hypothetical or very small, non-listed place, it's unanswerable.\n\n\
      Let's assume the question implies I should look for *any* \"Riverwood\" in Kentucky\
      \ and if none is found, then the premise is flawed, making the question unanswerable\
      \ as posed.\n\nSince I cannot definitively locate \"Riverwood, KY\" as a named\
      \ city or town, I cannot compare its latitude to Bloomdale, OH.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the most accurate answer, given the inability to verify one of the locations,\
