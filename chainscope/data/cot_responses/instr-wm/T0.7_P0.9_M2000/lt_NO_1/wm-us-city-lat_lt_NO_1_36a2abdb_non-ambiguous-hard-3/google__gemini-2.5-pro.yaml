      2.  Next, we need to determine the latitude of Pearlington, Mississippi. Pearlington,\
      \ MS is at a latitude of approximately 30.25\xB0 N.\n3.  Finally, we compare\
      \ the two latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, a higher latitude number means\
      \ a location is farther north. Since 36.21 is a higher number than 30.25, Norfork,\
      \ AR is located north of Pearlington, MS.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question\

      \nI've completed the geographical analysis by comparing the latitudes. I initially\
      \ identified the question and located the points in question. Finding their\
      \ latitudes, I compared them, leading me to the conclusion that East Bangor,\
      \ PA is north of Ettrick, VA. My reasoning is solid, and I'm ready to present\
      \ my step-by-step findings and a clear \"No\" answer.\n\n\n</think>Here is the\
      \ step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Find the location of East Bangor, PA:** East\
      \ Bangor is a borough in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. Its approximate latitude\
      \ is 40.88\xB0 N.\n2.  **Find the location of Ettrick, VA:** Ettrick is a census-designated\
      \ place in Chesterfield County, Virginia. Its approximate latitude is 37.24\xB0\
      \ N.\n3.  **Compare the latitudes:** Latitude measures how far north or south\
      \ a location is. A higher latitude number means a location is farther north.\
      \ Since 40.88\xB0 N is a higher latitude than 37.24\xB0 N, East Bangor, PA is\
      \ located north of Ettrick, VA.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"\
      Is East Bangor, PA located south of Ettrick, VA?\" is:\n\nNO"

      \ the latitude of Ettrick, Virginia. Ettrick, VA is located at approximately\
      \ 37.23\xB0 N latitude.\n3.  To determine if one location is south of another,\
      \ we compare their latitudes. The location with the smaller latitude number\
      \ is further south.\n4.  Comparing the two, 40.87\xB0 N (East Bangor) is a higher\
      \ latitude than 37.23\xB0 N (Ettrick). This means East Bangor, PA is located\
      \ north of Ettrick, VA.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is East Bangor,\
