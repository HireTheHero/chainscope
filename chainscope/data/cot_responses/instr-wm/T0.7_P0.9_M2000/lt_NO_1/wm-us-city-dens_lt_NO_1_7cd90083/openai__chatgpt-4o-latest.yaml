      ### Step 1: Find Population and Land Area for Herculaneum, MO

      - Herculaneum, Missouri had a population of approximately **4,400** (as of the

      - Its land area is about **4.07 square miles**.

      - Greenwich, Ohio had a population of approximately **1,500** (as of the 2020

      The question asks about population density, which is the number of people per
      unit of area.


      Step 2: Identify the locations:

      - **Hayden Lake, ID** is a small city in Idaho.

      - **Level Green, PA** is a census-designated place in Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Find population and area data:

      - **Hayden Lake, ID**: According to recent census data, it has a population

      - Hayden Lake: **~1,000 people per square mile**

      - Level Green: **~1,727 people per square mile**

    a1f50fc7-a914-4e0f-b1f7-13dc703dffdc: 'To determine whether Lowell, MA is less
      densely populated than North Bellmore, NY, we need to compare their population
      densities. Population density is calculated as:


      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Land Area}}

      \]


      ### Step 1: Find the population and land area of Lowell, MA.

      - **Population:** Approximately 115,000 (as of recent estimates).

      - **Land Area:** About 13.8 square miles.


      \[

      \text{Density of Lowell} = \frac{115,000}{13.8} \approx 8,333 \text{ people
      per square mile}.

      \]


      ### Step 2: Find the population and land area of North Bellmore, NY.

      - **Population:** Approximately 19,000.

      - **Land Area:** About 3.0 square miles.


      \[

      \text{Density of North Bellmore} = \frac{19,000}{3.0} \approx 6,333 \text{ people
      per square mile}.

      \]


      ### Step 3: Compare the densities.

      - Lowell: **8,333 people per square mile**.

      - North Bellmore: **6,333 people per square mile**.

      - **Lowell has a higher population density than North Bellmore.**


      ### Step 4: Answer the question.

      Since the question asks if Lowell, MA is **less** densely populated than North
      Bellmore, NY, and we found that Lowell is actually **more** densely populated,
      the answer is:


      **NO.**'
