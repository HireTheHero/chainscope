      ### Step 1: Research Cathcart, WA

      Cathcart is a census-designated place in Snohomish County, Washington. Generally,
      Washington state has areas with both high and low population densities, but
      specifics about Cathcart''s population density would need to be checked from
      recent census data or local statistics.


      ### Step 2: Research MacArthur, WV

      MacArthur is a census-designated place in Raleigh County, West Virginia. West
      Virginia is known for having rural areas with relatively low population densities
      compared to urban areas.


      ### Step 3: Compare Population Densities

      - **Cathcart, WA:** Needs specific data from census reports, but generally speaking,
      parts of Washington near urban centers like Seattle may have higher densities.

      - **MacArthur, WV:** Likely has a lower population density based on West Virginia''s
      general demographic and geographic characteristics.


      ### Conclusion

      Without the specific recent census data at hand, a general prediction can be
      made based on the characteristics of the states and the typical nature of census-designated
      places in these areas.


      If Cathcart, WA is closer to a major urban center and has experienced growth,
      it might have higher density than a rural area like MacArthur, WV.

      is less densely populated than Francesville, IN, we need to consider the population
      density of both locations. Population density is typically measured as the number
      of people per square mile.


      1. **Fairfax Station, VA**: Fairfax Station is an unincorporated community in
      Fairfax County, Virginia. As it is not a census-designated place, specific population
      density data might not be readily available. However, Fairfax County is generally
      suburban with relatively low population density compared to urban centers.


      2. **Francesville, IN**: Francesville is a small town in Pulaski County, Indiana.
      Its population density can be calculated using its population and land area,
      which are typically available from census data.


      3. **Comparison**: Generally, suburban areas like Fairfax Station tend to have
      lower population densities than small towns, depending on the specific characteristics
      of the towns and surrounding areas.


      To give a definitive answer, one would need to look up the most recent population
      and land area data for both Fairfax Station and Francesville. However, given
      the suburban nature of Fairfax Station and the fact that Francesville is a small
      town, Fairfax Station is likely to be less densely populated, as small towns
      can sometimes have a higher density due to their smaller size but concentrated
      population.


      Thus, the answer is: **YES**, Fairfax Station, VA is likely less densely populated
      than Francesville, IN.'

      population densities of both locations. Population density is typically measured
      as the number of people per square mile.


      1. **Identify Fairfax Station, VA:** Fairfax Station is an unincorporated community
      in Fairfax County, Virginia. Being an unincorporated area, it doesn''t have
      a formally defined population density like incorporated cities or towns. However,
      Fairfax County is known for its suburban character, with many residential areas
      and a lower population density compared to urban centers.


      2. **Identify Francesville, IN:** Francesville is a small town in Pulaski County,
      Indiana. Being a small town, it likely has a lower population density compared
      to larger urban areas, but it can still vary significantly based on the size
      of the town and its population.


      3. **Assess Fairfax Station, VA population density:** Fairfax Station, being
      part of Fairfax County, generally has a suburban density. Fairfax County, overall,
      has a moderate population density, but specific areas like Fairfax Station could
      be less densely populated due to large residential lots and rural characteristics.


      4. **Assess Francesville, IN population density:** Francesville, as a small
      town, may have a low population density, often characterized by small populations
      spread over a limited area.


      Given the general characteristics of both places:

      - Fairfax Station is likely to be less densely populated than urban parts of
      Fairfax County due to its suburban and rural nature.

      - Francesville, being a small town in Indiana, likely has a low population density
      typical of small Midwestern towns.


      After considering these aspects, Fairfax Station, VA, with its suburban and
      semi-rural characteristics, is likely to have a lower population density than
      Francesville, IN, which is a small town.


      Therefore, the answer is YES, Fairfax Station, VA is less densely populated

      **Step 1: Gather data for Chain Lake, WA**

      - Chain Lake is a census-designated place in Washington. You would need its
      population and land area to calculate the population density.


      **Step 2: Gather data for Foxfield, CO**

      - Foxfield is a town in Colorado. Similarly, you need its population and land
      area.

      - Population density for each location is calculated using the formula: Population
      Density = Population / Land Area.


      **Step 4: Compare the population densities**

      - Once you have the population densities, compare them to see which is lower.

      the population density of both Lake Wisconsin, WI, and Terre du Lac, MO, and
      compare them. Population density is typically calculated by dividing the population
      by the area (usually in square miles).


      1. **Lake Wisconsin, WI**: Lake Wisconsin is not an incorporated city or town;
      it is primarily known as a lake and the surrounding area in Wisconsin. The area
      around Lake Wisconsin includes parts of the towns of Lodi and West Point in
      Columbia County and Merrimac in Sauk County. Therefore, it might be challenging
      to define a specific population density for Lake Wisconsin without a specific
      city or town.


      2. **Terre du Lac, MO**: Terre du Lac is a private, planned community located
      in Missouri. It is recognized as a census-designated place (CDP), which means
      it has defined boundaries for statistical purposes. The population and area
      are typically recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau, which allows us to calculate
      its population density.


      Given that Lake Wisconsin is not a defined city or town and does not have a
      specific population density, while Terre du Lac, MO, does have defined boundaries
      and population data, it is difficult to make a direct comparison.


      Therefore, the question does not have a straightforward YES or NO answer based
      on the available information about Lake Wisconsin. If more specific criteria
      or locations were provided around Lake Wisconsin, a comparison could potentially
      be made.'

      1. **Obtain population data**: We need to find the population figures for both
      Wimauma and Semmes.


      2. **Obtain area data**: We also need the land area for each location to calculate
      density.


      3. **Calculate population density**: Divide the population by the land area
      for both locations to get their respective population densities.


      4. **Compare the densities**: Finally, compare the two densities to determine
      which location is less densely populated.


      Due to the nature of this question, you would need access to recent and reliable
      demographic and geographic data sources to perform these calculations accurately.
      However, based on general knowledge:


      - Wimauma, FL, is an unincorporated community in Hillsborough County, known
      for its rural characteristics, but recent development might have increased its
      population density.

      - Semmes, AL, is a city in Mobile County, which also has a suburban and semi-rural
      character.


      Typically, without exact figures, the final answer would be speculative. But
      considering the characteristics and assuming typical densities, Wimauma, FL,
      is likely to be less densely populated than Semmes, AL, due to its larger rural
      areas and recent development trends.


      However, without current specific data, this remains an educated guess. If you
      have access to the latest census or local government data, you could verify
      these densities more precisely.

      less densely populated than Locust Fork, AL, we need to compare their population
      densities. Population density is typically measured as the number of people
      per square mile or square kilometer.


      ### Step 1: Obtain Population and Area Data

      For both Ansonville, NC and Locust Fork, AL, we need to find the most recent
      data on:

      - Total population

      - Land area in square miles (or square kilometers)


      ### Step 2: Calculate Population Density

      For each town, calculate the population density using the formula:

      \[ \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Total Population}}{\text{Land Area}}
      \]


      ### Step 3: Compare Densities

      Compare the calculated population densities of the two towns to determine which
      one is less densely populated.


      ### Example Calculation

      Let''s assume hypothetical values for illustration purposes:

      - Ansonville, NC: 600 people, 1 square mile

      - Locust Fork, AL: 1,200 people, 2 square miles

      densely populated than Holiday Hills, IL, we need to compare the population
      densities of the two locations. Here''s how we can approach this:


      1. **Find Population and Area Data**: Look up the population and land area for
      both Fort Lawn, SC, and Holiday Hills, IL. This information can typically be
      found through census data or other demographic resources.


      2. **Calculate Population Density**: Population density is calculated by dividing

      3. **Compare the Densities**: Once we have the population densities for both
      locations, we compare them to determine which one is less densely populated.


      Now, let''s assume we have the necessary data:


      - **Fort Lawn, SC**: Suppose it has a population of 895 and an area of 1.9 square
      miles. The population density would be approximately 471 people per square mile.


      - **Holiday Hills, IL**: Suppose it has a population of 610 and an area of 0.31
      square miles. The population density would be approximately 1,968 people per
      square mile.


      Comparing these densities:


      - Fort Lawn, SC: 471 people per square mile

      - Holiday Hills, IL: 1,968 people per square mile


      Based on this hypothetical data, Fort Lawn, SC is less densely populated than
