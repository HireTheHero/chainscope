      1. First, I''ll need to find the population density of River Edge, NJ and Bothell
      East, WA.


      2. For River Edge, NJ:

      - Total area: About 2.6 square miles

      - Population (as of 2020 census): Around 11,600

      - Population density: 11,600 / 2.6 = approximately 4,462 people per square mile


      3. For Bothell East, WA:

      - I''ll need to verify the specific population and area data

      - Without precise local data, I cannot confidently calculate its exact population
      density


      4. Without being able to definitively calculate Bothell East''s population density,
      I cannot make a conclusive comparison.


      5. Given the lack of complete information, I cannot confidently answer whether
      River Edge, NJ is less densely populated than Bothell East, WA.

    ee130141-327b-4149-9099-50930ebb5fc3: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to find the population and land area of both Calimesa,
      CA and Bogart, GA to calculate their population densities.


      2. Calimesa, CA:

      - Population (as of 2020 census): Around 2,100

      - Land area: Approximately 6.5 square miles

      - Population density: About 323 people per square mile


      3. Bogart, GA:

      - Population (as of 2020 census): Around 1,200

      - Land area: Approximately 1.5 square miles

      - Population density: About 800 people per square mile


      4. Comparing the population densities:

      - Calimesa: 323 people per square mile

      - Bogart: 800 people per square mile


      5. Since Bogart has a higher population density, Calimesa is less densely populated.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

    8720d544-ab3e-438c-8815-c6527e266d78: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll check the population and area of Dover Plains, NY

      - Dover Plains is a small hamlet in Dutchess County, NY

      - Its population is very small, likely under 1,000 people

      - The area is also quite small


      2. Next, I''ll check Coos Bay, OR

      - Coos Bay is an actual city in Oregon

      - It has a population of around 16,000 people

      - It covers a larger geographic area


      3. Population density calculation requires population divided by land area

      - Dover Plains will have very few people spread over a small area

      - Coos Bay has more people spread over a larger area


      4. Comparing the two

      - Dover Plains will likely have a lower population density

      - Coos Bay, being an established city, will have a higher population density


      5. Conclusion reasoning:

      - Coos Bay is more densely populated than the small hamlet of Dover Plains


      Therefore, my answer is: NO (Dover Plains is NOT less densely populated than
      Coos Bay)'

      1. First, I''ll need to find the population and land area of both Hayden Lake,
      ID and Level Green, PA.


      2. Hayden Lake, ID:

      - Located in Kootenai County, Idaho

      - According to the 2020 census, it has around 1,200 residents

      - Total land area is approximately 1.5 square miles


      3. Level Green, PA:

      - Located in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania

      - Has a population of around 300-400 residents

      - Total land area is approximately 0.5 square miles


      4. To calculate population density, I''ll divide population by land area:

      - Hayden Lake: ~1,200 / 1.5 = 800 people per square mile

      - Level Green: ~350 / 0.5 = 700 people per square mile


      5. Comparing the two:

      - Hayden Lake has a slightly higher population density (800 vs 700 people per
      square mile)


      6. The question asks: Is Hayden Lake less densely populated than Level Green?

      1. First, I''ll need to find the population and area of Munhall, PA

      - Munhall is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania

      - Its population is around 11,400

      - Its area is approximately 1.4 square miles


      2. Next, I''ll find the population and area of Woodland Beach, MI

      - Woodland Beach is an unincorporated community in Michigan

      - Detailed population data is harder to find

      - It appears to be a very small community in Huron County


      3. To calculate population density, I would divide population by area

      - Munhall''s density: 11,400 / 1.4 = approximately 8,143 people per square mile

      - Woodland Beach''s exact density is uncertain, but it seems very low


      4. Comparing the two:

      - Munhall appears to be much more densely populated

      - Woodland Beach looks like a very sparse, rural community


      5. Therefore, Munhall is NOT less densely populated than Woodland Beach

      5. For Stryker, OH: 321 / 0.33 = 973 people per square mile


      6. For Lake Dalecarlia, IN: Without precise data, but likely lower population
      and possibly similar small area, the density would probably be lower than Stryker.


      7. Therefore, Lake Dalecarlia, IN is likely less densely populated than Stryker,
      OH.

      1. First, I''ll find the population of McCordsville, IN:

      - McCordsville is a small town in Indiana

      - Its population is around 1,500-2,000 people

      - Its total area is approximately 1-2 square miles


      2. Next, I''ll find the population of Juniata, NE:

      - Juniata is a small town in Nebraska

      - Its population is around 500-700 people

      - Its total area is also approximately 1-2 square miles


      3. To determine population density, I''ll divide population by area:

      - McCordsville density: ~1,000 people per square mile

      - Juniata density: ~500 people per square mile


      4. Comparing the densities:

      - McCordsville has a higher population density than Juniata

      - This means Juniata is LESS densely populated than McCordsville


      Therefore, the answer is: NO (McCordsville is NOT less densely populated than
      Juniata)'
