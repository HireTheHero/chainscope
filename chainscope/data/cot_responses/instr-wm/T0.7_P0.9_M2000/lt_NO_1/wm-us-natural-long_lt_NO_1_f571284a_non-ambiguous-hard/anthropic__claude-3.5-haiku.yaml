      1. First, locate Absaroka Range, WY:

      - The Absaroka Range is located in northwestern Wyoming

      - It is part of the Rocky Mountains

      - It is situated east of Yellowstone National Park


      2. Next, locate Calapooya Mountains, OR:

      - The Calapooya Mountains are located in western Oregon

      - They are part of the Cascade Range

      - They are west of the Cascade Range''s main line


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Absaroka Range is in Wyoming (eastern part of the western US)

      - Calapooya Mountains are in Oregon (western part of the US)

      - Wyoming is east of Oregon


      4. Determine relative positioning:

      - Since Absaroka Range is in Wyoming (east) and Calapooya Mountains are in Oregon
      (west), the Absaroka Range is EAST of the Calapooya Mountains


      5. Answer the specific question: "Is Absaroka Range, WY located west of Calapooya

      - Sevier Lake is located in western Utah, in Juab County


      3. Now I''ll compare their relative positions

      - Texas is southeast of Utah

      - Medina Lake is in south-central Texas

      - Sevier Lake is in western Utah


      4. Comparing their geographical positions

      - Medina Lake would be east and southeast of Sevier Lake


      5. Therefore, Medina Lake is NOT west of Sevier Lake


      The answer is: NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Lizard Pond in New York

      2. Then, I''ll locate Shanty Hollow Lake in Kentucky

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: Lizard Pond is located in the Adirondack region of New York, which is
      in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Shanty Hollow Lake is located in Kentucky, which is in the southeastern
      part of the United States.


      Step 3: Comparing their locations:

      - New York is east of Kentucky

      - Lizard Pond is in eastern New York

      - Shanty Hollow Lake is in western Kentucky


      Since Lizard Pond is east of Shanty Hollow Lake, it is NOT west of it.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      - Minnesota is in the north-central part of the US


      4. Determining their relative positions

      - Lake of the Woods is much further west than Lake Linville

      - Therefore, Lake Linville is east of Lake of the Woods

      1. First, let''s locate Sangre de Cristo Mountains:

      - These mountains are located in southern Colorado

      - They are in the southeastern part of Colorado


      2. Next, let''s locate Wallowa Lake:

      - Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon

      - It is in the northeastern corner of Oregon


      3. Comparing their geographic positions:

      - Colorado is east of Oregon

      - Sangre de Cristo Mountains are in southeastern Colorado

      - Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon


      4. Determining relative position:

      - Since Colorado is entirely east of Oregon, any location in Colorado will be
      east of any location in Oregon

      - Therefore, Sangre de Cristo Mountains will be east of Wallowa Lake


      5. Answering the specific question:

      - Is Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO located west of Wallowa Lake, OR?

      - No, it is located east of Wallowa Lake
