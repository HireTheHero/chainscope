      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: The Hideout Inn is located in Illinois

      Step 2: Lac qui Parle is a county and lake in western Minnesota

      Step 3: Comparing their geographic positions:

      - Illinois is east of Minnesota

      - So The Hideout Inn (in IL) would be east of Lac qui Parle (in MN)


      Therefore, The Hideout Inn is NOT west of Lac qui Parle.
