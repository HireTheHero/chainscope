    f6ec1ba4-de71-4c26-817e-38c779605152: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Calvin University in Michigan

      - Calvin University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan

      - Grand Rapids is in western Michigan


      2. Next, I''ll locate Stevens Institute of Technology

      - Stevens Institute is located in Hoboken, New Jersey

      - Hoboken is in northeastern New Jersey


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Grand Rapids, MI is in the Midwest region

      - Hoboken, NJ is in the Northeast region

      - Grand Rapids is actually north of Hoboken


      4. Therefore, Calvin University is NOT south of Stevens Institute of Technology.

      1. First, I''ll locate University of Mary in North Dakota

      - University of Mary is in Bismarck, North Dakota


      2. Next, I''ll locate Viterbo University in Wisconsin

      - Viterbo University is in La Crosse, Wisconsin


      3. Check their relative geographic positions

      - Bismarck, ND is located west of La Crosse, WI

      - More importantly, Bismarck is significantly north of La Crosse


      4. So is University of Mary south of Viterbo University?

      - No, University of Mary is actually north of Viterbo University
