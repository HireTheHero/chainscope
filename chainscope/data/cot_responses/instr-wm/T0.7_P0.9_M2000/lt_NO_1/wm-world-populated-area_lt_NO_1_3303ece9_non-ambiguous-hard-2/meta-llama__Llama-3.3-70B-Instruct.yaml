      \ we can directly compare. Yunnan has about 394,000 square kilometers, while\
      \ Wagoner County has about 1,532 square kilometers.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Yunnan\

      \ the area of Yunnan, a province in China, with the area of Wagoner County,\
      \ Oklahoma, in the United States. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the area\
      \ of Yunnan Province, China**: Yunnan Province covers an area of approximately\
      \ 394,000 square kilometers (152,000 sq mi).\n\n2. **Identify the area of Wagoner\
      \ County, Oklahoma, USA**: Wagoner County covers an area of approximately 1,532\
      \ square kilometers (592 sq mi).\n\n3. **Compare the areas**: \n   - The area\
      \ of Yunnan Province is 394,000 square kilometers.\n   - The area of Wagoner\
      \ County is 1,532 square kilometers.\n   \n4. **Conclusion**: Since 1,532 square\
      \ kilometers (the area of Wagoner County) is less than 394,000 square kilometers\
      \ (the area of Yunnan Province), Yunnan has a larger area than Wagoner County,\
