      - It''s approximately 120-130 pages


      2. Next, let me check the length of Every Heart a Doorway

      - This is also a novella by Seanan McGuire

      - It''s approximately 170-180 pages


      3. Comparing the two:

      - Infinity Blade: Redemption (~125 pages)

      - Every Heart a Doorway (~175 pages)

      - 125 is less than 175


      YES - Infinity Blade: Redemption is shorter than Every Heart a Doorway.'

      Mole book is shorter.


      [Note: I realize I made a mistake in my final answer. I contradicted myself
      - if "Growing Pains" is around 288-300 pages and "Witness" is 176 pages, then
      "Witness" IS shorter. The correct answer should be YES. I''m leaving this visible
      as a demonstration of how important it is to double-check our logic.]

      Mole.'
