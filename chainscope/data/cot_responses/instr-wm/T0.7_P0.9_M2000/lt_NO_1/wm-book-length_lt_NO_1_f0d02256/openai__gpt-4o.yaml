      - "Splinter of the Mind''s Eye" is a science fiction novel published in 1978.

      edition.

      to consider the page or word count of each book.


      1. **The Whalestoe Letters**: This book is a companion piece to Mark Z. Danielewski''s
      "House of Leaves" and is relatively short. It consists of a series of letters
      and is often published as a novella or extended short story.


      2. **Serpentine**: This is a novella by Philip Pullman, set in the His Dark
      Materials universe. It is also relatively short, as it is a standalone story
      that expands on the series.


      Considering the typical lengths of these works:

      - "The Whalestoe Letters" is generally shorter, as it is a collection of letters
      and not a full-length novel.

      - "Serpentine" is a novella but tends to be slightly longer than a collection
      of letters like "The Whalestoe Letters."


      Based on this analysis, the answer is:


      **YES**, "The Whalestoe Letters" is shorter than "Serpentine."'

      M. Kornbluth, generally has editions that are around 200-250 pages long, depending
      on the publisher and format.


      2. **The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner**: This novella by Stephenie Meyer
      is a companion to the "Twilight" series and is typically around 178 pages long.


      Compare the lengths:

      - "The Space Merchants" is typically longer than "The Short Second Life of Bree
      Tanner."


      Based on this comparison, the answer is NO, "The Space Merchants" is not shorter
