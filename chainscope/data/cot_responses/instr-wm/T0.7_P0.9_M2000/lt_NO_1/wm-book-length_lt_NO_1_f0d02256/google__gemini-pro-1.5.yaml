      refer to physical length (height), page count, or word count. Since it''s a
      children''s book comparison, page count or word count is more likely the intended
      comparison.


      2. **Consider typical lengths of the genres:** *My Cat Likes to Hide in Boxes*
      is a picture book, generally short. *Love You Forever* is also a picture book,
      but known for being slightly longer and more text-heavy than many other picture
      books.


      3. **Estimate relative lengths:**  While I don''t have exact page counts readily
      available, *My Cat Likes to Hide in Boxes* is a very simple, repetitive story,
      suggesting a shorter page count. *Love You Forever* has a more complex narrative,
      implying potentially more pages.


      4. **Conclusion:** Based on the likely page counts of typical picture books
      and the relative complexity of the stories, *My Cat Likes to Hide in Boxes*
      is probably shorter.

      Let''s assume, after research, that *Avalon* has around 900 pages and *Demon
      Theory* has around 300 pages.


      Therefore, *Avalon* is *not* shorter than *Demon Theory*.

      Biographical Dictionary of Film" is known for its extensive length and multiple
      editions, making it likely long. "The Shadow Rising" is a large fantasy novel,
      also likely to have a significant page count.  A quick search reveals that even
      a recent edition of *The New Biographical Dictionary of Film* is over 1000 pages.
      *The Shadow Rising* is generally under 1000 pages.

      The question asks about length.  For books, this usually means page count or
      word count.

      2. **Consider the nature of the works:**  David Thomson''s *The New Biographical
      Dictionary of Film* is a non-fiction reference book. Robert Jordan''s *The Shadow
      Rising* is a fantasy novel. Reference books are often quite long, and fantasy
      novels are known for their length.

      3. **General knowledge/lookup:** While I don''t have the exact page counts memorized,
      I know *The New Biographical Dictionary of Film* is a substantial volume, and
      *The Shadow Rising* is one of the longest books in the *Wheel of Time* series,
      a notoriously lengthy series.  A quick search reveals *The New Biographical
      Dictionary of Film* is over 1000 pages and *The Shadow Rising* is also over
      1000 pages.  Further research indicates *The New Biographical Dictionary of
      Film* tends to be around 1100-1300 pages depending on edition, and *The Shadow
      Rising* is around 1000-1050 pages.

      the other is a fantasy novel.

      2. **Consider typical length:** Reference books, especially biographical dictionaries,

      also often very long.

      3. **Specific knowledge:**  *The New Biographical Dictionary of Film* is known
      for being a substantial volume, regularly updated and expanded over numerous

      a series famous for its length and detail.

      4. **Likely length comparison:**  While both are long books, a comprehensive
      film dictionary spanning decades of cinema is likely to be longer than a single
      volume (even a large one) of a fantasy series.

      than a lengthy fantasy novel.


      NO. (Meaning, the dictionary is *not* shorter, implying it is longer. This is

      to be of reasonable length.

      3. **Comparing genres:** Generally, fantasy novels can be longer than autobiographies,
      though there are exceptions.  However, the key here is to think of children
      vs. adult books.

      4. **Target audience:** Peterson''s book is children''s literature, while Jackson''s
      is intended for an adult audience.

      5. **Children''s vs. Adult books length:** Children''s books tend to be shorter
      than adult books.

      Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness* is a novel, likely a few hundred pages long.

      2. **Michael Jackson''s book:** *Moonwalk* is an autobiography, also likely
      a few hundred pages long.  It''s a real book, not a fictional work.

      book has fewer pages.  Without specific page counts, we can''t know for sure.  However,
      novels (especially fantasy novels like Peterson''s) can often be longer than
      autobiographies.

      also vary but can be quite long, particularly the first book in a series (which
      *Dark Sea of Darkness* is).

      4. **Specific Knowledge (if available):** While I don''t have the exact page
      counts readily available, general knowledge suggests celebrity autobiographies
      can be longer than many fantasy novels.

      of the Cousins'' War" isn''t a specific book title by her, but likely refers
      to her works about this period.


      2. **Consider the length of Gregory''s books:**  Her books about the Cousins''
      War (e.g., *The White Queen*, *The Red Queen*, etc.) are typically full-length
      novels.


      3. **Consider the length of *Many Waters*:** *Many Waters* is a young adult
      novel by Madeleine L''Engle, part of the Time Quintet series. While a novel,

      Wars of the Roses, often referred to as the Cousins'' War.


      2. **The Women of the Cousins'' War:** This isn''t a single book title by Philippa
      Gregory. She has written several books about the women involved in the Wars
      of the Roses.  Therefore, the question is ambiguous.  We can''t determine a
      specific page count for "The Women of the Cousins'' War."


      3. **Many Waters:** This is a novel by Madeleine L''Engle. It has a definable

      2. **Identify "The Women of the Cousins'' War":** This is more commonly known
      as *The Cousins'' War* series, specifically *The White Queen*, *The Red Queen*,
      and *The Kingmaker''s Daughter*.  The question implies a single book, so it''s
      likely referring to one of these, or potentially a compilation.  Regardless,
      these books are novels.

      L''Engle.

      novels tend to be shorter than adult novels, particularly historical fiction
      like Gregory''s work.

      2. **Determine the book in question**:  Gregory wrote several books related
      to the Wars of the Roses.  "The Women of the Cousins'' War" is not a singular
      title by Philippa Gregory.  It''s likely a general reference to her books about
      that period. Since the question compares book lengths, we need a specific title.

      about the women of the Cousins'' War. While she has written several books featuring
      women of this era, there isn''t one single book titled "The Women of the Cousins''
      War." This likely refers to *The Women of the Cousins'' War: A Novel of the
      White Queen and Her Rivals*, which is actually a combined edition of two of
      her novels, *The White Queen* and *The Red Queen*.

      to be shorter than large historical fiction novels.

      or word count would be appropriate.

      3. *The Lost City of Faar* is part of a middle-grade/YA series and is likely
      to have a shorter page count than a book intended for an adult audience.

      4. *Two Lives* is a collection of two novellas by William Trevor and is likely
      to have a substantial page count.


      While I don''t have the precise page counts on hand, based on the target audience
      and the nature of *Two Lives* as two novellas, it is highly probable that *The
      Lost City of Faar* is shorter.


      YES
