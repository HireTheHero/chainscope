      2. Let me recall when Honey, I''m Good by Andy Grammer was released

      - Honey, I''m Good was released in November 2014 initially, with wider release
      in 2015

      - It gained mainstream popularity in 2015 as the second single from his album
      "Magazines or Novels"


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Both songs were initially released in November 2014

      - However, Honey, I''m Good didn''t get its major release until 2015

      - Blank Space was an immediate major release in November 2014


      Therefore, since Blank Space had its full release before Honey, I''m Good:

      McCartney''s "I Lost My Little Girl"'
    88b1d150-be28-4383-b66f-40c28741d0a7: 'Let me solve this step by step:

      - "Love and Understanding" was released in 1991 as a single from her album "It''s
      a Man''s World"


      2. Next, let me find when Paul McCartney''s "I Lost My Little Girl" was released

      - "I Lost My Little Girl" was actually the first song McCartney ever wrote

      - He wrote it in 1956 when he was 14 years old

      - It was officially released on his album "Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)"
      in 1991


      3. Now let me compare:

      - Cher''s song: 1991

      - McCartney''s song: Written 1956, released 1991

      - Both songs were officially released in the same year, but McCartney''s was
      written much earlier


      4. The question specifically asks if Cher''s was released EARLIER than McCartney''s

      - Since both were released in 1991, Cher''s was not released earlier


      Answer: NO'

      1. Let me find the release date of Janet Jackson''s "Alright"

      - "Alright" was released in March 1990

      - It was from her album "Rhythm Nation 1814"


      2. Let me find the release date of Wet Wet Wet''s "Hold Back the River"

      - "Hold Back the River" was released in 1989

      - It was from their album "Holding Back the River"


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - 1989 comes before 1990

      - Therefore, "Hold Back the River" came out before "Alright"


      NO (Janet Jackson''s "Alright" was not released earlier than Wet Wet Wet''s
      "Hold Back the River")'

      Since I don''t have enough accurate information to compare both release dates,
      I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer in good faith.


      I must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer as I don''t have complete information

      1. First, let me check Big Sean''s "Feels" release date:

      - I actually cannot find a song called "Feels" by Big Sean with certainty.

      - There might be confusion with Calvin Harris''s "Feels" featuring Pharrell
      Williams, Katy Perry, and Big Sean, which was released in 2017.


      2. Let me check The Pretty Reckless''s "Back to the River":

      - "Back to the River" was released in 2020 as part of their album "Death by
      Rock and Roll"


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Even if we use Calvin Harris''s "Feels" featuring Big Sean (2017)

      - The Pretty Reckless song came out in 2020

      - 2017 is earlier than 2020


      Therefore: YES


      (Note: If there''s a different "Feels" by Big Sean that I''m not aware of, this
      answer could be incorrect. I''m basing it on the most well-known song featuring
      Big Sean with "Feels" in the title.)'

      - "Stop, Look, Listen (to Your Heart)" was released later in 1971 (around mid-1971)


      4. Since McCartney''s song came out in February 1971, and The Stylistics''s

      song.'

      1. Uriah Heep''s "One Way or Another" was released in 1976 on their album "High
      and Mighty"


      2. "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" was performed by Elton John and Kiki Dee (not
      just Kiki Dee)

      and was released in 1976


      3. Looking more specifically at the release dates:

      - "One Way or Another" - July 1976

      - "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" - June 1976


      4. Since "Don''t Go Breaking My Heart" was released in June 1976, and "One Way
      or Another" was released in July 1976, the Uriah Heep song came AFTER the Kiki
      Dee/Elton John duet.
