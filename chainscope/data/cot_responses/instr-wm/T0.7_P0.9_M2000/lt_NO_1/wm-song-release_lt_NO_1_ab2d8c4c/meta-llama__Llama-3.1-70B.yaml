      - Bazzi''s "Paradise" was released on April 4, 2019.

      - Paulo Londra''s "Tal Vez" was released on April 4, 2019.


      Since both songs were released on the same date, we need to look at the specific
      times they were released or the order in which they were announced or made available
      to determine which one was truly released earlier.


      3. **Compare Release Times**: According to the information available, there''s
      no specific mention of the exact time each song was released. However, we can
      consider the time zones and release strategies of the artists.


      - Bazzi is an American artist, so it''s likely that "Paradise" was released
      first in the United States.

      - Paulo Londra is an Argentine artist, so it''s likely that "Tal Vez" was released
      first in Argentina.


      Given these assumptions:


      - If we consider the release time based on the artists'' respective time zones,
      then "Tal Vez" would have been released earlier in Argentina, while "Paradise"
      would have been released earlier in the United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since both songs were released on the same date, and there''s
      no clear indication of which one was released earlier in terms of time, we can''t
