      determine which song was released earlier.


      Step 1: Identify when Taylor Swift''s "Blank Space" was released.

      "Blank Space" was released as a single on November 10, 2014. It was the second
      single from her album "1989" which was released in October 2014.


      Step 2: Identify when Andy Grammer''s "Honey, I''m Good" was released.

      "Honey, I''m Good" was released as a single in November 2014, and then re-released
      in February 2015. It was from his album "Magazines or Novels" which was released
      in August 2014.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      Both songs were initially released in November 2014. Looking more precisely:

      - "Blank Space" was released on November 10, 2014

      - "Honey, I''m Good" was released in November 2014, but the exact date appears
      to be later in November


      Step 4: Make a determination based on the release dates.

      Since "Blank Space" was released on November 10, 2014, and "Honey, I''m Good"
      was released later in November 2014, Taylor Swift''s song came out first.


      NO, Andy Grammer''s "Honey, I''m Good" was not released earlier than Taylor
      Swift''s "Blank Space."'

      - Taylor Swift''s "Blank Space": November 10, 2014

      - Andy Grammer''s "Honey, I''m Good": November 24, 2014

      - November 10 comes before November 24 in the same year (2014)


      Step 4: Determine which was released earlier.

      - Since November 10, 2014 is earlier than November 24, 2014, Taylor Swift''s
      "Blank Space" was released before Andy Grammer''s "Honey, I''m Good."


      NO, Andy Grammer''s "Honey, I''m Good" was not released earlier than Taylor

      two songs: "The First Time" by Surface and "Sin" by Nine Inch Nails.


      Step 1: Identify when "The First Time" by Surface was released.

      "The First Time" by Surface was released in 1990 as a single from their album
      "3 Deep."


      Step 2: Identify when "Sin" by Nine Inch Nails was released.

      "Sin" by Nine Inch Nails was released in 1990 as a single from their album "Pretty
      Hate Machine" (which was released in 1989).


      Step 3: Compare the specific release dates within 1990.

      Without the exact month and day information for both singles, I cannot make
      a definitive comparison of which came first within the same year. However, "Pretty
      Hate Machine" was released in October 1989, and "Sin" was the fourth single
      from that album, suggesting it was released later in 1990. Surface''s "3 Deep"
      album was released in early 1990, and "The First Time" was a lead single.


      Based on the available information, it appears that "The First Time" by Surface
      was likely released earlier in 1990 than "Sin" by Nine Inch Nails.


      Answer: YES'

      appeared on the "Sliver: The Best of the Box" compilation in 2005.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Deana Carter''s song was released in 1996.

      - Nirvana''s "Old Age" was officially released in 2004, though it was recorded
      earlier.

      - For commercial release dates, 1996 comes before 2004.


      NO - Deana Carter''s "Did I Shave My Legs for This?" was not released earlier

      (1991) but earlier than when "Old Age" was officially released (2004).'

      Step 1: Determine when Deana Carter''s "Did I Shave My Legs for This?" was released.

      - Deana Carter''s song "Did I Shave My Legs for This?" was the title track of
      her debut album released in 1996.


      Step 2: Determine when Nirvana''s "Old Age" was released.

      - "Old Age" was a Nirvana song that was recorded during the Nevermind sessions
      (around 1991).

      - However, it wasn''t officially released during the band''s active years.

      - It was later released on the "With the Lights Out" box set in 2004, and also
      appeared on the "Nevermind" deluxe reissue.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Deana Carter''s song: 1996

      - Nirvana''s "Old Age" (official release): 2004


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - 1996 comes before 2004


      NO - Deana Carter''s "Did I Shave My Legs for This?" was not released earlier
      than Nirvana''s "Old Age." It was released later.


      Wait, I need to double-check my reasoning. Deana Carter''s song was released
      in 1996, and Nirvana''s "Old Age" was officially released in 2004. Since 1996
      is earlier than 2004, the correct answer is:


      YES - Deana Carter''s "Did I Shave My Legs for This?" was released earlier than
      Nirvana''s "Old Age."'
