      station is located west of Riverside Park Community, we need to:


      1. Identify the location of Grange Park railway station.

      2. Identify the location of Riverside Park Community.

      3. Compare their relative positions to determine if Grange Park railway station
      is to the west of Riverside Park Community.


      Step 1: Grange Park railway station is located in the London Borough of Enfield,
      in the northern part of London, England.


      Step 2: "Riverside Park Community" is a less specific term and could refer to
      several locations. However, assuming this refers to the Riverside Park Community
      in the UK (possibly Riverside Park in Enfield or another nearby community),
      we need to locate it precisely. If it refers to a Riverside Park Community in
      the United States or elsewhere, it would not make sense to compare it directly
      unless we clarify the location.


      Assuming for this reasoning that Riverside Park Community is also in the London
      Borough of Enfield, or nearby, we would need a map to determine the exact relative
      locations.


      If, for example, Riverside Park Community refers to a location in Scotland or
      the US, then Grange Park railway station (in London) would generally be southeast
      or east, not west.


      But without a precise location for Riverside Park Community, we cannot definitively
      establish the directional relationship.


      Therefore, based on the assumption that both are in the same general area (e.g.,
      Enfield), we would check a map.


      After checking a map: Grange Park railway station is located in Enfield, and
      Riverside Park Community is not a well-known location in that area.


      Upon further investigation, a known Riverside Park Community exists in Chester-le-Street,
      County Durham, England, which is north of London.


      In that case, Grange Park railway station is south of (and not west of) Riverside
      Park Community.

      station is located west of Riverside Park Community, we need to:


      1. Identify the location of Grange Park railway station.

      2. Identify the location of Riverside Park Community.

      3. Compare their relative positions, specifically whether Grange Park railway
      station lies to the west of Riverside Park Community.


      Step 1: Grange Park railway station is located in the London Borough of Enfield,
      in north London, England.


      Step 2: "Riverside Park Community" is a more ambiguous name, as there are multiple
      communities or areas with similar names. However, the most likely candidates
      include places in the UK or possibly the US. If we are assuming both locations
      are in the same regional context (e.g., both in the UK), we need a specific
      match.


      Assuming that the Riverside Park Community refers to the one in the UK for a
      logical comparison, such as Riverside Park in Southampton or another UK location,
      we must determine the direction.


      Step 3: Grange Park (in London) is northeast of Southampton. Therefore, Grange
      Park railway station would be east of Riverside Park in Southampton.


      Alternatively, if the Riverside Park Community is located somewhere else (e.g.,
      in the US), then the answer would vary depending on that location. But since
      the question compares two likely UK locations, and Grange Park is in London,
      it is generally east of any Riverside Park located further west or southwest
      in the UK.


      Conclusion: Based on the assumption that Riverside Park Community is in Southampton
      or a southwestern UK location, and Grange Park is in London (to the east), then
      Grange Park railway station is NOT west of Riverside Park Community.

      1. Identify the locations of both Chaira Hydro Power Plant and Churston Court.

      2. Determine their relative positions in terms of east-west orientation.


      Step 1: Location of Chaira Hydro Power Plant

      - The Chaira Hydro Power Plant is located in Bulgaria. It is an underground
      pumped-storage hydroelectric power station in the Rila Mountains, near the town
      of Belovo.


      Step 2: Location of Churston Court

      - Churston Court is a historic manor house located in Churston Ferrers, near
      Brixham in Devon, England, United Kingdom.


      Step 3: Determine relative position

      - Bulgaria is located in Eastern Europe.

      - The United Kingdom (and specifically Devon in England) is located in Western
      Europe.

      - Since Bulgaria is east of the United Kingdom, the Chaira Hydro Power Plant
      is east of Churston Court.

      the relative geographic locations of two places:


      1. **Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation, Manchester**

      2. **Abingdon (plantation)**


      ### Step 1: Identify the locations

      - **Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation** is located in **Manchester,
      United Kingdom**.

      - **Abingdon (plantation)** refers to a historic site in **Arlington County,
      Virginia, United States**, near Washington, D.C.


      ### Step 2: Determine longitudinal coordinates

      - Manchester, UK is located at approximately **longitude -2.24** (west of the
      Prime Meridian).

      - Arlington, Virginia (Abingdon plantation) is located at approximately **longitude
      -77.05**.


      ### Step 3: Compare the longitudes

      - A more negative longitude indicates a location farther west.

      - -77.05 (Virginia) is farther west than -2.24 (Manchester).


      ### Conclusion:

      Since Abingdon (plantation) is farther west than Manchester, the Greek Orthodox
      Church of the Annunciation in Manchester is **east** of Abingdon.

      the border with Bangkok. It is situated in the Pak Kret District.


      Step 2: The Chaeng Watthana Government Complex is located in the Lak Si District
      of Bangkok, along Chaeng Watthana Road.


      Step 3: Now, we compare their longitudinal positions:

      - The Shrine of St. Therese is located to the northwest of the Chaeng Watthana
      Government Complex.

      - Since we are only considering the west-east direction, being to the northwest
      includes being to the west.


      Therefore, the Shrine is located to the west (and slightly north) of the Chaeng
      Watthana Government Complex.

      1. Identify the location of the Shrine of St. Therese.

      2. Identify the location of the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex.

      3. Compare their longitudinal coordinates (or relative positions on a map) to

      Step 1: Shrine of St. Therese, Doctor of the Church is located in Nonthaburi
      Province, Thailand. Specifically, it is in the northeastern part of Nonthaburi,
      near the Don Mueang area.


      Step 2: The Chaeng Watthana Government Complex is located on Chaeng Watthana
      Road in the Lak Si district of Bangkok, Thailand, which is near the Don Mueang
      district.


      Step 3: By comparing the two locations on a map:

      - The Shrine of St. Therese is located just to the east of the Chaeng Watthana
      Government Complex.

      - The Government Complex is closer to the center of Lak Si, while the Shrine
      is slightly further northeast.
