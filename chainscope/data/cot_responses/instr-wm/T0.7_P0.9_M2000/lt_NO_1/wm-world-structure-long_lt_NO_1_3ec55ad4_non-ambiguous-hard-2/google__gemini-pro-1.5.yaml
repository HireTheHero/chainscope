      We need the addresses or coordinates of both New Wine Church and the Basilica
      of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston, Maine.


      2. **Compare their longitudinal coordinates:**  West corresponds to a lower
      longitudinal value. Once we have the coordinates, we can compare the longitude
      of New Wine Church to the longitude of the Basilica.


      3. **Determine if New Wine Church''s longitude is less than the Basilica''s:**
      If New Wine Church''s longitude is less than the Basilica''s, then it is west
      of the Basilica.


      After researching, I found the following:


      * **Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul:**  122 Ash St, Lewiston, ME 04240

      * **New Wine Church:**  955 Lisbon St, Lewiston, ME 04240


      Using a mapping tool, I can see that New Wine Church is EAST of the Basilica.
