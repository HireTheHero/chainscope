      \ The goal is to determine whether the Immaculate Conception Cathedral in Pondicherry\
      \ is located west of the Rostov State Musical Theater. To answer this, we'll\
      \ need to gather some geographical information about both locations.\n\n###\
      \ Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, let's clarify where these two places\
      \ are situated.\n\n- **Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Pondicherry**: This\
      \ is a prominent church located in Pondicherry, a city in the southern part\
      \ of India. Pondicherry, also known as Puducherry, is a Union Territory on the\
      \ southeastern coast of India.\n\n- **Rostov State Musical Theater**: This theater\
      \ is situated in Rostov-on-Don, a city in southwestern Russia. Rostov-on-Don\
      \ is a major cultural and economic center in Southern Russia, located near the\
      \ Don River.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Geographical Coordinates\n\nTo determine\
      \ the relative positions of these two locations, we'll need their approximate\
      \ geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).\n\n- **Pondicherry, India**:\n\
      \  - Latitude: Approximately 11.9139\xB0 N\n  - Longitude: Approximately 79.8145\xB0\
      \ E\n\n- **Rostov-on-Don, Russia**:\n  - Latitude: Approximately 47.2224\xB0\
      \ N\n  - Longitude: Approximately 39.7189\xB0 E\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\
      \nLongitude is measured in degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0\
      \ longitude). Locations with higher east longitude values are further east,\
      \ while those with lower values are further west.\n\n- Pondicherry's longitude:\
      \ 79.8145\xB0 E\n- Rostov-on-Don's longitude: 39.7189\xB0 E\n\nSince 79.8145\xB0\
      \ E is greater than 39.7189\xB0 E, Pondicherry is located further east than\
      \ Rostov-on-Don.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Relative Positions\n\nGiven that\
      \ Pondicherry is further east than Rostov-on-Don, it means that Rostov-on-Don\

      \ Cathedral in Pondicherry is **not** located west of the Rostov State Musical\
      \ Theater; instead, it is located to the east of it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter\

      \  - St Paul's Church is located in Knightsbridge, a district in central London,\
      \ England.  \n   - The approximate coordinates are **51.500\xB0N latitude, 0.160\xB0\
      W longitude**.\n\n2. **Location of Lake Wallenpaupack**:  \n   - Lake Wallenpaupack\
      \ is a reservoir in northeastern Pennsylvania, USA.  \n   - The approximate\
      \ coordinates are **41.400\xB0N latitude, 75.300\xB0W longitude**.\n\n3. **Comparing\
      \ Longitudes**:  \n   - The longitude of St Paul's Church is **0.160\xB0W**,\
      \ meaning it is just slightly west of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0).  \n   - The\
      \ longitude of Lake Wallenpaupack is **75.300\xB0W**, meaning it is significantly\
      \ farther west.  \n   - A lower absolute value of longitude (closer to 0\xB0\
      ) means a location is farther east.  \n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   - Since 0.160\xB0\
      W is east of 75.300\xB0W, **St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge is not west of Lake\
      \ Wallenpaupack**.\n\n**Answer: NO**"

      \ by step. The question is: \"Is Cluj-Napoca National Theatre located west of\
      \ Berg Castle?\" To answer this, we need to determine the geographical locations\
      \ of both the Cluj-Napoca National Theatre and Berg Castle and then figure out\
      \ their relative positions in terms of east and west.\n\n### Step 1: Identify\
      \ the Locations\n\n**Cluj-Napoca National Theatre:**\nCluj-Napoca is a city\
      \ in Romania. It's known for its cultural institutions, including the National\
      \ Theatre. So, the Cluj-Napoca National Theatre is located in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.\n\
      \n**Berg Castle:**\nBerg Castle, also known as Schloss Berg, is located in Bavaria,\
      \ Germany. It's situated near the town of Berg on the shores of Lake Starnberg.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Determine the Coordinates\n\nTo find out which is west of the\
      \ other, we can look at their geographical coordinates.\n\n**Cluj-Napoca, Romania:**\n\
      - Latitude: 46.7712\xB0 N\n- Longitude: 23.6236\xB0 E\n\n**Berg, Bavaria, Germany:**\n\
      - Latitude: 47.9667\xB0 N\n- Longitude: 11.3500\xB0 E\n\n### Step 3: Compare\
      \ the Longitudes\n\nLongitude lines run north-south and measure how far east\
      \ or west a location is from the prime meridian (0\xB0 longitude). A higher\
      \ longitude means a location is farther east.\n\n- Cluj-Napoca: 23.6236\xB0\
      \ E\n- Berg: 11.3500\xB0 E\n\nSince 23.6236\xB0 E > 11.3500\xB0 E, Cluj-Napoca\
      \ is farther east than Berg.\n\n### Step 4: Determine Relative Position\n\n\
      If Cluj-Napoca is farther east than Berg, then Cluj-Napoca is east of Berg.\
      \ Consequently, Berg is west of Cluj-Napoca.\n\nTherefore, Cluj-Napoca National\
      \ Theatre is **not** west of Berg Castle.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing\
      \ the geographical coordinates, it's clear that the Cluj-Napoca National Theatre\
      \ is located east of Berg Castle.\n\n**Answer: NO**"

      by step. The question is: **Is Rybinsk Reservoir located west of Upper Boat
      Studios?**


      ### Step 1: Understanding the Locations


      First, I need to know where both Rybinsk Reservoir and Upper Boat Studios are
      located.


      - **Rybinsk Reservoir:** I recall that Rybinsk Reservoir is a large reservoir
      in Russia. It''s located in the central part of the country, specifically in
      the Yaroslavl Oblast region.


      - **Upper Boat Studios:** This name doesn''t ring a bell immediately. It sounds
      like it could be a place involved in media or production, possibly a studio
      complex. I need to find out where it''s located.


      ### Step 2: Locating Upper Boat Studios


      Since I''m not familiar with Upper Boat Studios, I''ll need to look it up. A
      quick search reveals that Upper Boat Studios is a television production facility
      located in Pontypridd, Wales, United Kingdom.


      ### Step 3: Mapping the Locations


      Now that I know both locations:


      - **Rybinsk Reservoir:** Central Russia, Yaroslavl Oblast.

      - **Upper Boat Studios:** Pontypridd, Wales, United Kingdom.


      ### Step 4: Determining Relative Directions


      To determine if Rybinsk Reservoir is west of Upper Boat Studios, I need to understand
      their positions on the globe.


      - **Russia vs. United Kingdom:** Russia is east of the United Kingdom. Specifically,
      Yaroslavl Oblast in central Russia is significantly east of Wales.


      ### Step 5: Conclusion


      Since Rybinsk Reservoir is in eastern Russia and Upper Boat Studios is in western
      United Kingdom (Wales), it''s clear that Rybinsk Reservoir is **east** of Upper
      Boat Studios, not west.


      **Final Answer:** NO.'

      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether St. Hyacinth's Church in Warsaw\
      \ is located west of Tooting railway station. To answer this, we'll need to\
      \ understand the geographical locations of both places and their relative positions.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n**St. Hyacinth's Church, Warsaw:**\n\
      - **City:** Warsaw\n- **Country:** Poland\n- **Continent:** Europe\n\n**Tooting\
      \ Railway Station:**\n- **City:** Tooting\n- **Country:** United Kingdom\n-\
      \ **Continent:** Europe\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Geographical Coordinates\n\
      \nTo compare the positions, we'll need the approximate geographical coordinates\
      \ (latitude and longitude) of both locations.\n\n**St. Hyacinth's Church, Warsaw:**\n\
      - **Latitude:** Approximately 52.2297\xB0 N\n- **Longitude:** Approximately\
      \ 21.0122\xB0 E\n\n**Tooting Railway Station, London:**\n- **Latitude:** Approximately\
      \ 51.4200\xB0 N\n- **Longitude:** Approximately 0.1630\xB0 W\n\n### Step 3:\
      \ Understand the Concept of \"West\"\n\nIn geographical terms, \"west\" refers\
      \ to the direction towards the left on a standard map, where longitude decreases\
      \ as you move west from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude).\n\n### Step 4:\
      \ Compare the Longitudes\n\nThe key to determining whether one location is west\
      \ of another is to compare their longitudes.\n\n- **St. Hyacinth's Church, Warsaw:**\
      \ 21.0122\xB0 E\n- **Tooting Railway Station:** 0.1630\xB0 W\n\nSince Tooting\
      \ Railway Station has a negative longitude (0.1630\xB0 W), it is west of the\
      \ Prime Meridian. St. Hyacinth's Church, with a positive longitude (21.0122\xB0\
      \ E), is east of the Prime Meridian.\n\n### Step 5: Determine Relative Position\n\
      \nGiven that Tooting Railway Station is west of the Prime Meridian and St. Hyacinth's\
      \ Church is east of it, we can conclude that St. Hyacinth's Church is east of\
      \ Tooting Railway Station.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nSince St. Hyacinth's\
      \ Church is east of Tooting Railway Station, it cannot be west of it.\n\n**Final\
      \ Answer:** NO, St. Hyacinth's Church, Warsaw is not located west of Tooting\
      \ railway station."

      The Ming Ancestors Mausoleum, also known as the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, is
      located in Nanjing, China. It is the tomb of the Hongwu Emperor, the founder
      of the Ming Dynasty.


      ### Step 2: Identify the Sacred Heart Cathedral, New Delhi

      The Sacred Heart Cathedral is a prominent Catholic church located in the center
      of New Delhi, India.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Locations

      Nanjing, China, and New Delhi, India, are two entirely different cities in different
      countries. Nanjing is located to the east of New Delhi when viewed on a map.


      ### Step 4: Determine Relative Position

      Since the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum is in Nanjing, China, and the Sacred Heart
      Cathedral is in New Delhi, India, the mausoleum is **east** of the cathedral,
      not west.


      ### Conclusion

      The answer is **NO**. The Ming Ancestors Mausoleum is not located west of the
      Sacred Heart Cathedral, New Delhi.'
