      2. Now, let me consider their relative positions:

      - Bucharest, Romania is in southeastern Europe

      - Luxembourg is in western Europe


      3. Looking at a map of Europe:

      - Luxembourg is clearly west of Romania

      - Therefore, Vianden Pumped Storage Plant is west of the Palace of the Patriarchate


      4. The question asks if the Palace is west of the Plant, which is the opposite
      of what we found.


      NO'

      4. Therefore, the Bulgakov Museum (in Kiev) is located EAST of Greenford station,
      not west.
