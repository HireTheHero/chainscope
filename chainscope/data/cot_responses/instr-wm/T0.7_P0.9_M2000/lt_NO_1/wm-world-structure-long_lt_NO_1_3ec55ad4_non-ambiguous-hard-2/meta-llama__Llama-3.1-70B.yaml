      \ Friedrichsfelde district of Berlin.\n   - **Classiebawn Castle:** This castle\
      \ is located in County Sligo, Ireland. It is situated in the town of Mullaghmore.\n\
      \n2. **Determine the geographical positions:**\n   - **Friedrichsfelde Palace\
      \ (Berlin, Germany):** Germany is a country in Central Europe. Berlin, the capital\
      \ city of Germany, is located in the northeastern part of the country.\n   -\
      \ **Classiebawn Castle (Mullaghmore, County Sligo, Ireland):** Ireland is an\
      \ island country in northwestern Europe. County Sligo is located in the northwestern\
      \ part of Ireland, and Mullaghmore is a small town on the coast of County Sligo.\n\
      \n3. **Compare their positions:**\n   - Considering the general geography, Germany\
      \ (where Friedrichsfelde Palace is located) is east of Ireland (where Classiebawn\
      \ Castle is located). However, to determine if Friedrichsfelde Palace is west\
      \ of the castle, we need to consider their longitudes.\n   - Germany's longitude\
      \ ranges approximately from 5\xB0E to 15\xB0E.\n   - Ireland's longitude ranges\
      \ approximately from 6\xB0W to 10\xB0W.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Friedrichsfelde\
      \ Palace (in Germany) is generally east of Classiebawn Castle (in Ireland),\
      \ considering their longitudes, Friedrichsfelde Palace is not west of the castle.\n\
