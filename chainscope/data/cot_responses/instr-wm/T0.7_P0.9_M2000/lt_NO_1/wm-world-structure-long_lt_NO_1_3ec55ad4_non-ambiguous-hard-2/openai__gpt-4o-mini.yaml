      3. **Analyze**: If Calcot Manor is directly west of or further along the west
      direction compared to Washington Avenue Immigration Station, the answer would
      be YES. If it is east, north, or south of the station, the answer would be NO.


      After considering these steps and checking the geographical locations:


      Calcot Manor is located in England, while Washington Avenue Immigration Station
      is in the United States. Thus, it is impossible to say that one is located west
      of the other due to the significant geographical distance and different countries.

      in Bangkok.


      3. **Relative Position**: We need to check the specific geographical positions
      of both places. If the shrine is positioned to the west of the government complex,
      then the answer would be YES; if it is to the east or in the same line, the
      answer would be NO.


      4. **Research**: By looking up the coordinates or a map of both locations, we
      can determine their relative positions.

      - The Shrine of St. Therese is located to the east of the Chaeng Watthana Government
      Complex.

      - Abbey Road DLR station is situated in the southern part of the UK.

      - Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant is situated in Norway, which is to the
      north of the UK.


      Since the power plant in Norway is to the north of the UK, Abbey Road DLR station
      is definitely not west of the Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant; it is actually
      south of it.
