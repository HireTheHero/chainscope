      Grange Park railway station is a National Rail station in Grange Park, in the
      London Borough of Enfield, UK.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of "Riverside Park Community".**

      "Riverside Park Community" most prominently refers to a neighbourhood in Ottawa,
      Ontario, Canada. There is also Riverside Park in New York City, but the "Community"
      suffix is strongly associated with the Ottawa neighbourhood. Let''s assume the
      Ottawa location for now, as it''s a distinct community area.


      **Step 3: Compare the two locations.**

      Grange Park railway station is in London, UK.

      Riverside Park Community is in Ottawa, Canada.

      These two locations are in different countries, separated by the Atlantic Ocean.


      **Step 4: Determine the relative direction.**

      On a global map, London, UK, is significantly to the *east* of Ottawa, Canada.
      Therefore, Grange Park railway station (in London) is east of Riverside Park
      Community (in Ottawa).


      If we were to consider Riverside Park in Manhattan, New York City, USA, London
      is still east of New York City.

      Based on the most common and prominent locations for these names, Grange Park
      railway station is not west of Riverside Park Community.

    fe10a8de-0b8f-44e2-811c-3f42fa0c6c5f: "Okay, let's break this down step by step:\n\
      \n1.  **Identify EastLink (Melbourne):** EastLink is a major toll road in Melbourne,\
      \ Victoria, Australia.\n2.  **Identify S\xE9 Cathedral:** \"S\xE9 Cathedral\"\
      \ is a common name for cathedrals in Portuguese-speaking countries or historically\
      \ Portuguese-influenced areas (S\xE9 means \"See,\" as in an episcopal see).\
      \ The most prominent and historically significant one often referred to simply\
      \ as \"S\xE9 Cathedral\" is the S\xE9 Cathedral de Santa Catarina in Old Goa,\
      \ India. Other notable ones include Lisbon Cathedral (S\xE9 de Lisboa) or S\xE3\
      o Paulo Cathedral (Catedral da S\xE9). Let's assume the one in Old Goa, India,\
      \ for primary analysis, as it's a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n3.  **Determine\
      \ the location of Melbourne, Australia:** Melbourne is in the Eastern Hemisphere,\
      \ with an approximate longitude of 145\xB0 East.\n4.  **Determine the location\
      \ of Old Goa, India:** Old Goa is also in the Eastern Hemisphere, with an approximate\
      \ longitude of 74\xB0 East.\n5.  **Compare their longitudes:**\n    *   EastLink\
      \ (Melbourne): ~145\xB0 E\n    *   S\xE9 Cathedral (Old Goa): ~74\xB0 E\n  \
      \  Since both are in the Eastern Hemisphere, the location with the *smaller*\
      \ East longitude is further west. 74\xB0 E is west of 145\xB0 E. This means\
      \ S\xE9 Cathedral (Old Goa) is west of EastLink (Melbourne).\n6.  **Rephrase\
      \ to answer the question:** The question asks if EastLink (Melbourne) is west\
      \ of S\xE9 Cathedral. Since S\xE9 Cathedral (Old Goa) is west of EastLink (Melbourne),\
      \ EastLink (Melbourne) is *east* of S\xE9 Cathedral (Old Goa).\n\n*Self-correction/check\
      \ with other S\xE9 Cathedrals:*\n*   If S\xE9 Cathedral refers to Lisbon, Portugal\
      \ (approx. 9\xB0 West longitude): Melbourne (145\xB0 E) is far to the east of\
      \ Lisbon.\n*   If S\xE9 Cathedral refers to S\xE3o Paulo, Brazil (approx. 46\xB0\
      \ West longitude): Melbourne (145\xB0 E) is far to the east of S\xE3o Paulo\
      \ (when considering the shorter distance across the globe, not going fully westwards\
      \ around).\n\nIn all common interpretations, EastLink (Melbourne) is east of\
      \ any prominent S\xE9 Cathedral.\n\nTherefore, the answer to \"Is EastLink (Melbourne)\
      \ located west of Se Cathedral?\" is NO.\n\nNO"
