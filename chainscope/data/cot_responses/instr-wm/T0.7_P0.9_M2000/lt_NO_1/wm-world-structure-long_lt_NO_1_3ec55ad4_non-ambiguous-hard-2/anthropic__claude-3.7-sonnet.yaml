      Station." There is the famous Ellis Island Immigration Station in New York Harbor,
      and Angel Island Immigration Station in San Francisco Bay. Without clear information
      about a "Washington Avenue Immigration Station," I cannot definitively place
      it.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Since I cannot confidently place the Washington Avenue Immigration Station,
      I cannot make a proper east-west comparison. However, if we''re referring to
      any location in the United States (where immigration stations were common),
      then Calcot Manor in England would be east of any location in the United States,
      not west.


      NO (Calcot Manor in England would be east of any U.S. location, not west)'

      Step 2: Identify the location of Washington Avenue Immigration Station.

      I''m not finding a specific "Washington Avenue Immigration Station" in my knowledge.
      The most well-known immigration station in US history is Ellis Island in New
      York. There''s also Angel Island Immigration Station in San Francisco Bay. Without
      clear information about this specific location, I cannot make a definitive comparison.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      Since I cannot definitively locate "Washington Avenue Immigration Station,"
      I cannot make a reliable east-west comparison with Calcot Manor.


      Given the lack of clear information about one of the locations, I cannot provide
      a definitive YES or NO answer to this question.'

      Step 1: Identify the location of Ou Raadsaal.

      Ou Raadsaal (Old Council Chamber) is a historic building located in Pretoria,
      South Africa. Pretoria is in the northeastern part of South Africa.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Thorntonbank Wind Farm.

      Thorntonbank Wind Farm is an offshore wind farm located in the North Sea, off
      the coast of Belgium in Western Europe.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      South Africa is located in the eastern hemisphere, while Belgium is also in
      the eastern hemisphere but much further west than South Africa. On a global
      east-west axis, South Africa (where Ou Raadsaal is) is east of Belgium (where
      Thorntonbank Wind Farm is).


      Therefore, Ou Raadsaal is NOT west of Thorntonbank Wind Farm; it is east of

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is a reservoir on the Missouri River along the Nebraska-South
      Dakota border.

      - Fox Theatre in Fullerton, California is located in Southern California.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions using U.S. geography.

      - Nebraska and South Dakota are in the central part of the United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - States east of California include Nevada, Arizona, and everything further
      east, including Nebraska and South Dakota.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      - Since Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska/South Dakota, and these states are
      east of California, the lake must be east of the Fox Theatre in Fullerton, California.

      - California is the westernmost continental state, so virtually all non-California
      U.S. locations that aren''t in Hawaii or Alaska would be east of a California
      location.


      NO, Lewis and Clark Lake is not west of Fox Theatre in Fullerton, California.

      Lewis and Clark Lake is a reservoir on the Missouri River along the Nebraska-South
      Dakota border in the central United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Fox Theatre in Fullerton, California.

      Fox Theatre in Fullerton is located in Orange County, California, which is in
      the western United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Nebraska/South
      Dakota are in the central part of the country. On a map of the United States,
      California is west of Nebraska/South Dakota.


      Step 4: Determine the answer.

      Since California is west of Nebraska/South Dakota, Fox Theatre in Fullerton,
      California is west of Lewis and Clark Lake. Therefore, Lewis and Clark Lake
      is NOT west of Fox Theatre, but rather east of it.


      NO'

      - Abbot Pass Hut was a historic alpine shelter located on the Alberta-British
      Columbia border in the Canadian Rockies.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - Surrey, BC is located in southwestern British Columbia, near Vancouver, on
      the west coast of Canada.

      - Abbot Pass is in the Rocky Mountains, on the continental divide between Alberta
      and British Columbia, in the eastern part of BC and western Alberta.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Surrey (where Tommy Douglas Secondary School is) is significantly west of
      the Rocky Mountains.

      - Abbot Pass Hut, being in the Rocky Mountains on the BC-Alberta border, is
      much further east than Surrey.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the east-west orientation.

      - Since Tommy Douglas Secondary School (in Surrey, BC) is near the west coast
      of Canada, and Abbot Pass Hut is in the Rocky Mountains much further east, the
      school is west of the hut.

      Tommy Douglas Secondary School is located in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada, which
      is in the eastern part of Canada.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Abbot Pass hut.

      Abbot Pass hut is located in the Canadian Rockies, on the continental divide

      Step 2: Let me identify where Abbot Pass hut is located.

      Abbot Pass hut is (or was, as it was removed in 2022) located in the Rocky Mountains
      on the continental divide between Alberta and British Columbia in western Canada.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions of these locations.

      Ontario is in eastern Canada, while the Rocky Mountains and the Alberta/BC border
      are in western Canada. Therefore, Tommy Douglas Secondary School (in Ontario)
      is east of Abbot Pass hut (in the Rockies).


      Step 4: Determine if Tommy Douglas Secondary School is west of Abbot Pass hut.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Tommy Douglas Secondary School is located in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada.

      - Abbot Pass hut is located on the continental divide between Alberta and British
      Columbia in the Canadian Rockies.


      Step 2: Determine their relative east-west positions.

      - Surrey, BC is near Vancouver on the west coast of Canada.

      - Abbot Pass is in the Rocky Mountains, which run through the eastern part of
      British Columbia and western Alberta.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Surrey (and thus Tommy Douglas Secondary School) is located in the far southwestern
      corner of British Columbia.

      - Abbot Pass is located much further east, in the Rocky Mountains along the
      BC-Alberta border.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Places on the west coast of Canada are west of the Rocky Mountains.

      - Therefore, Tommy Douglas Secondary School (in Surrey, BC) is west of Abbot
      Pass hut.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Surrey is on the west coast of Canada,
      which means it''s WEST of the Rocky Mountains where Abbot Pass is located. Since
      west means having a more westerly longitude, Tommy Douglas Secondary School
      would be west of Abbot Pass hut.

      the relative positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Chickamauga Lake.

      Chickamauga Lake is a reservoir in Tennessee, located in the southeastern part
      of the state.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lexington Reservoir.

      Lexington Reservoir is located in California, near San Jose in the western United
      States.

      Step 1: Identify where Stolzenfels Castle is located.

      Stolzenfels Castle is located near Koblenz, Germany, along the Rhine River.


      Step 2: Identify where St Brendan''s Cathedral in Loughrea is located.

      St Brendan''s Cathedral is in Loughrea, which is a town in County Galway, Ireland.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Germany is located in central Europe, while Ireland is located in western Europe.
      On a map, Ireland is west of Germany. This means that Loughrea (in Ireland)
      is west of Koblenz (in Germany).

      If Loughrea is west of Koblenz, then St Brendan''s Cathedral (in Loughrea) is
      west of Stolzenfels Castle (near Koblenz). Therefore, Stolzenfels Castle is
      east of St Brendan''s Cathedral, not west of it.
