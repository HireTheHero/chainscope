      - This is likely located in a city/country with historical significance

      - After checking, this appears to be located in Istanbul, Turkey


      2. Next, I need to locate the Vianden Pumped Storage Plant

      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Istanbul is in Turkey, which is in southeastern Europe/western Asia

      - Luxembourg is in northwestern Europe

      - These are quite far apart


      4. Determining west/east relationship:

      - Istanbul is east of Luxembourg

      - Therefore, the Palace of the Patriarchate is NOT west of the Vianden Pumped

      5. Answering the specific question:

      - Is the Palace of the Patriarchate located west of Vianden Pumped Storage Plant?

      - NO

      (in Norwich)


      4. The question asks: "Is Holy Trinity Church, Warsaw located west of St Julian''s
