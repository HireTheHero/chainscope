    6fe7aff6-84f9-4fc2-a9d6-9e7483a3a664: 'To determine if Gicumbi District is located
      south of Moretele Local Municipality, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Gicumbi District and Moretele Local Municipality. Gicumbi District is in Rwanda,
      East Africa. Moretele Local Municipality is in South Africa, Southern Africa.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Knowing the exact geographical coordinates or the
      districts each is in would be crucial. Gicumbi District, being part of Rwanda,
      gives us a starting point. Moretele Local Municipality, being in South Africa,
      provides another.


      3. **Comparative Analysis**: Normally, we would compare the latitudes of both
      locations to determine their north-south alignment. The location with the lower
      latitude would be south of the location with the higher latitude.


      Given the information typically available and assuming Gicumbi District in Rwanda
      and Moretele Local Municipality in South Africa are our fixed points:


      - **Conclusion**: Since Gicumbi District in Rwanda is generally at a lower latitude
      than Moretele Local Municipality in South Africa, Gicumbi District is south
      of Moretele Local Municipality.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

    234e1619-c9fa-4d1f-9542-77189f0d0a03: 'To determine if Renigunta mandal is located
      south of Nala Local Municipality, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Renigunta mandal and Nala Local Municipality. Renigunta mandal is in Andhra
      Pradesh, India. Nala Local Municipality''s location needs to be precisely identified,
      but for the sake of this exercise, let''s assume we find it is also in India,
      though typically, "Nala" could refer to various places. Assuming Nala Local
      Municipality is not a widely recognized name and might be a confusion or less
      common name, it''s possible it could be related to places with similar names
      in India or other countries. Without a clear, widely recognized "Nala Local
      Municipality," we''ll proceed with the assumption that it''s a less commonly
      referenced location that might not be directly comparable without more specific
      information.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Knowing the exact geographical coordinates or the
      district/state each is in would be crucial. Renigunta mandal, being part of
      Andhra Pradesh, gives us a starting point. However, without the precise location
      of Nala Local Municipality, direct comparison is challenging.


      3. **Comparative Analysis**: Normally, we would compare the latitudes of both
      locations to determine their north-south alignment. The location with the lower
      latitude would be south of the location with the higher latitude.


      Given the uncertainty around the exact location of "Nala Local Municipality"
      and assuming it might be a confusion or a less commonly referenced place, we
      cannot accurately perform the comparative analysis without more specific information.


      However, based on the information typically available and assuming Renigunta
      mandal in Andhra Pradesh, India, is our fixed point, and without clear details
      on Nala Local Municipality''s location, we cannot definitively say yes or no
      to the question as it stands. But since I must provide a YES or NO answer and
      given that I cannot verify the location of Nala Local Municipality accurately,
      I will have to base my response on the assumption that the question implies
      a comparison that should be possible with the given names, which might not be
      the case here.


      Therefore, without clear information on Nala Local Municipality''s location,
      the most accurate response based on the information provided and the need to
      select one of the options would be to acknowledge that we cannot accurately
      determine the spatial relationship without more specific details. But since

      1. **Identify Locations**: Kondagaon district is located in the state of Chhattisgarh,
      India. Mombasa Island is an island in Kenya, East Africa.


      2. **Geographical Context**: India is in South Asia, while Kenya is in East
      Africa.


      3. **Comparative Analysis**: Typically, when comparing locations in different
      continents, we consider the relative positions of the continents. In this case,
      Africa is generally considered to be south of Asia. However, the exact positions
      of the specific locations within these continents matter.


      4. **Latitude Comparison**: Latitude determines north-south positions. Without
      specific coordinates, we can''t directly compare the latitudes of Kondagaon
      district and Mombasa Island. However, we can infer their relative positions
      based on the general knowledge of their locations within their respective continents.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Kenya (where Mombasa Island is located) is in
      East Africa and India (where Kondagaon district is located) is in South Asia,
      and considering the general north-south positions of the continents, Kondagaon
      district is likely north of Mombasa Island.

      south of Ranau District, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Bhagalpur division and Ranau District. Bhagalpur division is in the state of
      Bihar, India. Ranau District is located in the state of Sabah, Malaysia.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Bihar, where Bhagalpur division is located, is
      in eastern India. Sabah, where Ranau District is situated, is in Malaysia, which
      is in Southeast Asia.


      3. **Comparative Analysis**: Normally, we would compare the latitudes of both
      locations to determine their north-south alignment. The location with the lower
      latitude would be south of the location with the higher latitude. However, in
      this case, the countries are in different hemispheres.


      Given the geographical context, Bhagalpur division is in India, which is in
      the Northern Hemisphere, while Ranau District is in Malaysia, which is in the
      Northern Hemisphere as well. Both locations are in the Northern Hemisphere,
      so they are not south of each other.


      However, since I must provide a YES or NO answer and given that the question
      implies a comparison that should be possible with the given names, I will have
      to base my response on the assumption that the question intends to ask if one
      location is south of the other, disregarding the fact that they are in the same
      hemisphere.
