      \ of Lazio, which is near Rome.\n   - The approximate latitude of Vicovaro is\

      \ the Indian Ocean.\n     - Rutland Island, County Donegal, Ireland.\n\n   Let's\

      \   - Without additional context, both could be valid, but the Rutland Island\
      \ in India is arguably better known due to its geographic uniqueness in the\
      \ Andaman Islands.\n   - However, Rutland Island in Ireland is also a known\
