      2. **Locate Munroe Island (India):** Munroe Island, also known as Mundrothuruthu,
      is an island located in the Kollam district of Kerala, India.


      3. **Compare Latitudes:** Washington state is in the northern hemisphere, while
      Kerala, India is in the northern hemisphere as well, but much further south.


      4. **Determine relative position:** Since Munroe Island is significantly further
      south than Riverton, Washington, Riverton must be north of it.

      is a census-designated place in Pinellas County, Florida, on the Gulf Coast.


      2. **Locate Stanwell:**  Stanwell is a village in the Borough of Spelthorne,
      Surrey, England, United Kingdom.  It''s near Heathrow Airport.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Bay Pines is in Florida, USA, and Stanwell
      is in England, UK.  Therefore, the concept of "south" in this context refers
      to a much larger geographical scale than if both were within the same state
      or even country.


      4. **Consider hemispheres:** Florida is in the Northern Hemisphere, while a
      large part of England (including Stanwell) is also in the Northern Hemisphere.  However,
      latitude matters.


      5. **Compare latitudes (if needed):**  While both locations are in the Northern
      Hemisphere,  one would need to check their latitudes to determine which is further
      south. However, given the vast distance and the fact they are on different continents,
      it''s highly unlikely Stanwell is south of Bay Pines.


      6. **Conclusion:** Stanwell is very far east of Bay Pines and likely at a similar
      latitude or further north.

      4. **Compare latitudes:**  Locations in the northern hemisphere have positive
      latitudes, increasing as you go north.  Anything in the southern hemisphere
      has a negative latitude.  Even though Florida is a relatively southern US state,
      it''s definitely in the northern hemisphere.  Surrey is also in the northern
      hemisphere at a higher latitude than Florida.


      Therefore, Stanwell is north of Bay Pines.

      3. **Compare locations:**  Bay Pines is in Florida, USA. Stanwell is in England,
      UK.  Therefore, the concept of "south" doesn''t really apply in the simple sense
      since they are on different continents.  One would have to consider a much broader
      geographical context.


      4. **Consider Latitude:** While not strictly "south," we could compare their
      latitudes.  Florida is at a lower latitude (closer to the equator) than England.


      5. **Conclusion:**  Stanwell is at a higher latitude (further from the equator)
      than Bay Pines.  So, in a very general sense, relative to the globe, it''s more
      north than south.
