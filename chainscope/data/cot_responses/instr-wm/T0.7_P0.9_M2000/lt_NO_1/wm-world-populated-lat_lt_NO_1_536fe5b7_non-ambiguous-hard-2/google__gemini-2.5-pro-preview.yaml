      1.  **Locate Riverton, Washington:** Riverton is a neighborhood in the city
      of Tukwila, Washington, which is south of Seattle.

      2.  **Locate Munroe Island:** A quick search for "Munroe Island Washington"
      points to an island in the San Juan Islands archipelago, which is located in
      the northern part of Puget Sound, significantly north of Seattle and Tukwila,
      near the Canadian border.

      3.  **Compare Locations:** The San Juan Islands (where Munroe Island is located)
      are considerably north of Tukwila (where Riverton is located).


      Therefore, Riverton, Washington is indeed south of Munroe Island.
