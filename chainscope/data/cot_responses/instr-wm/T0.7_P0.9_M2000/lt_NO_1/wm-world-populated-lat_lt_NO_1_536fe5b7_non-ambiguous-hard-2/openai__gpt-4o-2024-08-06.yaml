      1. **Froxfield**: Froxfield is a village in England, specifically in Hampshire
      and Wiltshire. There is also a Froxfield in the United States, but the English
      Froxfield is more commonly referenced.


      2. **Bemetara district**: This is a district located in the state of Chhattisgarh,

      Now, let''s compare their geographical positions:


      - Froxfield, being in England, is in the Northern Hemisphere and located in
      Europe.

      - Bemetara district is in India, also in the Northern Hemisphere, but significantly

      Now, let''s consider the relative positions:


      - The Faroe Islands, where Koltur is located, are situated far north of the
      equator, in the North Atlantic Ocean.

      - Uri, in Jammu and Kashmir, is situated much further south compared to the
