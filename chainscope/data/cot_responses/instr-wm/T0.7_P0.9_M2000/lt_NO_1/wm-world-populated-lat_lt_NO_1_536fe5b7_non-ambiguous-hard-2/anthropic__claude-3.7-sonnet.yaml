      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Gicumbi District is located in the Northern Province of Rwanda, in East Africa.

      - Moretele Local Municipality is located in North West Province of South Africa.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Rwanda is located in East Africa, roughly between 1-3 degrees south latitude.

      - South Africa is located at the southern tip of Africa, roughly between 22-35
      degrees south latitude.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Since Rwanda is much closer to the equator than South Africa, and Gicumbi
      is in northern Rwanda, it must be significantly north of any location in South
      Africa.

      - South Africa is much further south than Rwanda.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      - Gicumbi District is north of Moretele Local Municipality, not south of it.


      NO, Gicumbi District is not located south of Moretele Local Municipality. It
      is located north of it.'

      - Gicumbi District is located in northern Rwanda, in Africa.

      - Moretele Local Municipality is located in North West Province, South Africa.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Rwanda is located in east-central Africa, near the equator.

      - South Africa is located at the southern tip of the African continent.

      - Rwanda is much further north in Africa compared to South Africa.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since Rwanda is in central/eastern Africa and South Africa is at the southern
      tip of Africa, Gicumbi District (in Rwanda) must be north of Moretele Local
      Municipality (in South Africa).

      - If Gicumbi is north of Moretele, then Gicumbi cannot be south of Moretele.


      NO, Gicumbi District is not located south of Moretele Local Municipality. It

      Step 1: Identify where Gicumbi District is located.

      Gicumbi District is located in the Northern Province of Rwanda, in East Africa.


      Step 2: Identify where Moretele Local Municipality is located.

      Moretele Local Municipality is located in North West Province of South Africa.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine which is further south.

      Rwanda is located just south of the equator, with Gicumbi in the northern part
      of the country, roughly around 1-2 degrees south latitude.

      South Africa is much further south on the African continent, with locations
      in North West Province typically around 25 degrees south latitude.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since South Africa (including Moretele) is significantly further south than
      Rwanda (including Gicumbi), Gicumbi District is NOT south of Moretele Local
      Municipality. Rather, Gicumbi is NORTH of Moretele.

      Step 1: I need to identify where Combe Down is located.

      Combe Down is a village on the southern edge of Bath, in Somerset, England,
      UK.


      Step 2: I need to identify where Beit Jala is located.

      Beit Jala is a Palestinian town in the West Bank, near Bethlehem, in the Middle
      East.


      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - England is in northern Europe, approximately between 50-55 degrees north latitude.

      - The West Bank/Palestine is in the Middle East, approximately around 31-32
      degrees north latitude.

      - Since lower latitude numbers indicate locations closer to the equator (and
      higher numbers indicate locations closer to the North Pole), I can determine
      which is further south.


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      England (where Combe Down is) is at a higher latitude (further north) than Palestine/West
      Bank (where Beit Jala is). Therefore, Beit Jala is south of Combe Down, not
      the other way around.


      NO, Combe Down is not located south of Beit Jala. It''s located north of Beit

      Step 1: I need to identify where Crumpsall is located.

      Crumpsall is a suburb in north Manchester, England, in the United Kingdom.


      Step 2: I need to identify where Zira''a is located.

      Zira''a (or Zir''a) appears to be in the Middle East, likely in Syria, Jordan,
      or a similar region.


      Step 3: Compare their global positions.

      The United Kingdom (where Crumpsall is) is located in northwestern Europe.

      The Middle East (where Zira''a is) is located south and east of Europe.


      Step 4: Determine their relative north-south positioning.

      Locations in the UK are generally further north than locations in the Middle
      East.

      Therefore, Crumpsall (in northern England) would be north of Zira''a (in the
      Middle East).


      NO (Crumpsall is not south of Zira''a; it is north of it)'

      Step 1: I need to identify where Prevalje is located.

      Prevalje is a town in northern Slovenia, which is in Central Europe.


      Step 2: I need to identify where Bhaluka Upazila is located.

      Bhaluka Upazila is an administrative region in Bangladesh, which is in South
      Asia.


      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      Slovenia is approximately between 45-47 degrees north latitude.

      Bangladesh is approximately between 20-27 degrees north latitude.


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Since Bangladesh (where Bhaluka Upazila is located) is closer to the equator
      than Slovenia (where Prevalje is located), Bangladesh is south of Slovenia.


      Therefore, Prevalje is located NORTH of Bhaluka Upazila, not south of it.

      Step 1: Let me identify where El Rodeo, Escuintla is located.

      El Rodeo is in Escuintla, which is a department in Guatemala, Central America.
      Guatemala is located in the northern hemisphere, roughly around 14-15 degrees
      north latitude.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Saparua is located.

      Saparua is an island in the Maluku Islands (also known as the Moluccas) in Indonesia.
      Indonesia is in Southeast Asia, and Saparua is located in the southern hemisphere,
      approximately 3-4 degrees south of the equator.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes to determine which is further south.

      - El Rodeo, Escuintla is at approximately 14-15 degrees NORTH latitude

      - Saparua is at approximately 3-4 degrees SOUTH latitude


      Step 4: Determine the answer.

      Since El Rodeo is in the northern hemisphere and Saparua is in the southern
      hemisphere, El Rodeo is NORTH of Saparua (not south of it). Any location in
      the northern hemisphere is north of any location in the southern hemisphere.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Churchill is in Somerset, which is a county in southwest England, UK.

      - Vandenberg Village is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their latitudes.

      - California is roughly between 32-42 degrees North latitude, with Vandenberg
      Village specifically located in southern California (approximately 34.7 degrees
      North).


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Churchill, Somerset being in southwest England would be around 51 degrees
      North.

      - Vandenberg Village in California is around 34.7 degrees North.

      - A lower number of degrees North means a more southerly location.

      30-35 degrees north latitude.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Thousand Islands (Indonesia).

      The Thousand Islands (Kepulauan Seribu) is an archipelago in Indonesia. Indonesia

      Step 3: Compare the latitudes to determine which is further south.

      Littlefield, Texas is around 30-35 degrees north of the equator.

      Thousand Islands, Indonesia is approximately near the equator.


      Since Littlefield is in the northern hemisphere (north of the equator) and Thousand
      Islands is near the equator in Indonesia (in the southern hemisphere or very

      Step 1: I need to identify where Charodinsky District is located.

      Charodinsky District (also known as Charodeiskiy District) is located in Dagestan,
      which is in the southwestern part of Russia, near the Caspian Sea.


      Step 2: I need to identify where Manda Upazila is located.

      Manda Upazila is an administrative region in Bangladesh, which is a country
      in South Asia.


      Step 3: I need to compare their relative positions.

      Russia (where Charodinsky District is) is located in the northern hemisphere,
      significantly north of Bangladesh (where Manda Upazila is).


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      Since Charodinsky District is in Russia, which is north of Bangladesh, and Manda
      Upazila is in Bangladesh, Charodinsky District cannot be south of Manda Upazila.
      It must be north of it.

      determine if Bitterley is located south of Amethi district.


      Step 1: Identify where Bitterley is located.

      Bitterley is a village and civil parish in Shropshire, England, in the United
      Kingdom.


      Step 2: Identify where Amethi district is located.

      Amethi is a district in the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine which is further south.

      - Shropshire, England is located roughly between 52-53 degrees North latitude.

      - Amethi district in Uttar Pradesh, India is located at approximately 26 degrees
      North latitude.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Amethi is at 26 degrees North and Bitterley (in Shropshire) is at approximately
      52 degrees North, Amethi is further south than Bitterley. Places with lower
      degrees of North latitude are further south.


      NO, Bitterley is not located south of Amethi district. Bitterley is further
      north than Amethi district.'
