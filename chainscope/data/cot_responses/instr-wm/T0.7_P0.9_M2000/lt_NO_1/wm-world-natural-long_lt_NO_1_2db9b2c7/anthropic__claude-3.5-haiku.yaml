      - Both are located in Israel/Palestine region

      - They are both in the Jordan River Valley

      - The Jordan River actually connects these two bodies of water

      2. Morskie Oko is a famous lake located in the High Tatras mountain range in
      southern Poland, specifically in the Tatra National Park.


      3. The Gorce Mountains are located in southern Poland, north of the Tatra Mountains.


      4. Specifically, the Gorce Mountains are situated northeast of Morskie Oko.


      5. Since the Gorce Mountains are northeast of Morskie Oko, they are NOT west
      of Morskie Oko.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
