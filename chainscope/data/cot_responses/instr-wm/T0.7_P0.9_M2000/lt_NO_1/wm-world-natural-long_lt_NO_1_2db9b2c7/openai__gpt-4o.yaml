      2. Identify the location of Loch A''an: Loch A''an, also known as Loch Avon,
      is located in the Cairngorms National Park in Scotland.


      3. Determine the relative positions: Alwen Reservoir in North Wales is to the
      south of Loch A''an, which is in Scotland.


      4. Compare longitudinal positions: Since Alwen Reservoir is in Wales and Loch

      Brookfield and North Brookfield, Massachusetts.


      2. **Identify the location of Lake Sunapee**: Lake Sunapee is located in western
      New Hampshire.


      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Massachusetts is generally south
      of New Hampshire, but we need to determine the relative east-west position.
      East Brookfield and North Brookfield, where Lake Lashaway is located, are generally
      in central Massachusetts. Lake Sunapee is in western New Hampshire, which is
      to the east of central Massachusetts.


      Therefore, based on the geographic locations:


      Lake Lashaway is indeed located west of Lake Sunapee.


      The answer is: YES.'
    ffcc010a-8e06-414d-82ed-097e7f0048d0: 'To determine if Lake Lashaway is located
      west of Lake Sunapee, we first need to identify the locations of both lakes:


      1. **Lake Lashaway** is located in East Brookfield and North Brookfield in the
      state of Massachusetts, USA.

      2. **Lake Sunapee** is located in western New Hampshire, USA.


      Next, we consider the relative positions of Massachusetts and New Hampshire:


      - Massachusetts is located south of New Hampshire. East Brookfield, where Lake
      Lashaway is located, is in central Massachusetts.


      Given these locations, Lake Lashaway in Massachusetts is situated to the south
      of Lake Sunapee in New Hampshire. To determine if it is west or east, we compare
      their longitudes:


      - Massachusetts (especially central Massachusetts) is generally located to the
      east of western New Hampshire.


      Therefore, Lake Lashaway is actually located east of Lake Sunapee.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: **NO**.'

      located to the south of Singapore. It separates Singapore from the Riau Archipelago
      of Indonesia and connects the Strait of Malacca to the South China Sea.

      Now, considering the global geography:


      - South Africa, where Witwatersrand is located, is on the southern tip of the
      African continent.

      - Turkey, where the Sea of Marmara is located, is in the northwestern part of
      Asia and southeastern Europe.


      Given these positions:


      - South Africa (including Witwatersrand) is situated well to the south and west
      of Turkey.

      - The Sea of Marmara, being in Turkey, is geographically east of most locations
      in South Africa, including Witwatersrand.

      Sea and northwest of the Bosphorus Strait, which connects the Sea of Marmara
      to the Black Sea.


      2. **Identify the location of Witwatersrand**: Witwatersrand, often referred

      2. **Queen Victoria Sea**: Queen Victoria Sea is part of the Arctic Ocean, located
      north of the Arctic Circle, specifically north of the Svalbard archipelago,
      which belongs to Norway.


      Now, let''s consider the relative positions:


      - **Lake Abaya** is in the eastern hemisphere, in East Africa.

      - **Queen Victoria Sea** is in the northern hemisphere, above the Arctic Circle,
      primarily in the eastern part of the longitudinal span of the Arctic Ocean.


      Considering the global layout of these locations:


      - Lake Abaya is much further south than Queen Victoria Sea.

      - Queen Victoria Sea is located far to the north of Lake Abaya and is not in
      the western direction when considering global geography.


      Based on this analysis, we can conclude that Queen Victoria Sea is not located
      west of Lake Abaya.
