      1. First, I need to locate both bodies of water:

      - Alwen Reservoir is in Wales, in the northern part of the country

      - Loch A''an (also known as Loch Avon) is in Scotland, in the Cairngorms


      2. When comparing east-west positions in the UK:

      - Wales is located to the west of Scotland

      - Therefore, any location in Wales would be west of locations in Scotland


      3. Since Alwen Reservoir is in Wales and Loch A''an is in Scotland, Alwen Reservoir
      must be west of Loch A''an.


      Answer: YES'
    cc6dafce-06a8-4db0-8f92-f9b3fd7a476e: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Alwen Reservoir is located in Wales, specifically in North Wales near Denbigh.


      2) Loch A''an (also known as Loch Avon) is located in Scotland, in the Cairngorms
      National Park.


      3) Looking at their positions on a map:

      - Alwen Reservoir is in Wales, which is on the western side of Great Britain

      - Loch A''an is in Scotland, which is on the northern part of Great Britain


      4) When comparing their east-west positions:

      - Loch A''an is further east in Britain

      - Alwen Reservoir is further west in Britain


      Therefore: YES, Alwen Reservoir is located west of Loch A''an.'

      4) Looking at the geography:

      - Western New York State is east of central Ontario

      - Therefore, Four Mile Lake must be west of where Lake Tonawanda was located

      - The Caha Mountains run along the Beara Peninsula

      - The Beara Peninsula is south of the Lakes of Killarney


      4) When comparing their east-west positioning:

      - The Lakes of Killarney are situated more to the east

      - The Caha Mountains extend further west along the peninsula


      5) Therefore, the Lakes of Killarney are NOT west of the Caha Mountains, but
      rather east of them.
