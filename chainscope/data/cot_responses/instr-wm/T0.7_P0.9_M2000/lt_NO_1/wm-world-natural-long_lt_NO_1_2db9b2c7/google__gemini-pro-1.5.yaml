      between these two locations.

      2. **Locate Mount Shinn:** Mount Shinn is in the Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth
      Mountains in Antarctica.

      3. **Relative Positions:** Indiana is in the western hemisphere, and Antarctica
      is in the southern hemisphere.  West and East are relative to lines of longitude,
      and while one could argue all points on earth are west of all other points depending
      how you travel, the general understanding of West is a lower value of longitude.
      Indiana has a significantly lower value of longitude than Antarctica.


      Therefore, YES, Barbee Lake is located west of Mount Shinn.

      Since the question asks if the Beaufort Range is *west* of Sproat Lake, and
      it is northwest, the answer is technically NO.  While it has a westerly component,
      it''s not strictly west.
