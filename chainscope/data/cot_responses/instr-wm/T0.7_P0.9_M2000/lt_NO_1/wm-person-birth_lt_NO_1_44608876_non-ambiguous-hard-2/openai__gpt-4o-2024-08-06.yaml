      1. **Liang Jiong**: He was a Chinese poet and official during the Tang Dynasty.
      The Tang Dynasty lasted from 618 to 907 AD. Liang Jiong''s exact birth date
      is not widely recorded, but he was active during the Tang Dynasty, so it is
      reasonable to place his birth in the early to mid-part of this period.


      2. **Corentin of Quimper**: He is a recognized saint in Brittany, France, and
      is traditionally considered to have been a bishop in the 5th century. His time
      of activity is generally placed around the early to mid-5th century.


      Given these time frames:


      - Corentin of Quimper was active in the 5th century.

      - Liang Jiong was active during the Tang Dynasty, which started in the 7th century.


      Therefore, Corentin of Quimper was born earlier than Liang Jiong.

      considered to have lived in the early 5th century. He is often associated with
      Brittany and is considered one of the first bishops of Quimper. Although his
      exact birth date is not well-documented, it is generally placed around the late
      4th century or early 5th century.


      2. **Liang Jiong**: Liang Jiong was a Chinese scholar and official during the

      Based on these points:

      - Corentin of Quimper was born around the late 4th century or early 5th century.

      - Liang Jiong was born in 812 AD.

      was born earlier than Li Linfu, let''s examine the historical timelines for
      both figures:


      1. **Llywelyn ap Merfyn**: Llywelyn ap Merfyn was a Welsh nobleman. He lived
      during the 9th century and is believed to have died around 942 AD. However,
      specific birth dates for many figures from this period are often not well-documented,
      and his exact birth year is not clearly established.


      2. **Li Linfu**: Li Linfu was a Chinese chancellor during the Tang Dynasty.
      He was born in 683 AD and died in 753 AD.


      Given these timelines, Li Linfu was born in 683 AD, which places his birth in
      the 7th century. Llywelyn ap Merfyn, on the other hand, lived in the 9th century,
      and while his exact birth year is not documented, it would have been after the
      7th century.


      Therefore, based on the information available, Llywelyn ap Merfyn was not born
      earlier than Li Linfu.


      **NO**'
    2f8048c3-4f36-4586-94b7-a46d51b4c37f: 'To answer this question, let''s first identify
      the historical figures and their birth dates:


      1. **Llywelyn ap Merfyn**: He was a Welsh king, also known as Llywelyn the Great.
      However, there is no well-documented historical figure named Llywelyn ap Merfyn.
      You might be referring to Merfyn Frych, a 9th-century king of Gwynedd, or Llywelyn
      the Great (Llywelyn ap Iorwerth) from the 12th century. For the sake of argument,
      let''s consider a plausible period: Llywelyn ap Merfyn might be a fictional
      or confused figure, but if considering Merfyn Frych, his period of influence
      was around the early 9th century (he died in 844).


      2. **Li Linfu**: He was a prominent Chinese chancellor during the Tang Dynasty,
      serving from 734 to 752. He was born in 683.


      Now, comparing the birth dates:

      - If we consider Llywelyn ap Merfyn as Merfyn Frych or a similar figure from
      the early 9th century, his birth would likely be in the late 8th century.

      - Li Linfu was born in 683.

      birth dates of both individuals.


      1. **Jesko Albert Eugen von Puttkamer:** He was a German officer and colonial
      administrator born on July 2, 1855.
