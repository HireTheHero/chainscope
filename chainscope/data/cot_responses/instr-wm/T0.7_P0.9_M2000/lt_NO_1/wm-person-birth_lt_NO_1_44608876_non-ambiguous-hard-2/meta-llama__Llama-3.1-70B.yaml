      - Jacobus Voorda was born in 1643.

      - Roger Niger was active in the early 13th century, so his birth date is likely
      in the late 12th or early 13th century.


      Since the 13th century precedes the 17th century, Roger Niger was born earlier
      than Jacobus Voorda.

      Niger is: **NO**'

      1. **Siemowit of Cieszyn**: He was a Duke of Cieszyn from 1312 until his death.
      The exact date of his birth is not known, but he was probably born around the
