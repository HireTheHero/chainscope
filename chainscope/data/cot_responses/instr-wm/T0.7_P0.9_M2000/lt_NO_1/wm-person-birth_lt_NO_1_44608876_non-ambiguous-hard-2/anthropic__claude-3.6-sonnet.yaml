      1. Henriette Herz lived from 1764 to 1847

      2. Jacob Senleches (also known as Jacobus de Senleches) was a medieval composer
      who was active in the late 14th century (around 1382-1395)

      3. While we don''t have exact birth/death dates for Senleches, we know he was
      active in the late 14th century

      4. The late 14th century means around 1380-1400

      5. Therefore, Senleches must have been born sometime in the mid-14th century,
      likely around 1350-1360

      6. Since Henriette Herz was born in 1764, and Senleches was born around 1350-1360...


      NO (Henriette Herz was born about 400 years after Senleches)'

      - Hartwig von Passau (also known as Hartwig of Ortenburg) was Bishop of Passau
      from 1250 to 1254

      - His exact birth date is not readily available, but given his position as Bishop
      in the 1250s, he was likely born in the early 13th century, around 1200 or later


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Bernard II: born around 1140

      - Hartwig: born around 1200

      - 1140 comes before 1200


      Therefore: YES, Bernard II, Lord of Lippe was born earlier than Hartwig von
      Passau.'

      York.


      NO (Bridget of York was not born earlier than Guillaume Arrufat)'

      1. Bridget of York was born in 1480. She was the daughter of King Edward IV
      of England.


      2. Guillaume Arrufat was a French medieval cleric who lived in the 13th century.
      He died in 1311.


      3. Since Arrufat died in 1311, he must have been born in the 13th century (1200s),
      well before Bridget of York''s birth in 1480.


      4. Therefore, Bridget of York (born 1480) was NOT born earlier than Guillaume
      Arrufat (born in 1200s).


      Answer: NO'
    e45db992-a3ee-47a0-b830-98a7c3209320: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me identify when Bridget of York lived:

      - Bridget of York was born on November 10, 1480

      - She was one of the daughters of King Edward IV of England


      2. Now, let me identify when Guillaume Arrufat lived:

      - Guillaume Arrufat was a French bishop who lived in the 13th century

      - He died in 1286


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Guillaume Arrufat died in 1286, so he must have been born well before that,
      likely in the early-to-mid 13th century

      - Bridget of York was born in 1480, almost 200 years after Arrufat''s death

      of York


      NO (Bridget of York was not born earlier than Guillaume Arrufat)'

      - Guillaume Arrufat was a medieval French bishop

      - Giovanni Visconti lived from 1290 to 1354

      - He was an Italian Roman Catholic cardinal and Archbishop of Milan


      2. Let me find when Shaykh Tusi lived:

      - Shaykh Tusi (also known as Abu Jafar al-Tusi) lived from 995 to 1067

      - He was a prominent Persian Shia Islamic scholar


      3. Now I can compare their birth years:

      - Giovanni Visconti: born in 1290

      - Shaykh Tusi: born in 995

      - 1290 comes after 995 by about 295 years


      Therefore, Giovanni Visconti was NOT born earlier than Shaykh Tusi.


      Answer: NO'

      1. Let me identify when each person was born:


      2. Giovanni Visconti was born in 1290 in Milan, Italy


      3. Shaykh Tusi (also known as Abu Jafar al-Tusi) was born in 995 CE in Tus,
