      Roger FitzJohn is a medieval figure, so an exact date is also unlikely.  We''ll
      need to look for estimated years or date ranges.

      historical record of an Antonio Triva, suggesting this individual may be fictional
      or the name is misspelled.

      2. **Find Hugh VII of Lusignan''s birth date:** Hugh VII of Lusignan was born
      in 1065 according to Wikipedia. However, this should be Hugh I of Lusignan.
      Hugh VII is probably Hugh XII of Lusignan, born 1358. Let''s consider both dates
      to be safe.


      3. **Compare the dates:** 1224 (Matilda) is later than 1065.  1224 (Matilda)
      is earlier than 1358.


      4. **Determine if Matilda was born earlier than Hugh VII (Hugh I or Hugh XII):**
      If Hugh VII is Hugh I, the answer is NO. If Hugh VII is Hugh XII, the answer
      is YES.


      Since the question likely refers to a contemporary of Matilda, it is more likely
      Hugh XII.
