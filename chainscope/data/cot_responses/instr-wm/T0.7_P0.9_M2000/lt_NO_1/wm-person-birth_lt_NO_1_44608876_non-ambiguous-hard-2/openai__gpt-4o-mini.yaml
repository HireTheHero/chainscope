      earlier than Corentin of Quimper, we need to look at their respective birth
      dates.


      1. **Liang Jiong**: He is a historical figure from the Three Kingdoms period
      in China, specifically associated with the Shu Han state. His dates of birth
      are not widely known or documented, but he is generally considered to have lived
      during the late 2nd to early 3rd century AD.


      2. **Corentin of Quimper**: Corentin is a Breton saint traditionally believed
      to have been born in the 5th century AD. His life is associated with the early
      Christianization of Brittany.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - If Liang Jiong was active in the late 2nd to early 3rd century AD, this would
      place him around 200-250 AD.

      - Corentin, on the other hand, is believed to have lived in the 5th century
      AD, which would be around 400-500 AD.


      Since Liang Jiong lived in the 2nd to early 3rd century and Corentin lived in
      the 5th century, it follows that Liang Jiong was indeed born earlier.


      Thus, the answer is **YES**.'

      Jiong was born earlier than Corentin of Quimper, let''s first identify the birth
      years of both historical figures.


      1. **Liang Jiong**: Liang Jiong (or Liang Qichao) was a Chinese scholar and
      reformist born in 1873.


      2. **Corentin of Quimper**: Corentin is a Breton saint, and he is believed to

      1. **Kim Jang-saeng**: He is a historical figure from Korea, known to have lived
      during the Goryeo Dynasty. He was born in 1160.


      2. **Hawise of Aumale**: She was an English noblewoman, born around 1160 as
      well, specifically in 1160 or 1161.


      Now, we compare their birth years:


      - Kim Jang-saeng: 1160

      - Hawise of Aumale: 1160 (or possibly 1161)


      Since both were born in the same year (1160), we can conclude that Kim Jang-saeng
      was not born earlier than Hawise of Aumale.

      have been born around 1095. She was the daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr and is often

      Now, comparing the two dates:

      - Siemowit of Cieszyn (circa 1350)

      - Nest ferch Rhys (circa 1095)


      Since 1350 is later than 1095, Siemowit of Cieszyn was not born earlier than
      Nest ferch Rhys.


      The answer is **NO**.'

      of Poland. He was born around 1300.


      2. **Nest ferch Rhys**: Nest was a Welsh noblewoman, known for her connections
      to several important figures in Welsh history. She was born around 1080.


      Now we can compare their birth years:


      - Siemowit of Cieszyn: ~1300

      - Nest ferch Rhys: ~1080


      Since 1080 is earlier than 1300, we can conclude that Nest ferch Rhys was born

      Now, comparing the two dates:

      Since 1097 is earlier than 1350, we can conclude that Nest ferch Rhys was indeed

      1. **Louis King**: There is not enough widely known historical information about

      specific details, we can''t ascertain his birth year.

      de Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell, was born earlier than Guy I de La Tremoille,
      we need to look at the birth years of both historical figures.


      1. **Ralph de Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell**: He was born around 1400. His tenure
      as Baron began in 1434 and he was a prominent figure during the early 15th century.


      2. **Guy I de La Tremoille**: He was born in 1384. He was a French nobleman
