      of both individuals.


      1. Gunning Bedford, Jr. was an American lawyer and politician. He was born in
      the 18th century. Specifically, he was born in 1747.


      2. William of Alnwick was an English Franciscan theologian and bishop. He lived

      the early 14th century and likely born around the late 13th century, approximately
      in the 1290s.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - William of Alnwick: born circa 1290s

      - Gunning Bedford, Jr.: born in 1747


      So, William of Alnwick was born several centuries before Gunning Bedford, Jr.

      Step 1: Identify who Lucido Conti was.

      Lucido Conti was an Italian cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He was born
      around the mid-13th century. Some sources suggest he was born around 1240.


      Step 2: Identify who Yusuf al-Mustansir was.

      Yusuf al-Mustansir was a ruler of the Hafsid dynasty in Ifriqiya (North Africa).
      His full name was Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz al-Mustansir. He ruled in the 14th century.

      - Llywelyn ap Merfyn was a Welsh nobleman, thought to have lived during the

      - Li Linfu was a Chinese politician and chancellor during the Tang dynasty under

      - Since there is limited documentation, his birth is often estimated around
      the early 800s, possibly around 825 AD.


      Step 2: Identify who Li Linfu was.

      - Li Linfu was a prominent Chinese politician during the Tang dynasty.

      - He served as a chancellor under Emperor Xuanzong and died in 753 AD.

      - Given his political prominence before his death, his birth is typically estimated
      around 683 AD.


      Step 3: Compare their birth years.

      - Li Linfu: born circa 683 AD.

      - Llywelyn ap Merfyn: born circa 825 AD.


      Since 683 AD is earlier than 825 AD, Li Linfu was born earlier than Llywelyn
      ap Merfyn.
