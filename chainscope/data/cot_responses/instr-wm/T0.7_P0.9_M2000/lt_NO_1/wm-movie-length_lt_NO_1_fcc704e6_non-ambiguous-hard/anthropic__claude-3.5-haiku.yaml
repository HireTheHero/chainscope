      1. First, I need to find the runtime of "Get Bruce"

      - "Get Bruce" is a documentary about comedy writer Bruce Vilanch

      - I''ll check its runtime... it appears to be approximately 82 minutes long


      2. Next, I need to find the runtime of "Nelly''s Folly"

      - "Nelly''s Folly" is an animated short by Maurice Noble

      - Animated shorts are typically quite short

      - I''ll check its runtime... it appears to be around 7 minutes long


      3. Now I''ll compare the runtimes

      - Get Bruce: 82 minutes

      - Nelly''s Folly: 7 minutes

      - 82 minutes is significantly longer than 7 minutes


      4. Answering the specific question: Does Get Bruce have a shorter total runtime
      than Nelly''s Folly?

      - No, it does not. Get Bruce is much longer.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      - I know this film is known for being quite long and experimental

      - Its runtime is approximately 110 minutes


      3. Red Riding Hoodwinked (a Friz Freleng cartoon)

      - This sounds like a cartoon short

      - Cartoon shorts typically run much shorter, often around 6-8 minutes

      - Even if it''s a longer animated work, it''s unlikely to exceed 110 minutes


      4. Comparing the runtimes:

      - Singapore Sling: ~110 minutes

      - Red Riding Hoodwinked: Likely under 110 minutes

      - However, I do not know its precise runtime with certainty


      Fight Back to School III (1993, Hong Kong film):

      Comparing the runtimes:

      comedy from 1962)

      2. Then, I''ll find the runtime of "Mad as a Mars Hare" (a Looney Tunes cartoon
      from 1963)

      3. Compare their runtimes


      Checking the runtimes:

      - "Hussar Ballad" is a feature film, typically around 85-90 minutes long

      - "Mad as a Mars Hare" is an animated short, which typically runs about 6-7
      minutes


      Since the feature film is much longer than the animated short, the Hussar Ballad
      definitely has a LONGER runtime.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      4. Answering the specific question: Does "The Hook" have a shorter total runtime
      than "Devil''s Feud Cake"?

      - No, it does not. "The Hook" is much longer.


      Answer: NO'

      Gerasimov:

      - This is a Soviet epic historical drama film

      - Its runtime is approximately 375 minutes (6 hours and 15 minutes)


      2. Next, I''ll find the runtime of "Munafik 2" (2018) by Syamsul Yusof:

      - This is a Malaysian horror film

      - Its runtime is approximately 138 minutes (2 hours and 18 minutes)


      3. Comparing the runtimes:

      - "And Quiet Flows the Don": 375 minutes

      - "Munafik 2": 138 minutes

      - 375 minutes is significantly longer than 138 minutes

      - "Akhiyon Se Goli Maare": ~165 minutes

      - "Ski Troop Attack": ~70 minutes


      Therefore, "Ski Troop Attack" has a significantly shorter runtime.

      2. Edward L. Cahn was a real film director, known for many B-movies in the mid-20th
      century.


      3. "Gun Fight" sounds like a plausible title for a western film from that era.
