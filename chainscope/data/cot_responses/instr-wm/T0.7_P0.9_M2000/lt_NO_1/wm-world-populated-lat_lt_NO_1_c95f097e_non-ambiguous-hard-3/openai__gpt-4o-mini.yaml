    2c3f9961-d27c-4d48-93d4-13e9eb1386f4: 'To determine whether Germasogeia is located
      south of Idjwi, we need to identify the geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Germasogeia**: Germasogeia is a suburb of Limassol in Cyprus, located on
      the southern coast of the island.


      2. **Idjwi**: Idjwi is an island in Lake Kivu, located in the eastern part of
      the Democratic Republic of the Congo.


      Now to compare their relative positions:

      - Germasogeia is in the eastern Mediterranean region (southern Europe).

      - Idjwi is in central Africa.


      Since Germasogeia is situated in the southern part of Cyprus and Idjwi is in
      the central part of Africa, determining if Germasogeia is "south" of Idjwi requires
      us to recognize that the two places are not in the same geographical context
      (Cyprus vs. DRC) and are separated by a considerable distance.


      Thus, we can conclude that Germasogeia is not located south of Idjwi.


      The answer is **NO**.'

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand where Agame and Nala
      Local Municipality are situated. Agame is a location in South Africa, specifically

      north of Agame based on the map of the Free State region.


      3. **Conclusion**: Since Nala Local Municipality is to the north of Agame, it
      follows that Agame cannot be south of Nala Local Municipality.
