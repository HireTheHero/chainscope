      1. First, I recognize these are place names, likely in Malaysia.


      2. Nadia district is not in Malaysia - it is actually a district in West Bengal,
      India.


      3. Kluang District is located in Johor state, Malaysia.


      4. These districts are in different countries (India and Malaysia), not even
      close to each other.


      5. Therefore, the concept of "south of" cannot be meaningfully applied.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer.


      Since I cannot definitively say YES or NO based on the geographical information,
      I will answer:


      NO'
