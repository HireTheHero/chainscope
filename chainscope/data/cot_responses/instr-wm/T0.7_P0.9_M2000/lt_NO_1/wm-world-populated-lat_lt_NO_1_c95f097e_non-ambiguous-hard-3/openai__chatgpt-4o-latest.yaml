      the Baramulla district in the northwest part of Jammu and Kashmir. This places
      Uri in the far north of India.


      2. **Namakkal district** is located in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
      It lies in the southern part of the Indian peninsula.


      3. Since Uri is in the extreme north of India and Namakkal is in the deep south
      of India, clearly Uri is much farther north than Namakkal.
