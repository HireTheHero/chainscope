      - 29206 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - When looking at a US map, Connecticut is positioned to the east of South Carolina,
      not to the west.

      - Connecticut is on the Atlantic coast in New England

      - South Carolina is also on the Atlantic coast but further south and west of

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 30342 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      - 77340 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Generally, Texas is west of Georgia


      Step 3: To be more precise, let me think about the relative positions.

      - Georgia is on the Atlantic coast

      - Texas extends much further west than Georgia

      - All of Georgia is east of most of Texas


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Georgia is entirely east of Texas, zip code 30342 in GA must be east of
      zip code 77340 in TX. Therefore, 30342, GA is NOT located west of 77340, TX.

      - 77340 is in Texas (TX), specifically in Huntsville.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Georgia and Texas.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, extending to the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas on the U.S. map.

      - Atlanta, GA (where 30342 is located) is in the northern part of Georgia.

      - Huntsville, TX (where 77340 is located) is in the eastern part of Texas.


      Step 4: Even though Huntsville is in eastern Texas, Texas as a whole is still
      west of Georgia.


      Therefore, 30342 in Georgia is NOT west of 77340 in Texas. Georgia is east of
      Texas, so a Georgia zip code would be east of a Texas zip code.

    0550d60e-036b-4da9-9b19-3def1e0ef2db: '# Is 10918, NY located west of 30346, GA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) 10918 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      2) 30346 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      3) In the United States, longitude determines east-west position (lower longitude
      numbers are further west)

      4) New York is located in the northeastern United States

      5) Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      6) When comparing states on the same approximate latitude, locations in New
      York would be east of locations in Georgia


      Since New York is east of Georgia on the US map, zip code 10918 in NY would
      be east of zip code 30346 in GA, not west of it.

      Iowa is still west of any part of Michigan.


      Step 5: Compare the relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Even the westernmost parts of Michigan are east of the easternmost parts of
      Iowa

      - The Mississippi River largely forms the border between eastern Iowa and western
      Illinois, with Michigan further east


      Therefore, 49453, MI is located EAST of 50703, IA, not west.

      - 49453, MI is a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      - 50703, IA is a zip code in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Michigan and Iowa.

      - Michigan is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United
      States

      - Iowa is located in the central part of the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Michigan is generally east of Iowa on a map of the United States

      - Iowa lies to the west of Michigan


      Step 4: Since 49453 is in Michigan and 50703 is in Iowa, and Michigan is east

      - 49453, MI refers to a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      - 50703, IA refers to a zip code in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Michigan and Iowa.

      - Michigan is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region

      - Iowa is located in the central part of the Midwest region

      - Generally, Michigan is east of Iowa


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Zip codes in the US generally increase from east to west

      - 49453 (Michigan) is a lower number than 50703 (Iowa)

      - This suggests 49453 is more eastern than 50703


      Step 4: Verify the pattern.

      - The first digit in US zip codes divides the country into regions

      - Michigan zip codes mostly start with 4, which is an eastern/midwestern region

      - Iowa zip codes mostly start with 5, which is generally west of the region
      represented by 4

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region in the eastern part of the Midwest

      - Iowa is located in the central Midwest, west of Illinois and Wisconsin, but
      east of Nebraska


      Step 3: Look at zip code patterns.

      - Zip codes generally increase from east to west in the US

      - The 494xx range is in western Michigan

      - The 507xx range is in eastern Iowa


      Step 4: Compare the specific locations.

      - 49453 would be in the western part of Michigan

      - 50703 would be in the eastern part of Iowa

      - Even western Michigan is generally east of eastern Iowa on a map


      Step 5: Make the determination.

      Since Michigan is east of Iowa geographically, and the specific zip codes don''t

      - 68147 is a ZIP code in Nebraska (NE), which is in the central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Georgia is located on the eastern side of the United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.

      - Nebraska is located in the middle of the country, in the Great Plains region.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions.

      states (like Nebraska).

      - Looking at a map of the US, Georgia is clearly east of Nebraska.


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on longitude.

      - 08620 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 34994 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Florida is also on the eastern seaboard, but is further south than New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - New Jersey is generally positioned to the northeast of Florida

      - Florida extends further west than most of New Jersey


      Step 4: More specifically for these zip codes:

      - 08620 appears to be in central New Jersey

      - 34994 is in eastern Florida (likely in the Stuart area)


      Step 5: The eastern coast of Florida is actually slightly east of the New Jersey
      coastline due to the curvature of the North American eastern seaboard.


      Based on these geographical positions, 08620, NJ is NOT located west of 34994,
      FL. In fact, it''s located northeast of the Florida zip code.

      - The west coast of the US runs roughly north-south

      - Portland, OR is in the northern part of the west coast

      - Norwalk, CA is in the southern part of the west coast

      - Texas is located in the southern part of the central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Wisconsin is generally located to the east of the central longitude of the
      continental US

      - Texas is also east of the central longitude, but extends further west than
      Wisconsin


      Step 4: More specifically, Wisconsin is positioned east of Texas on a map of
      the United States. Texas is significantly further west than Wisconsin.


      Since 53209, WI is located EAST of 76155, TX (not west), the answer is:

      - 44095 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and
      Ohio.

      side)


      Step 3: However, I need to check the specific locations of these zip codes,
      as they could be in parts of their states that don''t follow the general east-west
      relationship.

      - 19363 is in Oxford, PA, which is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - 44095 is in Eastlake, OH, which is in the northeastern part of Ohio


      Step 4: Based on their specific locations:

      - Oxford, PA (19363) is in the far eastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Eastlake, OH (44095) is in the far eastern part of Ohio, near Lake Erie


      Step 5: Even though Ohio is generally west of Pennsylvania, the eastern edge
      of Ohio (where 44095 is located) is still west of the southeastern part of Pennsylvania
      (where 19363 is located).

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio on the US map.

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania on Pennsylvania''s western border.


      Step 3: Consider zip code patterns.

      - Generally, zip codes in the eastern US have lower numbers than those in the
      western US.

      - 19363 (PA) has a lower number than 44095 (OH), which supports that the PA
      location is further east.


      Step 4: Make the geographical determination.

      - Since Pennsylvania is east of Ohio, and there''s nothing to suggest these

      To answer this question, I need to determine the locations of these zip codes
      and compare their east-west positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 02452 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15690 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts


      ## Step 3: More specifically for these zip codes

      - 02452 corresponds to Waltham, Massachusetts, in the eastern part of the state

      - 15690 corresponds to an area in western Pennsylvania


      ## Step 4: Compare east-west positions

      Since Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania on the US map, and these specific
      zip codes don''t change this general geographic relationship, 02452 MA is east
      of 15690 PA, not west.

      if 01810, MA is west of 15468, PA.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 01810 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15468 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern US, but generally west of Massachusetts


      Step 3: Check more specifically.

      - Zip codes beginning with "018" are in northeastern Massachusetts

      - Zip code 01810 specifically is in Andover, Massachusetts

      - Zip codes beginning with "154" are in southwestern Pennsylvania

      - Zip code 15468 is in Smithfield, Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania on a map

      - Therefore, a location in Massachusetts (01810) would be east of a location
      in Pennsylvania (15468), not west of it

      To determine this, I need to find the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 44116, OH is in Ohio, which is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States

      - 77045, TX is in Texas, which is in the Southern/Southwestern United States


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative positions

      Ohio is located significantly east of Texas in the United States. On a map of
      the US, Texas is positioned to the west of Ohio.


      ## Step 3: Apply geographical knowledge

      Since Ohio (where 44116 is located) is east of Texas (where 77045 is located),
      then 44116 cannot be west of 77045. It would be east of it.


      ## Answer: NO


      44116, OH is not located west of 77045, TX. It is located east of it.'

      Step 3: In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers tend to be in the
      eastern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western
      parts. However, this is not always reliable for comparing across different states.


      Step 4: Looking at the first digits:

      - 28457 starts with "2", which typically covers eastern states

      - 24354 also starts with "2", which also typically covers eastern states


      Step 5: Since both zip codes start with "2", I need to look at their specific
      locations. Virginia is generally north and slightly east of North Carolina.
      However, western Virginia borders northeastern North Carolina.


      Step 6: The specific zip code 28457 is in central/southern North Carolina, while
      24354 is in southwestern Virginia (in the Appalachian region).

      Ocean.

      Kentucky is located more inland and west of Pennsylvania.


      Generally speaking, locations in Kentucky are west of locations in Pennsylvania
      due to their relative positions in the United States. Kentucky''s eastern border
      is west of Pennsylvania''s western border.


      Specifically, zip code 18951 (PA) would be in eastern Pennsylvania, while 42431
      (KY) would be somewhere in Kentucky. Since Kentucky as a state is west of Pennsylvania,
      the Kentucky zip code would be west of the Pennsylvania zip code.


      Therefore, 18951 PA is NOT located west of 42431 KY. Rather, 42431 KY is west

      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of these
      two zip codes and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 28607 is in Boone, North Carolina (NC)

      - 49337 is in Newaygo, Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region, specifically in the Great Lakes region.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - North Carolina is generally east of Michigan on a US map.

      - Specifically, Boone, NC (28607) would be southeast of Newaygo, MI (49337).

      - In terms of longitude (east-west position), North Carolina is further east
      than Michigan.


      Step 4: Determine which is further west.

      - Since Michigan is west of North Carolina, 49337 (MI) is west of 28607 (NC).

      - Conversely, 28607 (NC) is NOT west of 49337 (MI).

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Ohio is in the midwestern United States, specifically in the eastern part
      of the Midwest

      - Generally, Ohio is west of New York


      Step 2: Let me think about the specific zip codes:

      - 12549 is in New York (NY)

      - 43160 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 3: Since Ohio is generally west of New York, and these zip codes are in
      their respective states, zip code 12549 in NY would be east of zip code 43160

      To determine this, I need to find the locations of both zip codes and compare
      their east-west positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 12549 is a zip code in New Windsor, New York

      - 43160 is a zip code in Washington Court House, Ohio


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography of the US states

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while Ohio is in the
      midwestern United States. Generally, New York is east of Ohio.


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      When comparing east-west positions in the US, we''re looking at longitude. Lower
      longitude numbers indicate more western locations. Since New York is east of
      Ohio, zip code 12549 in New York would be east of (not west of) zip code 43160
      in Ohio.

      To determine this, I need to find the geographical locations of both zip codes
      and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 12549 is in New Windsor, New York

      - 43160 is in Washington Court House, Ohio


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New York state is located in the northeastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern United States, west of New York


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - When moving from east to west across the United States, you would encounter
      New York before Ohio

      - This means New York is east of Ohio, not west of it


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 12549 is in New York and 43160 is in Ohio, the New York zip code would
      be east of the Ohio zip code


      Therefore, 12549, NY is NOT located west of 43160, OH.

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 12549 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 43160 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern United States, west of New York


      Step 3: In the United States, locations further west have higher longitude values,
      while locations further east have lower longitude values. Given the general
      positions of these states, Ohio is west of New York.


      Step 4: Since 12549 is in New York and 43160 is in Ohio, and Ohio is generally
      west of New York, it''s highly unlikely that a New York zip code would be west
      of an Ohio zip code.

      west of 33715, FL. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 01107 is in Massachusetts (MA), which is in the northeastern United States.

      - 33715 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative east-west positioning of these states.

      - Massachusetts is on the East Coast, but is positioned more to the northeast.

      - Florida is also on the East Coast, but extends further south and is positioned
      more to the southeast.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - States to the west have lower longitude values (more negative numbers in the
      Western Hemisphere).

      - Massachusetts is generally positioned to the northeast of Florida.

      - While both are eastern states, Massachusetts is actually slightly west of
      Florida in terms of longitude.


      This might seem counterintuitive, but due to the curved shape of the East Coast,
      parts of Massachusetts (including Springfield where 01107 is located) are indeed
      west of parts of Florida (including St. Petersburg where 33715 is located).


      NO - 01107, MA is not located west of 33715, FL. Massachusetts is actually slightly
      east of Florida in terms of longitude.


      Wait, I need to verify this. Let me check more carefully...


      After reconsideration: Massachusetts (including Springfield) is actually slightly
      WEST of the Florida peninsula (including St. Petersburg). The East Coast curves
      in such a way that this is the case.

      west of 27604, NC. I''ll think about this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 11572 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)

      - 27604 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New York is a state in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is a state on the eastern seaboard, south of New York

      - In the United States, locations that are "west" have a greater longitude (more
      negative number, since the US is in the western hemisphere)


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - While New York is north of North Carolina, the question asks about east/west
      positioning

      - New York is generally east of North Carolina, not west

      - The Atlantic coast angles such that as you move north from North Carolina
      to New York, you actually move further east


      Step 4: Verify with specific ZIP codes.

      - 11572 appears to be in Oceanside, NY (Long Island area)

      - 27604 is in Raleigh, NC

      - Long Island is significantly east of Raleigh
