      3. **Specific locations are needed:**  While generally true, zip codes within
      each state can vary east/west.  We need more specific location information than
      just the states.

      4. **Look up locations (if possible):**  In a real-world scenario, I''d use
      a zip code lookup tool or map to find the longitude of each zip code.

      5. **Compare longitude:**  A location further west has a *higher* longitude
      value.  So, I''d compare the longitudes to see if 48624 has a higher longitude
      than 63670.


      Since I can''t look up zip codes, I can''t definitively answer.  However, based

      a state, the state-level location is the dominant factor in determining east/west
      placement across such distances.


      3. **Conclusion:** Since Minnesota is west of Texas, zip code 55043 in MN is
      west of zip code 75025 in TX.
