      the East Coast of the United States.

      of one being "west" of the other refers to relative longitude.  Lower longitude
      values are further west.

      4. **General East Coast Geography:** New Jersey is north of Florida.  Generally,
      as you go north along the East Coast, longitude values decrease (move westward).

      need to look at the specific locations within the states.


      3. **Consider longitude:**  Longitude is the key to determining east/west position.  A
      higher longitude value indicates further West.


      4. **(Optional) Use a map or online tool:** A quick search shows Woodbridge,
      VA is significantly west of Clermont, GA.

      further west in the Great Lakes region.

      3. **Westward direction:**  Moving from New Jersey to Michigan requires going
      westward.


      Therefore, 08750, NJ is located **YES** west of 48085, MI. This is incorrect.


      Let me try again:


      1. 08750 is in New Jersey.

      2. 48085 is in Michigan.

      3. New Jersey is EAST of Michigan.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

      2. **General US Geography:** New York is generally north-east, and North Carolina
      is generally south-east.  A more northerly location doesn''t automatically mean
      it''s west, however.

      3. **Consider Longitude:**  Longitude determines east/west position.  Locations
      further west have *lower* longitude values. We need to find or approximate the
      longitude of each zip code.

      4. **Approximate locations:** 11572 is on Long Island, NY. 27604 is near Raleigh,
      NC. Long Island is significantly east of Raleigh.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.

      further east will have a higher longitude value.  Since NY is east of NC, we
      would expect a NY zip code to have a higher numerical value related to longitude
      than an NC zip code.
