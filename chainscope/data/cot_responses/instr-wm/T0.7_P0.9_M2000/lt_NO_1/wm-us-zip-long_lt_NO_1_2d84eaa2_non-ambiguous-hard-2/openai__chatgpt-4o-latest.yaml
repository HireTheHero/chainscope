      New Jersey is located west of ZIP code 28107 in North Carolina, we need to compare
      their relative geographic locations, specifically their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.

      - ZIP code 08080 is in Sewell, New Jersey.

      - ZIP code 28107 is in Midland, North Carolina.


      Step 2: Determine the longitude of each location.

      - Sewell, NJ (08080) has a longitude of approximately -75.1 degrees.

      - Midland, NC (28107) has a longitude of approximately -80.5 degrees.


      Step 3: Understand how longitude works.

      - In the Western Hemisphere (which includes the US), a more negative longitude
      means the location is farther west.

      - So, -80.5 (Midland, NC) is farther west than -75.1 (Sewell, NJ).


      Step 4: Compare longitudes.

      - Since -80.5 (28107, NC) is more negative than -75.1 (08080, NJ), 08080, NJ
      is east of 28107, NC.

      steps:


      **Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.**

      - ZIP code 90650 is located in Norwalk/Whittier area in Los Angeles County,
      California. This is in Southern California.

      - ZIP code 97229 is located in the Portland, Oregon metro area. Specifically,
      it''s in the northwestern part of Oregon.


      **Step 2: Understand west vs. east in terms of longitude.**

      - In geographic coordinate systems, locations with smaller (more negative) longitude
      values in the Western Hemisphere are farther west.

      - So, we need to compare the longitudes of 90650 and 97229.


      **Step 3: Look up the approximate longitudes.**

      - ZIP 90650 (California): approximately -118.0 degrees longitude.

      - ZIP 97229 (Oregon): approximately -122.8 degrees longitude.


      **Step 4: Compare the longitudes.**

      New York is located west of ZIP code 29067 in South Carolina, we need to analyze
      their geographical positions based on longitude.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes:**

      - ZIP code 10457 is located in the Bronx, New York City, New York.

      - ZIP code 29067 is located in Kershaw, South Carolina.


      **Step 2: Understand what "west of" means:**

      - A location is considered west of another if its longitude is numerically greater
      in the western hemisphere (i.e., more negative, since longitudes west of the
      Prime Meridian are negative).


      **Step 3: Find the approximate longitudes of each ZIP code:**

      - 10457 (Bronx, NY) is approximately at longitude -73.89.

      - 29067 (Kershaw, SC) is approximately at longitude -80.58.


      **Step 4: Compare the longitudes:**

      - -73.89 (10457) is farther east than -80.58 (29067), because -73.89 is closer
      to zero.

      - Therefore, 10457 is east of 29067.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since 10457 is east of 29067, it is not located west of it.
