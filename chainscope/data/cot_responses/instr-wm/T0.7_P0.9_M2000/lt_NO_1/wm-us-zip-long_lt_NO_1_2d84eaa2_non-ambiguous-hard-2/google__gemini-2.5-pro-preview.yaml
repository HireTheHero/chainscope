    56629312-16cd-45e5-9051-a4f27bfd0e16: 'Okay, here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of zip code 08628:** This zip code is in Ewing Township
      / Trenton, New Jersey (NJ).

      2.  **Identify the location of zip code 38834:** This zip code is in Corinth,
      Mississippi (MS).

      3.  **Determine the relative geographical positions:** New Jersey is an East
      Coast state. Mississippi is a Southern state, located significantly west of
      New Jersey.

      4.  **Compare longitudes (conceptually):** Locations further east have smaller
      (less negative) West longitudes or positive East longitudes. Locations further
      west have larger (more negative) West longitudes. New Jersey is much further
      east than Mississippi.

      5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, 08628, NJ is located *east* of 38834, MS.

      code 80130 is primarily for Larkspur, Colorado (and areas around it like Castle
      Rock).

      2.  **Identify the location of 85255, AZ:** A quick search reveals that zip
      code 85255 is primarily for Scottsdale, Arizona.

      3.  **Compare the states:** Arizona (AZ) is geographically west of Colorado
      (CO).

      4.  **Compare the specific locations:** Scottsdale, AZ is west of Larkspur/Castle
      Rock, CO.

      5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if 80130, CO (Larkspur/Castle
      Rock) is west of 85255, AZ (Scottsdale). Since Larkspur/Castle Rock, CO is *east*
      of Scottsdale, AZ, the statement is false.

    f0002553-dc27-4962-acc8-477c3359fb12: 'Okay, here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of 25701, WV:** A quick search reveals that zip
      code 25701 is for Huntington, West Virginia.

      2.  **Identify the location of 60136, IL:** A quick search reveals that zip
      code 60136 is for Geneva, Illinois.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations of West Virginia and Illinois:** West
      Virginia is an eastern US state, part of Appalachia. Illinois is a Midwestern
      US state, located significantly to the west of West Virginia.

      4.  **Determine relative positions:** Therefore, Huntington, West Virginia (25701)
      is located to the *east* of Geneva, Illinois (60136).

      5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if 25701, WV is located *west*
      of 60136, IL. Since Huntington, WV is east of Geneva, IL, the answer is no.

      1.  **Identify the state for 12549:** NY stands for New York.

      2.  **Identify the state for 43160:** OH stands for Ohio.

      3.  **Consider the general geographical locations of New York and Ohio:** New
      York is an East Coast state. Ohio is a Midwestern state, located to the west
      of New York.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, any location in New York (like 12549) will be

      1.  **Identify the location of 07432:** A quick search reveals that 07432 is
      a zip code for Mahwah, New Jersey (NJ).

      2.  **Identify the location of 15139:** A quick search reveals that 15139 is
