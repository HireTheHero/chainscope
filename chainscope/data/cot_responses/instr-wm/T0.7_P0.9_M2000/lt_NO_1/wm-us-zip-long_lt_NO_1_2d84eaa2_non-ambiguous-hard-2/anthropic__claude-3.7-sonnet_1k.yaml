      to determine the geographical locations of these two zip codes and then figure
      out if one is west of the other.


      Let me identify the locations:

      - 06438, CT: This is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)

      - 29206, SC: This is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Now I need to consider the relative positions of these states:

      - Connecticut is in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is in the southeastern United States


      When comparing east-west positioning in the US, we can use longitude. Places
      further west have higher longitude values.


      Connecticut is generally located to the northeast of South Carolina, which means
      Connecticut would be east (not west) of South Carolina.


      Therefore, 06438, CT would be east of 29206, SC, not west of it.</think># Is
      06438, CT located west of 29206, SC?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 06438 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 29206 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - When looking at a US map, Connecticut is positioned significantly to the east
      of South Carolina.

      - Connecticut is on the Atlantic coast in New England

      - South Carolina is also on the Atlantic coast, but much further south and west
      of Connecticut


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Connecticut is east of South Carolina (not west of it), zip code 06438
      in CT cannot be west of zip code 29206 in SC.


      NO'

      - Is 06438, CT located west of 29206, SC?


      I need to determine the geographic locations of these zip codes and then compare
      their east-west positions.


      06438 is in Connecticut (CT)

      29206 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Looking at the map of the United States:

      - Connecticut is a state in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is a state in the southeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude):

      - Connecticut is further east than South Carolina

      - States on the East Coast generally follow this pattern from north to south:
      Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New
      Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
      Florida


      So Connecticut is northeast of South Carolina, which means Connecticut is NOT
      west of South Carolina. In fact, it''s east of South Carolina.</think># Is 06438,
      CT located west of 29206, SC?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 06438 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 29206 is in South Carolina (SC)


      ## Step 2: Determine geographical positions

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      Looking at the map of the United States, Connecticut is positioned significantly
      to the east of South Carolina on the Atlantic coast. The entire state of Connecticut
      is east of South Carolina, not west.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 06438, CT is not located west of 29206, SC. It is located east of it.'
    55a3c877-a151-48c9-a699-febc1ba54ebd: '<think>This question asks whether 06438,
      CT (Connecticut) is located west of 29206, SC (South Carolina).


      To answer this, I need to understand the relative positions of Connecticut and
      South Carolina in the United States.


      The United States'' East Coast runs roughly from northeast to southwest. Connecticut
      is a New England state in the northeastern US, while South Carolina is a state
      in the southeastern US.


      Specifically:

      - Connecticut is positioned in the northeast, bordering New York, Massachusetts,
      and Rhode Island

      - South Carolina is positioned in the southeast, bordering North Carolina, Georgia,
      and the Atlantic Ocean


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Connecticut is clearly located to the northeast
      of South Carolina. This means Connecticut is east of South Carolina, not west.


      So, 06438, CT (a zip code in Connecticut) would be east of 29206, SC (a zip
      code in South Carolina), not west.</think>To determine if 06438, CT is located
      west of 29206, SC, I need to understand the geographic locations of these zip
      codes and their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 06438 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 29206 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states on the US map.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in
      the New England region.

      - South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship between these states.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is positioned to the
      northeast of South Carolina.

      - In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Connecticut is to the east
      of South Carolina, not to the west.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 06438 is in Connecticut and 29206 is in South Carolina, the Connecticut
      zip code must be east of the South Carolina zip code.

      29206 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Connecticut (CT) is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - South Carolina (SC) is in the southeastern part of the United States


      When comparing east-west positions in the US, places with lower longitudes (more
      negative numbers, since US longitudes are west and thus negative) are further
      west.


      In terms of the east-west positioning, Connecticut is generally east of South
      Carolina. The entire state of Connecticut is positioned to the east of South
      Carolina on a US map.

      3) When looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is positioned significantly
      to the east of South Carolina.


      4) The entire state of Connecticut lies east of South Carolina on the Atlantic
      coast.


      5) Therefore, any ZIP code in Connecticut (including 06438) would be located

      the relative geographical positions of two US zip codes:

      1. 22150, VA (Virginia)

      2. 31210, GA (Georgia)


      Specifically, I need to determine if the Virginia zip code is west of the Georgia
      zip code.


      I need to think about the general geographic positions of these states. The
      US eastern seaboard, from north to south, includes:

      - Maine

      - New Hampshire

      - Vermont

      - Massachusetts

      - Rhode Island

      - Connecticut

      - New York

      - New Jersey

      - Delaware

      - Maryland

      - Virginia

      - North Carolina

      - South Carolina

      - Georgia

      - Florida


      Looking at this list, Virginia is north of Georgia. But the question is asking
      about east/west positioning, not north/south.


      In terms of east/west positioning:

      - Virginia is along the Atlantic coast

      - Georgia is also along the Atlantic coast, but extends further west than Virginia


      Generally speaking, Georgia is west of Virginia, not the other way around. So
      a zip code in Virginia would typically be east of a zip code in Georgia, not
      west.</think>To determine if 22150, VA is west of 31210, GA, I need to think
      about the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, north of North
      Carolina.

      Georgia is also on the eastern seaboard, but further south, below the Carolinas.


      Step 3: Analyze the east-west relationship.

      Looking at a map of the US, Georgia is generally positioned to the west of Virginia
      when comparing their overall longitude. The Atlantic coastline angles westward
      as you move south from Virginia to Georgia.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on these relative positions.

      Since Georgia is positioned to the west of Virginia on the map, a zip code in
      Virginia (22150) would be east of a zip code in Georgia (31210), not west.


      NO'
    2646cb76-8917-4b36-ad5b-553b580721a0: '<think>To determine whether 22150, VA is
      located west of 31210, GA, I need to find the approximate locations of these
      zip codes and compare their east-west positions.


      22150 is a zip code in Virginia (VA). Let me recall the general location of
      Virginia. Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States, roughly
      in the mid-Atlantic region.


      31210 is a zip code in Georgia (GA). Georgia is also on the eastern side of
      the United States, but is located south of Virginia. Georgia is generally in
      the southeastern U.S.


      In terms of east-west positioning, I need to consider their relative longitudes.
      The eastern United States generally has states arranged such that as you go
      further south, you also tend to go further west. This is because the eastern
      coastline curves from northeast to southwest.


      Virginia is more northern than Georgia. And since the east coast curves, Virginia
      is typically going to be more eastern (not western) than Georgia.


      So without knowing the exact coordinates, my geographical knowledge suggests
      that 22150, VA is likely EAST of 31210, GA - not west of it.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these

      Step 1: Identify the states and their general locations.

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic eastern seaboard

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - On a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned to the west of Virginia

      - Virginia is closer to the Atlantic coast than Georgia

      - The US East Coast curves inward as it moves south, placing Georgia further
      west


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - 22150 (Springfield area in VA) is in the eastern part of Virginia

      - 31210 (Macon area in GA) is in central Georgia

      - When comparing these specific locations, 22150 is east of 31210

      22150 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).

      31210 is a zip code in Georgia (GA).


      Now I need to think about the relative locations of these states and specifically
      these zip codes.


      Virginia is on the east coast of the United States, roughly in the mid-Atlantic
      region.

      Georgia is also on the east coast, but further south than Virginia.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Georgia is generally west of Virginia when
      looking at the U.S. map. This is because the east coast curves, with states
      further south also being further west.


      However, I need to be specific about these zip codes. Let me think about their
      likely locations:


      22150 is in Virginia, and zip codes starting with 22 are typically in the northern
      Virginia area near Washington D.C.

      31210 is in Georgia, and zip codes starting with 31 are typically in central
      Georgia.


      Given that Virginia is northeast of Georgia, and these specific zip codes appear
      to follow the general pattern of their states, 22150 in VA would be east of
      31210 in GA, not west.


      Therefore, 22150, VA is NOT located west of 31210, GA. It is east of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 22150 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 31210 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      Next, I need to consider the geographic positions of these states:

      - Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic east coast

      - Georgia is located on the southeastern coast, south of Virginia


      Looking at a US map, while Georgia is south of Virginia, it''s also positioned
      more westward due to the curved shape of the eastern coastline. Generally speaking,
      as you move south along the east coast, you also move slightly west.


      Specifically for these zip codes:

      - 22150 is in the Springfield area of northern Virginia, near Washington DC

      - 31210 is in the Macon area of central Georgia


      When comparing their longitudinal positions, Virginia''s position (including
      22150) is east of Georgia''s position (including 31210).

      - 30342 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)\n- 77340 is a zip code in Texas (TX)\n\
      \nIn the United States, generally:\n- Georgia is on the east coast/southeastern\
      \ US\n- Texas is in the south-central US\n\nIn terms of relative positioning,\
      \ Texas is generally west of Georgia. So a zip code in Georgia would typically\

      \ on the eastern side of the continental US\n- Texas is west of Georgia in terms\
      \ of longitude\n\nStep 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.\nSince 30342\

      Step 1: First, I need to understand which states GA and TX refer to.

      - GA is Georgia, a state in the southeastern United States.

      - TX is Texas, a state in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Let me think about the general geographic positions of Georgia and Texas.

      - Georgia is on the east coast of the US, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Texas is further west than Georgia, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: In terms of cardinal directions, Texas is generally west of Georgia.


      Step 4: Therefore, a zip code in Georgia (30342) would be east of a zip code
      in Texas (77340), not west of it.


      The answer is NO, 30342, GA is not located west of 77340, TX. It''s actually

      - 77340 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Georgia and Texas.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, extending to the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Georgia is positioned entirely east of Texas on the US map.

      - All Georgia zip codes (including 30342) are east of Texas zip codes (including
      77340).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      - Since Georgia is east of Texas, 30342 in Georgia must be east of 77340 in
      Texas, not west of it.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast.
      Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering Mexico and the
      Gulf of Mexico.


      Geographically speaking, Texas is generally west of Georgia. When we look at

      Now, let''s think about the specific zip codes:

      - 30342 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      - 77340 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Since Georgia is east of Texas, and these zip codes are in their respective

      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States along the Atlantic
      coast.

      Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf

      Step 2: Compare the general east-west positioning of these states.

      On a map of the United States, Texas is positioned to the west of Georgia.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 30342 is in Georgia and 77340 is in Texas, and Georgia is east of Texas,
      the zip code 30342 would be east (not west) of zip code 77340.

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - Georgia lies entirely to the east of Texas on the U.S. map

      - When moving from east to west across the United States, you would encounter
      Georgia before Texas


      Step 4: Conclusion

      to determine if 08080, NJ (New Jersey) is located west of 28107, NC (North Carolina).


      First, I need to think about the geography of the eastern United States:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the east coast of the United States

      - North Carolina (NC) is also on the east coast, but further south


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally located northeast of North Carolina

      - The relevant question is whether NJ is east or west of NC


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - New Jersey is roughly aligned with the eastern part of Pennsylvania

      - North Carolina is west of the Atlantic Ocean and east of Tennessee


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is EAST of North Carolina, not west. Almost the
      entire state of North Carolina is west of almost the entire state of New Jersey.


      Since zip code 08080 is in New Jersey and zip code 28107 is in North Carolina,
      the New Jersey zip code would be EAST of the North Carolina zip code, not west.</think>#
      Is 08080, NJ located west of 28107, NC?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 08080 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 28107 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is on the mid-Atlantic coast

      - North Carolina is also on the Atlantic coast, but further south


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New Jersey is located in the northeastern part of the US

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern US

      - Looking at a map of the US, New Jersey is positioned to the EAST of North
      Carolina


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 08080 is in New Jersey, and 28107 is in North Carolina, the New Jersey
      zip code is positioned to the east of the North Carolina zip code, not to the
      west.

      New Hampshire is located in New England on the eastern coast of the United States.

      New York is located west of New Hampshire.


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since New Hampshire is entirely east of New York state, any location in New
      Hampshire (including 03784) must be east of any location in New York (including
      14206).


      ## Step 4: Determine the answer

      If 03784, NH is east of 14206, NY, then it cannot be west of it.

      NH is located west of 14206, NY.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east-west orientation)


      Let''s think about US geography first:

      - NH is New Hampshire, located in the northeastern US

      - NY is New York, also in the northeastern US


      New Hampshire is generally located east of New York state. The entire state
      of New Hampshire is east of most of New York state.


      Let''s get more specific:

      - 03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire

      - 14206 is a zip code in New York


      The specific location of 14206, NY is Buffalo, NY, which is in the western part
      of New York state.

      The specific location of 03784, NH is likely somewhere in New Hampshire, which
      is entirely east of Buffalo, NY.


      So if 03784 is in New Hampshire and 14206 is in Buffalo, NY, then 03784 would
      be east of 14206, not west of it.</think># Is 03784, NH located west of 14206,
      NY?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 14206 is a zip code in New York state (NY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship

      - New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States

      - New York is also in the northeastern United States, but west of New Hampshire

      - More specifically, 14206 appears to be in the Buffalo area of western New
      York

      - 03784 is in New Hampshire, which lies entirely east of Buffalo, NY


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      Since New Hampshire is east of western New York (where Buffalo is located),
      zip code 03784 in NH must be east of zip code 14206 in NY, not west of it.


      NO'

      First, let me understand what these codes represent:

      - 03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 14206 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      A location with a more negative (or less positive) longitude is further west.


      However, I don''t have the exact longitude coordinates for these zip codes.
      But I can use general geographic knowledge about the states:


      New Hampshire (NH) is in New England, in the northeastern United States, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      New York (NY) is also in the northeastern United States, but is generally west
      of New Hampshire.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, New Hampshire is east of New York state.
      The entire state of New Hampshire lies east of most of New York state.


      Therefore, 03784, NH should be east of 14206, NY, not west of it.</think># Is
      03784, NH located west of 14206, NY?

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 03784 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 14206 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Hampshire is located in New England, in the northeastern United States

      - New York is also in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - New York state is positioned to the west of New Hampshire

      - The entire state of New Hampshire lies to the east of most of New York state


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 03784 is in NH and 14206 is in NY, the NH zip code would be to the east
      of the NY zip code


      Therefore, 03784, NH is NOT located west of 14206, NY.

      is located west of 14206, NY. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 14206 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic locations of New Hampshire and New York.

      New Hampshire is in New England, in the northeastern United States. New York
      is also in the northeastern United States, but generally west of New Hampshire.
      New Hampshire borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and Vermont on the west.
      New York is west of Vermont.


      Step 3: Consider more specifically the locations.

      Since we have specific zip codes, I need to consider where in NH and NY these
      zip codes are located. However, without the exact details of these zip codes,
      I can make a general assessment:

      - NH is entirely east of NY state

      - No part of NH is west of any part of NY


      Step 4: Make a conclusion.

      Since NH is east of NY geographically, zip code 03784 in NH must be east of
      zip code 14206 in NY, not west of it.</think>I need to determine if 03784, NH
      is located west of 14206, NY.


      Step 1: Let''s identify the general geographic positions of New Hampshire and
      New York.

      New Hampshire (NH) is in New England in the northeastern United States. New
      York (NY) is also in the northeastern US, but is positioned to the west of New
      Hampshire.


      Step 2: Looking at the relative positions of these states, New Hampshire shares
      its western border with Vermont, and Vermont shares its western border with
      New York. This means that New Hampshire is entirely east of New York.


      Step 3: Since all locations in New Hampshire are east of New York, zip code
      03784 in NH must be east of zip code 14206 in NY, not west of it.

      - 03784, NH: This is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 14206, NY: This is in New York (NY)


      Now, I need to think about the relative positions of these states. In the US,
      positions west correspond to higher longitude values (more negative numbers,
      since US longitudes are in the western hemisphere).


      Generally speaking:

      - New Hampshire is in New England, in the northeastern United States

      - New York is also in the northeastern United States, but generally west of
      New Hampshire


      New Hampshire borders Maine to the east, Massachusetts to the south, and Vermont
      to the west. New York is west of Vermont. So the standard geography of these
      states suggests that New Hampshire is east of New York, not west of it.


      That means that 03784, NH is likely east of 14206, NY, not west of it.


      But to be thorough, let me consider the specific zip codes, since states can
      have unusual shapes and border areas might have unexpected relationships.


      03784 is a zip code in New Hampshire. Without specific data on this zip code,
      I can assume it''s somewhere within New Hampshire.


      14206 is a zip code in New York. Again, without specific data, I can assume
      it''s somewhere in New York.


      Given the overall geography of these states, it''s most likely that any point
      in New Hampshire is east of any point in New York, not west.</think># Determining

      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of these

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 03784 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 14206 is in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in
      New England. New York state is also in the northeast, but is positioned to the
      west of New Hampshire.


      ## Step 3: Look at the specific zip codes

      - 03784 is in New Hampshire, which is entirely east of most of New York state

      - 14206 is in Buffalo, NY, which is in the western part of New York state


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      Since New Hampshire is east of New York state, and specifically 03784 (NH) would
      be east of 14206 (Buffalo, NY), the New Hampshire location is NOT west of the
      New York location.

    7539c092-a331-432f-a7bd-a815dd55b373: '<think>This question asks if the zip code
      72023 in Arkansas is located west of the zip code 75033 in Texas.


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic locations
      of these two zip codes. I''ll break this down:


      1. 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)

      2. 75033 is in Texas (TX)


      Generally, Arkansas is located to the east of Texas. The eastern border of Texas
      meets the western border of Arkansas. This means that locations in Arkansas
      are typically east of locations in Texas.


      However, there''s a complication - zip codes don''t always follow a perfect
      west-to-east ordering, and the specific locations within each state matter.
      For example, a location in eastern Texas could be east of a location in western
      Arkansas.


      Looking at the zip code patterns:

      - Arkansas zip codes generally start with 716-729

      - Texas zip codes generally start with 750-799


      The fact that 72023 (AR) has a lower prefix than 75033 (TX) is consistent with
      the general pattern that eastern states tend to have lower zip code ranges than
      western states. This is because zip codes generally increase as you go from
      east to west in the US.


      Based on the zip code ranges and the general geographic positions of Arkansas
      and Texas, I can conclude that 72023 in Arkansas is east of 75033 in Texas,
      not west.</think># Determining if 72023, AR is west of 75033, TX


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 75033 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states

      Arkansas and Texas share a border, with Arkansas positioned to the east of Texas.
      Generally, locations in Arkansas are east of locations in Texas.


      ## Step 3: Check if there might be exceptions

      While there could be geographic irregularities at state borders, zip code patterns
      can provide additional confirmation. US zip codes generally increase from east
      to west. The fact that 72023 (AR) has a lower number than 75033 (TX) reinforces
      that the Arkansas location is to the east.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 72023, AR is not located west of 75033, TX. It is located to the east.'

      is located west of 75033, TX (Texas), I need to compare their geographic locations.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Arkansas is located to the east of Texas, not west of it.

      - Texas is the westernmost state of these two.


      Now, let me think about zip codes:

      - US zip codes generally increase from west to east

      - The first digit of the zip code often indicates the general region

      - 7xxxx zip codes are in the central/south-central region of the US


      Looking at the specific zip codes:

      - 72023 (in Arkansas) starts with "72"

      - 75033 (in Texas) starts with "75"


      Since the zip code for Arkansas (72023) has a lower number than the zip code
      for Texas (75033), and generally zip codes increase from west to east, this
      suggests that 72023 would be WEST of 75033.


      However, I need to be careful because the general rule that zip codes increase
      from west to east has exceptions, especially within regions.


      Let me double-check by recalling the general geographic positions:

      - Arkansas is EAST of Texas (not west)

      - But the zip code of Arkansas (72xxx) is lower than Texas (75xxx)


      This seems contradictory. Let me reconsider...


      Actually, I think I made an error. While zip codes do generally increase from
      west to east across the country overall, within regions there can be different
      patterns. The first digit "7" puts both locations in the same general region,
      but the second digit can follow different patterns.


      Let me recall the geographic facts: Arkansas borders Texas on Texas''s eastern
      side. So a location in Arkansas would be EAST of Texas, not west.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      To determine if 72023, AR is located west of 75033, TX, I need to analyze the
      geographic relationship between these locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 75033 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between Arkansas and Texas

      - Arkansas and Texas are neighboring states

      - Arkansas is located to the east of Texas (Texas shares its eastern border
      with Arkansas)


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      - While zip codes generally follow patterns, the fundamental geography is that
      Arkansas is positioned east of Texas

      - No matter which specific locations within these states these zip codes represent,
      an Arkansas location cannot be west of a Texas location


      ## Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Since Arkansas is east of Texas, 72023 (in AR) must be east of 75033 (in TX),
      not west of it.

      positions on a map.


      Zip code 72023 is in Arkansas (AR).

      Zip code 75033 is in Texas (TX).


      I need to find out if 72023, AR is located west of 75033, TX.


      Looking at the US map, Arkansas is generally east of Texas. Texas extends further
      west than Arkansas. However, zip codes can be in different parts of their states,
      so I need to consider the specific locations.


      Arkansas (72023) is in the central part of the US, while Texas (75033) is in
      the south-central part of the US.


      The first digits of zip codes generally follow a pattern from east to west in
      the US:

      - 0 and 1 are in the Northeast

      - 2 and 3 are in the South and Southeast

      - 4 and 5 are in the Midwest

      - 6 and 7 are in the Central and South-Central

      - 8 and 9 are in the West


      Both zip codes start with 7, indicating they''re in the Central/South-Central
      region. But 72xxx is for Arkansas, while 75xxx is for Texas.


      Since Arkansas (72xxx) has a lower second digit than Texas (75xxx), and given
      the general pattern of zip codes, Arkansas would be more to the east than this
      part of Texas.


      So 72023, AR would be east of 75033, TX, not west of it.</think>I''ll solve
      this step by step by figuring out the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 72023 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 75033 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship of these states

      - Arkansas is located to the east of Texas on the US map


      Step 3: Check if these specific zip codes change this relationship

      - US zip codes are assigned in a pattern where the first three digits indicate
      region

      - 720xx is in central Arkansas

      - 750xx is in northeastern Texas (Dallas area/Frisco region)


      Step 4: Determine relative positions

      - Looking at these specific regions, 72023 (Arkansas) is still to the east of
      75033 (Texas)

      - The zip code 75033 is in the eastern part of Texas, but Arkansas (72023) is
      still further east


      NO'

      located west of 75033, TX, I need to find the locations of these two zip codes
      and compare their longitudes.


      72023 is a zip code in Arkansas (AR).

      75033 is a zip code in Texas (TX).


      To determine which one is more westerly, I need to know their approximate locations:


      Arkansas is a state that lies to the east of Texas, generally speaking. Texas
      is the larger state that extends further west than Arkansas.


      Looking at the initial digits of the zip codes can give us a general idea too.
      In the US zip code system, lower numbers tend to be in the eastern parts of
      the country, while higher numbers tend to be in the western parts. So 72023
      (starting with 72) would generally be east of 75033 (starting with 75).


      However, this isn''t a perfect indicator, especially for states that are adjacent
      to each other. So let''s think more specifically about these zip codes.


      72023 appears to be in Arkansas, which is entirely east of Texas.

      75033 appears to be in Texas, and based on the first two digits (75), it''s
      likely in the eastern part of Texas.


      Even though 75033 is in the eastern part of Texas, Texas extends much further
      west than Arkansas does. So it''s very unlikely that a location in Arkansas
      would be west of a location in Texas, even one in eastern Texas.


      Therefore, 72023, AR is almost certainly east of 75033, TX, not west of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 72023 is a zip code in Arkansas (AR)

      - 75033 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Arkansas is positioned entirely east of Texas. The entire state of Arkansas
      sits to the east of Texas on a map of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Even though zip codes generally increase as you move westward in the US (and
      75033 > 72023), the state locations are more important here. Regardless of which
      part of Arkansas 72023 is in, and which part of Texas 75033 is in, any location
      in Arkansas will be east of any location in Texas.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their positions.

      Since 72023 is in Arkansas and Arkansas is east of Texas (where 75033 is located),
      72023 cannot be west of 75033.

      - Western states have higher longitude values


      New York is located in the northeastern United States.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States.


      When comparing east-west positions, we need to compare longitudes:

      - If location A has a LOWER longitude than location B, then A is EAST of B

      - If location A has a HIGHER longitude than location B, then A is WEST of B


      New York is generally east of Georgia. Therefore, 10918, NY would typically

      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 11768, NY refers to a zip code in New York

      - 45342, OH refers to a zip code in Ohio


      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      A location with a more negative (or less positive) longitude is further west.


      Let me recall the general geographic positions:

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, west of New York


      Generally speaking, locations in New York would be east of locations in Ohio,

      - NY is New York state, which is in the northeastern US

      - OH is Ohio state, which is in the midwestern US

      In terms of east-west positioning in the US, states further east have lower

      In the US, locations are generally arranged such that:

      - Eastern states (like NY) are further east

      - Western states (like those on the Pacific coast) are further west


      New York is on the east coast of the United States, while Ohio is more inland
      and west of New York.


      Generally speaking:

      - New York is east of Ohio

      - Ohio is west of New York

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest, west of New York


      Since 11768 is in New York and 45342 is in Ohio, the general geographic positioning

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest, west of New York


      In general, locations in New York would be east of locations in Ohio, not west.
      This is because as you move west across the United States from the Atlantic
      Ocean, you encounter New York before Ohio.


      So my initial expectation is that 11768, NY would be east of 45342, OH, not

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region

      - When looking at a US map, Ohio is positioned west of New York


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic knowledge to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 11768 is in New York and 45342 is in Ohio

      - 10598 is in New York (NY)

      - 43207 is in Ohio (OH)


      In general, in the United States, New York is located east of Ohio. This is
      because:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the US

      - New York is in the Northeast region of the US


      When we look at a map of the United States, we see that Ohio is west of New
      York (or equivalently, New York is east of Ohio).


      So if 10598 is in New York and 43207 is in Ohio, then 10598 would be east of
      43207, not west of it.


      Therefore, 10598, NY is NOT located west of 43207, OH.</think># Is 10598, NY
      located west of 43207, OH?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 10598 is in New York (NY)

      - 43207 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      In the United States, Ohio is located west of New York. Looking at a US map,
      New York is in the Northeast, while Ohio is in the Midwest region.


      ## Step 3: Determine the answer

      Since New York is east of Ohio (not west), any location in New York (including
      zip code 10598) would be east of locations in Ohio (including zip code 43207).

      First, I need to recall the general geography of the US states:

      - New York (NY) is located in the northeastern United States

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the midwestern United States, west of New York


      In general, Ohio is west of New York. However, I need to check if this specific
      relationship holds for these particular zip codes.


      Zip code 10598 is in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      Zip code 43207 is in Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the midwest, and is west of New York.


      Since Ohio is west of New York, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, zip code 10598 (NY) would be east of zip code 43207 (OH), not west of
      it.


      So, 10598, NY is NOT located west of 43207, OH. It''s actually east of it.</think>#

      - 43207 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern United States


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - Ohio is positioned west of New York in the United States

      - Therefore, New York (including zip code 10598) is east of Ohio (including
      zip code 43207)


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      - Since 10598, NY is east of 43207, OH (not west of it), the statement is incorrect

      located west of 38611, MS, I need to:


      1. Identify where 24073, VA is located (which city/county in Virginia)

      2. Identify where 38611, MS is located (which city/county in Mississippi)

      3. Compare their geographic positions (longitudes) to determine which is further
      west


      First, let''s think about the geographic positioning of Virginia and Mississippi
      in general:

      - Virginia is on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Mississippi is further west, bordering the Mississippi River


      In general, most of Mississippi is west of Virginia. However, I need to check
      the specific zip codes to be certain.


      24073 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      38611 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)


      Since Mississippi is generally west of Virginia (Mississippi is in the southern
      central part of the US while Virginia is on the east coast), it''s likely that
      38611, MS is west of 24073, VA.


      However, I need to be careful about the exact locations. Virginia extends quite
      far west into the Appalachian Mountains, and Mississippi''s eastern border is
      with Alabama. So I should verify the specific locations before concluding.


      Based on general US geography, Mississippi is west of Virginia, so 24073, VA
      would be EAST of 38611, MS, not west of it.</think># Is 24073, VA located west
      of 38611, MS?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 24073 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 38611 is in Mississippi (MS)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions of these states

      Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Mississippi
      is located in the south-central United States, along the Mississippi River.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Mississippi is significantly west of Virginia on the US map

      - All locations in Mississippi have a more westerly longitude than most locations
      in Virginia


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Mississippi is west of Virginia geographically, 24073 VA cannot be west
      of 38611 MS. The Virginia zip code is east of the Mississippi zip code.

      located west of 38611, MS, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these two zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me recall US geography:

      - VA stands for Virginia, which is on the east coast of the United States

      - MS stands for Mississippi, which is in the southern United States, closer
      to the center of the country


      In general, Virginia is east of Mississippi. The eastern states like Virginia
      are closer to the Atlantic Ocean, while Mississippi is further west, closer
      to the Mississippi River.


      Since 24073 is in Virginia (VA) and 38611 is in Mississippi (MS), and Virginia
      is east of Mississippi, then 24073, VA would be EAST of 38611, MS - not west.

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern side of the United States, along the Atlantic
      Coast.

      - Mississippi is located in the southern United States, west of Alabama and
      east of Louisiana, along the Mississippi River.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Looking at a US map, Mississippi is clearly west of Virginia.

      - Virginia is in the eastern portion of the United States while Mississippi
      is more centrally located.


      Step 4: Determine the directional relationship.

      - Since Mississippi is west of Virginia, any zip code in Mississippi would generally
      be west of any zip code in Virginia.

      2. Identify the approximate geographic location of 38611, MS

      3. Compare their longitudes to determine which is further west


      First, let''s think about the general geography of these states:

      - Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf

      Generally speaking, Mississippi is west of Virginia. So my initial guess would

      of 38611, MS.


      Since Virginia is on the east coast and Mississippi is significantly further
      west, it''s very likely that any location in Virginia would be east of any location
      in Mississippi. This is because Mississippi is approximately in the middle of

      - When looking at a US map, Virginia is significantly to the east of Mississippi

      - All of Virginia is east of all of Mississippi in terms of longitude


      Step 3: Since zip code 24073 is in Virginia, and zip code 38611 is in Mississippi,
      their relative positions follow the positions of their respective states.

      if 49453, MI (Michigan) is located west of 50703, IA (Iowa).


      To answer this question, I need to figure out the relative geographical positions
      of these two zip codes.


      First, let me think about the general geography of Michigan and Iowa. Michigan
      is in the Great Lakes region in the eastern part of the Midwest, while Iowa
      is further west in the Midwest.


      Generally speaking:

      - Michigan is east of Iowa

      - Iowa is west of Michigan


      But I need to be specific about these particular zip codes.


      49453 is a zip code in Michigan (MI).

      50703 is a zip code in Iowa (IA).


      Given the standard arrangement of zip codes in the US, lower numbers tend to
      be in the eastern states and higher numbers tend to be in the western states.
      But within states, this pattern doesn''t necessarily hold.


      Since 49453 (MI) has a lower number than 50703 (IA), and Michigan is generally
      east of Iowa, I would conclude that 49453, MI is located east of 50703, IA,
      not west.


      Therefore, 49453, MI is NOT located west of 50703, IA.</think># Is 49453, MI
      located west of 50703, IA?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Understand the state locations

      Michigan (MI) and Iowa (IA) are both in the Midwest, but Michigan is located
      in the eastern part of the Midwest while Iowa is located farther west.


      ## Step 2: Consider state geography

      Michigan is positioned east of Iowa on the US map. Iowa borders the Mississippi
      River on its east side, while Michigan is primarily located between Lake Michigan
      and Lake Huron.


      ## Step 3: Apply zip code knowledge

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where codes increase as you move from
      east to west across the country. The first digit of the zip code reflects this
      pattern:

      - 4xxxx (like 49453) covers Michigan and other Great Lakes states

      - 5xxxx (like 50703) covers Iowa, Minnesota, and other western Midwest states


      ## Conclusion

      Since Michigan is east of Iowa geographically, and this is consistent with the
      zip code pattern (4xxxx east of 5xxxx), 49453, MI is located EAST of 50703,
      IA, not west.

      49453, MI refers to a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      50703, IA refers to a zip code in Iowa (IA)


      Geographically speaking:

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, in the upper Midwest/Eastern part of
      the United States

      - Iowa is also in the Midwest, but generally west of Michigan


      Looking at the relative positions of these states, Michigan is east of Iowa.
      So generally, a location in Michigan would be east of a location in Iowa, not

      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 50703 is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest

      - Iowa is also in the Midwest, but positioned to the west of Michigan


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      When looking at a US map, Michigan is positioned to the east of Iowa. This means
      that locations in Michigan (including 49453) are generally east of locations
      in Iowa (including 50703).

      to determine the locations of these zip codes and then figure out their geographic
      relationship.


      Step 1: Identify the zip codes and their states.

      - 23834 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 45439 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the general geographic positioning of these states.

      Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States, while Ohio is more
      inland and to the west of Virginia. Generally speaking, Ohio is west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Since the zip codes are in these respective states, I need to determine
      if 23834 (VA) is west of 45439 (OH).

      Since Ohio is generally west of Virginia, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, it''s likely that 23834 (VA) is east of 45439 (OH), not west of it.


      Therefore, 23834 (VA) is NOT west of 45439 (OH). It''s east of it.</think>#
      Is 23834, VA located west of 45439, OH?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 23834 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 45439 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between VA and OH

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Ohio is located inland, west of Virginia

      - On a map of the US, Ohio is positioned to the west of Virginia


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since Ohio as a state is positioned west of Virginia, zip code 45439 in Ohio
      would be west of zip code 23834 in Virginia. This means that the Virginia zip
      code is NOT west of the Ohio zip code, but rather east of it.

      77362 in Texas is located west of the zip code 58501 in North Dakota. To do
      this, I need to consider the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      First, let''s establish the locations:

      - 77362 is in Texas (TX)

      - 58501 is in North Dakota (ND)


      In the United States, longitude determines east-west position, with smaller
      longitude numbers indicating more western locations. So I need to compare the
      longitudes of these zip codes.


      Generally speaking:

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US

      - North Dakota is in the northern central part of the US


      While both states are in the central part of the country, Texas tends to extend
      further east than North Dakota. North Dakota''s western border aligns with Montana,
      while Texas extends east to border Louisiana.


      I don''t have the exact longitude coordinates for these specific zip codes,
      but based on the general geography of the US:

      - 77xxx zip codes in Texas are typically in the eastern part of Texas

      - 58xxx zip codes in North Dakota are typically in the central part of North
      Dakota


      Based on this general knowledge, it''s likely that 77362, TX is east of 58501,
      ND, not west of it.</think># Is 77362, TX located west of 58501, ND?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the general locations

      - 77362 is in Texas (TX)

      - 58501 is in North Dakota (ND)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical positions

      Texas is located in the south-central United States, while North Dakota is in
      the northern central United States.


      ## Step 3: Analyze zip code patterns

      - ZIP codes generally increase from east to west in the US

      - 77xxx series ZIP codes are in eastern Texas

      - 58xxx series ZIP codes are in central/western North Dakota


      ## Step 4: Compare their positions on a west-east axis

      North Dakota sits in the northern Great Plains region, with its western border
      aligned with Montana.

      Texas extends further east than North Dakota, with 77xxx ZIP codes being in
      the eastern portion of Texas.


      Therefore, 77362 in Texas would be east of 58501 in North Dakota, not west of
      it.

      Let me think about the states:

      - MN is Minnesota, which is in the upper Midwest

      - KS is Kansas, which is in the central United States


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Minnesota is north of Kansas

      - But in terms of east-west positioning, Minnesota is generally east of Kansas

      - Kansas is directly south of Nebraska and directly west of Missouri

      - Minnesota is west of Wisconsin and east of North and South Dakota


      So generally speaking, Minnesota (55404) would be east of Kansas (67037), not
      west.

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 55404 is in Minnesota (MN)

      - 67037 is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positioning of these states.

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Kansas is located in the central Great Plains region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Minnesota is positioned to the east of Kansas on the US map

      - Minnesota borders Wisconsin to the east and the Dakotas to the west

      - Kansas is further west in the continental US than Minnesota


      Step 4: Verify with specific zip codes.

      - The 554xx zip codes cover the Minneapolis area in eastern Minnesota

      - The 670xx zip codes cover the southern Kansas area

      - Even the westernmost parts of Minnesota are generally not as far west as Kansas

      To solve this, I need to:

      2. Compare their east-west positions (longitudes)


      Let me think about what I know about US zip codes and states:

      1) 55404 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN)

      2) 67037 is a zip code in Kansas (KS)

      3) Looking at the geographic layout of the United States, Minnesota is positioned

      Is 55404, MN located west of 67037, KS?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Zip code 55404 is in Minnesota (MN), which is located in the Upper Midwest
      region of the United States.


      2) Zip code 67037 is in Kansas (KS), which is located in the central Great Plains
      region.


      3) Looking at the geographic layout of US states, Minnesota is positioned to
      the northeast of Kansas.


      4) More specifically, Minnesota sits directly north of Iowa, which is northeast
      of Kansas.


      5) Zip code 55404 is in the Minneapolis area of Minnesota, while 67037 is in
      south-central Kansas (near Wichita).


      6) When comparing the east-west positioning (longitude), Minnesota is east of
      Kansas, not west of it.


      ## Answer: NO


      55404, MN is NOT located west of 67037, KS. It is actually located east and
      north of the Kansas zip code.'

      located west of 22407, VA, I need to determine the geographical locations of
      both ZIP codes.


      11239 is a ZIP code in New York (NY). Let me think about where in New York this
      might be. New York ZIP codes generally start with 100-149, with NYC area codes
      typically in the 100-119 range. So 11239 is likely in the New York City area.


      22407 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA). Virginia ZIP codes generally start with
      220-246. 22407 is likely in northern or central Virginia.


      Geographically speaking, New York is generally northeast of Virginia. So a ZIP
      code in New York would typically be east of a ZIP code in Virginia, not west.


      To be more precise:

      - 11239 is in Brooklyn, New York City, NY, which is on the eastern seaboard

      - 22407 is in Fredericksburg, VA, which is also on the eastern seaboard but
      further south


      When we compare east-west positioning, New York is generally to the east of
      Virginia on a map of the United States. The eastern seaboard runs northeast
      to southwest, so locations further north (like New York) are generally further
      east than locations further south (like Virginia).


      So 11239, NY would be east of 22407, VA, not west of it.</think># Is 11239,
      NY located west of 22407, VA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 11239 is a ZIP code in New York (NY), specifically in the Brooklyn area of
      New York City

      - 22407 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA), in the Fredericksburg area


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic position

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is located south of New York along the eastern seaboard

      - On the U.S. east coast, the coastline runs roughly northeast to southwest


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - Locations on the eastern seaboard that are further north (like New York) tend
      to be further east than locations further south (like Virginia)

      - New York City is generally east of Virginia locations


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 11239, NY is not west of 22407, VA. It is actually east of it.'

      First, let me identify where these ZIP codes are located:

      - 11239 is in New York (NY)

      - 22407 is in Virginia (VA)


      In general, New York is northeast of Virginia on the US map. So a typical location
      in New York would be east (and north) of a typical location in Virginia, not
      west.


      Let me be more specific about these ZIP codes:

      - 11239 appears to be in Brooklyn, New York City, which is in the eastern part
      of New York state

      - 22407 appears to be in Fredericksburg, Virginia, which is in the eastern part
      of Virginia


      Given the general geography of the eastern United States, New York is east and
      north of Virginia. Brooklyn (NYC) is on the Atlantic coast in the easternmost
      part of New York, while Fredericksburg, VA is also in the eastern part of Virginia
      but would still be west of NYC.

      Brooklyn is located on the eastern side of New York state, along the Atlantic
      coast.

      Fredericksburg is in northern Virginia, also in the eastern portion of that
      state.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      Eastern locations have higher longitude values than western locations in the
      US.

      Brooklyn, NY is farther east than Fredericksburg, VA.


      Therefore, 11239 (Brooklyn, NY) is located EAST of 22407 (VA), not west.

      - 22407 is in Fredericksburg, Virginia, which is also eastern but south of New
      York


      Looking at their positions on a map, 11239 (Brooklyn, NY) would be to the northeast

      - 11239 is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York.

      - 22407 is a zip code in Fredericksburg, Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the East Coast states.

      - New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States.

      - Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, south of New York.


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      - On a map of the United States, the East Coast generally runs north-northeast
      to south-southwest.

      - New York (including Brooklyn) is positioned to the northeast of Virginia.

      - This means that New York locations are generally east of Virginia locations,
      not west.


      Step 4: Specific zip code comparison.

      - Brooklyn (11239) is on the Atlantic coast of New York.

      - Fredericksburg (22407) is inland from the Atlantic coast in Virginia.

      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      Western locations have higher (more negative) longitude values in the Western
      Hemisphere.


      New York is generally in the northeastern United States, while Virginia is in
      the mid-Atlantic region, south of New York.


      Geographically speaking, New York is east of Virginia, not west. This means
      that 11239, NY should be east of 22407, VA, not west of it.


      However, I should be careful since zip codes don''t always follow a perfect
      east-west pattern. Let me think about the specific zip codes.


      11239 appears to be in Brooklyn, New York City, which is on the eastern coast
      of the US.

      22407 appears to be in Fredericksburg, Virginia, which is also on the eastern
      coast, but south of New York.


      Since both are on the eastern seaboard, and New York is northeast of Virginia,
      the zip code 11239 in NY should be east of 22407 in VA, not west.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographical positions of these
      two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 11239 is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York (NY)

      - 22407 is a zip code in Fredericksburg area, Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while Virginia is in
      the mid-Atlantic region, south of New York.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      When looking at a map of the United States, New York is positioned to the northeast
      of Virginia. This means New York is generally east of Virginia, not west.


      Step 4: Specifically for these zip codes, 11239 (Brooklyn) is on the east coast
      and 22407 (Fredericksburg area) is also on the east coast but further west than
      New York City.

      To determine which is further west, I need to consider their relative positions.
      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast, while West Virginia is inland and

      Since longitude decreases as you move east in the United States (with the easternmost
      points having higher negative values), the location that is further west will
      have a lower longitude value (less negative, or closer to 0).

      First, let me break down the information:

      - 07070 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 26041 is a zip code in West Virginia (WV)


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to consider their geographic
      positions. In the United States, longitude determines east/west positioning
      (lower longitude numbers are further east).


      New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while West
      Virginia is an inland state to the west of New Jersey.


      Based on general geographic knowledge of US states:

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast

      - West Virginia is inland, west of New Jersey


      Since West Virginia is west of New Jersey, zip code 26041 in WV would be west
      of zip code 07070 in NJ.


      Therefore, 07070, NJ is NOT located west of 26041, WV. Rather, it''s the opposite

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      West Virginia is an inland state, positioned to the west of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge about these states'' relative positions.

      When looking at a map of the United States, West Virginia is clearly west of
      New Jersey. This means any location in West Virginia would generally be west
      of locations in New Jersey.


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion about these specific zip codes.

      Since 26041 is in West Virginia, and 07070 is in New Jersey, the zip code 26041
      would be west of 07070 - not the other way around.

      New Mexico zip code to be west of a California zip code. However, I should be
      careful because state borders aren''t straight lines, and there could be exceptions
      depending on the exact locations.


      But in this case, we''re comparing a zip code in New Mexico with one in California.
      California''s eastern border is generally west of New Mexico''s western border.
      So a location in New Mexico would be east of a location in California, not west
      of it.


      Therefore, 88048, NM is not west of 91352, CA - it''s east of it.</think># Analysis
      of ZIP Code Locations


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 88048 is in New Mexico (NM)

      - 91352 is in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of these states

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is an inland state, positioned east of California


      ## Step 3: Compare the geographic positions

      California''s eastern border is west of New Mexico''s western border. Even the
      easternmost parts of California are generally west of any part of New Mexico.


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Since any location in New Mexico (including 88048) would be east of locations
      in California (including 91352), the New Mexico ZIP code cannot be west of the
      California ZIP code.

      2. Identify the location of zip code 91352 in California

      3. Compare their longitudes (east-west positions)


      First, some general knowledge: California is on the west coast of the United
      States, while New Mexico is inland and to the east of California. Generally
      speaking, locations in New Mexico would be east of locations in California.


      Let me think more specifically about these zip codes:

      - 88048 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)

      - 91352 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Since California is west of New Mexico on the US map, and these zip codes are
      in their respective states, it''s highly likely that 88048, NM is east of 91352,

      before New Mexico. California borders the Pacific Ocean on its western edge,
      while New Mexico is several states inland.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 88048 is in New Mexico and 91352 is in California, and California is generally
      west of New Mexico, the zip code in New Mexico would be east of the zip code

      First, let me identify these locations:

      - 88048, NM is a zip code in New Mexico

      - 91352, CA is a zip code in California


      In the United States, states are generally arranged such that:

      - California is on the west coast of the US

      - New Mexico is inland, east of California


      In terms of longitude (which measures east-west position), California is generally
      west of New Mexico. This means locations in California typically have a more
      westerly position (smaller longitude number) than locations in New Mexico.


      Since 88048 is in New Mexico and 91352 is in California, the California zip
      code would generally be west of the New Mexico zip code.


      So 88048, NM would NOT be west of 91352, CA. Rather, it would be east of it.</think>#

      To do this, I need to know the relative east-west positioning of these zip codes,
      which corresponds to their longitude. In the US, lower longitude numbers are
      further west, and higher longitude numbers are further east.


      Let me first recall the general geography of the states:

      - California (CA) is on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico (NM) is inland, east of California


      In general, locations in California tend to be west of locations in New Mexico.
      Since California is on the Pacific coast and New Mexico is several states inland,
      California is generally west of New Mexico.


      So based on state positioning alone, 91352 in California should be west of 88048
      in New Mexico. This would mean the answer is NO.


      However, I should be careful because California is a large state that extends
      quite far north-south, and its eastern border could potentially be east of some
      western parts of New Mexico. But generally speaking, even eastern California
      is west of western New Mexico.</think>I''ll determine this by examining the

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while New Mexico
      is an inland state to the east of California.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      In the United States, states on the west coast (like California) are generally
      west of inland states (like New Mexico). Even the easternmost parts of California

      to find out where 10973, NY and 33901, FL are located, and then determine if
      10973, NY is west of 33901, FL.


      First, let me think about the general geography of New York (NY) and Florida
      (FL) in the United States:

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States


      Generally speaking, New York is north of Florida, but the question is asking
      about east/west positioning, not north/south.


      In terms of east/west:

      - New York is generally east of Florida along the Atlantic coast

      - However, I need to check the specific locations of these zip codes


      Let me recall the approximate longitudes:

      - New York state is roughly around 74-79 degrees west longitude

      - Florida is roughly around 80-87 degrees west longitude


      Since lower longitude numbers indicate more eastern locations in the western
      hemisphere, this suggests that New York is generally east of Florida.


      For 10973, NY - this appears to be a zip code in New York state, which would
      likely be in the eastern part of the US.

      For 33901, FL - this appears to be a zip code in Florida, which would be in
      the southeastern US.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, New York is east of Florida,
      not west. Therefore, 10973, NY would be east of 33901, FL, not west.</think>#
      Determining if 10973, NY is west of 33901, FL


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the general locations

      - 10973 is a zip code in New York state, which is in the northeastern United
      States

      - 33901 is a zip code in Florida, which is in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 2: Consider east-west geography of the US

      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - New York state is generally positioned around 74-79 degrees west longitude

      - Florida is generally positioned around 80-87 degrees west longitude


      ## Step 3: Apply longitude principles

      On a map of the United States, locations with lower longitude numbers (when
      both are negative/west) are more eastern. Since New York has lower longitude
      numbers than Florida, New York is east of Florida.


      ## Step 4: Make the conclusion

      Since 10973, NY is in New York, and 33901, FL is in Florida, the New York location
      is east of the Florida location, not west.

      First, I need to think about the geography of the United States. Generally speaking:

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New York is further east than most states

      - Florida is also quite far east, extending into a peninsula


      Specifically, to compare these two zip codes:

      1. 10973 is a zip code in New York state

      2. 33901 is a zip code in Florida state


      Looking at their geographical positions, New York is generally north of Florida,
      but in terms of east-west positioning, New York and Florida are both on the
      eastern seaboard of the United States. However, New York tends to be slightly

      - 10973 is in New York state, in the northeastern United States

      - 33901 is in Florida state, in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 2: Compare their longitudinal positions

      - New York is located on the eastern seaboard of the US

      ## Step 3: Specific zip code positions

      - 10973 (NY) would be positioned to the northeast of 33901 (FL)

      - In terms of pure east-west positioning, New York zip codes are typically east

      To determine whether one location is west of another, I need to compare their

      the Western Hemisphere is further east.


      In the US, New York is located in the northeastern part of the country, while
      Florida is in the southeastern part. Generally speaking, New York state is north

      ## Step 2: Consider relative positions in the US

      - Florida is generally in the southeastern United States

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region

      - While Florida extends westward in its panhandle region, Pembroke Pines (33026)
      is in the eastern/southeastern part of Florida

      33026 is a zip code in Florida (FL). Let me recall the approximate location
      of Florida in the US. Florida is in the southeastern United States, extending
      south into the Gulf of Mexico.


      46203 is a zip code in Indiana (IN). Indiana is located in the Midwest region
      of the United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle of the country from east

      these zip codes are located and compare their positions on an east-west axis.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 33026 is in Pembroke Pines, Florida, which is in the southern part of Florida
      near Miami.

      - 46203 is in Indianapolis, Indiana, which is in the central part of Indiana.


      Step 2: Compare their general geographic positions.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider longitude (east-west positioning).

      - Florida is primarily to the east and south of Indiana.

      - While Florida has a panhandle that extends westward, Pembroke Pines (33026)
      is in southern Florida, far to the east.

      - Indianapolis (46203) is further west than the eastern Florida cities.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Indiana is west of the Atlantic coast but east of the western states.

      - Pembroke Pines, FL is significantly east of Indianapolis, IN.

      First, let''s think about the general geographic relationship between Michigan
      and Missouri:

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the northern part of the US

      - Missouri is in the Midwest, south of Iowa and Illinois


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Michigan is generally in the eastern portion of the Midwest

      - Missouri is generally in the central/western portion of the Midwest


      Michigan is actually east of Missouri, not west. Looking at a US map, Michigan
      is to the right (east) of Missouri.


      So generally speaking, a zip code in Michigan would be east of a zip code in
      Missouri, not west of it.

      To determine this, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located and
      their relative positions to each other.


      Michigan (MI) is a state in the upper Midwest region of the United States. Missouri
      (MO) is a state in the Midwestern United States.


      Geographically speaking, Michigan is generally located east of Missouri. Michigan
      borders Lake Michigan to the west and Lake Huron to the east, while Missouri
      is farther west in the central US.


      So in general, locations in Michigan would be east of locations in Missouri,
      not west.


      To be even more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 48624 is a zip code in Michigan

      - 63670 is a zip code in Missouri


      Since Michigan is east of Missouri on the US map, 48624, MI would be east of
      63670, MO - not west of it.</think>I need to determine if 48624, MI is located

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 48624 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 63670 is in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Michigan is located in the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United
      States

      - Missouri is located in the central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Looking at a US map, Michigan is positioned to the EAST of Missouri

      - Michigan borders Lake Michigan to the west and Lake Huron to the east

      - Missouri is farther west in the central United States


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the specific zip codes.

      Since Michigan as a state is geographically east of Missouri, the zip code 48624
      in Michigan would be east of zip code 63670 in Missouri, not west of it.

      Now, let''s think about these specific zip codes:

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)


      Since Louisiana is generally east of Texas, it would be unusual for a Louisiana
      zip code to be west of a Texas zip code. However, I should be careful because
      state borders aren''t straight lines, and there could be exceptions depending

      3. Whether 70712, LA is west of 76008, TX


      First, I know that Louisiana is east of Texas in the United States. This is

      and Louisiana is to the east of Texas.


      Zip codes in the US generally follow patterns, with similar first digits often

      Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the specific zip codes.

      Since 70712 is in Louisiana and 76008 is in Texas, the Louisiana zip code must

      70712 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA).

      76008 is a zip code in Texas (TX).


      Geographically, Louisiana is east of Texas. Texas is the westernmost state of

      However, I need to be more precise since I''m comparing specific zip codes.
      The western part of Louisiana could potentially be west of the eastern part
      of Texas. Let me think about the general numbering system of zip codes.


      In the US zip code system:

      - First digit generally indicates a geographical region of the US (0 for northeast,
      9 for far west, etc.)

      - The 7xxxx series covers part of the central US

      - 70xxx is generally for Louisiana

      - 76xxx is generally for Texas


      In this case, since we have 70xxx for Louisiana and 76xxx for Texas, these align
      with their normal state locations. Louisiana is east of Texas, so 70712, LA
      is likely east of 76008, TX, not west.


      Let me double check the logic: the zip code 70712 is in Louisiana, and zip code
      76008 is in Texas. Louisiana is east of Texas in general, so a location in Louisiana
      would be east of a location in Texas, not west.</think># Is 70712, LA located
      west of 76008, TX?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Louisiana is located to the east of Texas on the US map. Texas borders Louisiana
      on Louisiana''s western side.


      ## Step 3: Check zip code patterns

      In the US zip code system, the first three digits typically represent specific
      regions. The 707xx codes are used for central/eastern Louisiana, while 760xx
      codes are used for north-central Texas (around the Fort Worth area).


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these specific zip codes follow the standard
      geographical distribution of their respective states, 70712 in Louisiana would
      be east of 76008 in Texas, not west.

      the geographical locations of two zip codes.


      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 76114, TX (Texas)

      - 80237, CO (Colorado)


      Then I need to determine which one is further west.


      In the United States, locations that are further west have a higher longitude
      (more negative, since US is in western hemisphere).


      Regarding the general locations of Texas and Colorado:

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US

      - Colorado is in the western-central part of the US


      Generally speaking, Colorado is west of Texas. But I need to consider the specific
      zip codes, as Texas is a large state and parts of western Texas could potentially
      be west of eastern Colorado.


      Specifically:

      - 76114 appears to be in the Fort Worth area of Texas, which is in north-central
      Texas

      - 80237 appears to be in the Denver area of Colorado, which is in eastern Colorado


      Since Denver, Colorado is west of Fort Worth, Texas, the zip code 80237, CO
      would be west of 76114, TX - not the other way around.</think>To determine if
      76114, TX is west of 80237, CO, I need to analyze the geographic locations of
      these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.

      - 76114 is in Fort Worth, Texas

      - 80237 is in Denver, Colorado


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Texas and Colorado.

      Colorado is located directly west of Kansas, while Texas is south of Oklahoma
      and Kansas. This means Colorado is generally northwest of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      Fort Worth is in north-central Texas, while Denver is in eastern Colorado. Even
      though Fort Worth is in the western half of the United States, Denver is still
      further west.


      Step 4: Consider longitude (the east-west position).

      Denver, Colorado is at a more westerly longitude than Fort Worth, Texas. This
      means 80237, CO is west of 76114, TX, not the other way around.


      NO'
    6920d32e-fa50-4c1c-9f6d-32d957d60020: '<think>This question is asking if zip code
      76114 in Texas is located west of zip code 80237 in Colorado.


      To figure this out, I need to know the relative positions of these zip codes.
      Let me think about the general geographic positions of Texas and Colorado in
      the US:


      - Colorado is a western state, located in the Rocky Mountain region

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the US


      Generally speaking, most of Texas is east of Colorado. Colorado''s western border
      is with Utah, while Texas extends eastward toward Louisiana and the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      Let''s now try to be more specific about these particular zip codes:

      - 76114 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 80237 is a zip code in Colorado (CO)


      The 76xxx range is typically in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas, which is
      in the northern part of the state.

      The 80xxx range covers Denver and surrounding areas in Colorado.


      Fort Worth (which is likely where 76114 is) is in the eastern part of Texas,
      and Denver is in the eastern part of Colorado. Since Colorado as a whole is
      west of Texas, zip code 80237 in Colorado would generally be west of zip code
      76114 in Texas.


      So 76114, TX is NOT west of 80237, CO. Rather, 76114, TX is EAST of 80237, CO.</think>#
      Is 76114, TX located west of 80237, CO?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions

      Colorado is located in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States,
      while Texas is in the south-central United States. Generally, Colorado is west
      of Texas.


      ## Step 2: Consider specific zip code locations

      - 76114 is likely in the Fort Worth area of Texas (76xxx series)

      - 80237 is likely in the Denver area of Colorado (80xxx series)


      ## Step 3: Determine east-west relationship

      Fort Worth, TX is in the eastern portion of Texas, while Denver, CO is in the
      eastern portion of Colorado. However, even eastern Colorado is still west of
      Texas geographically.


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Colorado is west of Texas, zip code 80237 in Colorado would be west of
      zip code 76114 in Texas.


      NO (76114, TX is not west of 80237, CO - it''s east of it)'

      west of 80237, CO, I need to find where these zip codes are located geographically
      and compare their longitudes.


      76114 is a zip code in Texas (TX).

      80237 is a zip code in Colorado (CO).


      In the United States, lower longitude values represent locations further west,
      while higher longitude values represent locations further east.


      Generally speaking, Colorado is west of Texas in the United States. Colorado
      is a western state that borders the Rocky Mountains, while Texas is in the south-central
      part of the country.


      If we''re looking at standard geography of the US:

      - Texas is typically east of Colorado

      - So a zip code in Texas (76114) would typically be east of a zip code in Colorado
      (80237)

      - If 76114, TX is east of 80237, CO, then it is NOT west of 80237, CO


      Therefore, 76114, TX is not located west of 80237, CO.</think># Is 76114, TX
      located west of 80237, CO?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 76114 is in Texas (TX)

      - 80237 is in Colorado (CO)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      In the United States, Colorado is located west of Texas. Colorado is part of
      the western/mountain region, while Texas is in the south-central region of the
      country.


      ## Step 3: Understand directional relationships

      When comparing "west of," I need to determine if the first location (76114,
      TX) is to the west of the second location (80237, CO). Since Texas is east of
      Colorado, zip codes in Texas are generally east of zip codes in Colorado, not
      west.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Texas is east of Colorado, 76114 (TX) cannot be west of 80237 (CO).

      I know that Colorado is generally west of Texas in the United States. Colorado
      borders the western side of the panhandle of Texas. Most of Colorado is west
      of most of Texas.


      However, I need to be careful here, as specific ZIP codes could be in different
      relative positions than their states overall. Let me reason through this:


      - TX (Texas) is generally east of CO (Colorado)

      - Therefore, a location in TX would typically be east of a location in CO

      - If a location in TX is east of a location in CO, then the CO location would

      - 80237 is in Colorado (CO)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Colorado is located directly west of Kansas, which borders the northern part
      of Texas. Generally speaking, Colorado is northwest of Texas in the United States.


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific ZIP codes

      - ZIP code 76114 is in the Fort Worth area in north-central Texas

      - ZIP code 80237 is in the Denver area in central Colorado

      Let me identify what these ZIP codes represent:

      - 76114, TX is a ZIP code in Texas

      - 80237, CO is a ZIP code in Colorado


      The question is asking if the Texas ZIP code is located west of the Colorado
      ZIP code.


      Generally speaking, the US states are roughly organized where states get further
      west as you go from right to left on a map. Texas is typically southeast of
      Colorado, not west of it. Colorado is generally west of Texas.


      In terms of longitude (which measures east-west position), Colorado is typically
      further west than Texas. So a location in Texas would normally be east of a
      location in Colorado, not west of it.


      Therefore, I can conclude that 76114, TX is likely east of 80237, CO, not west
      of it.


      To be more precise, 76114 appears to be in the Fort Worth area of Texas, which

      of Colorado, which is on the eastern side of Colorado.

      - 76114 is in Texas (TX)

      - 80237 is in Colorado (CO)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Colorado is located directly west of Kansas and Nebraska, while Texas is located
      south of Oklahoma, which is south of Kansas.


      ## Step 3: Compare their longitudes

      - Colorado is positioned to the west of Texas on the US map

      - Even though both ZIP codes may be in different parts of their respective states,

      Since Colorado is generally west of Texas, and these specific zip codes don''t
      suggest any unusual geographic anomaly, 76114 in TX should be east of 80237
      in CO.


      Therefore, 76114, TX is NOT located west of 80237, CO. It is east of it.</think>#
      Is 76114, TX located west of 80237, CO?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions

      Colorado (CO) is located in the western United States, while Texas (TX) is in
      the south-central United States. Geographically, Colorado lies west of Texas.


      ## Step 2: Consider specific zip code locations

      - 76114 is in Texas, likely in the northern/central part of the state

      - 80237 is in Colorado, likely in the eastern part of the state (Denver area)


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      Since Colorado as a whole is west of Texas, and these particular zip codes don''t
      represent any geographic anomalies (like a small portion of one state extending
      unusually), the Texas zip code must be east of the Colorado zip code.

      (New Jersey) is located west of 46016, IN (Indiana).


      To solve this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these locations.
      In the United States, locations further west have higher longitude values.


      Step 1: Let me identify where these zip codes are located.

      - 08734 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 46016 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of New Jersey and Indiana.

      New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States, while Indiana is in the
      Midwest.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      On a map of the United States, New Jersey is clearly to the east of Indiana.
      Indiana is much further west than New Jersey.


      If something is "west of" something else, it means it has a higher longitude
      value. Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Indiana is in the Midwest,
      New Jersey is EAST of Indiana, not west.</think>To determine whether 08734,
      NJ is located west of 46016, IN, I need to consider the geographic locations

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 08734 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 46016 is a ZIP code in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on the US map.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Looking at a US map, New Jersey is significantly east of Indiana. The entire
      state of New Jersey is east of Indiana, with several states (like Ohio and Pennsylvania)
      lying between them.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      Since New Jersey is east of Indiana, ZIP code 08734 in NJ must be east of (not
      west of) ZIP code 46016 in IN.

      To answer this question, I need to:

      1. Determine the geographic locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their east-west positioning (longitude)


      In the United States:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is a state on the East Coast

      Generally speaking, Indiana is west of New Jersey. Looking at a map of the US,
      Indiana is significantly further west than New Jersey.


      Since 08734 is in New Jersey and 46016 is in Indiana, the New Jersey zip code
      would be EAST of the Indiana zip code, not west of it.

      Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their general east-west positioning.

      The United States generally runs with the East Coast on the right (eastern)
      side and gradually moves west as you go left on the map. New Jersey is one of
      the easternmost states, while Indiana is considerably more inland and westward.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Indiana is in the Midwest, any zip
      code in New Jersey would be EAST of any zip code in Indiana, not west.


      NO, 08734, NJ is not located west of 46016, IN. It is located east of it.'

      New Jersey (NJ) is a state on the east coast of the United States.

      Indiana (IN) is a state in the Midwest of the United States.

      states like Indiana. Therefore, New Jersey is east of Indiana, not west of it.


      So the zip code 08734 in NJ would be east of (not west of) the zip code 46016
      in IN.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New Jersey is significantly east of Indiana on the US map

      - The East Coast (including NJ) is east of the Midwest (including IN)


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since 08734 is in New Jersey and 46016 is in Indiana, and New Jersey is east
      of Indiana (not west), the zip code 08734 cannot be west of 46016.

      1. "08734, NJ" refers to a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ).

      2. "46016, IN" refers to a ZIP code in Indiana (IN).


      The question is asking whether the New Jersey ZIP code location is west of the
      Indiana ZIP code location.


      Geographically in the United States:

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, significantly west of New Jersey.


      Given the general geography of the US, New Jersey is east of Indiana, not west
      of it. So 08734, NJ would be east of 46016, IN, not west of it.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region, significantly west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Indiana is in the Midwest, New Jersey
      is east of Indiana, not west of it. This means that any location in New Jersey

      In the United States, states on the East Coast (like New Jersey) are generally
      east of Midwestern states (like Indiana). In other words, if you look at a map
      of the US, New Jersey is to the right of Indiana.

      The United States generally spans from east to west, with the East Coast (including
      New Jersey) being the easternmost part of the contiguous US. The Midwest (including
      Indiana) is located west of the East Coast but east of the western states.


      Step 4: Determine the relative position.

      Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Indiana is in the Midwest, New Jersey
      is east of Indiana, not west of it.

      - Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Louisiana (LA) is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico

      - When comparing these states east-to-west, Virginia is clearly east of Louisiana


      ## Step 2: Consider the specific zip codes

      - Zip code 22936 is in Virginia, which means it''s in the eastern portion of
      the country

      - Zip code 70444 is in Louisiana, which is significantly west of Virginia


      ## Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on geography

      22936 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).

      70444 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA).


      To determine which is more westerly, I need to compare their longitudes. A more
      negative longitude in the United States means further west.


      Let me think about the general geographic locations:

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico


      In terms of east-west positioning, Louisiana is generally west of Virginia.

      34224, FL - This is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      68152, NE - This is a zip code in Nebraska (NE)

      - Nebraska is located in the midwestern United States, roughly in the middle
      of the country


      For a location to be west of another, it would need to have a smaller (more
      negative) longitude value.


      Generally speaking, Florida is east of Nebraska in the United States. However,
      Florida has a panhandle that extends westward along the Gulf Coast. So I need

      34224 appears to be in southwest Florida, likely in the Port Charlotte or Punta
      Gorda area.

      68152 appears to be in eastern Nebraska, likely in or near Omaha.

      - 68152 is in Nebraska (NE), in the Omaha area in eastern Nebraska.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States, significantly to the west
      of Florida.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Even though 34224 is on Florida''s western Gulf Coast, Nebraska as a whole
      lies west of Florida.

      - Eastern Nebraska (where 68152 is located) is still west of even the westernmost

    5c00a174-93d7-4501-ba7c-76b4c6e8d5f7: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of two zip codes:

      - 10162, NY (New York)

      - 32129, FL (Florida)


      The east-west position corresponds to longitude, where western locations have
      lower (more negative) longitudes in the US.


      Let me reason through the general geographical positions:

      1. New York state is in the northeastern US

      2. Florida is in the southeastern US

      3. Generally, New York is east of Florida


      However, to be precise, I should consider the specific zip codes. The first
      digits of US zip codes generally follow a west-to-east pattern:

      - Lower first digits (0, 1) are in the northeast

      - Higher first digits (8, 9) are in the west

      - Middle digits (3, 4) are in the south and midwest


      10162 starts with "1", which is in the Northeast (specifically New York)

      32129 starts with "3", which is in the Southeast (specifically Florida)


      Based on the general arrangement of zip codes and the states involved, New York
      (10162) would be east of Florida (32129), not west.</think>I need to determine

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10162 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 32129 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - When comparing east-west positions in the US, we''re looking at longitude

      - New York is generally positioned to the east of Florida, not west

      - The US zip code system generally follows a pattern where lower first digits
      (like 1) are in the northeast, while mid-range digits (like 3) are in the southeast


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geography.

      Since New York is positioned to the east of Florida on the US map, zip code
      10162 in NY would be east of, not west of, zip code 32129 in FL.

      In general, when comparing locations on the east coast, the more northern locations

      Given that 01364 appears to be in western Massachusetts (based on the low zip
      code starting with 01) and 23702 seems to be in eastern Virginia (based on the
      237xx pattern), it''s likely that 01364, MA is indeed west of 23702, VA.</think>#
      Is 01364, MA located west of 23702, VA?


      I need to determine the locations of these zip codes and compare their east-west
      positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 01364 is in Massachusetts (MA), in the northeastern United States

      - 23702 is in Virginia (VA), also on the eastern seaboard but south of Massachusetts


      ## Step 2: Analyze the zip code patterns

      - Massachusetts zip codes start with 01-02, with 01xxx typically representing
      western Massachusetts

      - Virginia zip codes in the 237xx range are typically in the eastern part of
      Virginia, specifically in the Portsmouth/Norfolk area (Tidewater region)


      ## Step 3: Compare their geographic positions

      - Western Massachusetts (01364) is located inland

      - The Portsmouth/Norfolk area of Virginia (23702) is located on the Atlantic
      coast, in the far eastern part of Virginia

      - When comparing longitude (east-west position), eastern Virginia extends further
      east than western Massachusetts


      ## Answer: YES


      01364, MA is indeed located west of 23702, VA.'

      \ MA is located west of 23702, VA. Let me break this down step by step.\n\n\
      Step 1: Identify the states.\n- 01364 is in Massachusetts (MA)\n- 23702 is in\
      \ Virginia (VA)\n\nStep 2: Consider the general geography of these states.\n\
      Massachusetts is in the Northeast US, while Virginia is in the Mid-Atlantic\
      \ region of the East Coast. \n\nStep 3: Think about the relative positions.\n\
      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is north of Virginia. But the question is\
      \ asking about east-west positioning, not north-south.\n\nMassachusetts is generally\
      \ located northeast of Virginia. This means that most of Massachusetts would\
      \ be east of most of Virginia, not west.\n\nHowever, western Massachusetts could\
      \ potentially be west of eastern Virginia. I need to be more precise with these\
      \ specific zip codes.\n\nStep 4: Consider the zip code patterns.\nIn the US\
      \ postal system, zip codes generally (but not perfectly) follow a west-to-east\
      \ pattern, with lower numbers in the east and higher numbers in the west.\n\n\
      01364 is a very low zip code, suggesting it's in eastern Massachusetts.\n23702\
      \ is a higher zip code, suggesting it's more toward central or western Virginia.\n\
      \nStep 5: Make a determination based on geography.\nWestern Massachusetts might\
      \ be roughly aligned with central Virginia longitudinally, but eastern Massachusetts\
      \ would definitely be east of Virginia.\n\nSince 01364 appears to be in eastern\
      \ Massachusetts (based on the low zip code), and 23702 appears to be in central/eastern\
      \ Virginia, it's unlikely that the Massachusetts location is west of the Virginia\

      \ is in the north-central part of Massachusetts.\n- ZIP code 23702 is in Portsmouth,\
      \ Virginia, which is on the eastern coast of Virginia.\n\nStep 2: Consider the\
      \ general geography of these states.\nMassachusetts is in the Northeast US,\
      \ while Virginia is in the Mid-Atlantic region, south of Massachusetts.\n\n\
      Step 3: Analyze east-west positioning.\nWhile Massachusetts is north of Virginia,\
      \ the question is about east-west positioning. The eastern coast of Virginia\
      \ (where Portsmouth is) is actually further east than much of central and western\
      \ Massachusetts.\n\nStep 4: Compare the specific locations.\nOrange, MA (01364)\

      Mississippi (MS) is in the southeastern United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico.

      Oklahoma (OK) is in the south-central United States.


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is west of Mississippi. Almost all of Oklahoma
      is west of all of Mississippi. So it''s very likely that the ZIP code in MS
      is east of the one in OK, not west.


      But let me verify more precisely...</think># Is 39367, MS located west of 73801,
      OK?


      Let me solve this step by step by determining the geographic locations of these
      zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 39367 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 73801 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States, along the Gulf of
      Mexico. Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States.


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      Looking at a US map, Oklahoma is positioned entirely west of Mississippi. Mississippi''s
      western border connects with Louisiana and Arkansas, while Oklahoma is further
      west, bordering Arkansas and Texas.


      ## Step 4: Make the final determination

      Since Oklahoma is geographically west of Mississippi, and their territories
      don''t overlap longitudinally, any location in Mississippi (including 39367)
      would be east of any location in Oklahoma (including 73801).


      Therefore, 39367, MS is NOT located west of 73801, OK.

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 01908 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 18218 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Looking at the geography of the US, Massachusetts is located in the northeastern
      United States, along the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern
      US, but is west of Massachusetts.


      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania. So a location in
      Massachusetts would typically be east of a location in Pennsylvania, not west
      of it.


      Therefore, 01908, MA is likely east of 18218, PA, not west of it.</think># Is

      2) Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States along the Atlantic
      coast.


      3) Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern US, but it''s positioned west of
      Massachusetts.


      4) All Massachusetts zip codes (including 01908) are located east of Pennsylvania.


      5) All Pennsylvania zip codes (including 18218) are located west of Massachusetts.


      6) Therefore, 01908 MA must be east of 18218 PA, not west of it.

      1. Identify where these zip codes are located

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me first identify the locations:


      01908 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      18218 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Now, for their east-west positioning, I need to consider the geographic layout
      of these states. In the United States:

      - Massachusetts is located in New England, in the northeastern part of the country

      - Pennsylvania is located south of New York and west of New Jersey, in the mid-Atlantic
      region


      In general, Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania. Massachusetts is on the Atlantic
      coast, while Pennsylvania is more inland (though eastern PA does touch the Delaware
      River).


      So if we compare their positions on a map, Massachusetts is to the east of Pennsylvania,
      not to the west. Therefore, 01908, MA would be east of 18218, PA, not west of
      it.</think># Is 01908, MA located west of 18218, PA?

      - 01908 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 18218 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative geographic positions of these states

      Massachusetts is located in New England, in the northeastern United States along
      the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, west
      of New Jersey but east of Ohio.


      ## Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning

      On a map of the United States, Massachusetts is positioned to the east of Pennsylvania.
      The entire state of Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion about the specific zip codes

      Since 01908 is in Massachusetts and 18218 is in Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts
      is east of Pennsylvania, it follows that 01908 is east of 18218, not west.

      In terms of general geography in the United States:

      32603 appears to be in Gainesville, Florida, which is in the northern part of
      Florida.

      74105 appears to be in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which is in the northeastern part of
      Oklahoma.


      Even with these specific cities, the general relationship holds - Gainesville,

      - 74105 is a ZIP code in Tulsa, Oklahoma


      Step 2: Consider their positions on the US map.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Moving from east to west across the United States, you would encounter Florida

      Let me break this down:

      1. 06250 is in CT (Connecticut)

      2. 28403 is in NC (North Carolina)


      First, I need to recall the relative positions of these states on the US map.


      Connecticut (CT) is in the northeastern part of the United States, specifically
      in New England. It''s on the East Coast.


      North Carolina (NC) is on the East Coast as well, but it''s further south, part
      of the southeastern United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Connecticut is generally northeast of North
      Carolina. But the specific question is about east-west positioning, not north-south.


      Looking at the US map, Connecticut is actually further east than North Carolina.
      The East Coast runs at a diagonal from northeast to southwest. So states further
      north on the East Coast (like CT) are actually further east than states further
      south (like NC).</think># Is 06250, CT located west of 28403, NC?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 06250 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 28403 is in North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographical positions of these states

      Connecticut is located in the Northeast region of the United States, while North
      Carolina is in the Southeast region.


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      Looking at a US map, the East Coast has a northeast-to-southwest orientation.
      Connecticut, being in the Northeast, is actually positioned *further east* than
      North Carolina.


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Connecticut is east of North Carolina (not west), zip code 06250, CT cannot
      be west of 28403, NC.

      1. Identify what states these zip codes are in

      2. Determine the general east-west relationship of these states

      3. Confirm the specific locations of these zip codes


      From the question:

      - 06250 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 28403 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Geographically in the United States:

      - Connecticut is in the northeastern part of the country

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern part of the country, but further west
      than Connecticut


      When comparing east-west positions in the US:

      - States further east have higher longitude values (closer to 0 degrees)

      - States further west have lower longitude values (further from 0 degrees)


      Connecticut is east of North Carolina on a US map. If you look at the Atlantic
      coast, you start with Maine in the northeast, then go through New Hampshire,
      Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
      Virginia, North Carolina, etc. as you move south.

      the geographic relationship between these two zip codes by identifying their
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 06250 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 28403 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship of these states.

      Connecticut is located in the Northeast region of the United States, while North
      Carolina is in the Southeast region. When looking at a map of the US East Coast,
      Connecticut is positioned significantly northeast of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      Connecticut''s eastern border faces the Atlantic Ocean, and it is entirely east
      of North Carolina. The entire state of Connecticut has a more easterly longitude
      than North Carolina.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since 06250 is in Connecticut, and 28403 is in North Carolina, and Connecticut
      is east (not west) of North Carolina, the zip code 06250, CT cannot be west
      of 28403, NC.

      To answer this, I need to consider the geographical locations of these states
      and zip codes.


      First, let me recall the general geography of the United States:

      - Connecticut (CT) is in the northeastern part of the United States, in New
      England

      - North Carolina (NC) is on the eastern seaboard, in the southeastern part of
      the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Connecticut is generally positioned to the
      northeast of North Carolina. This means Connecticut is more eastern (not western)
      than North Carolina.


      Since zip code 06250 is in Connecticut and zip code 28403 is in North Carolina,
      the Connecticut zip code would be located to the east of the North Carolina
      zip code, not to the west.</think>To determine if 06250, CT is located west

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 06250 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 28403 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Connecticut is in the northeastern United States (New England region), while
      North Carolina is on the east coast but further south.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      When looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is positioned to the
      northeast of North Carolina. Importantly for this question, Connecticut is actually
      east of North Carolina, not west.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes

      Since 06250 is in Connecticut and 28403 is in North Carolina, and Connecticut
      is east of North Carolina, the zip code 06250 must be east (not west) of zip

      4. Now I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these states.


      5. In the United States, the general geography is that the East Coast states

      6. Connecticut (CT) is a New England state in the northeastern United States.

      85132 is in Arizona (AZ)

      98311 is in Washington (WA)


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest, bordering the Pacific Ocean

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Washington is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is inland but still in the western United States


      Washington is generally west of Arizona. Places in Washington would typically
      have a more westerly longitude (closer to the Pacific Ocean) than places in
      Arizona.


      Therefore, 85132, AZ would be EAST of 98311, WA, not west of it.</think>To determine

      - 85132 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 98311 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest, along the Pacific coast.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, but inland.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Washington is one of the westernmost states in the continental US, directly
      bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - Arizona is also western, but it lies east of Washington state.


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Washington is west of Arizona, zip code 98311 in WA would be west of zip
      code 85132 in AZ.

      First, let me think about the states:

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States, much further inland from the
      Atlantic Ocean


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is west of North Carolina. Almost all of Arkansas

      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 27009 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 72114 is a zip code in Arkansas (AR)


      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      The more negative (or less positive) the longitude in the western hemisphere,
      the further west a location is.


      I need to recall the general geographical positions of North Carolina and Arkansas
      in the United States:

      - North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Arkansas is more centrally located, in the southern part of the US


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is west of North Carolina. So it''s likely that
      a zip code in Arkansas would be west of a zip code in North Carolina, not the
      other way around.


      The question asks if 27009, NC is west of 72114, AR. Based on the general positions
      of these states, the answer should be NO - a North Carolina zip code would be
      east of an Arkansas zip code, not west of it.</think># Determining if 27009,

      their geographic locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 27009 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      Looking at a map of the United States, Arkansas is positioned significantly
      to the west of North Carolina. All of Arkansas is west of all of North Carolina.


      ## Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 27009 is in North Carolina and 72114 is in Arkansas, the North Carolina
      zip code must be east of the Arkansas zip code, not west of it.

      10927 in New York is west of zip code 33990 in Florida.


      To determine this, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip codes.
      The general geographical relationship between New York and Florida is that New
      York is in the northeastern United States, while Florida is in the southeastern
      United States. This means that New York is generally north of Florida, but the
      question is asking about east/west orientation.


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Florida, not west. But I should verify
      this with the specific zip codes.


      Zip code 10927 is in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      Zip code 33990 is in Florida (FL). Florida is in the southeastern United States,
      also on the east coast but further south.


      In terms of longitude (east-west position), New York is generally to the east
      of Florida, not west. This is because the Florida panhandle extends westward,
      while New York is further east along the Atlantic coast.


      So it''s very likely that 10927, NY is east of 33990, FL, not west.</think>#
      Is 10927, NY located west of 33990, FL?


      Let me determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      First, I need to consider the general geographic positions of New York and Florida:

      - New York state is in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States


      Looking at their positions on a map:

      - New York is located along the Atlantic coast in the northeast

      - Florida extends southward along the Atlantic coast and into the Gulf of Mexico


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - New York is generally positioned to the EAST of Florida, not west

      - The eastern parts of New York are significantly further east than most of
      Florida


      Therefore, zip code 10927 in New York would be EAST of zip code 33990 in Florida,
      not west of it.

      west of 33990, FL, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10927 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 33990 is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Recall general US geography.

      New York is in the northeastern part of the United States, while Florida is
      in the southeastern part. In general, New York is north of Florida, but I need
      to determine the east-west relationship.


      Step 3: Consider basic US geography.

      The eastern coast of the US runs approximately northeast to southwest. New York
      is on the northeast part of this coast, while Florida is on the southeast peninsula
      that extends southward.


      Step 4: Compare general longitudes.

      Florida generally lies to the west of New York when comparing similar latitudes.
      The Florida peninsula extends quite far south, but it also extends farther west
      than most of New York.


      However, I need to be careful here because specific zip codes might not follow
      the general state pattern. Let me think about where these specific zip codes
      might be located within their states.</think># Is 10927, NY located west of
      33990, FL?


      Let me solve this step by step by comparing the geographic locations of these
      zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the general locations

      - 10927 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United
      States

      - 33990 is a zip code in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 2: Consider east-west positioning

      - New York is located along the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Florida is also on the eastern side of the US, but extends as a peninsula
      to the south

      - Looking at the general geography, New York is actually located EAST of Florida
      on the east-west axis


      ## Step 3: Verify specific zip codes

      - 10927 (NY) is in the southeastern part of New York state

      - 33990 (FL) is in Cape Coral in southwestern Florida

      - Florida''s longitude is generally west of New York''s longitude


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 10927, NY is NOT located west of 33990, FL. It is actually located east
      of the Florida zip code.'

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)


      To determine which is further west, I need to compare their longitudes. Lower
      (more negative) longitude values in the US indicate more western locations.


      Let me think about the general locations of Virginia and Georgia:

      - Virginia is on the eastern seaboard, roughly in the mid-Atlantic region

      - Georgia is also on the eastern seaboard, but further south than Virginia


      In terms of east-west positioning, Virginia is generally to the northeast of

      - Ellijay, Georgia (30534) is in the northern mountainous region of Georgia,
      closer to the western side of the state


      ## Step 4: Longitude comparison

      - Virginia zip codes, especially in the northern Virginia/DC area like 20121,
      are generally east of northern Georgia mountain zip codes

      - Northern Georgia''s mountain region (where Ellijay is) extends further west

      west.


      20121 is in Virginia (VA). Let me recall where this might be. Virginia is on
      the east coast, and its zip codes are generally in the northern part of the
      east coast.


      30534 is in Georgia (GA). Georgia is also on the east coast, but it''s south

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic east coast, while Georgia is located
      in the southeastern United States.


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      Looking at the geographic layout of the eastern United States:

      - Virginia is positioned to the northeast of Georgia

      - Georgia is positioned to the southwest of Virginia


      ## Step 4: Consider these specific zip codes

      - 20121 is in Centreville, northern Virginia (near Washington DC)

      - 30534 is in northern Georgia


      ## Step 5: Compare east-west positioning

      Moving from east to west across the United States, Georgia is further west than
      Virginia. Specifically, northern Georgia (where 30534 is) lies west of northern
      Virginia (where 20121 is).

      is located west of 30534, GA.


      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)


      To determine which is more west, I need to think about the geographical layout
      of these states.


      Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean. Georgia is also an eastern state, but it''s further south than Virginia.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Georgia is generally west of Virginia, especially
      the western parts of Georgia. However, I need to be careful because the specific
      zip codes might not follow the general state positioning.


      ZIP code 20121 appears to be in northern Virginia, likely in the suburban Washington
      DC area.

      ZIP code 30534 appears to be in northern Georgia.


      Northern Virginia is in the eastern part of the United States, while northern
      Georgia is more west than Virginia. Georgia is southwest of Virginia.


      So, in general, Georgia is west of Virginia. But to be more precise about these
      specific zip codes:

      - 20121 (VA) is likely in the eastern part of the country

      - 30534 (GA) is likely more westward than the Virginia zip code


      Therefore, 20121 VA is likely NOT west of 30534 GA. Rather, 30534 GA is west
      of 20121 VA.</think># Is 20121, VA located west of 30534, GA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the US, while Georgia is located
      in the southeastern US. When comparing their east-west positioning, Georgia
      is generally west and south of Virginia.


      ## Step 3: Consider general zip code patterns

      - Zip codes starting with "20" are typically in the Washington DC area/northern
      Virginia region

      - Zip codes starting with "30" are in Georgia


      ## Step 4: Look at the specific locations

      - 20121 is in Centreville, northern Virginia, in the eastern part of the state

      - 30534 is in northern Georgia


      ## Step 5: Compare longitude

      Northern Georgia is west of northern Virginia. Looking at the general geographic
      layout of the US, Georgia''s eastern border is west of Virginia''s western border.


      NO - 20121, VA is not located west of 30534, GA. It''s the opposite: 30534,

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region

      - Texas is in the South/Southwest region


      Generally speaking, Illinois is east of Texas in the United States. The Mississippi

      Step 1: Let me identify these locations.

      - 60652 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)

      - 76247 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      Illinois (IL) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      Texas (TX) is located in the south-central region of the United States.

      of 97229, OR, I need to locate these zip codes geographically.


      90650 is a zip code for Norwalk, California, which is in the Los Angeles area
      in Southern California.

      97229 is a zip code in Portland, Oregon.


      Now I need to think about their relative positions. The west coast of the US
      runs roughly north-south, with Oregon located north of California. However,
      the coastline angles somewhat, with northern regions (like Oregon) being slightly
      more eastward than southern regions (like Southern California).


      California is generally west of Oregon when considering longitude. The general
      rule is:

      - California extends further west than Oregon

      - Southern California (where Norwalk/90650 is located) tends to be further west
      than most of Oregon


      So Norwalk, CA (90650) should be west of Portland, OR (97229) because:

      1. California is generally west of Oregon on the map

      2. Southern California in particular extends further west than Oregon


      Therefore, 90650, CA is west of 97229, OR.</think># Is 90650, CA located west
      of 97229, OR?


      I need to determine the geographic positions of these zip codes and compare
      their longitudes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 90650 is in Norwalk, California (in the Los Angeles area of Southern California)

      - 97229 is in Portland, Oregon (in the northwestern part of Oregon)


      ## Step 2: Consider their geographic positions

      - Both states are on the west coast, with Oregon directly north of California

      - The Pacific coastline angles inland as you move northward

      - This means Southern California locations tend to be further west (have a more
      westerly longitude) than Oregon locations


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - California''s coastal position, especially Southern California, extends further
      west than Oregon

      - Norwalk (90650) in the Los Angeles area is positioned further west in longitude
      than Portland (97229)


      YES, 90650 (Norwalk, CA) is located west of 97229 (Portland, OR).'

      90650 is a zip code for Norwalk, California.

      97229 is a zip code for Portland, Oregon.


      In the United States, locations on the west coast generally follow a pattern
      where:

      - Oregon is north of California

      - Locations further west have smaller longitude values (since longitude values
      increase as you move eastward from the Prime Meridian)


      California is generally west of Oregon, since California makes up more of the
      coastline and Oregon is set slightly more inland comparatively. So my initial
      guess would be that 90650 CA is west of 97229 OR, but I should be careful because
      specific zip codes might not follow the general state positioning.


      Norwalk, CA (90650) is in the Los Angeles area in Southern California, very
      close to the Pacific coast.

      Portland, OR (97229) is in the northwestern part of Oregon, but it''s a bit
      inland from the coast.


      Given these locations, 90650 (Norwalk, CA) is likely west of 97229 (Portland,
      OR) since Southern California coastal areas are typically further west than
      inland portions of Oregon.</think># Is 90650, CA located west of 97229, OR?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 90650 is in Norwalk, California (in the Los Angeles area)

      - 97229 is in Portland, Oregon


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positioning

      California extends further west along the Pacific coast than Oregon does. Oregon
      is positioned northeasterly relative to California.


      ## Step 3: Specific locations analysis

      - Norwalk (90650) is in Southern California, relatively close to the Pacific
      coast

      - Portland (97229) is inland from the Oregon coast, in the northwestern part
      of the state


      ## Step 4: Compare longitudinal positions

      Southern California''s coastal regions are generally further west (lower longitude
      values) than Portland, which is set inland from the Oregon coast.


      YES, 90650 CA is located west of 97229 OR.'

      \ in Oregon (OR)\n\nStep 2: Recall the general geographic layout of the western\
      \ United States.\n- California is located on the west coast of the United States\n\
      - Oregon is also on the west coast, but is north of California\n\nStep 3: Consider\
      \ the east-west relationship.\nWhen we're looking at locations on the west coast\
      \ of the US:\n- Generally, Oregon is slightly east of California, because the\
      \ coastline angles inland as you move north from California to Oregon\n- However,\
      \ specific locations within these states could vary\n\nStep 4: Since we're working\
      \ with specific zip codes, I should consider their exact locations.\n- 90650\
      \ appears to be in the Los Angeles area of California, likely in the western\
      \ part of the state\n- 97229 is likely in the Portland area of Oregon, which\
      \ is in the northwestern part of Oregon\n\nBased on the general geography, since\
      \ both locations are in coastal states, and California generally extends further\

      \   - 90650 is for Norwalk, CA, in the Los Angeles area of Southern California\n\
      \   - 97229 is in the Portland area of northwestern Oregon\n\n4) Comparing their\

      \ close to the coast, while Portland, OR is slightly inland\n\nBased on this\
      \ analysis, 90650 (Norwalk, CA) is indeed west of 97229 (Portland, OR).\n\n\
      YES"

      \ south of Oregon on the west coast of the United States. However, the question\
      \ is asking specifically about east-west positioning, not north-south.\n\nGenerally\
      \ speaking, the coastline of the western United States runs in a northwest to\

      \ to be slightly more eastward than southern locations (like California).\n\n\
      However, I should be more precise about these specific zip codes:\n\n90650 is\
      \ in California. California zip codes starting with 906xx are typically in the\

      36107 is in Alabama (AL). Alabama is in the southeastern United States.


      When we think about the general geography of the US:

      - Ohio is generally north and east of Alabama

      - Alabama is generally south of Ohio


      But the question specifically asks about east-west positioning (not north-south).


      In terms of longitude (east-west position):

      - Ohio is generally positioned to the EAST of Alabama

      - Alabama is generally positioned to the WEST of Ohio


      This is because, while Ohio is more northern than Alabama, it''s also shifted
      eastward in the US map compared to Alabama.


      So without looking up the exact coordinates, I would say that 44030, OH is NOT
      west of 36107, AL. Instead, 44030, OH would be EAST of 36107, AL.


      Let me reason a bit more to double-check: Ohio borders Pennsylvania, which is
      definitely in the eastern US. Alabama borders Mississippi, which is more central/western.
      This confirms that Ohio is generally east of Alabama.</think># Is 44030, OH
      located west of 36107, AL?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 44030 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 36107 is in Alabama (AL)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      Looking at the map of the United States:

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Alabama is located in the Southeast region


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudes (east-west positioning)

      - Ohio is positioned in the eastern portion of the Midwest

      - Alabama sits further west than Ohio on the US map

      - While Ohio is north of Alabama, it''s actually east of Alabama in terms of
      longitude


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Ohio is positioned to the east of Alabama on the US map, not to the west. Therefore,
      zip code 44030 in Ohio would be east of zip code 36107 in Alabama.

      44030, OH refers to a zip code in Ohio.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Alabama is located in the Southeast region

      \ locations of both zip codes and compare their positions.\n\n## Step 1: Identify\
      \ the states\n- 61611 is in Illinois (IL)\n- 76210 is in Texas (TX)\n\n## Step\
      \ 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states\nIllinois is\
      \ located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas is located\
      \ in the South/Southwest region.\n\n## Step 3: Compare their relative positions\n\
      Looking at a US map:\n- Illinois is positioned between approximately 87\xB0\
      W and 91\xB0W longitude\n- Texas is positioned between approximately 94\xB0\
      W and 106\xB0W longitude\n\nLower (more negative) longitude numbers indicate\
      \ positions further east, while higher (more negative) numbers indicate positions\
      \ further west.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the specific zip codes\n61611 is in the\
      \ Peoria area of central Illinois\n76210 is in the Denton area near Dallas-Fort\
      \ Worth in northeastern Texas\n\nEven though Texas has portions that extend\
      \ far west, the northeastern part of Texas (where 76210 is located) is still\
      \ generally west of Illinois.\n\n# Answer: NO\n\n61611, IL is located EAST of\
      \ 76210, TX, not west of it."

      step:


      1. I need to determine if the zip code 61611, IL is west of zip code 76210,
      TX.


      2. I know that Illinois (IL) is a state in the Midwest region of the United
      States, while Texas (TX) is a state in the South-Central region.


      3. Geographically, Illinois is located east of Texas. In the United States,
      states get progressively more western as you move from the East Coast toward
      the West Coast. Texas is significantly west of Illinois.


      4. Since 61611 is in Illinois, and 76210 is in Texas, and Illinois is east of
      Texas, then 61611 is east of 76210, not west of it.


      5. So the answer is NO - 61611, IL is not located west of 76210, TX. It''s located
      east of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      geographic positions of these two zip codes based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 76210 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas
      is in the South-Central region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Illinois is positioned to the east
      of Texas. The Mississippi River forms much of Illinois'' western border, while
      Texas extends much further west.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion about the zip codes.

      Since 61611 is in Illinois, and 76210 is in Texas, and Illinois is east of Texas,
      then 61611 must be east of 76210, not west of it.

      determine if zip code 03303 in New Hampshire (NH) is located west of zip code
      21209 in Maryland (MD).


      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 21209 is in Maryland (MD)


      Next, I need to think about the geographic locations of these states. In the
      United States:

      - New Hampshire is located in the Northeast region, specifically in New England

      - Maryland is located in the Mid-Atlantic region


      Looking at their relative positions on a map:

      - New Hampshire is roughly positioned in the northeast corner of the contiguous
      US

      - Maryland is located further south and west of New Hampshire


      When comparing east-west positions specifically:

      - New Hampshire is positioned further east on the Atlantic coast

      - Maryland is positioned more to the west compared to New Hampshire

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 21209 is in Maryland (MD)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states

      - New Hampshire is in the Northeast region (New England)

      - Maryland is in the Mid-Atlantic region


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - On a US map, New Hampshire is positioned along the eastern seaboard

      - Maryland is also on the eastern coast, but is positioned southwest of New
      Hampshire

      - When moving from Maryland to New Hampshire, you travel northeast, not west


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since New Hampshire is east of Maryland (not west of it), zip code 03303 in
      NH is east of zip code 21209 in MD.

      I need to find the approximate locations:


      1) 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      2) 21209 is in Maryland (MD)


      The United States is laid out such that states in the east are closer to the
      Atlantic Ocean, and states in the west are further from the Atlantic Ocean (or
      closer to the Pacific Ocean).


      New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in
      the New England region. It borders the Atlantic Ocean to the east.


      Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, south of
      Pennsylvania and north of Virginia.


      Comparing these two states geographically:

      - New Hampshire is in the Northeast

      - Maryland is in the Mid-Atlantic region


      In terms of east-west positioning, New Hampshire is actually east of Maryland.
      If you look at a US map, the New England states (including NH) extend further

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 21209 is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Hampshire is located in the New England region in the northeastern United
      States

      - Maryland is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, south of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New Hampshire is positioned in the far northeast, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Maryland is positioned more centrally along the eastern seaboard

      - On a map of the United States, New Hampshire is clearly east of Maryland

      - Illinois is located in the midwest of the United States


      Generally, states on the eastern seaboard (like South Carolina) are east of
      midwestern states (like Illinois). This means South Carolina would be east of
      Illinois, not west.


      Thus, 29405, SC would be east of 60626, IL, not west of it.</think>I need to
      determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 29405 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 60626 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - South Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - States on the eastern seaboard (like South Carolina) are generally east of
      midwestern states (like Illinois)

      - Moving from Illinois to South Carolina, you would travel eastward

      - Therefore, South Carolina is east of Illinois, not west


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 29405, SC is in South Carolina, it is east of 60626, IL

      First, let me identify which states these zip codes are in:

      - 29405, SC means zip code 29405 in South Carolina

      - 60626, IL means zip code 60626 in Illinois


      Now I need to think about the general geographic positions of these states:

      - South Carolina (SC) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest


      Specifically in terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Illinois is generally
      west of South Carolina. This means that locations in South Carolina are generally

      - Moving from east to west across the US, you would encounter South Carolina
      before Illinois


      Step 4: Make the determination based on longitude.

      - Since South Carolina is east of Illinois, zip code 29405 in SC must be east

      1) 80130, CO - This is a zip code in Colorado

      2) 85255, AZ - This is a zip code in Arizona


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. In the US, lower longitude
      numbers are further west. Colorado is generally east of Arizona, so we would
      expect the Colorado zip code to be east of the Arizona zip code.


      Colorado is located to the east of Arizona in the United States. The entire
      state of Colorado is east of Arizona. So any zip code in Colorado would be east
      of any zip code in Arizona.


      Therefore, 80130, CO (which is in Colorado) is located EAST of 85255, AZ (which
      is in Arizona), not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two zip codes on the east-west axis.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 80130 is in Colorado (CO)

      - 85255 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      Colorado is located to the east of Arizona on the US map. The entire state of
      Colorado is positioned east of Arizona.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes

      Since 80130 is in Colorado, and 85255 is in Arizona, the Colorado zip code must
      be east of the Arizona zip code, not west of it.

      west of 85255, AZ, I need to identify the locations and compare their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify what 80130, CO represents.

      - 80130 is a zip code in Colorado (CO).

      - Looking at my knowledge, this zip code corresponds to Highlands Ranch, which
      is near Denver in Colorado.


      Step 2: Identify what 85255, AZ represents.

      - 85255 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ).

      - Looking at my knowledge, this zip code corresponds to Scottsdale, Arizona.


      Step 3: Consider the relative positions of Colorado and Arizona.

      - Colorado is generally east of Arizona in the United States.

      - Arizona borders the western edge of Colorado, but Arizona extends further
      west.


      Step 4: Compare the specific locations.

      - Highlands Ranch, CO is in the central-east part of Colorado.

      - Scottsdale, AZ is in the central-east part of Arizona.</think># Is 80130,
      CO located west of 85255, AZ?


      I''ll solve this step by step by determining the locations and comparing their
      east-west positioning.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 80130 is a ZIP code for Highlands Ranch, Colorado

      - 85255 is a ZIP code for Scottsdale, Arizona


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' positions

      - Colorado is located directly east of Utah

      - Arizona is located south of Utah and west of New Mexico

      - Generally, Arizona is west of Colorado on a map


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - Highlands Ranch (80130) is in the east-central part of Colorado

      - Scottsdale (85255) is in the east-central part of Arizona

      - Even though both are in the eastern portions of their respective states, the
      entire state of Colorado is east of Arizona


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Colorado is east of Arizona, Highlands Ranch (80130, CO) must be east
      of Scottsdale (85255, AZ), not west.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 53209 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 76155 is in Texas (TX)


      To determine which is more westerly, I need to know their approximate longitudes.


      Generally in the US:

      - Wisconsin is in the northern Midwest region

      - Texas is in the southern central/southwest region


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Wisconsin is roughly in the middle of the country but toward the east half

      - Texas extends quite far west


      Wisconsin is generally east of Texas on a map of the United States. If we think
      about longitude lines, Texas (especially central and western parts) has lower
      longitude numbers (more westerly) than Wisconsin.


      So if 53209 is in Wisconsin and 76155 is in Texas, then 53209 is likely EAST
      of 76155, not west of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the east-west relationship between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of these states.

      - Wisconsin (WI) is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is located in the South Central region of the United States


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the US map.

      - Wisconsin is positioned much further east than Texas

      - Texas extends significantly further west than Wisconsin


      Step 3: While specific zip codes might have some variation, the general state
      positions will determine their east-west relationship.

      - 53209 is in Wisconsin, which is positioned to the east of Texas

      - 76155 is in Texas, which is positioned to the west of Wisconsin


      Therefore, 53209 in Wisconsin is located EAST of 76155 in Texas, not west of
      it.

      Wisconsin is roughly around the Great Lakes region, while Texas borders Mexico.

      region

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, extending toward the
      southwest


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west).

      - Wisconsin is generally positioned to the east of Texas

      - Texas extends further west than Wisconsin does


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Wisconsin is positioned to the east of Texas on a map of the United States,
      a zip code in Wisconsin (53209) would be east of a zip code in Texas (76155),

      1. Identify where 19363, PA is located (which city/town in Pennsylvania)

      2. Identify where 44095, OH is located (which city/town in Ohio)

      3. Compare their geographic positions to determine which is further west


      Let me start by analyzing these zip codes:


      19363 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is generally east of
      Ohio.

      44095 is a zip code in Ohio (OH).


      Geographically, Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, as Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic
      coast and Ohio is an inland state. In general, locations in Pennsylvania would
      be east of locations in Ohio.


      However, Pennsylvania is a large state with an irregular western border with
      Ohio, so we need to check the specific locations more carefully. Some parts
      of western PA could potentially be west of eastern parts of OH.


      19363 appears to be in southeastern Pennsylvania, likely in the vicinity of
      Philadelphia or southeastern PA.

      44095 appears to be in northeastern Ohio.


      Given this information, 19363 PA is very likely east of 44095 OH, not west of
      it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 19363 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 44095 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Ohio is generally west of Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania is on the east coast, while Ohio is inland


      Step 3: Look at the specific locations within their states.

      - 19363 is in southeastern Pennsylvania (in Oxford)

      - 44095 is in northeastern Ohio (in Eastlake)


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Even though the zip codes are in different parts of their respective states,
      the entire state of Pennsylvania is east of Ohio geographically.

      - The western border of Pennsylvania connects to the eastern border of Ohio.

      - Therefore, any location in Pennsylvania would be east of any location in Ohio

      To determine this, I need to know the geographic locations of these zip codes.
      In general in the US:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is east of Ohio (OH)

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania on Pennsylvania''s western border


      Since Pennsylvania is generally east of Ohio, it would be unusual for a PA zip
      code to be west of an OH zip code. But I should check the specific locations
      since zip codes near borders could potentially cross this pattern.


      Based on general geographic knowledge:

      - Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio

      - So a typical PA zip code would be east of a typical OH zip code

      - Therefore, 19363, PA is likely east of 44095, OH, not west


      This would mean the answer is "NO" - 19363, PA is not west of 44095, OH.


      But let me double-check by thinking about where these specific zip codes might
      be located:

      - 19xxx zip codes are usually in eastern Pennsylvania (Philadelphia area)

      - 44xxx zip codes are typically in northern/northeastern Ohio


      This confirms that 19363 is likely in eastern PA, while 44095 is likely in northeastern

      - The 193xx zip codes are generally in the southeastern portion of Pennsylvania

      - The 440xx zip codes are in northeastern Ohio (likely in the Cleveland area)

      First, I need to identify what these zip codes correspond to:

      - 19363, PA is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 44095, OH is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      To determine which is further west, I need to know their approximate locations.


      Pennsylvania is generally east of Ohio in the United States. Ohio borders Pennsylvania
      on Pennsylvania''s western border. That means that in general, locations in
      Ohio tend to be west of locations in Pennsylvania.


      However, zip codes near the border could potentially contradict this general
      rule, so I should try to be more specific about these particular zip codes.


      19363 appears to be in southeastern Pennsylvania.

      44095 appears to be in northeastern Ohio.


      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, and these zip codes don''t seem to be in
      unusual border areas that would contradict the general geography, 44095 in Ohio
      should be west of 19363 in Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, 19363, PA should NOT be west of 44095, OH. Instead, 44095, OH should
      be west of 19363, PA.</think># Is 19363, PA located west of 44095, OH?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 44095 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio on the US map. Ohio borders Pennsylvania''s
      western edge.


      ## Step 3: Look at specific zip codes

      - 19363 (PA) is located in southeastern Pennsylvania (Oxford area)

      - 44095 (OH) is located in northeastern Ohio (Eastlake area)


      ## Step 4: Compare their positions

      Even though both are in the northern parts of their respective states, the fact
      that Ohio is west of Pennsylvania means that an Ohio zip code (including 44095)
      would be west of a Pennsylvania zip code (including 19363).


      ## Answer: NO


      19363, PA is NOT located west of 44095, OH. Rather, it''s the opposite - 44095,
      OH is west of 19363, PA, following the general geographic arrangement of these
      two states.'

      To determine which is west of the other, I need to know the relative geographical
      positions of these locations.


      Let me think about the general layout of these states:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located east of Ohio (OH)

      - So generally, locations in Pennsylvania are east of locations in Ohio


      However, zip codes can sometimes be in unusual arrangements, so I should think
      about this more carefully.


      19363 is in Pennsylvania, which is generally east of Ohio.

      44095 is in Ohio, which is generally west of Pennsylvania.


      Given that PA is east of OH, and these zip codes are in those respective states,

      - Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania shares its western border with Ohio


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions

      - Since 19363 is in Pennsylvania and 44095 is in Ohio

      - And Pennsylvania is east of Ohio

      - Therefore, 19363, PA must be east of 44095, OH (not west)

      First, let me identify what states these zip codes are in:

      - 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 44095 is in Ohio (OH)


      In general, Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, since Pennsylvania is on the eastern
      seaboard of the US, while Ohio is more inland.


      However, I need to check the specific zip codes, since states have irregular
      shapes and some parts of one state might be east or west of specific parts of
      another state.


      The zip code 19363 is likely in western Pennsylvania, and 44095 is likely in
      eastern Ohio. Pennsylvania borders Ohio on Ohio''s eastern side.


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Pennsylvania is to the east of Ohio

      - So, typically, any location in Pennsylvania would be east of locations in
      Ohio

      - This means that 19363, PA would typically be east of 44095, OH

      - If 19363, PA is east of 44095, OH, then it is NOT west of it

      - 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 44095 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio on the US map. Ohio borders Pennsylvania''s

      ## Step 3: Check specific zip codes

      - Zip code 19363 is in southeastern Pennsylvania

      - Zip code 44095 is in northeastern Ohio


      ## Step 4: Determine the relative positions

      Since Pennsylvania is east of Ohio, locations in Pennsylvania (including 19363)

      02452 in Massachusetts (MA) is located west of the zip code 15690 in Pennsylvania
      (PA).


      First, let me recall the general geography of these states:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is also in the northeastern US, but southwest of Massachusetts


      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, not west. But I need
      to check the specific zip codes to be sure.


      For US zip codes:

      - Lower numbers (starting with 0) are generally in the northeastern states

      - Higher numbers tend to be further west and south


      02452 starts with "0" which confirms it''s in the northeastern region (specifically
      MA)

      15690 starts with "1" which is still eastern US but a bit further west than
      the "0" zip codes


      Since 02452 is in MA (with a lower first digit in the zip code) and 15690 is
      in PA (with a higher first digit), this confirms that 02452, MA is east of 15690,
      PA, not west of it.</think># Is 02452, MA located west of 15690, PA?


      To answer this question, I''ll need to determine the geographic relationship

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 02452 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15690 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern US, but positioned southwest of Massachusetts


      ## Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbering system

      US zip codes follow a general west-to-east pattern:

      - Lower numbers (starting with 0) are in the northeastern states

      - Higher numbers (like those starting with 1) are further west than the 0-series


      ## Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes

      - 02452 (MA) starts with "0" indicating far northeastern position

      - 15690 (PA) starts with "1" indicating a position west of the 0-series zip
      codes


      Therefore, 02452 in Massachusetts is located EAST of 15690 in Pennsylvania,

      Now, in terms of US geography, Massachusetts is located on the east coast, while
      Pennsylvania is also on the east coast but more inland/westward compared to
      Massachusetts.


      In general, Massachusetts is EAST of Pennsylvania. This means that locations

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      Massachusetts is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while
      Pennsylvania is located inland but still in the eastern part of the country.


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      Massachusetts is positioned to the east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United

      3. Answer if MA zip code is west of PA zip code


      First, let''s identify:

      - 02452 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15690 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      In the United States, states are generally positioned such that:

    c1d9afc9-26e9-48bd-a65a-7ee9f3ffe3ba: '<think>I need to determine if 02452, MA
      (Massachusetts) is located west of 15690, PA (Pennsylvania).


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these states first:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is also on the east coast, but is located west of Massachusetts


      Generally, states further west have higher first digits in their zip codes,
      and MA has a lower first digit (0) than PA (1), which is consistent with MA
      being east of PA.


      Let me double-check this with specific zip codes:

      - 02452 is in MA (likely in the eastern part of Massachusetts)

      - 15690 is in PA (somewhere in Pennsylvania)


      Since 02452 is in Massachusetts and 15690 is in Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts
      is east of Pennsylvania, that means 02452, MA is located EAST of 15690, PA,
      not west.


      So is 02452, MA located west of 15690, PA? No, it''s the opposite - 02452, MA
      is east of 15690, PA.</think>To determine if 02452, MA is located west of 15690,
      PA, I need to analyze the geographic relationship between these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 02452 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15690 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is also on the eastern side of the US, but is positioned west
      of Massachusetts


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers (especially first
      digits) are assigned to the eastern parts of the country

      - The first digit "0" (as in 02452) represents the northeasternmost region including
      Massachusetts

      - The first digit "1" (as in 15690) represents areas including Pennsylvania,
      which are west of the "0" zone


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic relationships.

      Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, so a zip code in MA (02452) would be
      east of a zip code in PA (15690), not west.

      1. We need to determine if the zip code 02452 in Massachusetts (MA) is located
      west of zip code 15690 in Pennsylvania (PA).


      2. To determine this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these
      zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the general locations of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania
      in the United States. Massachusetts is in the northeastern part of the US, on
      the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern US, but it''s inland
      and south of Massachusetts.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania.
      This means locations in Massachusetts are typically east of locations in Pennsylvania,
      not west.


      The zip code 02452 is in MA, which means it''s likely in the eastern part of
      the US.

      The zip code 15690 is in PA, which means it''s likely west of most places in
      Massachusetts.


      Given the general geography of the United States, a location in Massachusetts
      (02452) would be east of a location in Pennsylvania (15690), not west of it.


      So, is 02452, MA located west of 15690, PA? No, it would be east of it.</think>#

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 02452 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15690 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast

      - Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern US, but is positioned southwest of
      Massachusetts


      Step 3: Compare their locations on an east-west axis

      - Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania

      - Zip codes starting with "02" are in eastern Massachusetts

      - Zip codes starting with "15" are in western Pennsylvania


      Even though we''re comparing specific zip codes, the overall geographic relationship
      between these states means that any location in Massachusetts (including 02452)
      would be east of, not west of, locations in Pennsylvania (including 15690).

      determine if the zip code 05677 in Vermont (VT) is located west of zip code
      40109 in Kentucky (KY).


      Step 1: I need to think about the general geographic locations of Vermont and
      Kentucky.

      - Vermont (VT) is a state in the northeastern United States, part of New England.

      - Kentucky (KY) is a state in the southeastern/east-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Vermont is located on the eastern seaboard, bordering New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

      - Kentucky is more centrally located in the country, west of states like Virginia
      but east of states like Missouri.


      Step 3: Looking at relative longitude, Vermont is generally around 72-73 degrees
      west longitude, while Kentucky is around 84-89 degrees west longitude.


      Since longitude increases as you go west (in the western hemisphere), and Kentucky
      has a higher longitude number than Vermont, that means Kentucky is west of Vermont.

      ## Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions

      - Vermont is positioned along the eastern seaboard

      - Kentucky is positioned more centrally in the country

      - Looking at a map of the US, Vermont lies to the EAST of Kentucky


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Vermont is east of Kentucky, zip code 05677 in VT would be east of zip
      code 40109 in KY, not west of it.

      05677 is a zip code in Vermont (VT).

      40109 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY).


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of Vermont and Kentucky within
      the United States:


      Vermont is located in the northeastern part of the United States, in the New
      England region.

      Kentucky is located in the east-central part of the United States, in the Appalachian
      region.


      Generally speaking, Vermont is located to the east of Kentucky. If we were to
      draw a line directly south from Vermont, it would be significantly to the east
      of Kentucky. Or if we draw a line directly east from Kentucky, it would be significantly
      south of Vermont.


      Since longitude measures east-west position (with lower numbers being further
      west), Vermont would have a higher longitude number than Kentucky, making Vermont
      east of Kentucky, not west.


      Therefore, 05677, VT is NOT located west of 40109, KY. It is located east of
      it.</think># Is 05677, VT located west of 40109, KY?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1. First, I need to identify the general geographic locations of Vermont and
      Kentucky.

      2. Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, in the New England
      region.

      3. Kentucky (KY) is located in the east-central United States.

      4. When comparing east-west positioning in the US, we''re looking at longitude.

      5. Vermont is positioned significantly further east than Kentucky on the US
      map.

      6. The zip code 05677 is in Vermont, and therefore would be east of Kentucky.

      7. The zip code 40109 is in Kentucky, and therefore would be west of Vermont.


      Since Vermont is east of Kentucky (not west), the zip code in Vermont (05677)
      cannot be west of the zip code in Kentucky (40109).

      To answer whether one is west of the other, I need to know their relative geographical
      positions.


      Looking at a US map, Pennsylvania is located in the eastern part of the United
      States, while Indiana is in the Midwest. Specifically, Indiana is west of Pennsylvania.


      Since 19043 is in Pennsylvania (east) and 46222 is in Indiana (west), the location

      Pennsylvania is located on the eastern side of the United States, while Indiana
      is in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      On a map of the United States, Indiana is clearly west of Pennsylvania. Indiana
      borders Ohio on its eastern side, while Pennsylvania is further east, bordering
      Ohio on its eastern side.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the zip codes.

      Since 19043 is in Pennsylvania (which is east) and 46222 is in Indiana (which

      To determine this, I need to know the relative positions of these zip codes.
      The US states are generally arranged with the East Coast on the right side of

      the relative positions of Pennsylvania and Indiana.


      Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern part of the United States,

      Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern side of the country,

      - 46222, IN is a zip code in Indiana (IN)


      Now, to determine if one is west of the other, I need to consider their geographic

      2. 46222 is a zip code in IN (Indiana).

      3. I need to determine if 19043 in PA is located west of 46222 in IN.


      To solve this, I need to know the geographic locations of these zip codes. Generally
      speaking, Pennsylvania is located in the eastern part of the United States,
      while Indiana is in the Midwest. Looking at a map of the United States, Pennsylvania
      is east of Indiana, not west.


      Therefore, it''s unlikely that any zip code in Pennsylvania would be west of
      a zip code in Indiana. Pennsylvania borders Ohio to its west, and Indiana is
      further west of Ohio.


      So 19043, PA is likely located east of 46222, IN, not west.</think>To determine
      if 19043, PA is located west of 46222, IN, I need to consider the geographical
      positions of Pennsylvania and Indiana.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 19043 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 46222 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the eastern part of the United States, while Indiana
      is in the Midwest.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      If you look at a US map, Indiana is clearly west of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
      borders Ohio to its west, and Indiana is further west of Ohio.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the zip codes.

      Since 19043 is in Pennsylvania and 46222 is in Indiana, and Pennsylvania is
      east of Indiana, it follows that 19043 must be east of 46222, not west.

      the geographical relationship between two zip codes: 01430 in Massachusetts
      (MA) and 31636 in Georgia (GA).


      To answer this, I need to figure out if 01430, MA is located west of 31636,
      GA. Let me think about the general locations:


      1. Massachusetts (MA) is a state in the northeastern United States.

      2. Georgia (GA) is a state in the southeastern United States.


      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is located to the northeast of Georgia. On
      a west-east axis, Massachusetts is to the east of Georgia, not to the west.


      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 01430 is a zip code in Massachusetts, which should be in the northeastern
      part of the country

      - 31636 is a zip code in Georgia, which should be in the southeastern part of
      the country


      Since the entire state of Massachusetts is east of Georgia (MA is on the eastern
      seaboard, and GA is further west), it follows that 01430, MA would be east of
      31636, GA - not west of it.


      Therefore, 01430, MA is NOT located west of 31636, GA. It is located EAST of
      it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 01430 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 31636 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Massachusetts is on the east coast

      - Georgia is also on the east coast, but further west than Massachusetts

      - The entire state of Massachusetts lies east of Georgia


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      Since Massachusetts is entirely east of Georgia, any zip code in Massachusetts
      (including 01430) must be east of any zip code in Georgia (including 31636).

      Let''s think about the geographical positions of Massachusetts and Georgia in
      the United States:

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Massachusetts is located in the eastern part of the country

      - Georgia is also in the eastern part, but typically Georgia is further west
      than Massachusetts


      Let me think about this more specifically with the zip codes:

      - 01430 is in Massachusetts

      - 31636 is in Georgia


      The general east-west relationship between Massachusetts and Georgia is that
      Massachusetts is EAST of Georgia, not west. This means that a location in Massachusetts
      would typically be EAST of a location in Georgia, not west.


      So 01430, MA should be EAST of 31636, GA, not west of it.</think># Is 01430,

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 01430 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 31636 is in Georgia (GA)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographical positions

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Massachusetts is positioned to
      the east of Georgia

      - The entire state of Massachusetts is east of Georgia''s longitude


      ## Conclusion

      Since Massachusetts is east of Georgia on the map of the United States, zip
      code 01430 in MA is located to the east (not west) of zip code 31636 in GA.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 01810 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 15468 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the relative geography of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.

      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States.

      Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern United States, but Pennsylvania is
      west of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Since Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts, generally any location
      in Pennsylvania would be west of any location in Massachusetts. Therefore, a
      zip code in Massachusetts (01810) would be east of a zip code in Pennsylvania
      (15468), not west of it.


      Step 4: To confirm my reasoning, I can think about the general arrangement of
      these states. Moving from east to west along the US east coast, you would encounter
      Massachusetts before Pennsylvania. So Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania,
      not west of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative

      - 15468 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.

      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States along the Atlantic
      coast, while Pennsylvania is also in the northeast but positioned more inland
      and to the west of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Massachusetts is positioned to the
      east of Pennsylvania. This means that any location in Massachusetts (including
      01810) would be east of locations in Pennsylvania (including 15468), not west.

      01810 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)

      15468 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to know their relative positions
      on a map. In the US, generally:

      - Massachusetts is in the Northeast, on the East Coast

      - Pennsylvania is also in the Northeast, but it''s west of Massachusetts


      Looking at these states'' relative positions:

      - Massachusetts is bordered by New York to the west, Vermont and New Hampshire
      to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and Connecticut and Rhode Island
      to the south.

      - Pennsylvania is south of New York, west of New Jersey, north of Maryland,
      and east of Ohio.


      Based on general US geography, Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts. However,
      I need to check the specific zip codes to be sure, as they could be in unusual
      parts of their respective states.


      01810 is likely in eastern Massachusetts (as MA zip codes generally start with
      0).

      15468 is likely in western Pennsylvania (as PA zip codes generally range from
      15xxx-19xxx, with western PA having lower numbers).


      Even in the extreme case where 01810 is in western Massachusetts and 15468 is
      in eastern Pennsylvania, Massachusetts is still generally east of Pennsylvania.


      So 01810, MA is east of 15468, PA, not west of it.</think>To determine if 01810,

      - 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, on the Atlantic

      Step 3: Check the specific zip codes

      - 01810 appears to be in eastern Massachusetts (Andover area)

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania, which lies entirely west of Massachusetts


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the east-west relationship

      Since Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, and no part of Massachusetts extends
      west of Pennsylvania, it''s not possible for a Massachusetts zip code to be
      west of a Pennsylvania zip code.

      To solve this problem, I need to know the approximate longitude of each zip
      code:


      1) 07440 is in New Jersey (NJ), which is on the east coast of the United States.

      2) 35954 is in Alabama (AL), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Generally, New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the US, while Alabama
      is more inland but still in the eastern half of the country.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Alabama is typically west of
      New Jersey. States on the east coast like NJ are further east than southeastern
      states like Alabama.


      So the zip code in Alabama (35954) should be west of the zip code in New Jersey
      (07440).

      by finding the approximate locations of these zip codes and comparing their
      longitudes.


      Let''s start with some general geographic knowledge:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Alabama (AL) is in the southeastern United States, but is not on the East
      Coast - it''s more inland


      Now, for more specific locations:

      - 07440 is a zip code in New Jersey

      - 35954 is a zip code in Alabama


      Generally speaking, locations that are "west" have a higher longitude value
      (more negative in the Western Hemisphere). Since both states are in the eastern
      United States, I need to consider their relative positions.


      New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast, while Alabama is inland but still in the
      southeastern US. Geographically, New Jersey is generally east of Alabama.


      So, if 07440, NJ is east of 35954, AL, then 07440, NJ is NOT west of 35954,
      AL.

      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if 07440, NJ is west of 35954, AL, I need to consider the geographical
      positions of these locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States, but inland from
      the East Coast


      ## Step 2: Consider state positions on a longitude scale

      - States further west have more negative longitude values in the Western Hemisphere

      - New Jersey is significantly east of Alabama on the US map


      ## Step 3: Apply to specific zip codes

      - Zip code 07440 is in New Jersey (likely in the northern part of the state)

      - Zip code 35954 is in Alabama (specific location within the state)

      - All of New Jersey is east of all of Alabama


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since New Jersey is positioned east of Alabama on the US map, zip code 07440
      in NJ must be east of zip code 35954 in AL, not west of it.

      2. Determine which is further west (has a smaller longitude value)


      Zip code 11218 is in New York (NY). Specifically, it''s in Brooklyn, New York

      - Michigan is in the Midwest, and is significantly west of New York


      Even though I don''t know the exact longitude values, I know that all of Michigan
      is west of New York state, so a zip code in Michigan would be west of a zip

      Coast of the United States.

      - 48069 is a zip code in Michigan (MI), which is in the Midwest region.

      - The state of New York is positioned in the eastern part of the United States.

      - Michigan is positioned in the Midwest, significantly west of New York.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - When comparing east-west positions in the continental US, locations in Michigan

      - 07092, NJ is EAST of 60060, IL (not west)


      So the answer to "Is 07092, NJ located west of 60060, IL?" is NO.</think>I need
      to determine if 07092, NJ is located west of 60060, IL by considering the geographic
      positions of these states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these states within the US.

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Illinois (IL) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship between these states.

      - Illinois is significantly west of New Jersey on the US map.

      - All of New Jersey is east of all of Illinois.


      Step 3: Since the zip codes 07092 and 60060 are in New Jersey and Illinois respectively,
      they follow the same east-west relationship as their states.

      - 07092, NJ must be east of 60060, IL.

      - 60060, IL must be west of 07092, NJ.


      Therefore, 07092, NJ is NOT located west of 60060, IL. It is located east of
      it.

      07092 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      60060 is a zip code in Illinois (IL).


      In the United States, generally speaking:

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast

      - Illinois is in the Midwest, east of the Rocky Mountains but west of the East
      Coast states


      In terms of longitude, Illinois is west of New Jersey. This means that locations

      So 07092, NJ would be east of 60060, IL, not west.</think>I''ll solve this step
      by step:


      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 07092 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 60060 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographical positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Illinois is significantly west of New Jersey

      - In terms of longitude, locations in New Jersey are east of locations in Illinois

      First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of these states:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the East Coast of the US

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest, significantly west of New Jersey


      Based on US geography, Illinois is west of New Jersey. Therefore, any location

      - Illinois is significantly west of New Jersey

      - All of New Jersey is east of all of Illinois


      Since New Jersey is entirely east of Illinois on the map of the United States,
      a zip code in New Jersey (07092) cannot be west of a zip code in Illinois (60060).

    a44330d8-e4bf-401e-947a-27e374e68252: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      if zip code 44116 in Ohio is located west of zip code 77045 in Texas.


      To answer this, I need to understand the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Let me think about the general geographic relationship between Ohio and Texas:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States

      - Texas is in the Southern/Southwestern part of the United States


      Generally speaking, Ohio is east of Texas, not west of it. On a map of the United
      States, Ohio is to the right (east) of Texas.


      So if 44116 is in Ohio and 77045 is in Texas, then the Ohio zip code would be
      east of the Texas zip code, not west of it.


      Therefore, 44116, OH would NOT be located west of 77045, TX. It would be located
      east of it.</think>To determine if 44116, OH is located west of 77045, TX, I
      need to consider the geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the general geographic positions of Ohio and Texas.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest/eastern part of the United States.

      Texas is located in the southern/southwestern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the directional relationship between these states.

      On a U.S. map, Ohio is positioned to the east of Texas. The entire state of
      Ohio lies east of Texas.


      Step 3: Since zip code 44116 is in Ohio and zip code 77045 is in Texas, their
      relative positions follow the same relationship as their states.


      Step 4: Therefore, zip code 44116 in Ohio must be east of zip code 77045 in
      Texas, not west of it.


      NO'

      OH is located west of 77045, TX.


      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 44116, OH: This is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      - 77045, TX: This is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      In the United States, states are positioned geographically such that:

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the country

      - Texas (TX) is in the South/Southwest part of the country


      Looking at their relative positions on a US map:

      - Ohio is generally east of Texas

      - Texas is generally west of Ohio


      Therefore, a zip code in Ohio (44116) would be east of a zip code in Texas (77045),
      not west of it.</think>To determine if 44116, OH is located west of 77045, TX,
      I need to identify the geographic locations of these zip codes and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 44116 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 77045 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Ohio is located in the Midwest/Eastern region of the United States, while Texas
      is located in the South/Southwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning

      Looking at a map of the United States, Ohio is positioned to the east of Texas.
      The entire state of Ohio is east of Texas.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion about the zip codes

      Since 44116 is in Ohio, and Ohio is east of Texas (where 77045 is located),
      it follows that 44116, OH is east of 77045, TX, not west of it.

      located west of 75150, TX, I need to find the geographic locations of these
      zip codes.


      33703 is a zip code in Florida (FL). Florida is on the eastern side of the United
      States, along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.


      75150 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is in the south-central part of the
      United States, west of Florida.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Florida is east of Texas. Since
      33703 is in Florida and 75150 is in Texas, the zip code 33703 would be east
      of 75150, not west of it.


      Therefore, 33703, FL is NOT located west of 75150, TX. It''s located east of

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 33703 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 75150 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative east-west positions.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      Step 3: Looking at a US map, Texas is clearly west of Florida. All of Florida
      is east of all of Texas.


      Step 4: Since 33703 is in Florida and 75150 is in Texas, the Florida zip code
      must be east of the Texas zip code, not west.

      1. 07052 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      2. 44012 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      3. The question asks if the NJ zip code is west of the OH zip code


      To answer this, I need to know the general geographic positions of these states.
      The United States is laid out where:

      - East Coast states are on the eastern edge of the country

      - Midwest states like Ohio are more central but still eastern half

      - West Coast states are on the western edge


      New Jersey (NJ) is on the East Coast of the United States.

      Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest, but still in the eastern half of the country.


      When comparing east-west positions in the US, generally:

      - States on the East Coast are east of Midwest states

      - So New Jersey would be east of Ohio, not west of it


      Therefore, 07052, NJ would be EAST of 44012, OH, not west of it.</think>I need

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - When looking at a US map, Ohio is clearly west of New Jersey

      - This means New Jersey is east of Ohio, not west of it

      Let me think about this. US zip codes have specific geographic areas they cover.

      28457 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      24354 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Generally, Virginia is north of North Carolina. But the question is asking about
      east/west positioning.


      North Carolina is generally south and slightly west of Virginia, but the specific
      zip codes matter because these states share a border that runs roughly northeast
      to southwest.


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I need to determine if 28457, NC is

      Based on my knowledge of zip codes:

      - 28xxx zip codes tend to be in eastern and central North Carolina

      - 24xxx zip codes tend to be in southwestern Virginia


      So 28457 is likely in central/eastern NC, and 24354 is likely in southwestern

      2. I need to identify where 24354, VA is located.

      3. I need to determine if the NC location is west of the VA location.


      For US geography, I need to recall that North Carolina (NC) is generally south
      of Virginia (VA). However, that doesn''t tell us about east/west positioning.


      The western part of North Carolina borders the eastern part of Tennessee, while
      Virginia is to the north of North Carolina. The western parts of Virginia are
      close to West Virginia and Kentucky.


      ZIP code 28457 is in North Carolina, and ZIP code 24354 is in Virginia.


      Let me think about the general pattern of ZIP codes. In the US, ZIP codes generally
      increase as you go from east to west. The lowest ZIP codes (00xxx-03xxx) are
      in the Northeast, and the highest (9xxxx) are in the West Coast.


      ZIP code 28457 is in the 2xxxx range, which typically covers the Eastern seaboard
      states. The same applies to 24354.


      Since both ZIP codes are in the 2xxxx range, I''ll need to look more specifically
      at the patterns within these states.


      Within the Eastern states, ZIP codes still generally increase as you go west,
      but there can be exceptions based on population centers and historical assignment
      patterns.


      Based on my knowledge, ZIP codes in Virginia (24xxx) are typically in the western
      part of the state, while North Carolina ZIP codes in the 28xxx range are often
      in the central or western parts of North Carolina.


      Given that 28457 (NC) is a higher number than 24354 (VA), and applying the general

      - ZIP code 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - ZIP code 24354 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider ZIP code patterns in the eastern US.

      While ZIP codes generally increase from east to west across the entire country,
      within the eastern states there are regional patterns to consider.


      Step 3: Locate these specific ZIP codes.

      - 28457 is in the western portion of North Carolina (specifically in the Salisbury/Gold
      Hill area)

      - 24354 is in the southwestern part of Virginia (in the Rural Retreat area)


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Virginia is north of North Carolina, but that doesn''t automatically tell us
      the east-west relationship. Looking at the specific locations, ZIP code 24354
      in southwestern Virginia is actually slightly west of where 28457 is located

      1. 28457, NC (North Carolina)

      2. 24354, VA (Virginia)


      Specifically, I need to determine if the first zip code is west of the second
      one.


      First, let''s consider the relative positions of North Carolina and Virginia.
      Generally speaking, Virginia is north of North Carolina, with both states on
      the eastern seaboard of the US.


      However, the question is about east-west positioning, not north-south. The western
      parts of North Carolina extend further west than the western parts of Virginia,
      while the eastern parts of both states touch the Atlantic Ocean.


      To answer precisely, I need to determine where these specific zip codes are
      located within their states.


      Zip code 28457 is in North Carolina

      Zip code 24354 is in Virginia


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I can use some general knowledge about
      zip codes. Lower numbers in the first three digits of zip codes tend to be in
      the eastern parts of the US, while higher numbers tend to be in the western
      parts.


      28457 has a higher first three digits (284) compared to 24354 (243).


      This suggests that 28457 is likely further west than 24354.</think># Is 28457,
      NC located west of 24354, VA?


      I need to determine the geographic relationship between these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Understand the zip code numbering system

      The US zip code system generally follows patterns where lower numbers in the
      first three digits tend to be assigned to areas in the eastern US, and higher
      numbers to western areas.


      ## Step 2: Compare the first three digits

      - 28457 (NC) starts with 284

      - 24354 (VA) starts with 243


      ## Step 3: Analyze the pattern

      Since 284 is higher than 243, this suggests that 28457 is likely further west
      within the overall zip code system.


      ## Step 4: Consider state positions

      Virginia is north of North Carolina. While both states are on the eastern seaboard,
      North Carolina extends further west than Virginia in their western regions.


      ## Step 5: Reach a conclusion

      Based on both the zip code numbering pattern and the general geography of these
      states, 28457, NC is likely west of 24354, VA.

      - 28457, NC: This is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 24354, VA: This is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Generally, Virginia is north and slightly east of North Carolina. However, the
      western part of North Carolina extends quite far west (into the Appalachian

      I need to be more specific about these particular zip codes. Since I don''t
      have direct access to a zip code database, I''ll reason based on the general
      pattern of zip codes.


      In the US zip code system:

      - First digit indicates a general geographic area (0-9 from east to west)

      - The first three digits together define a more specific sectional center facility


      For these zip codes:

      - 28457 starts with "2", which covers parts of the east coast including NC

      - 24354 also starts with "2", covering parts of the east coast including VA


      Since both start with "2", they''re in the same general region. Looking at the
      next digit:

      - "8" in 28457 (NC)

      - "4" in 24354 (VA)


      Within the same first-digit region, lower second digits are generally more eastern
      than higher second digits. So the "4" in the VA zip code suggests it''s more
      eastern than the "8" in the NC zip code.


      Therefore, 28457, NC is likely west of 24354, VA.</think># Is 28457, NC located
      west of 24354, VA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 24354 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Analyze zip code patterns

      In the US zip code system, the first three digits indicate geographic regions.
      Lower numbers in the same region generally indicate more eastern locations.


      - 28457 (NC) starts with "284"

      - 24354 (VA) starts with "243"


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      Virginia is generally northeast of North Carolina, but their western borders
      have a different relationship. Looking at the specific zip codes:


      - 28457 is in western North Carolina (higher second digit "8")

      - 24354 is in southwestern Virginia (lower second digit "4")


      The zip code 28457 (NC) is in the western part of North Carolina, while 24354
      (VA) is more eastern within the Appalachian region of Virginia.


      YES, 28457, NC is located west of 24354, VA.'

      2. Find the location of zip code 24354 in Virginia (VA)

      3. Determine which one is further west


      In the US, zip codes generally follow some patterns where lower numbers tend
      to be in the eastern parts of the country, with numbers increasing as you go
      west. However, this is not a reliable way to determine exact relative positions,
      especially for zip codes in neighboring states.


      North Carolina is generally south of Virginia. For east-west positioning, I
      need to know the specific locations of these zip codes.


      Zip code 28457 is in North Carolina, likely in the western or central part of
      the state.

      Zip code 24354 is in Virginia, likely in the southwestern part of Virginia.


      Since Virginia is north of North Carolina, and these seem to be in the western
      parts of their respective states, I need to determine if 28457, NC is west of
      24354, VA.


      Without looking at a map, it''s hard to be certain, but southwestern Virginia
      often extends further west than much of North Carolina. However, the westernmost
      part of North Carolina extends quite far west.


      I believe zip code 28457 is in western North Carolina, and 24354 is in southwestern
      Virginia. Given the geography of these states, it''s likely that the NC zip
      code is west of the VA zip code, but I cannot be completely certain without
      verifying the exact locations.</think>To determine if 28457, NC is located west
      of 24354, VA, I need to find the geographic locations of both zip codes and
      compare their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of zip code 28457 in North Carolina.

      This zip code is located in the Salisbury area of North Carolina, in the central
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Identify the location of zip code 24354 in Virginia.

      This zip code is associated with Marion, Virginia, which is in the southwestern
      part of Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Marion, VA (24354) is in the mountainous western region of Virginia, while Salisbury,
      NC (28457) is in the central Piedmont region of North Carolina.


      When comparing longitudes, Marion, VA is further west than Salisbury, NC. The
      southwestern part of Virginia extends westward beyond the central part of North
      Carolina.

      28457 in North Carolina is west of zip code 24354 in Virginia.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative east-west positioning


      The US zip codes generally follow geographic patterns, with lower numbers in
      the east and higher numbers in the west. However, this pattern isn''t perfect
      for granular comparisons, especially between different states.


      Looking at these specific zip codes:

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 24354 is in Virginia (VA)


      Generally, Virginia is north of North Carolina. In terms of east-west positioning,
      parts of Virginia are west of parts of North Carolina, particularly in the western
      regions of both states.


      However, I need to be careful about the specific zip codes. The first digit
      "2" in both suggests they''re in the same general eastern region of the US.
      Within that region, the "8" in 28457 suggests it''s more southern than the "4"
      in 24354.


      But this doesn''t directly tell me east-west positioning. For that, I''d need
      to know the specific locations of these zip codes.</think># Determining if 28457,
      NC is west of 24354, VA


      I need to analyze the geographic locations of these two zip codes to determine
      their east-west relationship.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 24354 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Analyze the zip code patterns

      ZIP codes in the US generally follow a west-to-east pattern, with lower numbers
      in the east and higher numbers in the west. However, the first digit (2 in both
      cases) indicates they''re both in the eastern region of the US.


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes

      - 24xxx codes are typically in western and central Virginia

      - 28xxx codes are typically in central and western North Carolina


      ## Step 4: Consider state geography

      Virginia is north of North Carolina, but their western regions overlap longitudinally.
      The key is that within the same first digit region (2), lower second digits
      (4 in 24354) are generally west of higher second digits (8 in 28457).


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 28457, NC is NOT west of 24354, VA. It is actually east of the Virginia
      zip code.'

      this:


      1) I need to determine the relative geographic positions of two zip codes

      2) I need to determine if 08221, NJ is west of 24486, VA

      3) To do this, I should find the longitude of both locations, and compare them


      Let me recall what I know about US geography:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the eastern seaboard of the US, generally east of most
      other states

      - Virginia (VA) is also on the eastern seaboard, but south of New Jersey

      - In terms of east-west positioning, VA is typically west of NJ (especially
      western parts of VA)


      But I need to be precise about these specific zip codes. Without having the
      exact longitude data for these zip codes, I can make an educated determination:


      08221 is a zip code in New Jersey, likely in the eastern part of the state near
      the Atlantic coast (zip codes starting with 0 are generally in the northeastern
      US).


      24486 is a zip code in Virginia. Zip codes in the 20000s are typically in the
      mid-Atlantic region. This is likely in the western/central part of Virginia.


      Given the general geography of the US eastern seaboard, New Jersey is east of
      Virginia. Therefore, 08221, NJ is likely east of 24486, VA, not west of it.</think>#
      Is 08221, NJ located west of 24486, VA?


      I need to determine the geographical positions of these zip codes and compare
      them.


      Step 1: Let''s consider the general locations of New Jersey and Virginia.

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Virginia (VA) is also on the eastern seaboard, but south of New Jersey


      Step 2: Examine the relative east-west positioning.

      - New Jersey as a whole is positioned to the east of Virginia on the US map

      - The eastern parts of Virginia might be at roughly the same longitude as the
      western parts of New Jersey, but most of New Jersey is east of most of Virginia


      Step 3: Consider these specific zip codes.

      - 08221 is in New Jersey, and based on its low zip code number (starting with
      0), it''s likely in the eastern portion of the state

      - 24486 is in Virginia, and is likely in the central or western portion of the
      state


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Given the geography of the eastern US, a location in New Jersey (especially
      with a low zip code) would be positioned east of a location in central/western
      Virginia


      NO'

      located west of 24486, VA, I need to:


      1. Identify where each zip code is located

      2. Determine their relative positions (east-west orientation)


      For US zip codes:

      - First digit generally indicates a broad geographical region, with lower numbers
      in the east/northeast and higher numbers in the west.

      - 0xxxx zip codes are typically in the northeastern US

      - 2xxxx zip codes are typically in the mid-Atlantic region


      Specifically:

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)


      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States.

      Virginia is south of New Jersey, but also on the east coast.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally east of Virginia. New Jersey is right on the Atlantic
      coast, while Virginia extends further inland to the west.

      - However, the specific zip codes might have different relative positions than
      the states overall.


      Looking at the first digits:

      - 0 (for NJ) indicates further east than 2 (for VA)


      So based on the zip code pattern, 08221 in NJ would be east of 24486 in VA,
      not west of it.</think># Is 08221, NJ located west of 24486, VA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Analyze the geographic positions

      - In the US zip code system, lower first digits generally indicate more eastern
      locations

      - New Jersey (08xxx) has a lower first digit than Virginia (24xxx)

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is south of New Jersey, but extends further west


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      - New Jersey''s position is entirely east of Virginia

      - The 0 in NJ''s zip code (08221) confirms its eastern position compared to
      the 2 in VA''s zip code (24486)


      Therefore, 08221, NJ is located EAST of 24486, VA, not west.

      to determine whether the zip code 45801 in Ohio is located west of the zip code
      77008 in Texas. I''ll do this by figuring out where each zip code is located
      and then comparing their relative positions.


      Let me start with identifying where these zip codes are:


      45801, OH: This zip code is in Ohio, which is in the Midwest/Eastern part of
      the United States.

      77008, TX: This zip code is in Texas, which is in the South/Southwest part of

      Looking at a mental map of the US, Ohio is east of Texas. Texas is much further
      west than Ohio in the continental United States.


      Since 45801 is in Ohio, and 77008 is in Texas, and Ohio is east of Texas, that

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States

      - Texas is located in the South/Southwest part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - On a US map, Ohio is positioned significantly east of Texas

      - Texas is west of Ohio in terms of longitude


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Ohio (where 45801 is located) is east of Texas (where 77008 is located),
      zip code 45801 cannot be west of zip code 77008.

      IL (Illinois) is located west of 79331, TX (Texas).


      To answer this, I need to compare the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Let''s think about the general geographic position of Illinois and Texas.

      Illinois is in the Midwest, while Texas is in the South/Southwest of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Let''s think more specifically about west-east positioning.

      Illinois is generally east of Texas. The Mississippi River forms the western
      border of Illinois, and Texas extends much further west than Illinois.


      Step 3: Let''s confirm by thinking about the specific zip codes.

      - 60137 is in Illinois, which means it''s in the eastern half of the continental
      US

      - 79331 is in Texas. Texas zip codes starting with 79 are typically in the western
      part of Texas


      Given that Illinois is east of Texas, and specifically 60137 (IL) would be east
      of 79331 (TX), the answer should be NO - 60137, IL is NOT west of 79331, TX.</think>#
      Is 60137, IL located west of 79331, TX?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 79331 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is located in the South/Southwest region

      - Generally, Illinois is located to the east of Texas


      ## Step 3: Check zip code regions

      - Zip codes in the 601xx range are in the Chicago suburban area of Illinois,
      in the northeastern part of the state

      - Zip codes in the 793xx range are in the western part of Texas


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      Since Illinois is positioned east of Texas on a map of the United States, zip
      code 60137 in Illinois would be east of (not west of) zip code 79331 in Texas.

      - 60137 is in Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest region of the United States\n\

      \ the Texas zip code (7 vs 6) suggests it's in a more western postal zone than\
      \ the Illinois zip code, as US zip codes generally progress from east (lower\

      3. The zip code for TX (79331) has a first digit of 7, suggesting a more western\

      \ in the southern central US and extends far west\n\nStep 3: Analyzing the zip\
      \ codes:\n- US zip codes generally follow a pattern where the first digit increases\
      \ as you move from east to west\n- 60137 (IL) starts with \"6\"\n- 79331 (TX)\

      New Jersey (NJ) is a state on the east coast of the United States.

      South Carolina (SC) is also on the east coast, but further south than New Jersey.

      On the US east coast, as you move from north to south, the coastline trends
      from northeast to southwest. New Jersey is further east than South Carolina.
      Therefore, a location in New Jersey (08062) would be east of a location in South

      New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, in the Mid-Atlantic

      South Carolina is also on the eastern seaboard, but further south in the Southeastern
      region.

      South Carolina is positioned southwest of New Jersey.

      New Jersey is generally further east (higher longitude numbers) than South Carolina.

      The entire state of New Jersey lies east of South Carolina.

      To solve this:

      1. I need to know the approximate locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their relative positions on an east-west basis

      3. Determine if the IL location is west of the TX location


      In the US, states are generally positioned as:

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest

      - Texas (TX) is in the South/Southwest


      Generally speaking, Illinois is east of Texas. Illinois borders the Mississippi
      River on its western side, while Texas extends much further west.


      US zip codes don''t necessarily follow a strict west-to-east numbering system,
      but I do know that:

      - Illinois zip codes often start with 6

      - Texas zip codes often start with 7


      This aligns with the general west-to-east progression of first digits in ZIP
      codes, with lower numbers in the Northeast/East and higher numbers moving west
      (though there are many exceptions to this pattern).


      Given that Illinois is significantly east of Texas in the United States, zip

      - Illinois is positioned along the Mississippi River

      - Texas is located further west than Illinois

      - On a map of the United States, Texas is clearly west of Illinois


      Step 4: Conclude based on relative positions.

      Since Illinois is east of Texas, zip code 62207 in Illinois must be east of
      zip code 77388 in Texas, not west of it.

      1) I need to determine if zip code 62207 in Illinois is west of zip code 77388

      2) To determine this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of
      these two zip codes.


      3) In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend
      to be in the eastern parts of the country, and higher numbers tend to be in

      of 77388.


      5) However, I should also consider the states themselves. Illinois (IL) is generally
      east of Texas (TX) in the United States.


      6) Texas is in the south-central part of the US, while Illinois is in the Midwest,
      east of Texas.


      7) So, even though the zip code number for the Illinois location is lower, its

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Illinois is positioned to the east of Texas on the US map

      - The entire state of Illinois lies east of Texas


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions of the specific zip codes.

      - Since 62207 is in Illinois and 77388 is in Texas, and Illinois is east of

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 62207 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)

      2) 77388 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      3) In the United States, locations are generally oriented on a west-to-east

      18951 is a zip code in Pennsylvania. Without looking up the exact location,
      Pennsylvania zip codes that start with 1 are typically in the eastern part of
      the state.


      42431 is a zip code in Kentucky. Without looking up the exact location, Kentucky
      zip codes that start with 4 are generally distributed across the state.


      Given that Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky geographically, and these specific
      zip codes don''t suggest any unusual geographic positions that would contradict
      this general relationship, I can conclude that 18951, PA is NOT west of 42431,
      KY. In fact, it would be east of the Kentucky zip code.</think>To determine
      if 18951, PA is located west of 42431, KY, I need to think about the geographic
      positions of these states and their zip codes.


      Step 1: Consider the general geographic positions of Pennsylvania and Kentucky.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States


      Step 2: Determine the relative position of these states to each other.

      - Kentucky is generally west of Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic coast, while Kentucky is inland


      Step 3: Consider if there might be any unusual geographic situations with these
      specific zip codes.

      - 18951 is in eastern Pennsylvania (Quakertown area)

      - 42431 is in western Kentucky (Hopkins County area)

      - This follows the normal geographic relationship between the states


      Step 4: Make the conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      - Since Kentucky is west of Pennsylvania, and these specific zip codes follow
      the normal geographic layout of their respective states, 18951 PA must be east
      of 42431 KY (not west).

      42431 in Kentucky (KY).


      To answer this, I need to think about the general geographic positions of Pennsylvania
      and Kentucky in the United States.


      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern part of the United States. It borders
      New Jersey to the east, New York to the north, Ohio to the west, West Virginia
      to the southwest, Maryland to the south, and Delaware to the southeast.


      Kentucky is located in the east south-central region of the United States. It
      borders Illinois, Missouri, and Tennessee to the south, West Virginia and Virginia
      to the east, Ohio to the north and northeast, and Indiana to the northwest.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Pennsylvania is generally located east of
      Kentucky. Pennsylvania is on the eastern seaboard of the US, while Kentucky
      is more inland and further west.


      So, in general, locations in Pennsylvania would be east of locations in Kentucky,
      not west. Therefore, 18951, PA would be east of 42431, KY, not west.</think>To
      determine if 18951, PA is located west of 42431, KY, I need to consider the
      geographic positions of Pennsylvania and Kentucky.


      Step 1: Consider the general locations of these states in the US.

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern United States, bordering the
      Atlantic coast region.

      Kentucky (KY) is located in the east south-central region of the United States,
      inland from the Atlantic coast.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      When looking at a US map, Pennsylvania is clearly positioned to the east of
      Kentucky. Pennsylvania is part of the eastern seaboard states, while Kentucky
      is further inland and westward.


      Step 3: Since zip codes within these states follow the general geographic positioning
      of their states, a zip code in Pennsylvania (18951) would be east of a zip code
      in Kentucky (42431).

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central part of the country

      - Arizona is in the southwestern part of the country


      Looking at their positions on a map, Arizona is clearly west of Oklahoma. Arizona
      borders California on its western edge, while Oklahoma is several states to
      the east.


      Since 73505 is in Oklahoma and 85621 is in Arizona, and Arizona is west of Oklahoma,
      the zip code 73505 is east of 85621, not west of it.


      Therefore, 73505, OK is NOT located west of 85621, AZ. It''s actually east of
      it.</think>To determine if 73505, OK is west of 85621, AZ, I need to identify
      where these zip codes are located geographically.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 73505 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 85621 is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, bordering California to
      its west and New Mexico to its east.

      Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States, much further east than
      Arizona.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      Since Oklahoma is east of Arizona on the US map, any zip code in Oklahoma (including
      73505) would be east of any zip code in Arizona (including 85621).


      NO, 73505, OK is not located west of 85621, AZ. It is located east of it.'

      To figure this out, I need to compare the relative locations of these two places.
      In the US, locations further west have longer longitude values (more negative
      numbers since we''re in the western hemisphere).


      Let me think about the general geographic positions of Oklahoma and Arizona:

      - Arizona is in the southwestern US, bordering California

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central US, east of New Mexico and north of Texas


      Generally speaking, Arizona is west of Oklahoma. This means that locations in
      Arizona are typically west of locations in Oklahoma.


      So my initial thought is that 73505, OK would be EAST of 85621, AZ (not west
      of it).


      Let me double-check by thinking about US geography. Moving from east to west
      in the US, we have:

      - East Coast states

      - Midwestern states including Oklahoma

      - Mountain states including Arizona

      - West Coast states

      Step 1: Let me identify the general geographic locations of these states.

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central United States.

      - Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - Arizona borders California on the west and New Mexico on the east.

      - Oklahoma is east of New Mexico, placing it east of Arizona.


      Step 3: Determine the directional relationship.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, Arizona is clearly west of Oklahoma.

      - Therefore, any location in Oklahoma would be east of (not west of) locations
      in Arizona.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      This is a zip code in Arizona. Arizona is in the southwestern US, and is west
      of Oklahoma.


      Based on the general geography of US states, Arizona is west of Oklahoma. So
      a zip code in Oklahoma would not be west of a zip code in Arizona.


      In the US, longitude decreases as you move west. Arizona''s longitude is likely

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 73505 is a zip code in Lawton, Oklahoma

      the geographic locations of two US zip codes and determine if one is west of
      the other.


      The zip codes are:

      1. 28607, NC (North Carolina)

      2. 49337, MI (Michigan)


      To determine if 28607, NC is west of 49337, MI, I need to identify where these
      locations are and compare their longitudes. A location with a more negative
      longitude (in the Western Hemisphere) is west of a location with a less negative
      longitude.


      Let me think about the general geography of the US:

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Generally speaking, Michigan is west of North Carolina. However, Michigan has
      an unusual shape with both an Upper and Lower Peninsula, so I should be precise
      about these specific zip codes.


      28607 appears to be a zip code in western North Carolina, possibly in the Appalachian
      mountain region.

      49337 appears to be a zip code in western Michigan.


      Even though 28607 is in western North Carolina, North Carolina as a whole is
      east of Michigan. So 28607, NC should be east of 49337, MI, not west.

      I need to think about the geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 28607 is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the eastern side of the United
      States

      - 49337 is in Michigan (MI), which is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      ## Step 2: Consider relative positions

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan is northwest of North Carolina

      - Even though 28607 may be in western North Carolina, the entire state of North
      Carolina is generally east of Michigan

      - Michigan''s longitude coordinates are further west than North Carolina''s


      ## Step 3: Draw conclusion

      Since Michigan is west of North Carolina geographically, zip code 49337 in Michigan
      would be west of zip code 28607 in North Carolina, not the other way around.

      - 70062, LA means zip code 70062 in Louisiana


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to consider the relative positions

      So if 17970 is in PA and 70062 is in LA, then the LA zip code must be west of
      the PA zip code.</think>To determine if 17970, PA is located west of 70062,
      LA, I need to consider the geographical positions of Pennsylvania and Louisiana.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations within the US.

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Louisiana (LA) is located in the southern United States along the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Pennsylvania is positioned on the eastern side of the United States.

      - Louisiana is positioned in the south-central part of the United States, but
      importantly, it is west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Since zip codes 17970 and 70062 are in PA and LA respectively, they
      follow the same general east-west relationship as their states.


      NO - 17970, PA is not located west of 70062, LA. In fact, it''s the opposite:
      70062, LA is located west of 17970, PA.'

      1. Identify where 06379, CT is located

      2. Identify where 48219, MI is located

      3. Compare their relative east-west positions


      Let''s start with understanding these zip codes:


      06379 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT). Connecticut is a state in the northeastern
      United States.


      48219 is a zip code in Michigan (MI). Michigan is a state in the midwestern
      United States.


      Geographically speaking, the United States is laid out such that:

      - The East Coast (including Connecticut) is in the east

      - The Midwest (including Michigan) is west of the East Coast states


      Connecticut is on the East Coast, while Michigan is in the Midwest. From basic
      US geography, Connecticut is located east of Michigan.


      Therefore, 06379, CT would be east of 48219, MI, not west of it.</think>I need
      to determine the east-west relationship between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 06379 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 48219 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Michigan
      is in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Connecticut is positioned much further east in the United States compared to
      Michigan. On a map, Connecticut sits along the Atlantic Ocean, while Michigan
      is inland and significantly west of Connecticut.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Connecticut is east of Michigan, zip code 06379 in CT would be east of

      2. CT stands for Connecticut and MI stands for Michigan.

      3. We need to determine whether 06379 in Connecticut is west of 48219 in Michigan.


      To determine this, I need to recall the geographic positions of these states.
      In general:

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, on the East Coast.

      - Michigan is located in the north-central United States, in the Great Lakes
      region.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Michigan is generally west of Connecticut.
      This means that any location in Connecticut would typically be east of locations
      in Michigan, not west.


      Therefore, 06379, CT is likely east of 48219, MI, not west.</think>I need to
      determine whether zip code 06379 in Connecticut is located west of zip code

      - 06379 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 48219 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, on the East Coast.

      - Michigan is located in the north-central United States, in the Great Lakes
      region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is clearly positioned
      to the east of Michigan.

      - All of Connecticut is east of Michigan on the east-west axis.


      Since Connecticut is east of Michigan, zip code 06379 in Connecticut must be
      east of (not west of) zip code 48219 in Michigan.

      First, let''s identify what states CT and MI are:

      - CT is Connecticut, located in the northeastern United States

      - MI is Michigan, located in the midwestern United States


      Generally speaking, Connecticut is in the east, and Michigan is more to the
      west and north. But let me think more precisely about their relative positions.


      Connecticut is one of the easternmost states in the US, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean. Michigan is further inland and west of Connecticut.


      So generally, locations in Connecticut would be EAST of locations in Michigan,

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States, while Ohio is
      in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is clearly east of Ohio.
      The entire state of Connecticut lies to the east of Ohio.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      First, I need to identify the states:

      - 06076 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 45371 is in Ohio (OH)


      Now I need to recall the geographic positions of these states. In the United
      States:

      - Connecticut (CT) is located in the New England region in the northeastern
      part of the country

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region, west of Pennsylvania but east
      of Indiana


      Geographically, Connecticut is on the east coast, while Ohio is more inland
      but still in the eastern half of the country. When comparing their positions,
      Connecticut is EAST of Ohio, not west of it.

      - 06076 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)

      - 45371 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in
      the New England region along the Atlantic coast.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwestern United States, west of Pennsylvania but
      east of Indiana.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Connecticut is positioned significantly east of Ohio on a map of the United
      States.

      - Moving from Ohio to Connecticut would mean traveling eastward, not westward.

      First, 06076 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT). Connecticut is a state in the
      northeastern United States.


      45371 is a zip code in Ohio (OH). Ohio is a state in the midwestern United States.

    06edb80c-e8fb-4d56-8c58-da1c63520b45: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      if a location with zip code 43952 in OH (Ohio) is west of a location with zip
      code 60087 in IL (Illinois).


      To determine this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these
      zip codes.


      First, I''ll consider the states themselves. Ohio (OH) is east of Illinois (IL)
      in the United States. Illinois borders the Mississippi River on its western
      edge and is generally considered a Midwestern state, while Ohio is further east,
      often considered part of the Midwest but bordering the East Coast states.


      So in general, locations in Ohio would be east of locations in Illinois, not
      west of them.


      Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes:

      - 43952 in Ohio

      - 60087 in Illinois


      Without specific data about these zip codes, I can rely on the general geographic
      relationship between the states. Since Ohio is east of Illinois, a zip code
      in Ohio (43952) would generally be east of a zip code in Illinois (60087), not
      west of it.


      Therefore, 43952, OH is NOT located west of 60087, IL. It would be located east
      of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic relationship
      between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 60087 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Ohio is
      located to the east of Illinois.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the zip codes.

      Since Ohio is east of Illinois on a map of the United States, zip code 43952
      in Ohio would be located east of zip code 60087 in Illinois.


      Step 4: Formulate the answer to the specific question asked.

      east of Illinois, not west, the answer is:


      NO'

      relative geographic positions of two zip codes in the United States. I need
      to determine if 43952, OH (Ohio) is located west of 60087, IL (Illinois).


      First, let''s think about the general geographic positions of these two states:

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States

      - Illinois (IL) is also in the Midwest, but generally west of Ohio


      In terms of the general geography, Illinois is west of Ohio. However, I need
      to verify the specific zip codes, as locations within states could potentially
      change this relationship, especially if these zip codes are at extreme edges
      of their respective states.


      The zip code 43952 is in Ohio (OH)

      The zip code 60087 is in Illinois (IL)


      Since Illinois is generally west of Ohio, and without any specific information
      that these particular zip codes would reverse this general geographic relationship,
      it''s likely that 43952, OH is EAST of 60087, IL, not west.


      Therefore, 43952, OH is likely NOT located west of 60087, IL.</think># Is 43952,
      OH located west of 60087, IL?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 60087 is in Illinois (IL)


      ## Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Ohio and Illinois are both in the Midwest region of the United States. Looking
      at a map of the US, Illinois is positioned to the west of Ohio. The entire state
      of Ohio is east of Illinois.


      ## Step 3: Consider if these specific zip codes might change this relationship

      Even though specific zip codes can sometimes be in unexpected locations relative
      to their states, the general east-west relationship between Ohio and Illinois
      is consistent throughout both states. No part of Ohio extends west of any part
      of Illinois.


      ## Conclusion

      Since 43952 is in Ohio and 60087 is in Illinois, and Ohio is entirely east of
      Illinois, zip code 43952 must be east of zip code 60087, not west.

      - 60087 is in Illinois (IL)


      Without looking up the exact locations, I can reason that since Ohio is east
      of Illinois, ZIP code 43952 in Ohio would be east of ZIP code 60087 in Illinois.

      ## Step 2: Determine relative positions of these states

      Ohio and Illinois are both Midwestern states, but Illinois is located to the
      west of Ohio. The entire state of Ohio is east of Illinois.


      ## Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge

      Since 43952 is in Ohio and 60087 is in Illinois, and Ohio is east of Illinois,
      then 43952 must be east of 60087 (not west).


      ## Conclusion

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Ohio is
      in the eastern part of the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west relationship.

      When looking at a US map, Illinois is positioned west of Ohio. Ohio borders
      Lake Erie to the north and Pennsylvania to the east, while Illinois borders
      the Mississippi River to the west.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the zip codes.

      Since 43952 is in Ohio, and 60087 is in Illinois, and Ohio is east of Illinois
      (not west), then 43952 OH must be east of 60087 IL (not west).

      located west of 60087, IL, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      First, let''s consider what I know about US geography:

      - Ohio (OH) is generally east of Illinois (IL)

      - Illinois is in the midwest, bordering the Mississippi River

      - Ohio is further east, bordering Pennsylvania


      In terms of general state positions, Illinois is west of Ohio. This means that
      locations in Illinois would typically be west of locations in Ohio.


      Since 43952 is in Ohio, and 60087 is in Illinois, the zip code in Ohio (43952)
      would be EAST of the zip code in Illinois (60087).


      Therefore, 43952, OH is NOT located west of 60087, IL. It would be EAST of it.</think>#

      First, I need to recall the general geographic locations of these states:

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest, east of Illinois

      - Illinois (IL) is also in the Midwest, west of Ohio


      In terms of general state positions, Illinois is west of Ohio. This means that

      However, I should be careful about zip codes near the borders, as there could
      be exceptions. But generally speaking, since Ohio is east of Illinois, zip code
      43952 in Ohio would be east of zip code 60087 in Illinois, not west of it.


      Therefore, 43952, OH is NOT located west of 60087, IL. It would be east of it.</think>I''ll

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 60087 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest, bordering the Mississippi River on its
      western side

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest, but is located east of Illinois


      Step 3: Understand the relative positions.

      - In the United States, Illinois is west of Ohio

      - Therefore, Ohio locations (including 43952) would be east of Illinois locations
      (including 60087)

      - For 43952 to be west of 60087, it would need to be in a state west of Illinois,
      which Ohio is not

      longitude value corresponds to a more western location.


      Let me first identify the states:

      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 60087 is in Illinois (IL)


      Now, I need to recall the general geographical locations of these states:

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest region

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region, west of Ohio


      Step 3: Consider the general geography

      - On a US map, Illinois sits to the west of Ohio

      - The Mississippi River forms Illinois'' western border, while Ohio borders
      Pennsylvania to the east


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      - Since 43952 is in Ohio and 60087 is in Illinois, and Illinois is west of Ohio,
      the Illinois zip code would be west of the Ohio zip code

      - This means the Ohio zip code (43952) is east of the Illinois zip code (60087)

      First, I need to understand the relative geographic positions of West Virginia

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region

      - West Virginia is in the Appalachian/Eastern region


      Geographically, Illinois is generally west of West Virginia. The entire state
      of Illinois lies to the west of West Virginia.


      To verify this with the specific zip codes:

      - 25701 is a zip code in West Virginia (likely in Huntington area)

      - 60136 is a zip code in Illinois

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      West Virginia is located in the eastern United States, in the Appalachian region.

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Illinois lies to the west of West Virginia. The entirety of West Virginia is
      east of Illinois on a map of the United States.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 25701 is in West Virginia and 60136 is in Illinois, and West Virginia
      is east of Illinois, then 25701 must be east of 60136, not west of it.

      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Determine the geographic locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their east-west positions (longitude)


      West Virginia (WV) is a state in the eastern part of the United States, in the
      Appalachian region.

      Illinois (IL) is a state in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Illinois is west of West Virginia. The entire state of Illinois
      is west of West Virginia.


      If we look at a map of the US, states are roughly arranged with:

      - East Coast states (including West Virginia) in the east

      - Midwest states (including Illinois) in the middle/central portion

      - West Coast states in the west


      So in general, a zip code in West Virginia would be EAST of a zip code in Illinois,

      West Virginia (WV) is located in the Appalachian region in the eastern part
      of the United States.

      Illinois (IL) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare the general east-west positioning of these states.

      Looking at a US map, Illinois is situated west of West Virginia. The entire
      state of Illinois lies west of West Virginia.


      Step 3: Since the zip codes are in these respective states, zip code 25701 in
      West Virginia must be east of zip code 60136 in Illinois, not west of it.

      1. 25701, WV - This is a zip code in West Virginia (WV)

      2. 60136, IL - This is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. The standard way to compare
      east-west positioning in the US is to compare longitudes - the lower (more negative)
      the longitude, the further west a location is.


      However, instead of looking up specific longitudes, I can use general geographic
      knowledge. West Virginia is an eastern state, located in the Appalachian region.

      - West Virginia is bordered by Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and

      - Illinois is in the Midwest, bordered by Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky,
      Indiana, and Michigan


      Illinois is definitely west of West Virginia. All of West Virginia is east of
      all of Illinois. So a zip code in WV would be east of a zip code in IL, not

      - Illinois is clearly west of West Virginia

      - All of West Virginia is east of Illinois on a US map


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Illinois (IL) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Illinois is positioned west of West Virginia on the U.S. map. Illinois borders
      the Mississippi River on its western side, while West Virginia is further east,
      bordering states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.


      Step 4: Make the determination about the specific zip codes.

      Since 25701 is in West Virginia, and West Virginia is east of Illinois (where
      60136 is located), then 25701 must be east of 60136, not west of it.

      Step 1: I need to identify the approximate geographic locations of these zip
      codes.

      - 25701 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 60136 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Think about the relative positions of these states.

      Illinois is in the Midwest, approximately in the middle of the country. West
      Virginia is on the eastern side of the country, in the Appalachian region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Illinois is generally west of West Virginia. The entire state of West Virginia
      lies east of most of Illinois.


      Since the specific zip codes are in these respective states, it''s almost certain
      that 25701 in WV is east of 60136 in IL - not west of it.


      So 25701, WV is NOT located west of 60136, IL. It would be located east of it.</think>To

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 25701 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 60136 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while West Virginia
      is located in the Appalachian region in the eastern part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Illinois is positioned to the west of
      West Virginia. The entire state of West Virginia lies east of most of Illinois.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since 25701 is in West Virginia and 60136 is in Illinois, and West Virginia
      is east of Illinois, the zip code 25701 must be east of zip code 60136, not

      3. Compare their longitudes (east-west position) to determine which is further
      west


      For 25701, WV:

      This is a ZIP code in West Virginia (WV). West Virginia is in the eastern part

      This is a ZIP code in Illinois (IL). Illinois is in the Midwest region of the
      United States.

      60136 appears to be in Gilberts, IL, which is in the northeastern part of Illinois.


      Now I need to compare their relative east-west positions. In the US, locations
      with lower longitude numbers are further west.


      West Virginia is generally east of Illinois. Even though 25701 is on the western
      edge of WV, and 60136 is on the northeastern part of IL, Illinois is still west

      - 25701 is in Huntington, West Virginia (WV)

      - 60136 is in Gilberts, Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - West Virginia is located in the eastern United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region, west of West Virginia


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Even though Huntington is on the western edge of West Virginia (along the Ohio

      Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region, west of New York.


      Step 2: Based on the general geography of these states:

      - Ohio is entirely west of New York

      - All ZIP codes in Ohio would be west of ZIP codes in New York, assuming standard

      To determine this, I need to figure out the approximate locations of these two
      zip codes and compare their longitudes. Locations farther west have more negative
      (or less positive) longitude values in the western hemisphere.


      Let me think about what I know about the geography of the United States:

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the US

      - Ohio is in the midwest, but still east of the Mississippi River

      - Generally, Ohio is west of North Carolina


      Since the zip code 28512 is in North Carolina and 44627 is in Ohio, based on
      the general geography of these states, it''s likely that the location in North

      - Zip code 01107 is in Springfield, Massachusetts

      - Zip code 33715 is in St. Petersburg, Florida


      ## Step 2: Consider general state positions

      Massachusetts is in the Northeast, while Florida is in the Southeast of the
      United States.


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions

      - Massachusetts locations are generally around 70-73 degrees west longitude

      - Florida''s west coast (including St. Petersburg) is around 82-83 degrees west
      longitude


      ## Step 4: Apply the longitude comparison

      Since longitude measures increase as you move east to west, the higher number
      (FL) is further west than the lower number (MA).


      Therefore, 01107 in Massachusetts is EAST of 33715 in Florida, not west.

      to determine if the zip code 01107 in Massachusetts (MA) is located west of
      zip code 33715 in Florida (FL).


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 01107 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 33715 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Determine the approximate geographical locations.

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning.

      In the United States, states further east have higher longitude values (e.g.,
      around 70-80 degrees West), while states further west have lower longitude values
      (e.g., around 120-125 degrees West for the West Coast).


      Massachusetts is definitely east of many states, but it''s in the Northeast.

      Florida is in the Southeast, extending into the Gulf of Mexico.


      The key question is whether Massachusetts is west of Florida. Generally speaking,
      Massachusetts is further north but also further east than Florida. Massachusetts
      is roughly around 70-73 degrees West longitude, while Florida is roughly around
      80-87 degrees West longitude.


      Since lower values of West longitude mean further east, Massachusetts would
      be east of Florida, not west of it.</think>I need to determine if zip code 01107

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 01107 is in Springfield, Massachusetts (MA)

      - 33715 is in St. Petersburg, Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical orientation of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Analyze east-west positioning.

      Massachusetts is positioned along the eastern seaboard, with Springfield in
      the western part of Massachusetts. Florida extends southward into the Gulf of
      Mexico, with St. Petersburg on its western coast.


      Step 4: Compare longitudes.

      Massachusetts, even its western parts, is generally east of Florida''s longitude.
      On a map of the United States, Massachusetts is positioned to the right (east)
      of Florida, not to the left (west).

      - 33715, FL: This is a zip code in Florida (FL).


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to understand their relative
      positions on a map of the United States.


      Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States.

      Florida is in the southeastern United States.


      When comparing east-west positions in the US, we''re looking at longitude. States
      further west have higher longitude values (when expressed as negative numbers,
      they have smaller absolute values).


      Massachusetts is on the East Coast but is north of Florida.

      Florida is also on the East Coast but is south of Massachusetts.


      When considering strictly east-west positioning (longitude), Massachusetts and
      Florida are roughly aligned on the East Coast, but Massachusetts is generally
      slightly more eastern than Florida.

      code in MA (Massachusetts) is located west of a zip code in FL (Florida).


      To determine this, I need to figure out the relative east-west positioning of
      these two zip codes.


      First, at a state level:

      - MA (Massachusetts) is in the northeastern United States

      - FL (Florida) is in the southeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Massachusetts is generally farther east than
      Florida. The US East Coast runs roughly northeast to southwest, with Massachusetts
      being more northeast and Florida being more southeast.


      Let''s check the specific zip codes:

      - 01107 is in Massachusetts (MA)

      - 33715 is in Florida (FL)


      Since Massachusetts is east of Florida on a map of the United States, generally
      speaking, a zip code in Massachusetts would be east of a zip code in Florida,
      not west.

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, while Florida is
      in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Looking at a US map, Massachusetts is positioned to the east of Florida. The
      entire state of Massachusetts is east of the entire state of Florida.


      Step 4: Verify specific zip codes.

      Even though these are specific zip codes, they follow the same geographic relationship

      located west of 97527, OR.


      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located.

      - 91748 is a ZIP code in California (CA)

      - 97527 is a ZIP code in Oregon (OR)


      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      A location with a smaller (more negative) longitude is further west in the United
      States.


      California is generally located to the south of Oregon along the west coast
      of the United States. However, the question is specifically about the east-west
      positioning.


      While I don''t have the exact longitude coordinates for these specific zip codes,
      I can reason about this based on general geographic knowledge:


      Oregon is located directly north of California on the west coast. The western
      borders of both states are along the Pacific Ocean. However, California extends
      further east than Oregon does in many parts.


      ZIP code 91748 appears to be in Southern California, likely in the Los Angeles
      area.

      ZIP code 97527 is in Oregon, likely in the western or central part of the state.</think>#
      Is 91748, CA located west of 97527, OR?


      I need to determine the geographical positions of these zip codes and compare
      their east-west relationship.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 91748 is in California (CA), specifically in the city of Rowland Heights in
      the eastern Los Angeles area

      - 97527 is in Oregon (OR), specifically in Grants Pass area in southwestern
      Oregon


      ## Step 2: Consider the coastal geography

      California and Oregon are both coastal states along the Pacific Ocean, with
      Oregon directly north of California. Generally, the Oregon coast is slightly
      east of much of California''s coast due to the coastline''s angle.


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      - Southern California (where 91748 is located) is in the inland/eastern portion
      of the LA metropolitan area

      - Grants Pass (97527) is in the southwestern part of Oregon, but still inland
      from the coast


      ## Step 4: Geographical positioning

      The LA area (even its eastern parts) is generally west of the inland parts of
      southwestern Oregon.


      NO - 91748, CA is not located west of 97527, OR. It''s actually east of it when

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 2: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Ohio is significantly east of Texas on the US map

      - When looking at a map of the US, you would find Ohio much closer to the Atlantic
      coast, while Texas is much further west


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - While specific zip codes might be in different parts of their respective states,
      the entire state of Ohio is east of Texas

      - No part of Ohio extends far enough west to be west of any part of Texas


      Therefore, zip code 45449 in Ohio cannot be west of zip code 76001 in Texas.
      It is east of it.

      determine if 70065, LA (Louisiana) is located west of 78380, TX (Texas).


      To answer this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of both zip codes

      2. Compare their positions on an east-west axis (longitude)


      Generally speaking, Louisiana is east of Texas in the United States. However,
      I should be precise about these specific zip codes since both states have irregular
      shapes and some parts of Louisiana could potentially be west of some parts of

      70065 is a zip code in Louisiana. Louisiana is generally to the east of Texas.

      78380 is a zip code in Texas. Texas is generally to the west of Louisiana.


      Based on the general geography of the US, Louisiana (70065) would be east of
      Texas (78380), not west of it. So the answer would be NO.


      Let me double-check this intuition. 70065 appears to be in the New Orleans area

      Is 70065, LA located west of 78380, TX?


      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their geographic
      positions, specifically their longitudes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) ZIP code 70065 is in Louisiana (LA), which is generally located in the southeastern
      United States.


      2) ZIP code 78380 is in Texas (TX), which is generally located to the west of
      Louisiana.


      3) More specifically, 70065 is in Kenner, Louisiana, in the New Orleans metropolitan
      area in the eastern part of Louisiana.


      4) ZIP code 78380 is in Robstown, Texas, which is in the southern part of Texas
      near Corpus Christi.


      5) When comparing their relative positions, Louisiana is east of Texas, not
      west. Even the westernmost parts of Louisiana are generally east of the southern
      Texas regions where 78380 is located.


      6) Therefore, 70065 (LA) is east of 78380 (TX), not west of it.

      70065 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA). Louisiana is a state in the southeastern
      United States.

      78380 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is a state in the south-central United

      Generally, Louisiana is east of Texas. However, I need to check the specific
      locations of these zip codes.


      70065 is the zip code for Kenner, Louisiana, which is in the New Orleans metropolitan
      area in the southeastern part of Louisiana.


      78380 is the zip code for Kingsville, Texas, which is in the southern part of
      Texas near the Gulf of Mexico.


      Louisiana is generally east of Texas, so it''s likely that 70065 (Kenner, LA)
      is east of 78380 (Kingsville, TX). But I need to confirm this by checking their
      relative positions more precisely.


      Looking at the map of the United States, Louisiana is indeed east of Texas.
      Kenner, LA (70065) is in southeastern Louisiana, while Kingsville, TX (78380)
      is in southern Texas. This means that 70065 is east of 78380, not west.

      - 78380 is in Kingsville, Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Louisiana and Texas

      - Louisiana is located to the east of Texas on the US map

      - Texas is west of Louisiana


      ## Step 3: Verify the specific locations

      - Kenner (70065) is in the southeastern part of Louisiana, near New Orleans

      - Kingsville (78380) is in the southern part of Texas

      - Even though both are southern cities, the state boundary relationship remains
      the same


      ## Step 4: Determine the directional relationship

      - Since 70065 is in Louisiana, which is east of Texas, and 78380 is in Texas,
      which is west of Louisiana, 70065 is east of 78380, not west.

      To answer this, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located and compare

      First, let me think about the general geography of Louisiana and Texas:

      - Louisiana is east of Texas (Texas is west of Louisiana)

      - Most of Louisiana is east of most of Texas


      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 70065 is in Louisiana. From my knowledge, zip codes starting with 700-701
      are in the New Orleans area, which is in southeastern Louisiana.

      - 78380 is in Texas. Zip codes starting with 783 are typically in south Texas.


      Since Louisiana is generally east of Texas, it would be unusual for a Louisiana

      I need to determine if 03079, NH is west of 32095, FL.


      In the United States, New Hampshire is located in the northeastern part of the

      New Hampshire is on the East Coast, but it''s in the Northeast.

      Florida is also on the East Coast, but it''s in the Southeast.


      Generally speaking, New Hampshire is east of most of the country, but I need
      to compare it specifically with Florida. When comparing these two states on
      the east coast:

      Southeast (including FL).</think># Is 03079, NH located west of 32095, FL?


      I need to think about the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 03079 is in New Hampshire (NH)

      - 32095 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning (longitude).

      - New Hampshire is positioned in the Northeast, along the eastern seaboard

      - Florida is also on the eastern seaboard but further south

      - The US eastern coastline curves, with the Northeast extending further east
      than the Southeast


      Step 4: Determine the specific relationship.

      - New Hampshire is actually further east than Florida, not west of it

    04cd00c4-6ee8-4c82-b1a6-5af5e53cb119: '<think>Let me solve this step by step.


      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 84056, UT (Utah)

      - 91360, CA (California)


      Then I need to determine which one is further west. In the US, states that are
      further west have lower longitude numbers (since longitude decreases as you
      go westward from the Greenwich meridian).


      Utah is generally east of California. The entire state of California lies along
      the Pacific coast, making it the westernmost contiguous US state. Utah is inland,
      to the east of California.


      Because of this geographical fact, a zip code in Utah (84056) would be east
      of a zip code in California (91360), not west of it.


      Therefore, 84056, UT is NOT located west of 91360, CA. It''s located east of
      it.</think># Is 84056, UT located west of 91360, CA?


      I need to think about the geographic positions of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 84056 is in Utah (UT)

      - 91360 is in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean. Utah is an inland state positioned to the east of California.


      ## Step 3: Apply geographical knowledge

      Since California is west of Utah, any location in Utah (including 84056) would
      be east of locations in California (including 91360), not west of them.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 84056, UT is not located west of 91360, CA. It is located east of it.'

    198e8515-9fa3-4f38-afba-c42827baff98: '<think>To determine if one zip code is
      west of another, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their longitudes. In the western hemisphere, a location further west will have
      a more negative longitude (or a numerically larger longitude value if expressed
      as degrees west).


      Let me identify the locations of these zip codes:


      84056, UT - This is a zip code in Utah (UT)

      91360, CA - This is a zip code in California (CA)


      Generally speaking, Utah is east of California since California is on the west
      coast of the United States. This would suggest that 84056, UT would be east
      of 91360, CA, not west.


      But let me be precise and check the specific locations:


      84056, UT is likely in northern Utah.

      91360, CA appears to be in southern California, possibly near Los Angeles.


      Given the geography of the western United States, California extends further
      west than Utah. Utah is landlocked and sits to the east of California. Therefore,
      a zip code in Utah would be east of a zip code in California, not west.


      So, 84056, UT is east of 91360, CA, not west of it.</think># Is 84056, UT located
      west of 91360, CA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 84056 is in Utah (UT)

      - 91360 is in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Utah is
      an inland state that borders Nevada, which itself borders California to the
      east.


      ## Step 3: Compare the general locations

      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), California is west of Utah. This
      is a fundamental geographic fact about the United States - California forms
      part of the western coastline, while Utah is located to the east of California.


      ## Step 4: Determine the specific zip code locations

      - 84056 (UT) is in the northern part of Utah

      - 91360 (CA) is in Thousand Oaks, in southern California


      Even considering their specific locations within their respective states, the
      California zip code remains west of the Utah zip code.

      if 84056, UT (Utah) is located west of 91360, CA (California).


      Step 1: Let me recall the general geographic position of Utah and California.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is located inland, east of California


      Step 2: Let''s confirm this by thinking about neighboring states:

      - California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west

      - Going east from California, you encounter Nevada and then Utah


      Step 3: Based on general geography, Utah would be EAST of California, not west
      of it.


      Step 4: The specific zip codes (84056 in UT and 91360 in CA) don''t change the
      fact that Utah is located east of California.


      So 84056, UT would be located EAST of 91360, CA, not west of it.</think># Is
      84056, UT located west of 91360, CA?


      Let me work through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geographic locations of Utah (UT) and
      California (CA).


      2) California is located on the western coast of the United States, bordering
      the Pacific Ocean.


      3) Utah is an inland state that lies to the east of California, with Nevada
      situated between them.


      4) Regardless of the specific locations within each state that these zip codes
      represent, the entire state of Utah is east of California.


      5) Since 84056 is in Utah and 91360 is in California, the Utah zip code must
      be east of the California zip code, not west.

      Let me break this down:

      1. 84056 is a ZIP code in Utah (UT)

      2. 91360 is a ZIP code in California (CA)

      3. I need to determine which one is further west


      Generally speaking, Utah is east of California. California is on the west coast
      of the United States, while Utah is an inland state to the east of California.


      ZIP codes in the US tend to increase as you go from east to west, but they''re
      organized by region rather than strictly by longitude. Still, the fact that
      California''s ZIP code (91360) has a higher number than Utah''s (84056) is consistent
      with California being further west.


      Regardless of the ZIP code numbers, the geography of the United States makes
      this clear: California is the westernmost continental state (excluding Alaska),
      while Utah is inland and east of California.


      So 84056, UT would be east of 91360, CA, not west of it.</think>I need to determine

      - 91360 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Utah is
      an inland state to the east of California.


      Step 3: Check the specific locations.

      ZIP code 84056 appears to be in the Salt Lake City area of Utah.

      ZIP code 91360 is in the Thousand Oaks area of California.


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Regardless of the specific locations within these states, any location in Utah
      would be east of most locations in California due to the geographical arrangement
      of these states. California forms part of the western border of the continental
      United States along the Pacific Ocean, while Utah is inland.

      - 91360 is in California (CA)


      Now, generally speaking, Utah is located east of California in the United States.
      California is on the West Coast of the US, while Utah is inland to the east
      of California.


      Given the general geographic positions of these states, it would be unlikely
      that a Utah zip code would be west of a California zip code. California is generally
      the westernmost state (except compared to Hawaii, Alaska, Oregon and Washington).

      is located west of 73701, OK (Oklahoma), I need to find the geographic coordinates
      of both ZIP codes and compare their longitudes. If the longitude of 47834, IN
      is less than (more negative, since we''re in the western hemisphere) the longitude
      of 73701, OK, then 47834, IN is west of 73701, OK.


      First, let me identify these locations:

      - 47834 is a ZIP code in Indiana (IN)

      - 73701 is a ZIP code in Oklahoma (OK)


      Now, I need to consider the general geographic positions of these states:

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the central/south-central part of the United States


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is west of Indiana. The continental United States
      has states arranged roughly from east to west, with eastern states like Maine
      having higher (less negative) longitude values, and western states like California
      having lower (more negative) longitude values.


      Since Indiana is east of Oklahoma, ZIP code 47834, IN would be east of 73701,
      OK, not west.


      Therefore, 47834, IN is NOT located west of 73701, OK.</think>I need to determine
      if a ZIP code in Indiana is west of a ZIP code in Oklahoma by comparing their
      geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 47834 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 73701 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Recall the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/Eastern region of the United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Looking at a U.S. map, Indiana is clearly east of Oklahoma. The United States
      generally proceeds from east to west, with eastern states having more eastern
      longitudes than western states.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific ZIP codes.

      Since Indiana is east of Oklahoma geographically, ZIP code 47834 in Indiana
      would be east of ZIP code 73701 in Oklahoma, not west of it.

      west of 73701, OK, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their longitudinal positions. West would mean a more negative longitude (or
      smaller number) in North America.


      Step 1: Let me identify where 47834, IN is located.

      47834 is a zip code in Indiana (IN). Indiana is in the Midwest region of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Let me identify where 73701, OK is located.

      73701 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK). Oklahoma is in the south-central region
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the general east-west positioning of Indiana and Oklahoma.

      Looking at a US map, Indiana is actually east of Oklahoma. Indiana borders Ohio
      to its east and Illinois to its west, while Oklahoma is further west, bordering
      states like Texas, Kansas, and Arkansas.


      Therefore, Indiana (where 47834 is) would be east of Oklahoma (where 73701 is),
      not west.


      So 47834, IN is NOT located west of 73701, OK.</think># Is 47834, IN located
      west of 73701, OK?


      I''ll solve this step by step by determining the relative positions of these
      two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 47834 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)

      - 73701 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic positioning

      Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Oklahoma
      is in the south-central region.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      Looking at a US map, Indiana is positioned to the east of Oklahoma. Indiana
      borders Ohio to the east and Illinois to the west, while Oklahoma is further
      west in the country.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Indiana is east of Oklahoma, zip code 47834 in Indiana would be east of
      zip code 73701 in Oklahoma, not west.

      (Indiana) is located west of 73701, OK (Oklahoma).


      To solve this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of these zip
      codes.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - 47834, IN is in Indiana (IN)

      - 73701, OK is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Now, I need to think about the geographical relationship between Indiana and
      Oklahoma. In the United States:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the country

      - Oklahoma is in the central/south-central part of the country


      Specifically, Indiana is generally east of Oklahoma. Looking at a US map, Oklahoma
      is significantly west of Indiana.


      Since 47834 is in Indiana, and 73701 is in Oklahoma, and Indiana is east of
      Oklahoma, then:

      47834, IN is located EAST of 73701, OK.


      Therefore, it is NOT west of 73701, OK.</think># Is 47834, IN located west of

      their states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 47834 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 73701 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative positions

      Looking at the US map, Indiana is located in the Midwest region, while Oklahoma
      is in the south-central region. Geographically:

      - Indiana is positioned in the eastern half of the United States

      - Oklahoma is positioned west of Indiana


      ## Step 3: Determine the answer

      Since 47834 is in Indiana, and Indiana is east of Oklahoma (where 73701 is located),
      the zip code 47834 cannot be west of 73701.


      ## Answer: NO

      have higher longitude values (going from east to west).


      Let me think about the states first:

      - IN is Indiana, which is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the US

      - OK is Oklahoma, which is in the Central/Southern part of the US


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is west of Indiana in the US map. So Indiana zip
      codes would typically be east of Oklahoma zip codes, not west.


      So my intuition is that 47834, IN is NOT west of 73701, OK. Instead, it would
      be east of the Oklahoma zip code.


      Therefore, the answer should be NO.</think># Is 47834, IN located west of 73701,
      OK?


      To determine this, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their positions.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - 47834 is in Indiana (IN)

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the South Central region of the United States


      When we look at a map of the United States, Indiana is positioned to the east
      of Oklahoma. The entire state of Indiana is east of Oklahoma, with states like
      Illinois and Missouri between them.


      Since 47834 is in Indiana and 73701 is in Oklahoma, the Indiana zip code must

      Given this information, 07432 in NJ would be east of 15139 in PA, not west of
      it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 07432 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      New Jersey is located east of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania borders New Jersey
      on New Jersey''s western side.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - 07432 is in northern New Jersey (specifically Fair Lawn area)

      - 15139 is in western Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh)


      Step 4: Determine relative positioning.

      Since New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and these particular zip codes follow
      this general state orientation (with 07432 being in NJ and 15139 being in PA),
      the NJ zip code would be east of the PA zip code, not west.

      is located west of 15139, PA.


      To do this, I need to:

      1. Determine the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their east-west positions


      First, let me think about what I know about U.S. zip codes. Generally, zip codes
      increase from east to west, with lower numbers in the east and higher numbers
      in the west. So based just on the zip code numbers:

      - 07432 (NJ) is a lower number, suggesting it''s more easterly

      - 15139 (PA) is a higher number, suggesting it''s more westerly


      Also, I know that New Jersey (NJ) is generally located east of Pennsylvania
      (PA). The entire state of NJ is east of PA.


      Therefore, 07432 in New Jersey cannot be west of 15139 in Pennsylvania. It must
      be east of it.


      So the answer is no, 07432, NJ is not located west of 15139, PA.</think>To determine
      if 07432, NJ is located west of 15139, PA, I need to analyze the geographic
      relationship between these locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states themselves. New Jersey (NJ) is located entirely
      to the east of Pennsylvania (PA). The entire state of New Jersey borders Pennsylvania
      along its western border.


      Step 2: Looking at the zip codes, 07432 is in northern New Jersey (lower zip
      codes in the east), while 15139 is in western Pennsylvania (higher zip numbers
      generally moving westward).


      Step 3: Since all of New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, any zip code in NJ
      (including 07432) must be east of any zip code in PA (including 15139).


      Therefore, 07432, NJ cannot be located west of 15139, PA - it must be east of
      it.

      07432 in New Jersey is located west of ZIP code 15139 in Pennsylvania.


      To solve this problem, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these ZIP codes

      2. Determine their east-west positioning relative to each other


      Let''s start by thinking about the general geography. The states of New Jersey
      and Pennsylvania are neighbors, with New Jersey being east of Pennsylvania.
      In general, lower ZIP code numbers in the US tend to be in the eastern parts
      of the country, and higher numbers in the western parts.


      07432 is in New Jersey, and the first digit "0" suggests it''s in a very eastern
      region.

      15139 is in Pennsylvania, and the first digit "1" suggests it''s still eastern,
      but not as far east as New Jersey.


      Given that:

      - New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania

      - 07432 (NJ) has a lower number than 15139 (PA)

      - The lower number is consistent with the eastern location of New Jersey


      I can conclude that 07432 in NJ is likely east of 15139 in PA, not west of it.</think>#
      Determining if 07432, NJ is west of 15139, PA


      I''ll analyze this step by step using geographic knowledge of US states and
      ZIP code patterns.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 07432 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider state geography

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is directly
      west of New Jersey. In terms of geographic positioning, Pennsylvania sits between
      New Jersey and states further west.


      ## Step 3: Analyze ZIP code patterns

      US ZIP codes generally follow a west-to-east pattern where lower numbers are
      in the east and higher numbers in the west. The first digit "0" for the NJ ZIP
      code indicates it''s in the easternmost postal region, while "1" for the PA
      ZIP code indicates it''s in the next region westward.


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and ZIP code 07432 is in New Jersey
      while 15139 is in Pennsylvania, the NJ location must be east of the PA location,
      not west.

      07432 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).

      15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to know their relative positions.
      Generally speaking:

      - Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey (NJ is on the east coast, and PA is inland
      from it)

      - However, specific zip codes near the border could potentially break this general
      pattern


      Looking at the specific zip codes:

      - 07432 appears to be in northern New Jersey (based on the "074" prefix which
      is typically northern NJ)

      - 15139 appears to be in western Pennsylvania (based on the "151" prefix which
      is typically western PA)


      Since Pennsylvania is generally west of New Jersey, and this particular PA zip
      code is in western PA, it''s almost certainly going to be west of the NJ zip
      code.

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States.


      Step 2: Understand the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Georgia is clearly east of Kansas on the US map.

      - Kansas is west of Georgia.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - 30354 is a zip code in Georgia (likely in the Atlanta area)

      - 67218 is a zip code in Kansas (likely in the Wichita area)


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      Since Georgia is east of Kansas, and these zip codes are within their respective
      states, 30354 is east of 67218, not west.

      First, let me think about where these states are located in the US:

      - Georgia (GA) is in the southeastern part of the United States

      - Kansas (KS) is in the central United States


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Kansas. Let me confirm with some geographical
      knowledge:

      - Georgia is on the Atlantic coast in the southeast

      - Kansas is a Great Plains state in the center of the country


      Since Georgia is in the east and Kansas is more central/western, Georgia would
      be EAST of Kansas, not west of it.


      So 30354, GA would be EAST of 67218, KS, not west of it.</think>To determine
      if 30354, GA is west of 67218, KS, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of Georgia and Kansas.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States, in the Great Plains region.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positioning.

      On a map of the United States, Kansas is positioned to the west of Georgia.
      Georgia is much further east than Kansas.


      Step 3: Determine the specific zip codes'' locations.

      While specific zip codes may be in different parts of their respective states,
      the entire state of Georgia lies east of Kansas.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Georgia is entirely east of Kansas, zip code 30354 in GA must be east
      of zip code 67218 in KS, not west of it.

      30354 is a zip code in Georgia (GA).

      67218 is a zip code in Kansas (KS).


      In the United States, states are generally arranged with:

      - East Coast states like Georgia being in the eastern part of the country

      - Midwestern states like Kansas being more central


      Looking at their relative positions on a US map:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Kansas is located in the central United States, west of Georgia


      Since Georgia is east of Kansas on a map, zip code 30354 in Georgia would be

      30354 is a zip code in Georgia (GA). Georgia is a state in the southeastern
      United States, along the Atlantic coast.


      67218 is a zip code in Kansas (KS). Kansas is a state in the central United

      Geographically, the United States is oriented such that the west coast faces
      the Pacific Ocean, and the east coast faces the Atlantic Ocean. The states generally
      follow this pattern, with western states being closer to the Pacific and eastern
      states being closer to the Atlantic.


      Georgia is on the east coast/southeastern part of the US, while Kansas is in

      west of 45204, OH, I need to:


      1. Identify where these zip codes are located (which cities/towns)

      2. Determine the relative east-west positioning of these locations


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 06770 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)

      - 45204 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Now, I need to think about the geographic positions of these states. In the
      United States:

      - Connecticut (CT) is located on the East Coast, in the New England region

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Ohio is west of Connecticut. Ohio is in the
      Midwest while Connecticut is on the East Coast.


      Since 06770 is in Connecticut, and 45204 is in Ohio, and Ohio is west of Connecticut,
      that means 06770, CT is EAST of 45204, OH.


      So 06770, CT is NOT located west of 45204, OH.</think>I need to determine the
      relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 06770 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 45204 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States, in the New England
      region.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Ohio is situated to the west of Connecticut.
      Connecticut is much farther east, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since 06770 is in Connecticut, which is east of Ohio (where 45204 is located),
      the zip code 06770 is EAST of 45204, not west of it.

      - 45204 is a ZIP code in Ohio (OH)


      Now I need to think about the relative east-west positioning of these two states:

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern United States


      Generally speaking, Ohio is west of Connecticut. The entire state of Ohio is

      Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.

      Ohio is located in the midwestern United States, significantly inland from the
      Atlantic.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning

      Looking at a map of the United States, Connecticut is clearly located to the
      east of Ohio. The entire state of Connecticut is east of Ohio.


      Step 4: Make the final determination

      Since 06770 is in Connecticut, and 45204 is in Ohio, and Connecticut is east

      1. CT is Connecticut, which is a state in the northeastern United States.

      2. OH is Ohio, which is in the midwestern United States.


      Geographically, Connecticut is located on the east coast of the US, while Ohio

      If we look at a map of the US from west to east, the general order of these
      states would be:

      Western States -> Midwestern States (including Ohio) -> Eastern States (including
      Connecticut)


      Connecticut is definitely east of Ohio, not west of it. Therefore, 06770, CT

      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, on the Atlantic
      coast.

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern United States, further inland.


      Step 3: Consider their east-west positioning.

      - Looking at a US map, Connecticut is clearly located to the east of Ohio.

      - In terms of longitude, all of Connecticut lies east of Ohio.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Let me start with what I know about these states:

      - CT is Connecticut, which is in the northeastern United States

      - OH is Ohio, which is in the midwestern United States


      Generally speaking, Connecticut is east of Ohio. So a ZIP code in Connecticut

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 06770 is in Connecticut (CT)

      - 45204 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States on the Atlantic coast,

      ## Step 3: Determine east-west relationship

      The entire state of Connecticut lies to the east of Ohio. Moving from west to
      east across the United States, you would encounter Ohio before reaching Connecticut.


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Connecticut is entirely east of Ohio, ZIP code 06770 in Connecticut must

      To do this, I need to check the approximate geographic locations of these zip
      codes.


      Zip code 11563 is in New York (NY). Generally, New York is east of Pennsylvania,
      but I should be more precise about these specific zip codes.


      Zip code 11563 corresponds to Lynbrook, NY, which is on Long Island in the eastern
      part of New York state, near New York City.


      Zip code 17202 corresponds to an area in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is
      generally west of New York, but I need to be more specific about this particular
      zip code.


      17202 is likely in the south-central part of Pennsylvania, possibly near the
      Maryland border.


      When comparing these locations:

      - Lynbrook, NY (11563) is on Long Island in the eastern part of New York

      - 17202 in PA is in the south-central or eastern part of Pennsylvania


      Since New York is generally east of Pennsylvania, and 11563 is in the eastern

      highly likely that 11563 is EAST of 17202, not west.</think># Determining if
      11563, NY is west of 17202, PA


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Zip code 11563 is in New York (NY), specifically in Lynbrook on Long Island

      - Zip code 17202 is in Pennsylvania (PA), in the south-central region


      ## Step 2: Consider geographical orientation

      - New York state is generally located east of Pennsylvania

      - Long Island (where 11563 is located) is on the eastern side of New York

      - The Pennsylvania zip code 17202 is in the central/eastern part of Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      - Long Island is significantly east of any part of Pennsylvania

      - Even the easternmost parts of Pennsylvania are west of Long Island


      Since 11563 (Lynbrook, NY) is on Long Island in the eastern part of New York,
      and 17202 is in Pennsylvania which is entirely west of Long Island, zip code
      11563 must be EAST of zip code 17202, not west.

      with a smaller (more negative) longitude is west of a location with a larger
      longitude.


      Step 1: Let me identify where 11563, NY is located.

      11563 appears to be in Lynbrook, New York, which is on Long Island, part of
      the greater New York City area in the southeastern part of New York state.

      17202 appears to be in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, which is in the south-central
      part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      New York state is generally east of Pennsylvania, but I need to check these
      specific locations. Long Island (where Lynbrook is) is at the eastern end of
      New York state, while Chambersburg is in south-central Pennsylvania.


      Long Island would definitely be east of central Pennsylvania. So 11563, NY (Lynbrook)

      Let me solve this step by step by determining the locations and comparing their
      east-west positions.

      - 11563, NY is in Lynbrook, which is located on Long Island in the southeastern
      part of New York state.

      - 17202, PA is in Chambersburg, which is in south-central Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between New York and Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of New York state.

      - However, Long Island (where Lynbrook is located) extends eastward from New
      York City.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Lynbrook, NY (11563) on Long Island is positioned along the eastern coast.

      - Chambersburg, PA (17202) is inland in south-central Pennsylvania.

      - Long Island is significantly east of central Pennsylvania.

      In general, New York is east of Pennsylvania, since Pennsylvania is west of
      New York on the US map. But I need to be careful because these are specific
      zip codes, and states have irregular shapes.


      Let me think about these specific zip codes:

      - 11563 appears to be a zip code in Long Island, NY (likely Nassau County)

      - 17202 appears to be in southern Pennsylvania


      Long Island is on the eastern side of New York state, and New York state is
      generally east of Pennsylvania. So it would be very unlikely that a Long Island

      - 17202 is a ZIP code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      To determine which is farther west, I need to know their approximate locations.
      In general, Pennsylvania is west of New York, but I need to be specific about
      these ZIP codes.


      11563 is in Long Island, NY. It''s specifically in Lynbrook, which is in Nassau
      County on Long Island.


      17202 is in Franklin County, PA, which is in south-central Pennsylvania near
      the Maryland border.

      part of New York state, while Franklin County, PA (where 17202 is) is in the
      central-southern part of Pennsylvania.


      Since New York is generally east of Pennsylvania, and especially since Long
      Island is in the eastern part of New York, while 17202 is in central Pennsylvania,
      I can conclude that 11563 (NY) is east of 17202 (PA), not west.</think># Is

      - 11563 is in Lynbrook, NY, which is in Nassau County on Long Island in the
      eastern part of New York State.

      - 17202 is in Franklin County, PA, which is in south-central Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between New York and Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of New York State.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Lynbrook (11563) is on Long Island, which is in the easternmost part of New
      York.

      - Franklin County (17202) is in central Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Long Island is far to the east, while central Pennsylvania is considerably
      westward.

      - The New York zip code (11563) is east of the Pennsylvania zip code (17202).


      NO - 11563, NY is not located west of 17202, PA. It is located east of it.'

      1. 11563 is a zip code in NY (New York)

      2. 17202 is a zip code in PA (Pennsylvania)


      I need to determine their locations and then compare them to see which one is

      - Long Island (where Lynbrook, NY is) is in the easternmost part of New York

      - Chambersburg, PA is in the southern central part of Pennsylvania


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Lynbrook, NY (11563) would be

      - 11563 is a zip code for Lynbrook, NY, which is located on Long Island in the
      eastern part of New York state

      - 17202 is a zip code for Chambersburg, PA, which is in south-central Pennsylvania


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      - New York state is generally east of Pennsylvania

      - Long Island (where Lynbrook is) is in the easternmost part of New York

      - Chambersburg is in the central part of Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      - Lynbrook, NY is significantly east of Chambersburg, PA

      - Places on Long Island are east of virtually all places in Pennsylvania

      I need to determine if the Kentucky zip code is west of the Missouri zip code.


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - Kentucky is located in the eastern part of the central United States

      - Missouri is located in the central United States, west of Kentucky


      Generally speaking, Missouri is west of Kentucky, which would suggest that a
      zip code in Kentucky would NOT be west of a zip code in Missouri. Missouri borders
      Kentucky''s western neighbor (Illinois), so Missouri is definitely west of Kentucky.


      So generally, a Kentucky zip code should be EAST of a Missouri zip code, not
      west. The answer should be NO.</think>To answer whether 40175, KY is located

      - 40175 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 64701 is in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Kentucky is located in the eastern part of the central United States, while
      Missouri is located to the west of Kentucky. In fact, Missouri doesn''t directly
      border Kentucky - Illinois sits between them.


      Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge about state positions.

      Since Missouri is positioned west of Kentucky on the US map, zip codes in Kentucky
      would generally be east of zip codes in Missouri, not west.


      NO'

      (Kentucky) is located west of 64701, MO (Missouri).


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of these
      zip codes. In the US, generally:

      - Western states are to the left on the map

      - Eastern states are to the right on the map


      So first, I need to think about the general locations of Kentucky (KY) and Missouri
      (MO).

      - Kentucky is located in the eastern part of the central United States

      - Missouri is located in the central United States, west of Kentucky


      Generally speaking, Missouri is west of Kentucky. This means that locations
      in Missouri would typically be west of locations in Kentucky.


      However, I need to be careful about specific zip codes, as states have irregular
      shapes and border areas might have exceptions to the general rule.


      Since 40175 is in Kentucky, and 64701 is in Missouri, based on the general positioning
      of these states, 40175, KY would be EAST of 64701, MO (not west).


      So the answer should be NO, 40175, KY is not located west of 64701, MO. Instead,
      it would be east of it.</think>I need to determine if 40175, KY is located west

      - 40175 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 64701 is in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Kentucky is located in the eastern part of the central United States

      - Missouri is located in the central United States, directly west of Kentucky


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific zip codes.

      When looking at a US map, Missouri is positioned to the west of Kentucky. This
      means that locations in Missouri (including 64701) would generally be west of
      locations in Kentucky (including 40175).


      Step 4: Conclude based on this geographic relationship.

      Since Missouri is west of Kentucky, 40175 KY would be east of 64701 MO, not
      west of it.

      to determine the geographic locations of these two zip codes and compare them.


      40175, KY is a zip code in Kentucky.

      64701, MO is a zip code in Missouri.


      Now I need to determine which one is more westerly. The way the US states are
      arranged:

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the eastern part of the central United States

      - Missouri (MO) is located in the central United States, just west of Kentucky


      Generally speaking, Missouri is west of Kentucky. So a zip code in Missouri
      (64701) would typically be west of a zip code in Kentucky (40175).


      So the answer would likely be NO - 40175, KY is NOT located west of 64701, MO.
      Rather, it would be east of it.


      Let me double-check this geographic understanding: Missouri borders Kentucky
      along Kentucky''s western side (along with Illinois). So Missouri is definitely
      west of Kentucky. This confirms my answer.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 40175 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 64701 is in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Kentucky is located in the eastern part of the central United States, while
      Missouri is located in the central United States. Importantly, Missouri is positioned
      to the west of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Compare the zip code locations.

      Since Missouri is west of Kentucky, a zip code in Kentucky (40175) would be
      east of a zip code in Missouri (64701), not west of it.


      NO'
    fdbf294f-a411-42ad-9586-022ff9d2e077: '<think>I need to determine if 40175, KY
      (Kentucky) is located west of 64701, MO (Missouri).


      First, I''ll think about the geography of these two states in the US. Missouri
      is generally west of Kentucky. Kentucky is in the eastern part of the US, while
      Missouri is more central/mid-western.


      Let''s be even more specific about the zip codes:

      - 40175 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)

      - 64701 is a zip code in Missouri (MO)


      Since Kentucky is east of Missouri at a state level, it''s likely that 40175,
      KY is east of 64701, MO. But I should verify this since zip codes in border
      areas could potentially reverse this general relationship.


      Looking at the geography of these states:

      - Kentucky''s western border meets with Missouri''s eastern border (with the
      Mississippi River between them)

      - However, almost all of Kentucky is east of almost all of Missouri


      So it''s very unlikely that a Kentucky zip code would be west of a Missouri
      zip code. Based on the general geography of these two states, I can conclude
      that 40175, KY is located EAST of 64701, MO, not west.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think>To determine if 40175, KY is located west
      of 64701, MO, I need to consider the geographic relationship between Kentucky
      and Missouri.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Missouri is located west of Kentucky in the United States. Kentucky is in the
      eastern part of the country, while Missouri is further west in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Zip code 40175 is in Kentucky, and zip code 64701 is in Missouri.


      Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge.

      Since Kentucky (as a whole) is east of Missouri, locations in Kentucky would
      generally be east of locations in Missouri. Even at their closest points along
      state borders, Kentucky remains east of Missouri (separated by the Mississippi
      River).


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since 40175 is in Kentucky and 64701 is in Missouri, and Kentucky is east of
      Missouri, it follows that 40175, KY must be east (not west) of 64701, MO.

      NY located west of 29067, SC?


      Let me determine the relative positions of these zip codes by looking at their
      geographic locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10457 is a zip code in the Bronx, New York City, NY

      - 29067 is a zip code in South Carolina


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - Both states are on the eastern seaboard


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudes

      - New York City (including the Bronx) is located on the far eastern edge of
      New York state

      - South Carolina is positioned westward of the direct north-south line from
      New York City

      - Moving from South Carolina to New York City requires traveling northeast,
      not east


      ## Conclusion

      When comparing these specific locations, 10457 (Bronx, NY) is actually east
      of 29067, SC, not west of it.

    be533108-6eca-466f-aff6-ea601e25710c: '<think>To determine if 10457, NY is located
      west of 29067, SC, I need to find the locations of these two zip codes and compare
      their longitudes.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 10457 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 29067 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      Now, let''s think about the relative positions:

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is in the southeastern United States


      In the United States, west-east positioning is determined by longitude, with
      more western locations having lower (more negative) longitude values.


      Generally speaking:

      - New York is located on the East Coast, roughly around the same longitude as
      other northeastern states

      - South Carolina is also on the East Coast, but is further south


      In terms of east-west positioning, New York is typically further east than South
      Carolina. This is because the East Coast of the US curves, with the northeastern
      states (like New York) being further east than the southeastern states (like
      South Carolina).


      Therefore, 10457, NY is likely east of 29067, SC, not west.</think>I need to
      determine if the New York zip code is west of the South Carolina zip code by
      examining their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10457 is in the Bronx, New York

      - 29067 is in South Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of New York and South Carolina
      on the US map.

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Analyze their east-west positions.

      - The US East Coast curves, with the northeastern states (like New York) generally
      positioned further east than the southeastern states (like South Carolina).

      - New York is further east in longitude than South Carolina.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since New York is east of South Carolina, 10457, NY would be east of 29067,
      SC, not west.

      is located west of 27604, NC.


      First, let me identify where these ZIP codes are located:

      - 11572 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)

      - 27604 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to think about the relative
      positions of New York and North Carolina in the United States.


      New York is in the northeastern part of the United States, while North Carolina
      is in the southeastern part. When considering east-west positioning, North Carolina
      is generally west of New York.


      Wait, I need to double-check this. Let me think about the US map:

      - The East Coast runs roughly north-south

      - Moving from north to south along the East Coast: Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
      Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
      North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida

      - New York is north of North Carolina on this north-south coastline


      However, because of the curvature of the coastline, New York is actually generally
      east of North Carolina, not west. The East Coast curves such that northeastern
      states like New York are further east than southeastern states like North Carolina.


      So 11572, NY should be east of 27604, NC, not west of it.</think># Is 11572,

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 11572 is in New York (NY)

      - 27604 is in North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of the US East Coast

      The US East Coast curves, with northeastern states being further east than southeastern
      states. New York is in the Northeast, while North Carolina is in the Southeast.


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      Looking at a US map, New York is positioned to the northeast of North Carolina.
      While New York is north of North Carolina, it is actually east of North Carolina,
      not west.

      1. 11572 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      2. 27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Geographically, New York is located in the northeastern United States, while

      Let me double-check by considering the specific zip codes:

      - 11572 appears to be in Long Island, NY (based on the zip code format)

      - 27604 appears to be in Raleigh, NC area


      This confirms the general state positions - a Long Island location would be
      significantly east of a North Carolina location.</think>I need to determine

      Step 1: Identify the general geographic locations of these states.

      New York is located in the northeastern United States.

      North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their east-west positioning.

      When looking at a map of the United States, New York is positioned to the northeast

      This means New York is east of North Carolina, not west.


      Step 3: Verify with the specific zip codes.

      11572 is in Oceanside, Long Island, New York.

      27604 is in Raleigh, North Carolina.

      The specific locations maintain the same general east-west relationship as their

      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since New York (including zip code 11572) is east of North Carolina (including

      - 27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: I need to determine the relative positions of these locations.

      The continental United States is generally oriented with the East Coast on the

      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the US

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern part of the US


      Looking at the geography of the Eastern US, New York is actually slightly east
      of North Carolina, not west. The East Coast curves, with New York jutting out

      - 27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC), in the Raleigh area


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positioning of New York and North Carolina.

      The United States East Coast curves, with New York being in the Northeast and
      North Carolina being in the Southeast. While North Carolina is south of New
      York, we need to determine their east-west relationship.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      New York is actually further east than North Carolina. The East Coast of the

    52568642-6882-4721-b1ba-708d8b264af8: '<think>To answer whether 10958, NY is located
      west of 27705, NC, I need to determine the geographical locations of both ZIP
      codes.


      10958 is a ZIP code in New York state (NY).

      27705 is a ZIP code in North Carolina state (NC).


      Generally, New York is located in the northeastern United States, while North
      Carolina is in the southeastern United States. On a map of the US, New York
      is typically north and east of North Carolina.


      However, I need to be more specific about these particular ZIP codes:


      - 10958 appears to be a ZIP code in New York state, likely in the southeastern
      part of NY.

      - 27705 appears to be a ZIP code in North Carolina, possibly in the Durham area.


      When comparing east-west positioning, we need to compare the longitudes of these
      locations. Lower (more negative) longitude numbers in the US indicate locations
      further west.


      Since New York is generally east of North Carolina on the US map, it''s likely
      that 10958, NY is east of 27705, NC, not west. But I should be careful about
      assuming this without checking specific coordinates, as there could be exceptions
      depending on the exact locations within these states.</think>I need to determine
      the geographical locations of these ZIP codes to compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10958 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)

      - 27705 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while North Carolina
      is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      On a standard map of the United States, New York is positioned to the east of
      North Carolina, not to the west. The entire state of New York is generally east
      of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Check the specific ZIP codes.

      10958 appears to be in southeastern New York (likely Orange County area).

      27705 is in Durham, North Carolina.


      Even at the specific ZIP code level, the New York location would be east of
      the North Carolina location, not west.


      NO, 10958, NY is not located west of 27705, NC. It is located east of it.'
    5766d1ed-1b5e-4663-a178-54d5f89b46a8: '<think>To determine if 10958, NY is located
      west of 27705, NC, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes on a map

      2. Determine which is further west (has a smaller longitude)


      10958 appears to be a zip code in New York state (NY)

      27705 appears to be a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Generally speaking, New York is located in the northeastern United States, while
      North Carolina is in the southeastern United States. On the east coast of the
      US, locations generally follow this pattern from north to south:

      - New England states (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut,
      Rhode Island)

      - New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania

      - Maryland, Delaware, Virginia

      - North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida


      Looking at this pattern, New York is north of North Carolina, but they are both
      on the eastern seaboard. However, the states are not perfect rectangles, and
      their shapes can vary.


      In general, North Carolina is actually west of much of New York, because the
      US eastern coastline curves. The Atlantic coast runs northeast-southwest, so
      as you go south from New York to North Carolina, you also go somewhat west.


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I believe 27705, NC would be west
      of 10958, NY.</think># Is 10958, NY located west of 27705, NC?


      Let me solve this step by step by determining the geographical positions of
      these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10958 is a zip code in New York state (NY)

      - 27705 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative positions of NY and NC

      The United States eastern coastline follows a northeast to southwest direction.
      New York is in the northeastern part of the country, while North Carolina is
      in the southeastern part.


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions

      Although New York is north of North Carolina, North Carolina is generally west
      of New York due to the curvature of the Atlantic coastline. The eastern seaboard
      angles to the southwest as you move south.


      ## Step 4: Specific zip code locations

      - 10958 (NY) is located in the southeastern part of New York

      - 27705 (NC) is in Durham, North Carolina, which is in the central part of that
      state


      Because of the geographic arrangement of the eastern United States, locations
      in central North Carolina (including Durham) are generally west of locations
      in New York.


      NO, 10958, NY is NOT located west of 27705, NC. It is located east of it.'
    62a707b4-1ed2-4110-a042-9150a3019d27: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of both zip codes and compare their geographic positions
      (east/west relationship).


      Let me identify the locations:

      1. 10958, NY - This is a zip code in New York state

      2. 27705, NC - This is a zip code in North Carolina


      Generally speaking, New York state is located in the northeastern United States,
      while North Carolina is in the southeastern United States. That means New York
      is north of North Carolina, but the east-west relationship requires more specific
      reasoning.


      Looking at the US map, New York state is actually located to the northeast of
      North Carolina. This means that most locations in New York would be EAST of
      locations in North Carolina, not west.


      However, I should be careful because zip codes represent specific areas, and
      the geometry of the states could potentially create exceptions. But in this
      case, given the general geography of the US eastern seaboard:


      - New York state is positioned to the northeast of North Carolina

      - Therefore, a zip code in NY (10958) would most likely be EAST of a zip code
      in NC (27705), not west


      So the answer would be NO - 10958, NY is not located west of 27705, NC. It''s
      located east of it.</think>To determine if 10958, NY is located west of 27705,
      NC, I need to identify these locations and compare their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10958 is a zip code in New York state (NY)

      - 27705 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while North Carolina
      is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Analyze the east-west relationship.

      Looking at the US map, the entire state of New York is positioned to the east
      of North Carolina. The eastern seaboard of the US runs in a northeastern direction,
      with New York being further northeast compared to North Carolina.


      Step 4: Make a specific comparison between these zip codes.

      Since 10958 is in New York and 27705 is in North Carolina, the New York zip
      code must be to the east of the North Carolina zip code, not to the west.

      10958 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)

      27705 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)


      I need to determine whether 10958, NY is located west of 27705, NC.


      Generally speaking, New York is in the northeastern United States, while North

      is north of North Carolina, but New York is actually east of North Carolina
      (closer to the Atlantic Ocean).


      Let me think about the specific ZIP codes:

      - 10958 is likely in the southern part of New York state

      - 27705 is likely in the central or western part of North Carolina


      The eastern edge of North Carolina is on the Atlantic Ocean, while New York
      is further northeast. Almost all of New York state is east of North Carolina.


      So 10958, NY would very likely be east of 27705, NC, not west of it.</think>I
      need to determine if ZIP code 10958 in New York is west of ZIP code 27705 in

      New York (NY) is in the northeastern United States.

      North Carolina (NC) is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      While New York is north of North Carolina, it''s actually positioned to the
      east of North Carolina. New York borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side,
      and North Carolina is situated further west along the East Coast.


      Step 3: Consider the specific ZIP codes.

      10958 is a ZIP code in New York state, which would be in the eastern part of
      the United States.

      27705 is a ZIP code in North Carolina, which would be southwest of New York.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since New York is east of North Carolina (not west), ZIP code 10958 in NY would
      be east of ZIP code 27705 in NC.

      Let me find the locations:


      10958 appears to be a zip code in New York state (NY).

      27705 appears to be a zip code in North Carolina (NC).


      Generally speaking, New York is in the northeastern part of the United States,
      while North Carolina is in the southeastern part. Looking at a map of the US,
      New York is generally east of North Carolina, not west.


      But I should check the specific locations of these zip codes to be sure:


      10958 is likely in southeastern New York.

      27705 is likely in central or eastern North Carolina.


      The eastern coast of the US runs from northeast (Maine) to southwest (Florida),

      - 10958 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States.

      - 27705 is in North Carolina (NC), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the eastern United States.

      - The East Coast runs in a northeastern to southwestern direction.

      - New York is positioned to the northeast of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Since New York is northeast of North Carolina, it is actually to the east

      To solve this, I need to determine the locations of both zip codes and compare

      Let me reason through this:


      1) 10958 is in New York state (NY)

      2) 27705 is in North Carolina state (NC)


      Geographically, North Carolina is located south and west of New York. The eastern
      United States generally follows this pattern where states further northeast
      (like NY) are east of states that are more southwest (like NC).


      North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard but is south of New York. When comparing
      east-west positioning, North Carolina is generally west of New York''s longitude.


      Therefore, 10958 NY is likely EAST of 27705 NC, not west of it.</think>I need

      \ but further south\n   - If you draw a vertical line south from New York, you\
      \ would pass through New Jersey, then Maryland/Delaware, before reaching North\

      \ terms of east-west positioning, New York is typically east of North Carolina.\n\
      \nHowever, to be precise, I should consider the specific zip codes rather than\
      \ just the states. But based on general US geography, New York locations are\
      \ almost always east of North Carolina locations. \n\nNew York is on the Atlantic\
      \ coast further north than North Carolina, which is also on the Atlantic coast\
      \ but further south. Moving along the coast from north to south, the coastline\
      \ runs roughly northeast to southwest, which means that New York is generally\
      \ east of North Carolina.\n\nSo 10958, NY is most likely east of 27705, NC,\
      \ not west of it.</think>To answer whether zip code 10958, NY is located west\
      \ of zip code 27705, NC, I need to consider the geographical positions of these\
      \ locations.\n\nStep 1: Identify the general locations.\n- 10958 is a zip code\
      \ in New York state (NY)\n- 27705 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)\n\nStep\
      \ 2: Consider the relative positions of these states on the US map.\n- New York\
      \ is located in the northeastern United States\n- North Carolina is located\
      \ in the southeastern United States\n\nStep 3: Compare their east-west positioning.\n\
      - When looking at a US map, New York is positioned to the east of North Carolina\n\
      - The eastern United States follows a general northeast-to-southwest orientation\
      \ along the Atlantic coast\n- New York, being further northeast, is actually\
      \ east of North Carolina, not west\n\nStep 4: Consider specific zip codes rather\
      \ than just states.\n- Even considering specific areas within these states,\
      \ the general east-west relationship holds true\n- Zip code 10958 in NY would\
      \ be east of zip code 27705 in NC\n\nNO (10958, NY is not located west of 27705,\
      \ NC; it is located east of it)"
