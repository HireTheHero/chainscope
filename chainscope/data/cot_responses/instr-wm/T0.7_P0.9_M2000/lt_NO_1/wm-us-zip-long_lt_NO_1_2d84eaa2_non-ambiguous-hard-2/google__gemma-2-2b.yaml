      100% of the time for this type of problem.


      Let''s start with this one:

      Is 60137, IL located west of 79331, TX?


      This is a simple yes or no question. Let''s say that we know that Illinois is
      west of Texas.


      We also know that 60137, IL is located in Illinois.


      So the question is, is Illinois west of Texas?


      The answer is YES.


      Now, let''s do the same thing with this question:

      Is 23834, VA located west of 45439, OH?


      Virginia is west of Ohio, so this is a yes question.


      But, we also know that 23834, VA is located in Virginia.


      So, the question is, is Virginia west of Ohio?


      The answer is YES.


      We can now take a step back and realize that if Illinois is west of Texas, and
      Virginia is west of Ohio, then 23834, VA is located west of 45439, OH.


      This is a true statement, and it is therefore a YES answer.

      states, then they are located in opposite directions.


      To determine whether 60137, IL is located in the same state as 79331, TX, we
      need to use the concept of state boundaries. The boundaries of a state are generally
      defined by natural features such as rivers, mountains, and deserts. The state
      of Illinois is bordered by the state of Missouri to the east, Iowa to the northeast,
      Wisconsin to the north, Indiana to the west, and Kentucky to the south. The
      state of Texas is bordered by the state of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to
      the southeast, Oklahoma to the south, New Mexico to the west, and Mexico to
      the north.

      The postal code for 45449, OH is 45449.


      The postal code for 76001, TX is 76001.


      Now, here''s the tricky part: you need to determine which is west of the other.


      Let''s start with the fact that the United States is a very large country, and
      that the postal codes for the different states and cities are not always consistent.


      So, to answer your question, we need to consider a few things:


      1. The state of Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      2. The state of Texas is located in the South region of the United States.

      3. Therefore, Ohio is west of Texas.


      Now, let''s consider the postal codes.


      45449, OH is located in the state of Ohio, which is west of Texas.


      76001, TX is located in the state of Texas, which is west of Ohio.
