      1. First, let''s identify the states: 53209 is in Wisconsin (WI), and 76155
      is in Texas (TX).


      2. Next, we need to consider the general geography of the United States. Wisconsin
      is located in the north-central part of the country, while Texas is in the south-central
      part.


      3. Now, let''s determine the specific locations of the zip codes. The zip code
      53209 is in the Milwaukee, WI area, and 76155 is in the Fort Worth, TX area.


      4. Comparing the two locations, Milwaukee, WI (53209) is generally north and

      1. **Identify the states**: The zip code 17970 is located in Pennsylvania (PA),
      and the zip code 70062 is located in Louisiana (LA).


      2. **General geographic knowledge**: Pennsylvania is generally located in the
      northeastern part of the United States, while Louisiana is located in the southern
      part of the country.


      3. **Specific locations**: The zip code 17970 is associated with the town of
      Cressona, Pennsylvania, which is in the eastern part of the state. The zip code
      70062 is associated with the town of Kenner, Louisiana, which is in the southeastern
      part of the state.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Since Pennsylvania is generally located east of
      Louisiana, and Cressona, Pennsylvania, is in the eastern part of the state,
      it is east of Kenner, Louisiana, which is in the southeastern part of Louisiana.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, 17970, PA (Cressona, Pennsylvania)

      California (CA).


      2. Next, we need to consider the general geography of the United States. Utah
      is located in the western part of the country, while California is also in the
      western part, but it extends further west than Utah.


      3. Now, let''s determine the specific locations of the zip codes. The zip code
      84056 is in the Salt Lake City, UT area, and 91360 is in the Thousand Oaks,
      CA area, which is northwest of Los Angeles.


      4. Comparing the two locations, Salt Lake City, UT (84056) is generally east
      of the Thousand Oaks, CA area (91360).


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether 84056, UT is located west of
