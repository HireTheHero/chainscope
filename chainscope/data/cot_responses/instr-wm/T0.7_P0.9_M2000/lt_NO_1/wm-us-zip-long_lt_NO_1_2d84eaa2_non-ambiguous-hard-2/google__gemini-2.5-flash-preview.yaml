      northeastern United States. South Carolina (SC) is in the southeastern United
      States.

      3.  **Compare the general locations:** The Northeast is generally north and
      east of the Southeast.

      4.  **Consider longitude:** Locations further west have smaller longitude values
      (closer to 0 or negative, depending on the convention, but for US comparison,
      smaller values on a typical map are further west). Locations further east have
      larger longitude values.

    e8ab019a-7e30-490d-b3b9-3892995b3da1: 'Step 1: Identify the states for each zip
      code.

      06438 is in CT (Connecticut).

      29206 is in SC (South Carolina).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographical location of each state within the
      United States.

      Connecticut is in the northeastern part of the US.

      South Carolina is in the southeastern part of the US.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions of the two states.

      Generally, the northeastern US is west of the southeastern US. However, let''s
      consider the specific longitude.


      Step 4: Find the approximate longitude of each location.

      A quick search reveals:

      Guilford, CT (where 06438 is located) has a longitude of approximately -72.68
      degrees West.

      Columbia, SC (where 29206 is located) has a longitude of approximately -80.99
      degrees West.


      Step 5: Compare the longitudes.

      -72.68 is greater than -80.99. On the Earth, a greater negative longitude means
      a location is further east (or less far west) than a location with a smaller
      negative longitude.


      Step 6: Determine the relative east-west position based on longitude.

      Since -72.68 is greater than -80.99, 06438, CT is located east of 29206, SC.


      Step 7: Answer the question based on the comparison. The question is whether
      06438, CT is *west* of 29206, SC. Our finding is the opposite.

      of Virginia, also on the Atlantic coast, but generally considered more southeastern.

      3. **Consider the general north/south and east/west relationship of the states:**
      Virginia is generally north of Georgia. While both are eastern states, Virginia
      is further north along the coast.

      4. **Consider the longitude:** While not explicitly stated, states further north
      on the eastern coast generally have longitudes further west than states further
      south on the eastern coast, especially when comparing points at roughly the
      same distance from the coast.

      zip code in Macon, Georgia, which is also inland but further south.

      6. **Visualize or understand the geography:** Imagine a map. Virginia is north
      of Georgia. To be west of a location in Georgia, a location in Virginia would
      need to be significantly further west than its general position relative to

      3. **Determine the relative locations of Virginia and Georgia:** Virginia is
      located to the north and east of Georgia.

      4. **Consider the general geographical arrangement of the US:** States further
      east generally have zip codes that are "smaller" in the eastern part of the

      asks about the relative positions of 08080, NJ and 28107, NC.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** New Jersey (NJ) is a state
      in the northeastern US. North Carolina (NC) is a state in the southeastern US.

      3.  **Determine the general relative position of the states:** Relative to each
      other on a map of the US, New Jersey is generally north and east of North Carolina.
      Conversely, North Carolina is generally south and *west* of New Jersey.

      4.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While zip codes can be large areas,

    a5693831-9b38-488d-a95d-cbd8f280a527: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing the locations of 08080, NJ
      and 28107, NC.

      2.  **Approximate location of 08080, NJ:** This zip code is in southern New
      Jersey, specifically in the area of Williamstown. Geographically, New Jersey
      is on the East Coast of the US.

      3.  **Approximate location of 28107, NC:** This zip code is in North Carolina,
      specifically in the area of Monroe, east of Charlotte. North Carolina is also
      on the East Coast, but south of New Jersey.

      4.  **Determine relative longitude:** To be "west of" another location, a location
      must have a higher longitude value (closer to 0 degrees longitude, or further
      west of the Prime Meridian). Alternatively, you can think of their positions
      on a map. New Jersey is north of North Carolina. When comparing locations roughly
      along the same north-south line on the East Coast, the more northern location
      (New Jersey) tends to be slightly further east than a location significantly
      to its south (North Carolina). A location further south and slightly inland
      (like Monroe, NC) is generally west of a location further north and closer to
      the coast (like Williamstown, NJ).

      5.  **Visualize or confirm with a map/coordinates:** Looking at a map or comparing
      approximate coordinates, Williamstown, NJ is roughly around 39.6 degrees North,
      75.0 degrees West. Monroe, NC is roughly around 35.0 degrees North, 80.5 degrees
      West. A longitude of 75.0 West is *east* of a longitude of 80.5 West.

      6.  **Compare "west of":** Since 08080, NJ is at approximately 75.0 degrees
      West longitude and 28107, NC is at approximately 80.5 degrees West longitude,
      08080, NJ is located *east* of 28107, NC.

      6.  **Determine \"west of\":** On the Earth, locations further west have *larger*\
      \ negative longitude values (or larger positive values if measuring from the\

      \ Virginia.\n    *   **38611:** A quick search reveals that 38611 is the zip\
      \ code for Byhalia, Mississippi.\n\n4.  **Determine the relative geographical\
      \ positions:** Now I need to compare the positions of Blacksburg, VA and Byhalia,\
      \ MS. I can do this by:\n    *   Visualizing their positions on a map of the\
      \ US.\n    *   Looking up their approximate latitude and longitude and comparing\
      \ the longitudes.\n\n5.  **Comparison (using either method):**\n    *   **Map\
      \ Visualization:** Mentally picture or look at a map of the eastern/southeastern\
      \ US. Mississippi is generally southwest of Virginia. Blacksburg, VA is in southwestern\
      \ Virginia. Byhalia, MS is in northern Mississippi, near the Tennessee border.\
      \ Placing these on a mental map, Blacksburg (VA) is clearly *east* of Byhalia\
      \ (MS).\n    *   **Longitude Comparison (more precise):**\n        *   Blacksburg,\
      \ VA (approximate center for 24073): Longitude is around -80.4 degrees West.\n\
      \        *   Byhalia, MS (approximate center for 38611): Longitude is around\
      \ -89.7 degrees West.\n        *   Comparing longitudes: -80.4 is *greater*\
      \ than -89.7. On a West-East scale, larger negative numbers (further west) are\
      \ to the left of smaller negative numbers (further east). Since -80.4 is a \"\
      smaller\" negative number than -89.7 (i.e., closer to zero), Blacksburg is located\
      \ *east* of Byhalia.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the comparison against the question:**\
      \ The question asks if 24073 (Blacksburg, VA) is *west* of 38611 (Byhalia, MS).\
      \ My analysis shows that Blacksburg, VA is *east* of Byhalia, MS.\n\n7.  **Formulate\
      \ the final answer:** Since Blacksburg, VA is east of Byhalia, MS, the answer\
      \ to the question \"Is 24073, VA located west of 38611, MS?\" is no.\n\n8. \
      \ **Provide the YES/NO answer:** The final answer must be a simple YES or NO.\
      \ Based on the reasoning, the answer is NO.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking complete.**\
      \ The final answer is ready.Step 1: Determine the geographical location associated\
      \ with zip code 24073.\nStep 2: Determine the geographical location associated\
      \ with zip code 38611.\nStep 3: Determine the relative longitudinal positions\
      \ of the two locations.\nStep 4: Compare the longitude of the 24073 location\
      \ to the longitude of the 38611 location. A location is west of another if its\
      \ longitude is further negative (or less positive if using East longitudes)\
      \ than the other location.\n\n24073 is Blacksburg, Virginia.\n38611 is Byhalia,\
      \ Mississippi.\n\nBlacksburg, VA is located at approximately 37.23\xB0 N, -80.41\xB0\
      \ W.\nByhalia, MS is located at approximately 34.85\xB0 N, -89.67\xB0 W.\n\n\
      Comparing the longitudes: -80.41\xB0 W vs -89.67\xB0 W.\n-80.41 is greater than\
      \ -89.67. Locations with longitudes further west have more negative values.\n\
      Since -80.41 is less negative (closer to zero) than -89.67, Blacksburg, VA is\
      \ located east of Byhalia, MS.\n\nThe question asks if 24073 is *west* of 38611.\
      \ Since it is east, the answer is no.\n\nNO"

      of 08628, NJ.**


      08628 is a zip code in New Jersey. New Jersey is a state on the East Coast of
      the United States. Therefore, 08628 is located in the eastern part of the US.


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate location of 38834, MS.**


      38834 is a zip code in Mississippi. Mississippi is a state in the Southeastern
      United States, bordering the Mississippi River. Therefore, 38834 is located
      more centrally within the eastern half of the US, but significantly west of
      the Atlantic coast.


      **Step 3: Compare the relative longitudes.**


      Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Mississippi is further inland and
      to the west of the East Coast states, a location in New Jersey will have a more
      easterly longitude than a location in Mississippi.


      **Step 4: Conclude the relative positions.**

      \ is a northern state, bordering Canada. It's generally considered part of the\
      \ Midwest, but leans more towards the northern/upper Midwest.\n    *   Kansas\

      1.  **Understand the question:** We need to determine if the location associated
      with the zip code 88048, NM is geographically west of the location associated
      with the zip code 91352, CA.


      2.  **Identify the states:** The zip codes are in New Mexico (NM) and California
      (CA).


      3.  **Recall basic US geography:** California is located on the west coast of
      the United States. New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States,
      east of Arizona and significantly east of California.


      4.  **Compare the relative positions of the states:** California is geographically
      further west than New Mexico.


      5.  **Apply to the specific zip codes:** Since California is generally west
      of New Mexico, any location within California will be west of any location within
      New Mexico (assuming standard geographic positions).


      6.  **Determine the final answer:** A location in New Mexico (88048, NM) is
      east of a location in California (91352, CA). Therefore, 88048, NM is *not*

      3.  **Consider the zip codes:** While zip codes generally increase as you move
      east, this is a very general rule with many exceptions, especially when comparing
      states far apart. Relying solely on the numeric value of the zip code is unreliable
      for precise east/west comparisons, especially across different states.

      4.  **Focus on the states'' locations:** The question asks about the relative
      location of a point in NM and a point in CA. Since California is geographically
      west of New Mexico, any point in California will be west of any point in New
      Mexico.


      Therefore, 91352, CA is located west of 88048, NM.


      The question asks if 88048, NM is located *west* of 91352, CA.


      Since 91352, CA is west of 88048, NM, 88048, NM must be east of 91352, CA.

      the location represented by zip code 08620, NJ west of the location represented
      by zip code 34994, FL?

      2.  **Determine the location of 08620, NJ:** This zip code is in New Jersey.
      New Jersey is on the East Coast of the US.

      3.  **Determine the location of 34994, FL:** This zip code is in Florida. Florida
      is also on the East Coast of the US, but generally south of New Jersey.

      4.  **Consider the relative positions:** New Jersey is located north of Florida.
      When comparing locations on the East Coast, New Jersey will generally be further
      *west* than Florida for any given latitude, because the coastline curves eastward
      as you go south. However, the question is about the overall relationship of
      the two points, not just latitude.

      5.  **Visualize or use geographical knowledge:** New Jersey is significantly
      further *north* than Florida. While both are on the East Coast, the vast majority
      of Florida lies south and east of New Jersey. To travel from New Jersey to Florida,
      you generally move south-southwest.

      6.  **Compare longitudes (implicitly):** Without looking up exact coordinates,
      we know NJ is north of FL. The US mainland generally trends southwest-to-northeast
      on the Atlantic coast. Therefore, a point in NJ will generally have a longitude
      further *west* than a point in southern Florida.

      7.  **Formulate the comparison:** A location in New Jersey (like 08620) is geographically
      situated north and generally *west* of a location in southern Florida (like
      34994).

      asks about the relative position of a location in NJ (zip code 08734) and a
      location in IN (zip code 46016).

      2.  **Determine the general geographical location of each state:** New Jersey
      is on the East Coast of the United States. Indiana is in the Midwest, west of
      the Appalachian Mountains and generally considered "further west" than the East
      Coast states.

      3.  **Consider the longitude:** Westward movement across the US corresponds
      to decreasing longitude values (more negative or smaller positive values depending
      on the convention). Since Indiana is west of New Jersey, any location in Indiana
      will have a more westerly (smaller or more negative) longitude than any location
      in New Jersey.

      4.  **Compare the specific locations:** While the exact longitude of 08734 (NJ)
      and 46016 (IN) isn''t explicitly needed for a YES/NO answer based on state locations,
      the general geographical principle holds. Indiana is west of New Jersey. Therefore,

      if 08734, NJ is west of 46016, IN:


      1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks about the relative East/West
      positions of two specific US zip codes.

      2.  **Recognize the need for location data:** To answer this, I need the geographical
      location (specifically, longitude) of each zip code.

      3.  **Find the location of 08734, NJ:** I access my internal knowledge base
      or perform a lookup for the location of zip code 08734. This zip code is associated
      with Lavallette, New Jersey. New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States.

      4.  **Find the location of 46016, IN:** I access my internal knowledge base
      or perform a lookup for the location of zip code 46016. This zip code is associated
      with Anderson, Indiana. Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United
      States.

      5.  **Compare the locations:** New Jersey is significantly further east than
      Indiana. The geographical order of the US from East to West is roughly: East
      Coast (like NJ) -> Midwest (like IN) -> Mountain West -> West Coast.

      6.  **Determine the relative position:** Since New Jersey (08734) is East of
      Indiana (46016), 08734 is *not* west of 46016.

      \ number line (or longitude scale), numbers further to the *right* are further\
      \ *east*.\n    *   Therefore, -78.27\xB0 W is *east* of -89.85\xB0 W.\n    *\
      \   This means 22936, VA is located *east* of 70444, LA.\n\n8.  **Answer the\
      \ Original Question:** The question was \"Is 22936, VA located *west* of 70444,\
      \ LA?\". Our analysis shows it is located *east*.\n\n9.  **Formulate the Final\
      \ Answer:** Based on the interpretation, the answer is NO.\n\n10. **Add the\
      \ Reasoning Steps (as requested):** Clearly state the locations, find the longitudes,\
      \ compare them, and draw the conclusion about east/west position.\n\n*Self-Correction/Refinement:*\
      \ Double-check the longitudes found. Are they reasonable for the states? Virginia\
      \ is on the East Coast, Louisiana is further west. Yes, -78 is typical for Virginia,\
      \ and -89 is typical for Louisiana. The relative ordering (-78 is east of -89)\
      \ makes sense geographically. The calculation and comparison seem correct.\n\
      \nTherefore, the final answer is NO.Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.\
      \  To determine if one location is west of another, we need to compare their\
      \ longitudes. A location further west will have a smaller (more negative) longitude\
      \ value than a location further east.\n2.  We need to find the approximate location\
      \ or longitude for zip code 22936, VA. This zip code corresponds to the Fork\
      \ Union, Virginia area. The approximate longitude for Fork Union, VA is around\
      \ -78.27\xB0 W.\n3.  We need to find the approximate location or longitude for\
      \ zip code 70444, LA. This zip code is in the Slidell, Louisiana area. The approximate\
      \ longitude for Slidell, LA is around -89.85\xB0 W.\n4.  Now, we compare the\
      \ longitudes: -78.27\xB0 W (Virginia) and -89.85\xB0 W (Louisiana).\n5.  On\
      \ a number line, -78.27 is greater than -89.85.\n6.  Since -78.27 is greater\
      \ than -89.85, the location at -78.27\xB0 W is *east* of the location at -89.85\xB0\
      \ W.\n7.  Therefore, 22936, VA is located east of 70444, LA.\n8.  The question\
      \ asks if 22936, VA is located *west* of 70444, LA.\n\nBased on the comparison,\
      \ the answer is that 22936, VA is *east* of 70444, LA.\n\nNO"

      \ is west of another, we need their approximate geographic positions, specifically\
      \ their longitudes. Zip codes don't directly give precise coordinates, but they\
      \ correspond to geographic areas.\n\n3.  **Determine the location of 39367,\
      \ MS:** 39367 is in Mississippi. Mississippi is a state in the southeastern\
      \ US. Its longitude is generally around -88 to -91 degrees West.\n\n4.  **Determine\
      \ the location of 73801, OK:** 73801 is in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is a state in\
      \ the south-central US, west of Mississippi. Its longitude is generally around\
      \ -94 to -103 degrees West.\n\n5.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *   Mississippi\
      \ (39367) is around -88 to -91 degrees West longitude.\n    *   Oklahoma (73801)\
      \ is around -94 to -103 degrees West longitude.\n\n6.  **Interpret longitude\
      \ and direction:** Westward movement corresponds to *more negative* (or larger\
      \ absolute value negative) longitudes.\n    *   -94 is west of -91.\n    * \
      \  -103 is west of -88.\n    *   Any longitude in Oklahoma (-94 to -103) is\
      \ west of any longitude in Mississippi (-88 to -91).\n\n7.  **Formulate the\
      \ conclusion:** Since Oklahoma (73801) is geographically west of Mississippi\
      \ (39367), 39367, MS is *not* located west of 73801, OK. In fact, it is located\
      \ *east* of it.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Format:** The request specifically asks\
      \ for a YES/NO answer. The conclusion is that 39367, MS is *east* of 73801,\
      \ OK. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Is 39367, MS located west of 73801,\
      \ OK?\" is NO.\n\nNO"

      Oklahoma (OK).

      3.  **Recall or look up the relative geographical positions of the states:**
      Oklahoma (OK) is located west of Mississippi (MS).

      4.  **Consider the zip codes:** While zip codes generally increase as you move
      east to west across the US, the state prefixes (the first digits) are the primary
      indicator of general location. Mississippi zip codes typically start with 39,
      and Oklahoma zip codes typically start with 73. The lower first digit (3 vs
      7) aligns with Mississippi being further east than Oklahoma.

      5.  **Compare the locations:** Since Oklahoma is west of Mississippi, any location
      within Oklahoma will be west of any location within Mississippi (ignoring minor
      north/south variations, the primary east/west relationship holds).

      6.  **Formulate the comparison:** Is 39367 (in MS) located west of 73801 (in
      OK)? This is asking if a location in Mississippi is west of a location in Oklahoma.

    a010e2d7-3d78-4a88-ab3e-43d0054459d3: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing 01908, MA and 18218, PA.

      2.  **Determine the states:** 01908 is in Massachusetts (MA). 18218 is in Pennsylvania
      (PA).

      3.  **Consider the relative geographic positions of the states:** Massachusetts
      is located in the northeastern part of the United States, primarily along the
      Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania is located slightly to the south and west of Massachusetts.

      4.  **Visualize the relative positions on a map:** If you were to draw a line
      from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania, you would generally move in a southwesterly
      direction. Conversely, if you were starting in Pennsylvania and moving towards
      Massachusetts, you would generally move in a northeasterly direction.

      5.  **Compare the locations directly:** Since Pennsylvania is west (and south)
      of Massachusetts, any specific location in Massachusetts (like 01908) will be
      east of any specific location in Pennsylvania (like 18218), assuming they are
      within the typical bounds of their states.


      Therefore, 01908, MA is located east of 18218, PA.

      2.  **Determine the states:** 01908 is in Massachusetts (MA). 18218 is in Pennsylvania
      (PA).

      3.  **Consider the general geographical relationship:** Massachusetts is generally
      located northeast of Pennsylvania.

      4.  **Visualize the relative positions:** If you were to place MA and PA on

      5.  **Apply this to the zip codes:** Since MA is northeast of PA, any location
      in MA will be east of any location in PA (assuming typical geographic bounds
      of the states). Therefore, 01908, MA will be east of 18218, PA.

      6.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if 01908, MA is *west* of 18218,

      3.  **Consider general relative positions:** The Northeast is generally north
      and east of the Southeast.

      4.  **Consider longitude:** While specific longitudes are needed for precise
      comparison, states further west have numerically larger negative longitudes
      (or smaller positive longitudes if using 0-360 degrees east). States further
      east have numerically smaller negative longitudes (or larger positive longitudes).

      5.  **Compare longitudes:** Connecticut is significantly further east than Florida.
      The average longitude of CT is roughly -72.5 degrees. The average longitude
      of FL is roughly -81.5 degrees. A more specific point in CT (like 06712) will
      have a longitude around -73 degrees. A point in southern Florida (like 33330)
      will have a longitude around -80 degrees.

      6.  **Determine "west of":** A location is "west of" another if its longitude
      is numerically more negative (or smaller if using 0-360 east).

      7.  **Apply to the locations:** -73 degrees (CT) is *not* more negative than
      -80 degrees (FL). In fact, -73 is larger than -80, meaning CT is east of FL.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** North Carolina (NC) is
      on the East Coast of the United States. Arkansas (AR) is in the South-Central
      United States.

      3.  **Compare the relative positions of the states:** Arkansas is located significantly
      to the west of North Carolina.

      4.  **Consider if specific zip codes within these states could reverse this:**
      While specific zip codes within a state have their own coordinates, the difference
      in longitude between North Carolina as a whole and Arkansas as a whole is substantial.
      It''s highly improbable that a location *within* North Carolina would be west
      of a location *within* Arkansas, given their general geographic placement. North
      Carolina''s westernmost point is still well east of Arkansas''s easternmost

      2.  **Determine the states:** 10927 is in New York (NY). 33990 is in Florida
      (FL).

      3.  **Consider the relative positions of the states:** New York is located generally
      north of Florida. More importantly, we need to consider their east-west positions.
      The continental US is roughly oriented such that the East Coast states (like
      NY and FL) are along the eastern edge.

      4.  **Consider the general longitude of each state:** Both New York and Florida
      are considered East Coast states. However, looking at a map or considering their
      longitudes, Florida extends further west than New York does. For example, the
      westernmost point of Florida is further west than the westernmost point of New

      \ 10927, NY is located east of 33990, FL, the answer to the question \"Is 10927,\
      \ NY located west of 33990, FL?\" is NO.\n\nAnswer:\nNO"
    8cb09148-0d48-4bd9-87a2-40f71337b188: '1. **Identify the locations:** We are comparing
      10927, NY and 33990, FL.

      2. **Determine the general geographical location of each state:** New York (NY)
      is on the East Coast of the US, north of Florida (FL). Florida is also on the
      East Coast of the US, south of New York.

      3. **Consider the general trend of longitude:** As you move west across the
      US, the longitude values generally decrease (become more negative or move away
      from 0 degrees longitude).

      4. **Compare the relative positions of NY and FL:** Since NY is generally north
      and slightly to the west of the *easternmost* parts of Florida, and Florida
      extends significantly further south, locations in NY will generally be further
      west than locations in Florida *at similar latitudes*. However, this is a comparison
      of specific zip codes, not entire states.

      5. **Consider the specific zip codes:** While we don''t need the exact coordinates,
      knowing that New York is further north and generally to the west of Florida
      on a map is sufficient for a general comparison of longitude.

      6. **Reason about the relative longitudes:** Given the general geographical
      positions, a location in New York (like 10927) will have a longitude value that
      is further west (a smaller negative number or a larger positive number depending
      on the convention, but more "west" on a standard map) than a location in Florida
      (like 33990).


      Therefore, 10927, NY is located west of 33990, FL.

      \ question:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks if a specific\
      \ US zip code in New York (10927) is located *west* of a specific US zip code\
      \ in Florida (33990). The answer must be YES or NO.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key\
      \ Information:**\n    *   Zip Code 1: 10927, NY\n    *   Zip Code 2: 33990,\
      \ FL\n    *   The comparison is based on **longitude** (west vs. east).\n\n\
      3.  **Determine How to Compare Locations:** Zip codes represent geographic areas.\
      \ To compare their locations in terms of west/east, I need to know their approximate\
      \ longitudes.\n\n4.  **Find Location Information for Each Zip Code:**\n    *\
      \   **10927, NY:** I know this is in New York. I can look up this zip code to\
      \ find its approximate location. A quick search reveals it corresponds to Goshen,\
      \ NY. Goshen, NY is in southeastern New York state. Its approximate latitude/longitude\
      \ is around 41.4\xB0 N, 74.3\xB0 W.\n    *   **33990, FL:** I know this is in\
      \ Florida. I can look up this zip code. A quick search reveals it corresponds\
      \ to Cape Coral, FL. Cape Coral, FL is on the southwestern coast of Florida.\
      \ Its approximate latitude/longitude is around 26.6\xB0 N, 82.0\xB0 W.\n\n5.\
      \  **Compare the Longitudes:**\n    *   Longitude of 10927 (Goshen, NY): approximately\
      \ 74.3\xB0 W\n    *   Longitude of 33990 (Cape Coral, FL): approximately 82.0\xB0\
      \ W\n\n6.  **Apply the West/East Rule:** On a map, longitudes increase as you\
      \ move *west* from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0). Therefore, a larger *west* longitude\
      \ number means a location is further west.\n\n7.  **Perform the Comparison:**\n\
      \    *   74.3\xB0 W vs. 82.0\xB0 W\n    *   Is 74.3\xB0 W west of 82.0\xB0 W?\n\
      \    *   No, because 82.0 is a larger west longitude number, meaning 82.0\xB0\
      \ W is further *west* than 74.3\xB0 W.\n    *   Therefore, 74.3\xB0 W is *east*\
      \ of 82.0\xB0 W.\n\n8.  **Formulate the Answer to the Original Question:** The\
      \ question asks \"Is 10927, NY located west of 33990, FL?\". My comparison showed\

      \n9.  **Determine the YES/NO Answer:** Since 10927, NY is east of 33990, FL,\
      \ the answer to the question \"Is 10927, NY located west of 33990, FL?\" is\
      \ NO.\n\n10. **Final Check:** Does the visual geography make sense? New York\
      \ is generally northeast of Florida. While parts of Florida extend quite far\
      \ west, southeastern New York is still significantly further east than the southwestern\
      \ coast of Florida. This confirms the longitude comparison.\n\n11. **Format\
      \ the Output:** Provide only the YES or NO answer as requested.\n\n**Thinking\
      \ Process Complete.** I am ready to give the answer.Here's the thinking process:\n\

      northeastern United States. Florida (FL) is in the southeastern United States.

      3.  **Consider the relative positions of the states:** Florida is generally

      located in the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast region of the US. Georgia (GA) is located
      in the Southeast region of the US, generally south and southwest of Virginia.


      3.  **Consider the zip code numbers:** While zip code numbers *can* sometimes
      give a rough east-west or north-south indication within a state or region, they
      are primarily designed for postal routing, not geographical coordinates. They
      are not reliable indicators of east-west position across different states, especially
      states that are geographically separated. 20xxx zip codes are generally northern
      VA/DC suburbs, and 30xxx zip codes are generally northern GA.


      4.  **Consult geographical knowledge or a map/tool:** We need to know if Warrenton,
      VA (20121) is west of Cornelia, GA (30534). Warrenton, VA is located approximately
      38.7 degrees North latitude and 77.8 degrees West longitude. Cornelia, GA is
      located approximately 34.5 degrees North latitude and 83.5 degrees West longitude.

      are crucial.

      6.  **Relate states to longitude:** Illinois is further east than Texas. Therefore,
      any specific location in Illinois will generally have a larger longitude value
      (meaning it''s further east) than a specific location in Texas.

      7.  **Conclude the relative position:** Since Illinois is east of Texas, a location
      in Illinois cannot be west of a location in Texas.

      with the zip codes.

      90650 is Norwalk, California.

      97229 is Portland, Oregon.


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographical positions of California and Oregon.

      California is located south of Oregon on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Determine the relative geographical positions of Norwalk, CA and Portland,
      OR.

      Norwalk is in Southern California. Portland is in Northern Oregon.


      Step 4: Consider the west-east relationship between the two cities.

      Both cities are on the west coast, but Portland is further north and slightly
      further east than Norwalk. To travel directly west from Portland, you would
      go out into the Pacific Ocean. To travel directly west from Norwalk, you would
      also go out into the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 5: Rephrase the question: Is Norwalk, CA located west of Portland, OR?


      Step 6: Based on the geographical positions, Portland, OR is located north and
      slightly east of Norwalk, CA. Therefore, Norwalk, CA is located south and slightly
      west of Portland, OR.


      Step 7: Confirm the answer to the question. Since Norwalk, CA is located west
      of Portland, OR, the answer is yes.

      \ CA is *east* of 97229, OR.\n\n9.  **Final YES/NO:** The statement \"90650,\
      \ CA is located west of 97229, OR\" is false.\n\n10. **Give the Answer:** The\
      \ answer is NO.\n\n*Self-Correction Check:* Okay, double-checking the longitude\
      \ comparison. -122 is indeed more negative (further west) than -118. So, Portland\
      \ area is west of Los Angeles area. The question asks if LA area (90650) is\
      \ west of Portland area (97229). No, LA area is east of Portland area.\n\nFinal\
      \ answer is NO.Here's the reasoning:\n\n1.  Identify the locations: 90650 is\
      \ in Norwalk, California (part of Los Angeles County). 97229 is in the Beaverton/Hillsboro\
      \ area of Oregon (part of the Portland metropolitan area).\n2.  Determine the\
      \ relative geographic positions of these two areas. Southern California (where\
      \ Norwalk is) is south of Northern Oregon (where Beaverton/Hillsboro is).\n\
      3.  To determine \"west of,\" compare their longitudes. Locations further west\
      \ have lower (more negative) longitudes.\n4.  Norwalk, CA (90650 area) is roughly\
      \ around -118\xB0 W longitude.\n5.  Beaverton/Hillsboro, OR (97229 area) is\
      \ roughly around -122.9\xB0 W longitude.\n6.  Comparing the longitudes: -122.9\
      \ is less than -118. This means 97229, OR is further west than 90650, CA.\n\
      7.  Therefore, 90650, CA is located east of 97229, OR, not west of it.\n\nNO"

      comparing the location of 44030, OH and 36107, AL.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest/Northeastern
      part of the US. Alabama (AL) is in the Southeastern part of the US.

      3.  **Consider the relative positions of the states:** Ohio is generally north
      of Alabama. More importantly for the west/east question, Ohio is generally located
      *east* of a vertical line that would pass through Alabama.

      4.  **Consider zip code locations within states:** While zip codes within a
      state can vary in their exact location, the overall position of the state is
      the primary factor when comparing locations in states that are geographically
      distant and have significantly different longitudes. A zip code in Ohio will
      almost certainly be further east than a zip code in Alabama.

      5.  **Compare longitudes (implicitly):** States further west have lower longitudes
      (closer to 0 or negative), states further east have higher longitudes (more
      negative). Alabama is further west than Ohio.

      6.  **Formulate the comparison:** The question asks if 44030, OH is *west* of
      36107, AL. Since Ohio is generally *east* of Alabama, a location in Ohio will
      be east of a location in Alabama.

      61611 and a location in Texas with the zip code 76210.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Illinois is a Midwestern
      state. Texas is a Southern state located further west than Illinois.

      3.  **Consider the general geographic areas:** Illinois is located east of the
      Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains. Texas is located on the Great Plains (in
      part) and extends further west than Illinois.

      4.  **Compare the longitudes:** While zip codes don''t directly represent longitude,
      they are geographically assigned. A lower zip code number *generally* corresponds
      to a location further east within the US (though there are many exceptions due
      to historical assignment and state boundaries). A higher zip code number *generally*
      corresponds to a location further west. Illinois''s zip codes generally fall
      between 60000 and 62999. Texas''s zip codes generally fall between 75000 and

    0bf1776a-535e-4100-8715-d1f29becd697: '1.  **Understand the question:** The question
      asks if a specific Colorado zip code (80130) is geographically located *west*
      of a specific Arizona zip code (85255).


      2.  **Identify the key information:** We need the relative east-west locations
      of 80130, CO and 85255, AZ.


      3.  **Recall/Research the general location of the states:** Colorado is generally
      east of Arizona.


      4.  **Consider the zip codes within the states:** While states have a general
      east-west relationship, zip codes can sometimes be near the state border, potentially
      complicating a simple state-level comparison. However, 80130 is in Parker, CO
      (southeast metro Denver area), and 85255 is in Scottsdale, AZ (northeast metro
      Phoenix area). These are not border towns near the CO/AZ line.


      5.  **Determine the relative longitude:** Since Colorado is east of Arizona
      overall, and these zip codes are not near the border in a way that would reverse
      the general state relationship, points in Colorado will generally have a more
      easterly longitude (closer to 0 degrees longitude) than points in Arizona. Being
      "east" means having a higher (less negative) longitude value when using the
      Prime Meridian as the reference. Being "west" means having a lower (more negative)
      longitude value.


      6.  **Compare longitudes:** A location with a more easterly longitude is *east*
      of a location with a more westerly longitude. Conversely, a location with a
      more westerly longitude is *west* of a location with a more easterly longitude.
      Since Colorado is east of Arizona, 80130, CO will have a more easterly longitude
      than 85255, AZ.


      7.  **Formulate the conclusion based on the comparison:** 80130, CO is east
      of 85255, AZ. Therefore, 85255, AZ is west of 80130, CO. The question asks if
      80130, CO is west of 85255, AZ.

      4.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While zip codes define specific areas,
      the relative positions of entire states provide a strong indication of the relative

      MA, which is in eastern Massachusetts, west of Boston. 31636 is Valdosta, GA,
      which is in southern Georgia, near the Florida border.

      3.  **Consider the relative positions of the states:** Massachusetts is in the
      northeastern United States. Georgia is in the southeastern United States.

      4.  **Compare the longitudes:** Generally, locations further west have lower
      longitudes (more negative numbers in the Western Hemisphere). Locations further
      east have higher longitudes. Since Massachusetts is significantly further north
      and east than Georgia, any location in Massachusetts will be further east (higher

      6.  **Confirm the specific locations (optional but adds certainty):** 01810
      is Andover, MA. 15468 is Ohiopyle, PA. Andover is north of Boston. Ohiopyle
      is in southwestern PA, near the border with West Virginia and Maryland. A quick
      check on a map confirms that Ohiopyle, PA is significantly west of Andover,
      MA.

      7.  **Formulate the comparison:** Is 01810, MA (Andover) west of 15468, PA (Ohiopyle)?

      comparing 01810, MA and 15468, PA.

      2.  **Determine the states:** 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA). 15468 is in Pennsylvania
      (PA).

      3.  **Consider the general geographical relationship between MA and PA:** Massachusetts
      is generally northeast of Pennsylvania.

      4.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While zip codes *can* give a rough
      idea of location within a state, they are not perfectly ordered geographically
      and cannot reliably be used for precise east-west comparison *between* states,
      especially when the states are not directly aligned east-west. However, the
      *states themselves* have a clear general relationship.

      5.  **Evaluate the question:** "Is 01810, MA located west of 15468, PA?" This
      asks if a location in Massachusetts is west of a location in Pennsylvania.

      6.  **Apply the general relationship:** Since Massachusetts is generally northeast
      of Pennsylvania, any location in MA will generally be *east* and *north* of
      any location in PA. Therefore, a location in MA will not be west of a location
      in PA (except in very fringe cases dependent on the specific points within the
      states, but the general relationship holds for the vast majority of locations).

      7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the general geographical relationship between the
      states, a location in MA is not west of a location in PA.

    9e75e708-cb7a-476f-b2b3-edcbc97d9ba4: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing 01810, MA and 15468, PA.

      2.  **Determine the states:** 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA). 15468 is in Pennsylvania
      (PA).

      3.  **Consider the relative geographical positions of the states:** Massachusetts
      is a New England state located on the eastern coast of the US. Pennsylvania
      is a state located west of Massachusetts, roughly in the mid-Atlantic/Northeast
      region.

      4.  **Infer the longitude:** Since Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts,
      locations within Pennsylvania will generally have a more westerly longitude
      (a smaller degree number if using negative values for west, or a larger degree
      number if using 0-360 values where West is larger).

      5.  **Apply this to the specific zip codes:** While specific locations within
      a state can vary, it is highly improbable that a location in eastern Massachusetts
      would be west of a location in western Pennsylvania. zip code 01810 is Andover,
      MA, which is in the eastern part of the state. zip code 15468 is Mount Pleasant,
      PA, which is in the western part of the state.

      6.  **Compare the locations:** Andover, MA is significantly east of Mount Pleasant,
      PA.


      Therefore, Mount Pleasant, PA (15468) is located west of Andover, MA (01810).
      The question asks if Andover, MA is located west of Mount Pleasant, PA.

      code.

      44116 is in Ohio (OH).

      77045 is in Texas (TX).


      Step 2: Determine the approximate geographic location of each state within the
      contiguous United States.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest/Eastern part of the US.

      Texas is located in the South/Southwestern part of the US.


      Step 3: Consider the general relative positions of Ohio and Texas on a map.

      Texas is generally located to the southwest of Ohio.


      Step 4: Specifically determine if all of Ohio is west of all of Texas.

      Looking at a map, Texas extends further west than Ohio. However, the question
      is whether a specific zip code in Ohio is west of a specific zip code in Texas.


      Step 5: Determine the longitude of 44116, OH and 77045, TX.

      Longitudes are needed to definitively determine the east/west relationship.

      The approximate centroid longitude for 44116, OH is around -81.86 degrees.

      The approximate centroid longitude for 77045, TX is around -95.46 degrees.


      Step 6: Compare the longitudes.

      A more negative longitude value indicates a location further west.

      -81.86 is greater than -95.46.

      2.  Determine the general geographical relationship between North Carolina and
      Virginia. North Carolina is generally south of Virginia.

      3.  To compare the east-west positions, we need to consider the specific locations
      within each state. While zip codes don''t directly give longitude, they are
      often assigned in a way that provides some geographical clues. Lower zip codes
      tend to be further east, and higher zip codes tend to be further west within
      a region or state.

      4.  However, comparing zip codes across states can be misleading. It''s better
      to find the actual locations or relative positions within the states.

      5.  Let''s consider the states themselves. The coastline of North Carolina extends
      further east (Cape Hatteras) than the coastline of Virginia. The western parts
      of both states are mountainous.

      6.  Let''s consider the numerical value of the zip codes. 28457 is a higher
      number than 24354. This *might* suggest 28457 is further west within its region
      compared to 24354 within its region, but this is not a guaranteed rule across
      state lines.

      7.  A more reliable method is to consider the general location of these areas.
      Zip code 28457 corresponds to Hampstead, NC, which is near the coast in southeastern
      North Carolina. Zip code 24354 corresponds to Hillsville, VA, which is in southwestern
      Virginia, in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

      8.  Hampstead, NC is a coastal town. Hillsville, VA is in the mountains far
      from the coast. Coastal areas are generally further east than mountainous areas
      in this region of the US.

      and Virginia. Virginia is located directly to the north of North Carolina.


      Step 3: While knowing the states is helpful, the specific locations within the

      Southport, NC is on the coast in southeastern North Carolina. Ivanhoe, VA is
      in southwestern Virginia.


      Step 6: Compare the longitudinal positions. Locations further west have a higher
      longitude value (when using positive numbers for west longitude, or smaller
      negative numbers when using negative numbers for west longitude). Since North
      Carolina is south of Virginia, we are comparing the relative east/west positions.

      4.  **Consider longitude:** Longitude lines run north-south. Locations further
      west have lower (or more negative, depending on the scale) longitude values.
      Locations further east have higher (or less negative) longitude values.

      5.  **Estimate/Recall longitude:** While precise longitude isn''t needed for

      \ To determine if one location is west of another, we need to know their relative\

      \ to +180 degrees). Alternatively, we can visualize or know the general geographic\
      \ positions of the states.\n\n4.  **Method 1: Geographic Knowledge (Visual/Mental\
      \ Map):**\n    *   Where is Pennsylvania (PA)? It's on the East Coast, or at\

      4.  **Refine the comparison:** While a location in Illinois is generally north

      4.  **Consider the specific locations within the states (optional but helpful\

      area. 75025 is in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

      5. **Compare the longitudes:** To be definitively west, the longitude of 55043
      would need to be a larger negative value (or a smaller positive value if using
      a different convention) than the longitude of 75025.

      6. **Recall or look up general US geography:** Minnesota is located further
      east than Texas. Texas extends further west than Minnesota. Therefore, a location
      in Minnesota is highly likely to be east of a location in Texas.


      Based on the general geographical relationship between Minnesota and Texas,

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** New York (NY) is located
      in the northeastern United States. Ohio (OH) is located in the midwestern United
      States.

      3.  **Consider the relative positions of the states:** Ohio is generally located
      west of New York.

      4.  **Consider the specific locations within the states:** While ZIP codes provide
      more precise locations, the overall west-east relationship between Ohio and
      New York is strong enough that it''s highly likely any location in Ohio will
      be west of any location in New York, especially when comparing states that are
      geographically distinct like this. A quick check confirms that Ohio is significantly
      west of New York.

      5.  **Formulate the comparison:** We are asking if 12549, NY is *west* of 43160,
      OH.

      6.  **Evaluate the comparison:** Since Ohio is west of New York, a location
      in New York will be *east* of a location in Ohio. Therefore, 12549, NY is *not*
      west of 43160, OH.

      3.  **Consider the general geographical relationship:** The East Coast of the

      code.

      - 01107 is in Massachusetts (MA).

      - 33715 is in Florida (FL).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographical location of each state within the
      US.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern part of the United States.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions of the two states.

      - The northeastern US is generally located west of the southeastern US when
      considering the entire continental United States as a frame of reference. While
      Florida extends further south, Massachusetts is located significantly further
      west in terms of longitude compared to the longitude of Florida.


      Step 4: Consider if specific locations within those states could reverse this
      general relationship.

      - While it''s possible for specific points within large states to be east or
      west of each other in ways that defy the general state-level comparison, given
      the significant difference in their overall locations (Northeast vs. Southeast),
      it''s highly improbable that a location in Massachusetts would be east of a
      location in Florida. Massachusetts is much further west.


      Step 5: Conclude based on the relative positions of the states.

      - Since Massachusetts is located significantly west of Florida, any zip code
      within Massachusetts will be located west of any zip code within Florida.

      \ Massachusetts zip code (01107) is located *west of* a specific Florida zip\
      \ code (33715).\n\n2.  **Understand the concept of \"west of\":** In geographical\
      \ terms, \"west of\" means having a lower longitude value. The further west\
      \ something is, the lower (or more negative, depending on the convention) its\
      \ longitude.\n\n3.  **Determine the locations of the zip codes:**\n    *   01107\
      \ is in Massachusetts (MA). Specifically, it's in Springfield, MA.\n    *  \
      \ 33715 is in Florida (FL). Specifically, it's in St. Petersburg, FL.\n\n4.\
      \  **Compare the relative locations of Massachusetts and Florida:** Massachusetts\

      \ positions of MA and FL. MA is significantly further north than FL. More importantly\
      \ for this question, look at their east-west positions.\n\n6.  **Consider the\
      \ longitudes:** States along the East Coast generally have higher (less negative)\
      \ longitudes than states further west. Both MA and FL are on the East Coast,\
      \ but their specific locations within the East Coast matter.\n    *   Springfield,\
      \ MA (01107) is roughly around 72.5 degrees West longitude.\n    *   St. Petersburg,\
      \ FL (33715) is roughly around 82.7 degrees West longitude.\n\n7.  **Compare\
      \ the longitudes:**\n    *   Longitude of 01107: ~72.5\xB0 W\n    *   Longitude\

      \ Derivation:** 01107 (MA) is around 72.5\xB0 W. 33715 (FL) is around 82.7\xB0\
      \ W. Since 82.7 is a larger number in West longitude, it is further west than\

      3.  **Determine the approximate location of 76001, TX:** 76001 is a zip code
      in the Arlington, Texas area (part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex). Texas
      is generally considered part of the Southwestern/South-Central United States.
      Its longitude is roughly around 97 degrees West.

      4.  **Compare longitudes:** A location is "west" of another if its longitude
      is further west (i.e., a larger number of degrees West longitude, or a smaller
      number of degrees East longitude if using that system). Ohio''s longitude (around
      84 degrees West) is *east* of Texas''s longitude (around 97 degrees West).

      5.  **Formulate the answer:** Since Ohio is east of Texas, 45449, OH is *not*
      located west of 76001, TX. Instead, it is located east of it.

      3.  **Consider the relative positions of the states:** Ohio is generally east
      of Texas.

      4.  **Consider the specific zip codes within the states:** While zip codes can
      sometimes create small variations in relative position within a state, the overall
      east-west position of the states themselves is the dominant factor for locations
      far apart like Ohio and Texas. 45449 is in Dayton, OH. 76001 is in Arlington,
      TX. Dayton is clearly east of Arlington.

      5.  **Compare the east-west positions:** Since Ohio is east of Texas, any location
      in Ohio (like 45449) will be east of any location in Texas (like 76001), ignoring
      minor north-south variations which don''t affect the east-west comparison in
      this case.

      3.  **Consider geographical location:** New Hampshire is in the northeastern
      United States. Florida is in the southeastern United States.

      4.  **Compare longitude:** The key to determining "west of" is longitude. Points
      further west have lower longitudes (more negative values). Generally, locations
      in the Midwest and West are west of the East Coast. New Hampshire is on the
      East Coast. Florida is also on the East Coast, but further south.

      slightly further east than Florida. While Florida is south of New Hampshire,
      New Hampshire is located *north and east* relative to Florida. A location west
      of Florida would be in a state like Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, etc.

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing 03079, NH and 32095, FL.

      2.  **Determine the states:** 03079 is in New Hampshire (NH). 32095 is in Florida
      (FL).

      3.  **Visualize the relative positions of the states:** New Hampshire is in
      the northeastern United States. Florida is in the southeastern United States.

      4.  **Consider the general geographical relationship:** States in the northeast
      are generally located north and *east* of states in the southeast when considering
      the overall continental US. Florida is generally located to the south and *west*
      of New Hampshire.

      5.  **Confirm with a mental map or external tool (if necessary):** Looking at
      a map of the US clearly shows New Hampshire significantly to the northeast of
      Florida. This means Florida is to the southwest of New Hampshire.

      6.  **Apply the question''s direction:** The question asks if 03079 (NH) is
      located *west* of 32095 (FL).

      7.  **Evaluate the relationship based on step 5:** Since Florida is to the southwest
      of New Hampshire, New Hampshire is to the northeast of Florida. Therefore, New
      Hampshire is *east* of Florida, not west.

      \n2.  **Identify the Key Information:**\n    *   Zip Code 1: 84056 (Utah)\n\
      \    *   Zip Code 2: 91360 (California)\n    *   Comparison: Is Zip Code 1 *west\
      \ of* Zip Code 2?\n\n3.  **Recall/Determine the General Location of the States:**\n\
      \    *   Utah is a landlocked state in the western United States.\n    *   California\
      \ is a state on the Pacific coast of the western United States.\n\n4.  **Determine\
      \ the Relative Position of the States:** California is generally located *west*\
      \ of Utah.\n\n5.  **Consider the Specific Zip Codes:** Does the specific location\
      \ *within* each state matter enough to potentially reverse the general state-level\
      \ relationship?\n    *   84056 is in Utah (specifically, Orem/Provo area). This\
      \ is in the central part of Utah.\n    *   91360 is in California (specifically,\
      \ Thousand Oaks area). This is in Southern California, near the coast.\n\n6.\

      \ UT (84056).\n    *   Locate Thousand Oaks, CA (91360).\n\n7.  **Compare the\
      \ Longitudes:** To be \"west of\" something, you need to have a smaller (more\
      \ negative in the Western Hemisphere) longitude value. While I don't need the\
      \ exact longitudes, I know from the map (or general knowledge of US geography)\
      \ that any location in California is significantly farther west than any location\
      \ in Utah. California is on the Pacific coast, while Utah is well inland.\n\n\
      8.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Since California is geographically located\
      \ west of Utah, any point within California (like 91360) will be west of any\
      \ point within Utah (like 84056).\n\n9.  **Check the Question Again:** Is 84056\
      \ (Utah) located *west of* 91360 (California)? No, because 84056 is in Utah,\
      \ which is *east* of California. The question asks if the Utah location is *west*\
      \ of the California location.\n\n10. **Final Answer Formulation:** The Utah\
      \ zip code is located geographically east of the California zip code. Therefore,\
      \ the Utah zip code is *not* west of the California zip code.\n\n11. **Provide\
      \ the YES/NO Answer:** Based on the conclusion, the answer is NO.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:**\
      \ The initial thought might be \"California is west of Utah\". The question\
      \ is \"Is 84056, UT west of 91360, CA?\". Rereading carefully confirms the perspective.\
      \ Since 84056 is in Utah (east of CA) and 91360 is in CA (west of UT), 84056\
      \ is *east* of 91360. Therefore, it is *not* west of 91360. The logic holds.\n\
