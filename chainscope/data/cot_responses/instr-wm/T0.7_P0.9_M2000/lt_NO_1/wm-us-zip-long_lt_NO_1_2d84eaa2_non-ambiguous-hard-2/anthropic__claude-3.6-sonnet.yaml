      2) Recall that in US zip codes:

      - Lower numbers generally represent eastern areas

      1. First, let me identify these locations:

      - 80130 is in Highlands Ranch, Colorado

      - 85255 is in Scottsdale, Arizona


      2. Let me recall the relative positions of these states:

      - Colorado and Arizona are both western states

      - Colorado is directly north of New Mexico

      - Arizona is west of New Mexico


      3. Therefore:

      - Arizona is west of Colorado

      - If Arizona is west of Colorado, then any point in Arizona must be west of
      any point in Colorado

      - Since 85255 (Scottsdale, AZ) is in Arizona and 80130 (Highlands Ranch, CO)
      is in Colorado, 85255 must be west of 80130


      4. The question asks if 80130 is west of 85255, which is the opposite of what
      we determined

      1. First, let me identify these locations:

      - 18951 is in Perkasie, Pennsylvania

      - 42431 is in Graham, Kentucky


      2. Let me roughly identify their positions:

      - Perkasie, PA is in eastern Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia

      - Graham, KY is in western Kentucky


      3. Comparing their positions:

      - Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky on the US map

      - Since 18951 is in eastern PA, and 42431 is in western KY, the difference is
      even more pronounced

      * Beaufort, NC is on the Atlantic coast of North Carolina

      * Dalton, OH is in northeast Ohio


      3. To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their relative
      positions:

      * North Carolina''s coast is clearly on the eastern seaboard

      * Ohio is a more inland state, west of North Carolina


      4. Therefore, since 28512 (Beaufort, NC) is on the Atlantic coast, and 44627
      (Dalton, OH) is in Ohio which is further inland, Beaufort must be EAST of Dalton,
      not west.
