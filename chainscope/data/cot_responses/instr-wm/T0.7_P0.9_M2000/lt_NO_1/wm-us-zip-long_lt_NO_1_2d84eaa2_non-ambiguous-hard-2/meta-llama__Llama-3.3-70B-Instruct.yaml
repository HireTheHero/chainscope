      west of 45439, OH, we need to determine the geographical locations of these
      two zip codes.


      1. **Identify the states**: The first step is to identify the states where these
      zip codes are located. The zip code 23834 is in Virginia (VA), and the zip code
      45439 is in Ohio (OH).


      2. **General geographical location of states**: Next, we consider the general
      geographical locations of Virginia and Ohio in the United States. Virginia is
      located in the southeastern part of the United States, while Ohio is in the
      eastern part of the Midwest, which places it northwest of Virginia.


      3. **Specific locations within states**: Without specific knowledge of each
      zip code''s location within its state, we rely on the general understanding
      of the states'' positions. However, knowing that Virginia is southeast and Ohio
      is more northwest gives us a basis for comparison.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that Virginia is generally southeast of Ohio, any location
      in Virginia would typically be southeast (and thus east) of locations in Ohio,
      assuming we''re comparing locations within the general areas of these states.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since Virginia is generally east and slightly south of Ohio,
      a location in Virginia (23834) would not be west of a location in Ohio (45439).


      The final answer is: NO'

      \ the longitudinal aspect (east-west), Los Angeles, CA (90043), and Albany,\
      \ OR (97331), are at similar longitudes because both are coastal cities on the\
      \ Pacific. The key difference is their latitude, with Los Angeles being south\
      \ and Albany being north. But when considering if one is strictly \"west\" of\
      \ the other based on zip code locations, we must acknowledge that the concept\
      \ of \"west\" in this context is somewhat nuanced because both locations are\

      \ higher longitude (further west) than Los Angeles, CA, when considering their\
      \ precise geographical locations.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer to whether\
      \ 90043, CA, is located west of 97331, OR, would be **NO**, because Albany,\
      \ OR, is slightly further west than Los Angeles, CA, but the critical aspect\

    1ef70719-94a1-430e-8682-fd6240f1e939: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the general geographic locations of the two zip codes and then compare their
      positions relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the states**: The first step is to recognize the states associated
      with each zip code. The zip code 10927 is located in the state of New York (NY),
      and the zip code 33990 is located in the state of Florida (FL).


      2. **General geographic location of NY and FL**: New York is located in the
      northeastern part of the United States, while Florida is located in the southeastern
      part of the country.


      3. **Compare positions**: Given their states, we know that New York is generally
      north and somewhat east of Florida. However, the question is about whether 10927,
      NY is west of 33990, FL.


      4. **Specific locations within states**: To better understand their relative
      positions, let''s consider the general geography. New York State extends farther
      east than Florida does, but it also extends northward. Florida, being a peninsula,
      extends into the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, with its western parts
      being closer to the Gulf and its eastern parts along the Atlantic coast.


      5. **Determine west/east relationship**: Since New York is to the north and
      east of Florida, for 10927, NY to be west of 33990, FL, the specific location
      of 33990, FL would need to be on the eastern edge of Florida, and 10927, NY
      would need to be significantly westward within New York State, or at least not
      as far east as the easternmost parts of Florida.


      6. **Zip code specifics**: Without looking up the exact locations, we can reason
      generally. The zip code 10927 is in the Hudson Valley region of New York, which
      is not as far east as the easternmost tip of New York (Long Island). The zip
      code 33990 is in the southwestern part of Florida, near Cape Coral.


      7. **Conclusion**: Given the general positions, 10927, NY is not west of 33990,
      FL. New York, where 10927 is located, is generally east and north of Florida,
      where 33990 is located. Even though 33990 is on the west coast of Florida, New

      \ The first part of the question involves understanding the locations of California\
      \ (CA) and Oregon (OR) in the United States. California is located on the West\
      \ Coast, and Oregon is also on the West Coast, north of California.\n\n2. **Understand\
      \ zip code locations**: \n   - **90650, CA**: This zip code is in California.\
      \ Given California's location on the map, we know it is generally west of many\
      \ parts of the United States but need to compare it directly with the location\
      \ of the Oregon zip code.\n   - **97229, OR**: This zip code is in Oregon. Oregon\
      \ is north of California and also on the West Coast.\n\n3. **Compare longitudes**:\
      \ To determine which is west, we can compare the longitudes of the two locations.\
      \ The farther west a location is, the higher its longitude (in terms of negative\
      \ numbers, since longitudes west of the Prime Meridian are negative). However,\
      \ without specific longitude values, we rely on general geographical knowledge.\n\
      \n4. **General geographical knowledge**: Both California and Oregon are on the\
      \ West Coast, but California extends farther south. The question isn't about\
      \ north-south but east-west positioning. Both states border the Pacific Ocean,\
      \ which means they are both towards the western edge of the United States. The\
      \ critical factor here is the relative east-west positioning, not the north-south.\n\
      \n5. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are coastal and on the western\
      \ edge of the United States, the difference in their east-west positioning (longitude)\
      \ would determine the answer. Oregon is generally at a similar longitude to\
      \ the northern parts of California but is north of it. The specific zip codes\
      \ would provide exact locations, but generally, parts of California can be west,\
      \ east, north, or south of parts of Oregon depending on their exact locations\
      \ within the states.\n\nSince both zip codes are on the West Coast and without\
      \ converting the zip codes to exact longitudes, the general assumption might\
      \ lean towards considering which state or part of the state is more westward.\
      \ However, this step requires precise geographical data or conversion of zip\
      \ codes to latitudes and longitudes for an accurate comparison.\n\nGiven the\
      \ information and steps above, the critical piece of information needed for\
      \ a precise answer involves the exact longitudes of the two zip codes or a detailed\
      \ geographical comparison that shows one is definitively west of the other based\

      \ \n- **90650, CA** is in Norwalk, California.\n- **97229, OR** is in Portland,\
      \ Oregon.\n\nPortland, Oregon, and Norwalk, California, are both near the coast,\
      \ but Portland is significantly north and slightly east due to the curvature\
      \ of the coastlines and the positioning of the states.\n\n**Final Step**: Given\
      \ the northward position of Oregon relative to California and considering the\
      \ coastal alignment, the east-west comparison depends on the specific locations.\
      \ However, since both are coastal and the question asks which is west, we look\
      \ at the general geography and the fact that as you move north along the West\
      \ Coast, you are not necessarily moving east or west in a significant manner\
      \ in terms of longitude, but rather, the coastline dictates the positioning.\n\
      \n**Answer**: \nGiven the steps and considerations, and without specific longitude\
      \ comparisons but knowing the general geography of the West Coast, the answer\
      \ hinges on the precise locations of 90650, CA, and 97229, OR. \n\nSince both\
      \ locations are on the West Coast and near the ocean, their east-west positioning\
      \ is relatively similar in terms of being \"west\" in the United States. However,\

      \   - South El Monte, CA (90650) and Portland, OR (97229) are both near the\
      \ Pacific coast. Portland, OR is slightly more east than many parts of California\

      \ part of the United States.\n\n3. **Compare the positions**:\n   - Since Ohio\
      \ is generally north and slightly west of Alabama, but considering the overall\
      \ geography, Alabama is more to the south and slightly east of Ohio. However,\
      \ the question is about beingwest, so we need to focus on the longitudinal (east-west)\
      \ aspect rather than the latitudinal (north-south) aspect.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Given that Ohio is north of Alabama and slightly west in terms of the\
      \ U.S. map, but not significantly so in a way that would make a dramatic difference\
      \ in their east-west positioning, we must consider the specific locations of\
      \ these zip codes. \n   - However, without needing to get into the specifics\
      \ of each zip code's exact longitude, we can generally say that Ohio, being\
      \ north of Alabama, does not necessarily mean it is west. The question hinges\
      \ on the relative east-west positions rather than the north-south positions.\n\
      \n5. **Final consideration**:\n   - Alabama is at a lower longitude (more east)\
      \ than parts of Ohio when considering the U.S. as a whole, but since both states\
      \ are in the eastern part of the United States, the difference in longitude\
      \ is not as significant as the difference in latitude. However, Ohio extends\
      \ further west than Alabama does, given the overall geography of the United\
      \ States.\n\nGiven these considerations, to directly answer the question without\
      \ overcomplicating:\n\n- Ohio (44030) is generally north of Alabama (36107),\
      \ and while it may extend further west than Alabama, the specific zip code locations\
      \ would determine the exact east-west relationship. However, considering typical\
      \ geography and without specific longitude details for these zip codes, we can\
      \ make an educated guess based on state positions.\n\n**YES**"

      is located in the southeastern United States, while Minnesota is in the north-central
      part of the country.

      3. Given that Florida is to the southeast and Minnesota is to the north-central,
      we can infer their relative east-west positions. Florida is generally east of
      Minnesota because it is located near the eastern coast of the United States,
      while Minnesota is more towards the central part of the northern United States.


      Based on this reasoning, since Florida (where 32579 is located) is generally
      east of Minnesota (where 55904 is located), 32579, FL is not west of 55904,
      MN.

      \ in Virginia (VA).\n\n2. **General geographical knowledge**: \n   - North Carolina\
      \ is located to the south of Virginia.\n\n3. **Specific locations**:\n   - Without\
      \ exact coordinates, we can't be perfectly precise, but generally, zip codes\
      \ can give us an idea of the relative east-west positioning within a state,\
      \ with lower numbers often being more eastward, especially in the eastern United\
      \ States.\n\n4. **Compare the zip codes**:\n   - The zip code 28457 starts with\
      \ \"284\", indicating it is in the southeastern part of the United States, more\
      \ specifically in eastern North Carolina.\n   - The zip code 24354 starts with\
      \ \"243\", indicating it is in western Virginia.\n\n5. **East-West Comparison**:\n\
      \   - Considering North Carolina is south of Virginia, to be west of Virginia,\
      \ a location in North Carolina would need to be significantly far west within\
      \ the state to be at a longitude less than a location in western Virginia.\n\
      \n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that 28457, NC is in eastern North Carolina\
      \ and 24354, VA is in western Virginia, but considering the states' positions\
      \ (NC to the south of VA), 28457, NC would likely be east of 24354, VA due to\
      \ the general layout of US states and zip code numbering patterns.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ based on this analysis, the answer is: **NO**"

      \ Virginia (VA).\n\n2. **Understand geographical locations**:\n   - North Carolina\
      \ is located to the south of Virginia.\n\n3. **Consider east-west orientation**:\n\
      \   - The question asks if 28457, NC, is west of 24354, VA. To determine this,\
      \ we need to understand the general east-west layout of these states. North\
      \ Carolina and Virginia share a border, with North Carolina to the south. However,\
      \ we need to consider their east-west alignment.\n\n4. **Specific locations\
      \ within the states**:\n   - Without specific city names, we can still consider\
      \ the general layout. North Carolina stretches from the Atlantic coast westward,\
      \ and so does Virginia. The question is whether the specific part of NC (28457)\
      \ is west of the specific part of VA (24354).\n\n5. **Zip code locations**:\n\
      \   - 28457 is associated with Shallotte, NC, which is in the southeastern part\
      \ of the state, near the coast.\n   - 24354 is associated with Marion, VA, which\
      \ is more inland and westward compared to the eastern coastal regions of Virginia\
      \ but still eastward compared to the western parts of North Carolina.\n\n6.\
      \ **Final consideration**:\n   - Given that Shallotte, NC (28457), is near the\
      \ southeastern coast of North Carolina and Marion, VA (24354), is more inland\
      \ in Virginia, we must consider their relative east-west positions. Shallotte,\
      \ being on the coast, is likely more eastward than Marion, VA, which is situated\
      \ more towards the western part of Virginia but still not as far west as the\
      \ western parts of North Carolina.\n\nGiven these considerations, to determine\
      \ if 28457, NC, is west of 24354, VA, we need to think about the relative positions:\n\
      \n- If 28457 (NC) is near the coast and thus more to the east, and 24354 (VA)\
      \ is more inland (westward in Virginia but not as far west as western NC), then\
      \ 28457 would not be west of 24354. \n\nHowever, this step-by-step reasoning\
      \ might seem to overcomplicate the geographical relationship without exact longitudinal\
      \ coordinates. The essence of the question is about the east-west relationship\
      \ between two points in neighboring states. Given the general geography:\n\n\
      - North Carolina is south of Virginia.\n- The specific locations within these\
      \ states (coastal NC vs. inland VA) suggest that the NC location could indeed\

      \   - 08221, NJ: New Jersey is located in the Northeastern United States.\n\
      \   - 24486, VA: Virginia is located in the Eastern United States, south of\

      \   - The east coast of the United States runs along the Atlantic Ocean. Moving\
      \ west from the coast would place you further inland.\n\n3. **Compare the locations:**\n\
      \   - New Jersey (NJ) is directly east of Pennsylvania and north of Delaware,\
      \ making it an eastern state.\n   - Virginia (VA) is south of New Jersey and\
      \ also considered an eastern state but extends slightly further west than New\
      \ Jersey does, due to its larger size and geographical layout.\n\n4. **Determine\
      \ if one is west of the other:**\n   - Given that both states are on the east\

      of cardinal directions (north, south, east, west), northeast is a combination

      1. First, let''s identify the states: 43952 is in Ohio (OH) and 60087 is in
      Illinois (IL).

      2. Next, we need to consider the general geography of these states. Ohio is
      located east of Illinois.

      3. Since 43952 is in Ohio and 60087 is in Illinois, and Ohio is east of Illinois,
      we can conclude that 43952, OH is east of 60087, IL.

      4. Given that east is the opposite direction of west, we can determine that
      43952, OH is not west of 60087, IL.

      \n2. **Determine general geographical locations**:\n   - Ohio is generally located\
      \ east of Illinois in the United States.\n\n3. **Consider the possibility of\
      \ specific zip code locations**:\n   - Even though Ohio is east of Illinois,\

      4. Since North Carolina is southeast and Ohio is more northwest (or at least

      \ 91748 is located in California (CA), and the zip code 97527 is located in\
      \ Oregon (OR).\n\n2. **Understand general US geography**: California is located\
      \ on the West Coast of the United States, and Oregon is also on the West Coast,\
      \ north of California.\n\n3. **Determine the relative positions of CA and OR**:\
      \ Since Oregon is north of California, we need to consider the specific locations\
      \ within these states to determine which zip code is west of the other.\n\n\
      4. **Specific locations of the zip codes**:\n   - The zip code 91748 is associated\
      \ with Rowland Heights, California, which is in the eastern part of the Los\
      \ Angeles metropolitan area, somewhat inland.\n   - The zip code 97527 is associated\
      \ with Grants Pass, Oregon, which is in the southwestern part of Oregon, closer\
      \ to the Pacific Ocean than the eastern parts of California but also somewhat\
      \ inland.\n\n5. **Compare the longitudes**:\n   - To determine which location\
      \ is west of the other, we need to compare their longitudes. Generally, the\
      \ farther west a location is, the higher its longitude (in negative terms, as\
      \ these locations are in the Western Hemisphere, where longitudes are negative).\n\
      \   - Without exact longitude values provided, we rely on general geographic\
      \ knowledge. Both California and Oregon are close to the Pacific Ocean, but\
      \ Oregon is generally at a higher latitude and slightly more eastward in terms\
      \ of longitude compared to the eastern parts of California, considering the\
      \ shape and orientation of the North American continent.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Given that 91748 (California) is more to the southeast compared to 97527 (Oregon),\
      \ which is more to the northwest, and considering the general geography of the\
      \ region, 91748 would be southeast (and thus east) of 97527. However, the question\
      \ asks which is west of the other, focusing on the east-west axis rather than\
      \ the north-south axis.\n\nBased on the above steps, since 97527 (Oregon) is\
      \ north and slightly more west than 91748 (California) due to the geographic\
      \ layout of the western United States:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NO}$"

      \ in Texas (TX).\n\n2. **General Geographical Location**:\n   - Louisiana is\
      \ generally east of Texas.\n   - However, the specific locations within these\
      \ states can vary significantly in terms of longitude.\n\n3. **Specific Zip\
      \ Code Locations**:\n   - 70065 is in Louisiana. Without a specific city, we\
      \ can infer it's likely near the eastern part of the state or possibly in the\
      \ central region, given the \"70\" prefix which often denotes the New Orleans\
      \ area or nearby regions.\n   - 78380 is in Texas. The \"78\" prefix often denotes\
      \ the southern part of Texas, which could be near the U.S.-Mexico border or\
      \ slightly north of it.\n\n4. **Longitudinal Comparison**:\n   - Louisiana's\
      \ western edge is roughly at 94\xB0 W longitude.\n   - Texas's eastern edge\
      \ is roughly at 93.5\xB0 W longitude, extending westward.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Given the general geographical locations and considering the longitudinal\
      \ positions, Louisiana (where 70065 is located) is generally east of Texas (where\
      \ 78380 is located). However, specific longitudes for these zip codes would\
      \ provide a definitive answer.\n\n6. **Specific Longitudes**:\n   - The zip\
      \ code 70065 (Metairie, LA) has a longitude around 90.1\xB0 W.\n   - The zip\
      \ code 78380 (La Gloria, TX) has a longitude around 98.1\xB0 W.\n\nGiven these\
      \ longitudes, 70065, LA is indeed east of 78380, TX, meaning 70065, LA is not\

      of 67218, KS, we need to understand the general geography of the United States
      and how zip codes are distributed.


      1. **Identify the states**: The zip code 30354 is located in the state of Georgia
      (GA), and the zip code 67218 is located in the state of Kansas (KS).


      2. **General geographic locations of the states**: Georgia is located in the
      southeastern part of the United States, while Kansas is located in the central
      part of the country.


      3. **Determine the relative east-west positions**: Given their locations, Georgia
      is generally east of Kansas. This is because the United States is often divided
      into broad regions, with the east coast being the Atlantic side and the west
      coast being the Pacific side. Georgia is closer to the east coast, and Kansas
      is more towards the central part of the country, moving towards the west.


      4. **Conclusion based on state locations**: Since Georgia is east of Kansas,
      any location within Georgia (such as the zip code 30354) would be east of any
      location in Kansas (such as the zip code 67218).

      of 29067, SC, we need to establish the general geographical locations of both
      zip codes and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the general location of 10457, NY**: The zip code 10457 is located
      in the Bronx, New York City, New York. New York State is in the northeastern
      part of the United States.


      2. **Identify the general location of 29067, SC**: The zip code 29067 is located
      in Lexington, South Carolina. South Carolina is in the southeastern part of

      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that New York is northeast and South Carolina
      is southeast, we need to consider their relative positions in terms of east-west
      orientation. Generally, New York is north of South Carolina, but when considering
      east-west, New York (especially the part around New York City) is somewhat east
      of South Carolina because the eastern seaboard of the United States curves slightly,
      with New York being directly east of many parts of the southeastern states.


      4. **Determine westward position**: For 10457, NY to be west of 29067, SC, it
      would need to be located to the west of it on a map. However, given that New

      5. Given that 11572 (NY) is east of 27604 (NC) and also north, we cannot conclude
      it is west based on the east-west comparison alone. However, the east-west aspect
      is what the question is asking about.

      6. Based on the general geography, New York (11572) is east, not west, of North
      Carolina (27604).


      The final answer is: NO'

      \ New York State.\n   - 27705, NC: This zip code is located in North Carolina.\n\
      \n2. **Determine the general geographical area:**\n   - New York is located\
      \ in the Northeastern United States.\n   - North Carolina is located in the\
      \ Southeastern United States.\n\n3. **Compare the locations:**\n   - The Northeast\

      \ of 27705, NC, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify the States**:\
      \ First, we identify the states involved. 10958 is in New York (NY), and 27705\
      \ is in North Carolina (NC).\n\n2. **General Geographic Location of States**:\
      \ \n   - New York is located in the Northeastern United States.\n   - North\
      \ Carolina is located in the Southeastern United States.\n\n3. **Longitudinal\
      \ Positions**: Generally, as you move west in the United States, the longitude\
      \ increases (from east to west, the numbers go from smaller to larger). However,\
      \ to compare these two locations directly, we should consider their specific\
      \ longitudes or their general positions relative to each other.\n\n4. **Compare\
      \ Longitudes**:\n   - New York's longitude is roughly around 74\xB0 to 79\xB0\
      \ W (western longitude).\n   - North Carolina's longitude is roughly around\
      \ 78\xB0 to 84\xB0 W.\n\n5. **Determine Westward Position**:\n   - For a location\
      \ to be west of another, it needs to have a higher longitude value in the context\
      \ of the Western Hemisphere, given that both are in the United States and share\
      \ similar latitude ranges.\n\n6. **Comparison**:\n   - Since 10958, NY, and\
      \ 27705, NC, are both in the eastern United States and considering their general\
      \ longitude ranges, North Carolina (NC) is generally east of New York (NY) because\
      \ it is more to the southeast, but when comparing their longitudes directly,\
      \ parts of North Carolina can be west of parts of New York due to their longitudinal\
      \ ranges overlapping.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - To accurately determine if\
      \ 10958, NY, is west of 27705, NC, without exact longitude and latitude, we\
      \ rely on the general geography. North Carolina extends further west than New\
      \ York does, due to its southeastern position relative to New York's northeastern\
      \ position. However, the question is about specific zip codes. Given the general\
      \ positions, it's possible for parts of North Carolina to be west of parts of\
      \ New York, but the specific comparison depends on the exact locations of these\
      \ zip codes.\n\nGiven the specific zip codes:\n- 10958, NY, refers to a location\
      \ in New York.\n- 27705, NC, refers to a location in North Carolina.\n\nAnd\
      \ considering the general geographic locations and longitudinal ranges, without\
      \ the exact coordinates, the direct comparison might seem complex. However,\
      \ knowing that New York is generally northeast and North Carolina is southeast,\

      \ based on typical geographic understanding and without precise coordinates:\n\
      - New York (10958) is generally northeast.\n- North Carolina (27705) is generally\
      \ southeast.\n\nGiven the nature of the question and the need for a precise\
      \ YES/NO without further geographic tools or exact coordinates for these zip\
