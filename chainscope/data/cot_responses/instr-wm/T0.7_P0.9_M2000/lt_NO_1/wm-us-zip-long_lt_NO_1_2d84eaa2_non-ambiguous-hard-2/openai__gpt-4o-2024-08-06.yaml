      1. **Locate 22936, VA**: Zip code 22936 is in Earlysville, Virginia. Virginia
      is on the eastern side of the United States.


      2. **Locate 70444, LA**: Zip code 70444 is in Independence, Louisiana. Louisiana
      is in the southeastern region of the United States.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: Generally, Virginia is located further east compared
      to Louisiana. Earlysville, VA (22936) has a longitude of approximately -78.5
      degrees, while Independence, LA (70444) has a longitude of approximately -90.5
      degrees.


      Since the longitude for Earlysville, VA is a smaller negative number than that
      of Independence, LA, this indicates that Earlysville is located further east.
