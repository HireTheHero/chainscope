      of both zip codes.


      1. **Locate 24073, VA**: The zip code 24073 corresponds to the area of Christiansburg

      3. **Comparative Position**: Virginia is located to the east of Mississippi.
      Since Christiansburg, VA (24073) is in Virginia and Como, MS (38611) is in Mississippi,
      we can analyze their relative positions.


      4. **Longitude Consideration**: Generally, when comparing locations in the U.S.,
      we can look at their longitudes. Virginia is east of Mississippi, meaning that
      locations in Virginia will typically have a higher longitude value (more to
      the east) than those in Mississippi.

      codes.


      1. **Locate 06250, CT**: This zip code is in the state of Connecticut. Connecticut
      is located in the northeastern part of the United States.


      2. **Locate 28403, NC**: This zip code is in the state of North Carolina. North
      Carolina is located in the southeastern part of the United States.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Connecticut is situated to the north of North
      Carolina. Since 06250, CT is in the northeastern U.S. and 28403, NC is in the
      southeastern U.S., we can visualize their locations on a map.


      4. **Determine relative positions**: Given that Connecticut is north of North
      Carolina, 06250 cannot be west of 28403. In fact, it would be more accurate
      to say that 06250 is northeast of 28403.

      1. **ZIP Code 27009**: This ZIP code is associated with the area of King, North
      Carolina. King is located in the northwestern part of North Carolina.


      2. **ZIP Code 72114**: This ZIP code is associated with the area of North Little

      - North Carolina (27009) is located to the east of the Mississippi River.

      - Arkansas (72114) is located to the west of the Mississippi River.


      Since King, NC (27009) is east of North Little Rock, AR (72114), we can conclude

      in the area of Fort Walton Beach, which is located in the northwest part of
      the state.


      2. **Identify the location of 55904, MN**: This zip code is in Minnesota, specifically
      in the city of Rochester, which is in the southeastern part of the state.


      3. **Assess the relative locations**: Florida is located in the southeastern
      part of the United States, while Minnesota is in the northern part of the Midwest.
      When comparing the longitudes, Florida (32579) is generally further south and
      west compared to Minnesota (55904).


      4. **Determine the west-east orientation**: Since 32579 is in Florida and 55904
      is in Minnesota, and considering that Florida is further south and west than
      Minnesota, we can conclude that 32579 is indeed west of 55904.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:


      YES'

      west of 49337, MI, we need to look at the geographical locations of both zip
      codes.


      1. **Locate 28607, NC**: This zip code corresponds to the area of Wilkesboro
      in North Carolina. North Carolina is situated in the southeastern region of
      the United States.


      2. **Locate 49337, MI**: This zip code corresponds to the area of Newaygo in
      Michigan. Michigan is located in the northern part of the Midwest region of
      the United States.


      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: North Carolina (28607) is to the
      south of Michigan (49337). Geographically, as you move from North Carolina to
      Michigan, you are moving northward and slightly westward.


      4. **Determine the west-east position**: Michigan is generally more to the northwest
      of North Carolina. When we specifically look at the coordinates, 28607 is approximately
      at a longitude of around -81.1, while 49337 is at approximately -85.7. Since
      -81.1 is greater than -85.7, this means that 28607, NC is actually located east
      of 49337, MI.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:

      west of ZIP code 97527, OR, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the location of ZIP code 91748**: ZIP code 91748 corresponds to
      the area of Rowland Heights in California, which is located in the southern
      part of the state.


      2. **Identify the location of ZIP code 97527**: ZIP code 97527 corresponds to
      the area of Medford in Oregon, which is located in the southern part of Oregon.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: California is located to the south
      of Oregon. The specific locations of Rowland Heights and Medford show that Rowland
      Heights is significantly further south than Medford.


      4. **West-East positioning**: Since both locations are in the western United
      States, we need to consider their longitudinal positions. California is generally
      west of Oregon, but within California, Rowland Heights is more towards the east
      compared to Medford, which is further west in Oregon.


      5. **Comparing the longitudinal coordinates**: Rowland Heights (91748) has a
      longitude of approximately -117.9 degrees, while Medford (97527) has a longitude
      of approximately -122.9 degrees. Therefore, Rowland Heights is actually east
      of Medford.


      Based on this reasoning, we conclude that 91748, CA is not located west of 97527,
      OR.


      The answer is NO.'

      is located west of the zip code 78380 in Texas, we can analyze the geographical
      locations of both zip codes.


      1. **Identify the Location of 70065**: The zip code 70065 corresponds to an
      area in Louisiana, specifically the city of LaPlace, which is located in the
      southeastern part of the state, near the Mississippi River and not far from
      New Orleans.


      2. **Identify the Location of 78380**: The zip code 78380 corresponds to an
      area in Texas, specifically the city of Robstown, which is located in the southern
      part of Texas, near the coast and southwest of Corpus Christi.


      3. **Determine Relative Position**: To ascertain if 70065 is west of 78380,
      we need to consider their positions on a map. Louisiana (70065) is situated
      to the east of Texas (78380). Since LaPlace, LA is east of Robstown, TX, this
      means that 70065 is not west of 78380.
