    14acc995-54da-47e9-8fcd-e357f33f5078: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Wallowa Lake:

      - Wallowa Lake is located in northeastern Oregon, in the Wallowa Mountains

      - It is in the northeastern part of Oregon, near the town of Joseph


      2. Next, locate Baldwin Hills:

      - Baldwin Hills is a small mountain range located in Los Angeles, California

      - It is in the southwestern part of California


      3. Compare their geographic locations:

      - Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon

      - Baldwin Hills is in southwestern California

      - This means Wallowa Lake is significantly north of Baldwin Hills


      4. Conclusion:

      Since Wallowa Lake is north of Baldwin Hills, the statement "Wallowa Lake is
      south of Baldwin Hills" is false.


      Answer: NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Anaconda Range in Montana

      - Anaconda Range is a mountain range located in southwestern Montana

      - It is near the town of Anaconda in Deer Lodge County


      2. Next, I''ll locate Bristol Lake in California

      - Bristol Lake is located in San Bernardino County, California

      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Montana is a northwestern state

      - California is a western state

      - Montana is north of California


      4. Specifically for Anaconda Range and Bristol Lake

      - Anaconda Range is significantly north of Bristol Lake

      - Bristol Lake is much further south than Anaconda Range


      5. Conclusion: The Anaconda Range is NOT located south of Bristol Lake.

      3. Montana is north of California.


      4. Therefore, Swiftcurrent Lake is located north of Ivanpah Lake.


      5. The question asks if Swiftcurrent Lake is south of Ivanpah Lake.


      6. Since Swiftcurrent Lake is actually north of Ivanpah Lake, the answer is
      NO.
