      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Wallowa Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      Step 2: Determine their general geographic positions.

      - Oregon is located north of California in the United States.

      - Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon, near the Oregon-Idaho border.

      - Baldwin Hills is in southern California, specifically in the Los Angeles area.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Since Oregon is entirely north of California, and Wallowa Lake is in Oregon
      while Baldwin Hills is in California, Wallowa Lake must be north of Baldwin
      Hills.

      - If Wallowa Lake is north of Baldwin Hills, then it cannot be south of Baldwin

      Rainy Lake is located in northern Minnesota, along the border between the United
      States and Canada.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Grand Lake o'' the Cherokees, OK is located.

      Grand Lake o'' the Cherokees is located in northeastern Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada, while Oklahoma is located
      in the south-central United States.

      Northern Minnesota (where Rainy Lake is) would be at a much higher latitude
      than northeastern Oklahoma (where Grand Lake o'' the Cherokees is).

      Since Rainy Lake is in northern Minnesota (near the Canadian border), and Grand
      Lake o'' the Cherokees is in northeastern Oklahoma (which is several states
      south of Minnesota), Rainy Lake must be north of Grand Lake o'' the Cherokees.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Lake Osakis is located in Minnesota (MN), which is in the northern part of
      the United States.

      - Lake of the Arbuckles is located in Oklahoma (OK), which is in the south-central
      part of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the north-south positioning of Minnesota and Oklahoma.

      - Minnesota borders Canada and is one of the northernmost states in the continental
      US.

      - Oklahoma is much further south, positioned above Texas and below Kansas.


      Step 3: Since Minnesota is significantly north of Oklahoma, any lake in Minnesota
      (including Lake Osakis) would be north of any lake in Oklahoma (including Lake
      of the Arbuckles).


      Therefore, Lake Osakis, MN is NOT located south of Lake of the Arbuckles, OK.
      It is located north of it.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - The Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer is located in northern Idaho and
      eastern Washington, spanning the border between these two states.

      - The San Jacinto Mountains are located in southern California.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Idaho is north of California on the map of the United States.

      - The Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, being in northern Idaho, is significantly
      north of any part of California.

      - The San Jacinto Mountains in southern California are therefore south of the
      Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer.


      Step 3: Answer the specific question about whether the aquifer is south of the
      mountains.

      - Since the aquifer is in northern Idaho/Washington and the mountains are in
      southern California, the aquifer is north of the mountains, not south.

      - Soap Lake is in Washington (WA)

      - Temescal Mountains are in California (CA)

      - Washington state is located north of California on the west coast of the United
      States

      - Washington is entirely north of California

      - Even the southernmost point of Washington is north of the northernmost point
      of California


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific locations.

      - Since Soap Lake is in Washington, and the Temescal Mountains are in California

      - Any location in Washington (including Soap Lake) must be north of any location
      in California (including the Temescal Mountains)


      NO, Soap Lake, WA is not located south of Temescal Mountains, CA. It is located

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Anaconda Range is a mountain range in Montana (MT), which is in the northwestern
      United States.

      - Bristol Lake is a dry lake in California (CA), which is on the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their states'' relative positions.

      - Montana is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada.

      - California is located on the west coast, extending from the Mexican border
      northward.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      United States.

      - Bristol Lake is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of Montana and California.

      - Montana is located near the Canadian border in the northern part of the contiguous
      United States.

      - California extends along the west coast, with its northern portion adjacent
      to Oregon and its southern portion bordering Mexico.


      Step 3: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Montana is entirely north of most of California.

      - Even the southernmost parts of Montana are generally north of the central
      and southern parts of California, where Bristol Lake is located (in the Mojave
      Desert region of Southern California).

      US.

      - Texas is along the Gulf of Mexico and extends much further south.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Minnesota is entirely north of Texas on a map of the United States.

      - Therefore, Lake Phalen in Minnesota must be north of Lake Conroe in Texas.


      Step 4: Determine if Lake Phalen is south of Lake Conroe.

      - Since Lake Phalen is in Minnesota (north) and Lake Conroe is in Texas (south),
      Lake Phalen cannot be south of Lake Conroe.

      - Mountain Lodge Lake is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Ohio and Florida within
      the United States.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Ohio is located much further north than Florida

      - Florida extends further south than any other continental US state


      Step 4: Since Indian Lake is in Ohio, and Mountain Lodge Lake is in Florida,
      Indian Lake must be north of Mountain Lodge Lake (not south).


      NO, Indian Lake (Ohio) is NOT located south of Mountain Lodge Lake, Florida.
      It is located north of it.'

      if Virgin Lake, WA is located south of San Emigdio Mountains, CA.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Virgin Lake is in Washington state (WA), which is in the northwestern United
      States.

      - San Emigdio Mountains are in California (CA), which is on the west coast of
      the United States, south of Washington.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Washington state is entirely north of California state.

      - Since Virgin Lake is in Washington, and the San Emigdio Mountains are in California,
      Virgin Lake must be north of the San Emigdio Mountains.


      Step 3: Determine the answer to the specific question.

      - The question asks if Virgin Lake, WA is located south of San Emigdio Mountains,

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Virgin Lake is in Washington state (WA)

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the western United States.

      - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest, in the far northwest
      corner of the contiguous United States.

      - California is located along the west coast, south of Washington state.


      Step 3: Determine their relative north-south positioning.

      - Since Washington state is entirely north of California, any location in Washington
      (including Virgin Lake) must be north of any location in California (including
      the San Emigdio Mountains).

      - Therefore, Virgin Lake, WA must be north of the San Emigdio Mountains, CA,

      - Washington is located directly north of California along the Pacific coast.

      - California is south of Washington.


      Step 3: Given their respective states'' positions:

      - Any location in Washington would be north of most locations in California.

      - The San Emigdio Mountains are in Southern California.

      - Virgin Lake in Washington would be significantly north of the San Emigdio

      - Since Virgin Lake is in Washington, and Washington is north of California,
      Virgin Lake must be north of any location in California.

      - The San Emigdio Mountains are in California, so Virgin Lake must be north
