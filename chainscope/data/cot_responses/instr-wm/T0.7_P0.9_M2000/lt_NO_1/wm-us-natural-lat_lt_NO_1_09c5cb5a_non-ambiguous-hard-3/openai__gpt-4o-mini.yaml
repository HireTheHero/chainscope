      2. **Locate Lake Maumelle, AR:** Lake Maumelle is located in Arkansas, which
      is in the southern part of the United States.


      3. **Determine the relative positions:** Minnesota is north of Arkansas. Therefore,
      Misquah Hills, being in Minnesota, is north of Lake Maumelle.


      Now, since we are asked if Misquah Hills is located south of Lake Maumelle,
      we can conclude:


      - Misquah Hills is NOT south of Lake Maumelle.

      locations of both places.


      1. **Identify the location of the Iowa River**: The Iowa River flows through
      the state of Iowa and generally runs from north to south, starting near the
      northern part of the state and moving downwards towards the confluence with
      the Mississippi River.


      2. **Identify the location of Matagorda Bay**: Matagorda Bay is located on the
      Texas Gulf Coast, to the southeast of the state. It is situated south of the
      city of Austin and southwest of Houston.


      3. **Compare their latitudes**: Iowa is situated in the northern part of the
      United States, while Texas is further south. Specifically, the Iowa River is
      at a latitude that is generally higher than that of Matagorda Bay, which is
      closer to the Gulf of Mexico.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since the Iowa River is located in Iowa (which is north of
      Texas) and Matagorda Bay is in Texas (which is at a lower latitude), the Iowa
      River is not south of Matagorda Bay.
