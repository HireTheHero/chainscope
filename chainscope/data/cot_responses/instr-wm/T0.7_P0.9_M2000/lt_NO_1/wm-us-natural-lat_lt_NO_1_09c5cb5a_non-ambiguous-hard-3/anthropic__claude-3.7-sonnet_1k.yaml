      positions of Wallowa Lake, Oregon and Baldwin Hills, California. To do this,
      I need to identify where both are located and then compare their north-south
      positions.


      First, let me think about Wallowa Lake, Oregon:

      - Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon, near the Idaho border

      - Oregon is generally north of California


      Now for Baldwin Hills, California:

      - Baldwin Hills is actually not a major mountain range but a neighborhood/area
      in Los Angeles

      - It''s in southern California, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area


      Since Oregon is north of California, and Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon,
      while Baldwin Hills is in southern California, Wallowa Lake would be north of
      Baldwin Hills, not south.


      So the answer is NO, Wallowa Lake, OR is not located south of Baldwin Hills,
      CA.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Wallowa Lake is located in northeastern Oregon, near the Oregon-Idaho border.

      - Baldwin Hills is in Los Angeles County in southern California.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Oregon is entirely north of California on a map.

      - Northeastern Oregon (where Wallowa Lake is) is significantly north of southern
      California (where Baldwin Hills is).


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Wallowa Lake is in Oregon, which is north of California, and Baldwin Hills
      is in southern California, Wallowa Lake must be north of Baldwin Hills, not
      south.

      in Wallowa County, which is in the far northeastern corner of Oregon.


      Baldwin Hills is in Los Angeles, California. It''s an urban area/small mountain

      Oregon is north of California on the west coast of the United States.

      - Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon

      - Baldwin Hills is in southwestern California (Los Angeles area)


      Since Oregon is entirely north of California, and Wallowa Lake is in Oregon
      while Baldwin Hills is in California, Wallowa Lake must be north of Baldwin

      Oregon-Idaho border.

      - Baldwin Hills is a neighborhood and small mountain range located in Los Angeles
      County in southern California.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Oregon is entirely north of California on the west coast of the United States.

      - Northeastern Oregon (where Wallowa Lake is) is significantly north of southern
      California (where Baldwin Hills is).


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Let me think about the states first:

      - Oregon (OR) is north of California (CA) in the United States

      - This means that, generally speaking, locations in Oregon tend to be north

      Step 2: Identify the specific locations.

      Wallowa Lake is in northeastern Oregon, in Wallowa County.

      Baldwin Hills is in Los Angeles County in southern California.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Oregon is entirely north of California, and Wallowa Lake is in Oregon

      1. Wallowa Lake is in Oregon (OR), which is a state that is generally north

      to determine the relative locations of Grinnell Lake in Montana (MT) and Hieroglyphic
      Mountains in Arizona (AZ).


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Montana (MT) is in the northwestern part of the United States, bordering Canada

      - Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern part of the United States, bordering Mexico


      In terms of latitude (north-south position):

      - Montana is generally north of Arizona

      - Since Grinnell Lake is in Montana, and Hieroglyphic Mountains are in Arizona,
      it''s likely that Grinnell Lake is north of the Hieroglyphic Mountains


      To be more specific:

      - Grinnell Lake is in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana

      - Hieroglyphic Mountains are in central Arizona, near Phoenix


      Given these locations, Grinnell Lake in Montana would be north of the Hieroglyphic
      Mountains in Arizona, not south of them.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      Montana (MT) is located in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.

      Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico.


      Step 2: Compare the general north-south positioning of these states.

      Montana is significantly north of Arizona. Montana is among the northernmost
      states in the contiguous US, while Arizona is among the southernmost.


      Step 3: Locate the specific features.

      Grinnell Lake is in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana.

      The Hieroglyphic Mountains are in central Arizona, northwest of Phoenix.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about their relative positions.

      Since Grinnell Lake is in Montana (a northern state) and the Hieroglyphic Mountains
      are in Arizona (a southern state), Grinnell Lake must be north of the Hieroglyphic
      Mountains, not south of them.

      to determine the relative locations of Grinnell Lake in Montana (MT) and the
      Hieroglyphic Mountains in Arizona (AZ).


      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Montana (MT) is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada

      - Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern part of the United States, bordering Mexico


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Montana is significantly north of Arizona

      - Therefore, places in Montana would generally be north of places in Arizona


      Specifically for Grinnell Lake, MT and Hieroglyphic Mountains, AZ:

      - Grinnell Lake is in Montana, so it would be in the northern part of the US

      - Hieroglyphic Mountains are in Arizona, so they would be in the southwestern
      part of the US


      Since Montana is north of Arizona, Grinnell Lake in Montana would be north of
      the Hieroglyphic Mountains in Arizona, not south of them.</think>I need to determine

      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      Montana (MT) is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico.


      Step 2: Compare the states'' latitudes.

      Montana is significantly north of Arizona on a map of the United States.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific locations.

      Grinnell Lake is in Montana, so it inherits Montana''s northern position.

      The Hieroglyphic Mountains are in Arizona, so they inherit Arizona''s southern
      position.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      Since Montana is north of Arizona, Grinnell Lake (MT) must be north of the Hieroglyphic
      Mountains (AZ), not south of them.

      First, let me identify the states:

      - MT is Montana, which is in the northern United States

      - AZ is Arizona, which is in the southwestern United States


      Generally speaking, Montana is north of Arizona in the United States. Montana
      shares a border with Canada to the north, while Arizona shares a border with
      Mexico to the south.


      So, if Grinnell Lake is in Montana (MT) and Hieroglyphic Mountains are in Arizona
      (AZ), then Grinnell Lake would be north of the Hieroglyphic Mountains, not south
      of them.


      The question asks if Grinnell Lake, MT is located south of Hieroglyphic Mountains,
      AZ. Based on the general geography of the United States, the answer would be
      NO, because Montana is north of Arizona.</think>To determine if Grinnell Lake,
      MT is located south of Hieroglyphic Mountains, AZ, I need to consider the geographic

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Montana (MT) is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada.

      Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern part of the United States, bordering
      Mexico.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      Montana is significantly north of Arizona in terms of latitude.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific locations.

      Since Grinnell Lake is in Montana and Hieroglyphic Mountains are in Arizona,
      Grinnell Lake must be north of the Hieroglyphic Mountains, not south.

      The United States is arranged with states in a roughly grid-like pattern. Montana
      is a northern state, bordering Canada. Arizona is a southwestern state, bordering
      Mexico.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Montana is in the northern part of the contiguous United States

      - Arizona is in the southern part of the contiguous United States


      Since Montana is north of Arizona, any location in Montana (including Grinnell
      Lake) would be north of any location in Arizona (including Hieroglyphic Mountains).


      Therefore, Grinnell Lake, MT is NOT south of Hieroglyphic Mountains, AZ. It
      is north of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two
      locations by considering their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are found.

      - Grinnell Lake is in Montana (MT)

      - Hieroglyphic Mountains are in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the north-south arrangement of these states in the US.

      - Montana is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, much further south than
      Montana


      Step 3: Make the relative position comparison.

      Since Montana is significantly north of Arizona in the United States, any location
      in Montana (including Grinnell Lake) would be north of any location in Arizona

      Therefore, the answer should be NO - Strait of Georgia, WA is NOT located south
      of Grizzly Bay, CA.


      However, I should double-check if these are the correct locations I''m thinking
      of. The Strait of Georgia is actually a body of water between Vancouver Island
      and the mainland of British Columbia, Canada. There''s a possibility it extends
      into Washington State, but it''s primarily in Canadian waters.


      Grizzly Bay is in California, in the northern part of the San Francisco Bay
      Delta region.


      Even with these more specific locations, the geographic fact remains: Washington
      state is north of California, so the Strait of Georgia (even the southernmost
      part if it extends into Washington) would be north of Grizzly Bay in California.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these places are located.

      - Strait of Georgia, WA is in Washington state

      - Grizzly Bay, CA is in California


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Washington and California.

      Washington state is located in the northwestern United States, while California
      is south of Washington along the west coast.


      Step 3: Apply this general geographic relationship to the specific locations.

      Since Washington is entirely north of California, any location in Washington
      (including the Strait of Georgia) would be north of any location in California
      (including Grizzly Bay).


      NO - Strait of Georgia, WA is not located south of Grizzly Bay, CA. It is located
      north of it.'

      Kettle River Range is a mountain range in Washington state (WA). Washington

      is specifically in Southern California, in Riverside County.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Washington state is entirely north of California. The Kettle River Range in
      Washington would therefore be north of any location in California, including

      Step 2: Consider the north-south relationship between Washington and California.

      - Washington state is positioned entirely north of California on the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - Since Kettle River Range is in Washington and Diamond Valley Lake is in California,
      the Kettle River Range must be north of Diamond Valley Lake.

      Generally speaking, Washington state is located north of California state. Washington
      borders Canada to the north and Oregon to the south, while California is below

      of Ford Lake and Lake Monroe


      To determine whether Ford Lake (Michigan) is located south of Lake Monroe (Florida),
      I need to consider the geographic positions of these two states.


      Michigan is located in the northern United States, in the Great Lakes region
      near the Canadian border. It''s one of the northernmost states in the contiguous
      US.


      Florida, on the other hand, is located at the southeastern tip of the United
      States and is the southernmost state in the continental US.


      Any body of water in Michigan (including Ford Lake) would be significantly north
      of any body of water in Florida (including Lake Monroe).


      Therefore, Ford Lake in Michigan is NOT south of Lake Monroe in Florida. It
      is north of it.

      the geographical locations of two lakes in the United States:

      1. Ford Lake in Michigan

      2. Lake Monroe in Florida


      Specifically, I need to determine if Ford Lake (MI) is located south of Lake
      Monroe (FL).


      First, let''s think about the general locations of Michigan and Florida in the
      United States:

      - Michigan is a northern state, located in the Great Lakes region

      - Florida is a southern state, located at the southeastern tip of the continental
      US


      In general, locations in Michigan would be north of locations in Florida. This
      is because Michigan is much further north in latitude compared to Florida.


      So logically, Ford Lake in Michigan would be located NORTH of Lake Monroe in
      Florida, not south of it.


      Therefore, the answer should be NO - Ford Lake (Michigan) is NOT located south
      of Lake Monroe (Florida).</think>To answer this question, I need to compare
      the geographical locations of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Determine the general locations of Michigan and Florida.

      Michigan is located in the northern United States, in the Great Lakes region.

      Florida is located in the southeastern United States, at the southern tip of
      the continental US.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Michigan is significantly further north than Florida. In fact, Florida is one
      of the southernmost states in the continental US, while Michigan is in the northern
      portion.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific lakes.

      Since Ford Lake is in Michigan, and Lake Monroe is in Florida, Ford Lake must
      be located north of Lake Monroe (not south of it).

      Michigan is in the northern United States, while Florida is in the southern
      United States. Generally, locations in Florida are south of locations in Michigan.


      Ford Lake is in Michigan, which is a northern state.

      Lake Monroe is in Florida, which is a southern state.


      Michigan''s southern border is roughly around 41.7 degrees north latitude.

      Florida''s northern border is roughly around 31 degrees north latitude, and
      extends south to about 24.5 degrees north latitude.


      Since Ford Lake is in Michigan, it must be north of Florida''s northern border.
      And since Lake Monroe is in Florida, it must be south of Michigan''s southern
      border.


      Therefore, Ford Lake (Michigan) must be north of Lake Monroe (Florida), not
      south of it.</think># Is Ford Lake (Michigan), MI located south of Lake Monroe
      (Florida), FL?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two lakes by considering
      their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these lakes are located.

      - Ford Lake is in Michigan (MI)

      - Lake Monroe is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Michigan is in the northern United States

      - Florida is in the southern United States, at the southeastern tip of the country


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Michigan is substantially north of Florida on the map of the United States

      - Any lake in Michigan would be north of any lake in Florida


      Since Ford Lake is in Michigan (a northern state) and Lake Monroe is in Florida
      (a southern state), Ford Lake cannot be south of Lake Monroe. Instead, Ford
      Lake is north of Lake Monroe.

      First, let''s think about the general locations of Michigan and Florida in the
      United States:

      - Michigan is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada

      - Florida is in the southernmost part of the continental United States


      In the US, when comparing locations north to south:

      - Places in Florida are generally much further south than places in Michigan

      - Michigan is much further north than Florida


      Given these general locations, it''s very unlikely that a lake in Michigan would
      be south of a lake in Florida. In fact, virtually any location in Michigan will
      be north of any location in Florida.


      So Ford Lake in Michigan is almost certainly north of Lake Monroe in Florida,
      not south.</think>I need to determine if Ford Lake (Michigan) is located south

      Step 1: Consider the geographic positions of Michigan and Florida within the
      United States.

      Michigan is located in the northern part of the United States, in the Great
      Lakes region near the Canadian border.

      Florida is located at the southeastern tip of the United States, forming a peninsula
      that extends south into the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 2: Compare the relative north-south positions of these states.

      Michigan is positioned much further north in the United States compared to Florida.

      Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental United States.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the lakes.

      Since Ford Lake is in Michigan (a northern state) and Lake Monroe is in Florida
      (a southern state), Ford Lake must be located north of Lake Monroe, not south
      of it.

      - Texas (TX) is in the southern part of the United States


      Wyoming is clearly north of Texas in terms of latitude.

      Wyoming is in the northwestern United States, while Texas is in the southern
      United States. Generally speaking, Wyoming is north of Texas.


      Step 2: More specifically, Wyoming borders Colorado to its south, and Colorado
      borders New Mexico to its south, and New Mexico borders Texas to its south and
      east. So Wyoming is quite a bit north of Texas.


      Step 3: The Bighorn Mountains are in northern Wyoming, which places them even

      Step 4: The Hueco Mountains are in western Texas, near El Paso on the border
      with New Mexico.


      Step 5: Given that Wyoming is entirely north of Texas, and the Bighorn Mountains
      are in Wyoming while the Hueco Mountains are in Texas, the Bighorn Mountains

      The Bighorn Mountains are in north-central Wyoming, extending from the Montana
      border southward.

      The Hueco Mountains are in far western Texas, near El Paso on the Texas-New

      Since Wyoming is entirely north of Texas on the map of the United States, and

      - Big Spirit Lake is in Iowa, specifically in the northern part of the state
      near the Minnesota border.

      - Carancahua Bay is in Texas, along the Gulf Coast in the southern part of the
      state.


      Step 3: Since Iowa is north of Texas, and Big Spirit Lake is in northern Iowa
      while Carancahua Bay is in southern Texas, Big Spirit Lake must be north of
      Carancahua Bay.

      To be more specific:

      - Big Spirit Lake is in northern Iowa, near the Minnesota border

      - Carancahua Bay appears to be on the Gulf Coast of Texas


      This confirms that Big Spirit Lake in Iowa is definitely north of Carancahua

      - Texas is positioned much farther south, extending down to the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Make the specific comparison.

      - Big Spirit Lake is in northern Iowa, near the Minnesota border.

      - Carancahua Bay is on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern part of the

      Minnesota is significantly north of Arkansas on the map of the United States.
      Since Saganaga Lake is in Minnesota and White Oak Lake State Park is in Arkansas,
      the lake must be north of the park, not south.

      1. The question asks whether Lake Pend Oreille in Idaho is located south of
      Coyote Lake in San Bernardino County, California.


      2. To answer this, I need to determine the locations of both lakes and compare
      their latitudes.


      3. Lake Pend Oreille is located in northern Idaho, near the town of Sandpoint.
      Idaho is a state in the northwestern United States.


      4. Coyote Lake in San Bernardino County is located in southern California. San
      Bernardino County is in the southeastern part of California.


      5. Geographically, Idaho is north of California. The northern part of Idaho
      (where Lake Pend Oreille is) would be even further north compared to southern
      California (where Coyote Lake is).


      6. Therefore, Lake Pend Oreille in Idaho is north of Coyote Lake in California,
      not south of it.


      The answer is NO.</think>I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two lakes by considering their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho.

      Lake Pend Oreille is located in the northern Idaho panhandle, in the northern
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Coyote Lake in San Bernardino County, California.

      Coyote Lake is in San Bernardino County, which is in southern California.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of these locations.

      Idaho is entirely north of California. Northern Idaho (where Lake Pend Oreille
      is) is significantly further north than southern California (where Coyote Lake
      is located in San Bernardino County).


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Lake Pend Oreille is in northern Idaho, and Coyote Lake is in southern
      California, Lake Pend Oreille is north of Coyote Lake, not south of it.

      To determine if West Okoboji Lake in Iowa is south of Aransas Bay in Texas,
      I need to consider the geographic locations of these two states and bodies of
      water.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - West Okoboji Lake is in Iowa (IA)

      - Aransas Bay is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - Iowa is located in the northern central United States

      - Texas is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Iowa is significantly further north than Texas

      - All of Iowa is north of all of Texas on a map of the United States


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific water bodies.

      - Since West Okoboji Lake is in Iowa, and Aransas Bay is in Texas, the lake
      must be north of the bay

      - Tulare Lake is located in California''s Central Valley.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Washington and California.

      - Washington state is positioned in the far northwestern United States.

      - California is located south of Washington along the Pacific coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Any location in Washington state (including Pine Lake) would be north of locations
      in California (including Tulare Lake).

      - Therefore, Pine Lake in Washington cannot be south of Tulare Lake in California.


      NO, Pine Lake (Washington) is not located south of Tulare Lake, CA.'

      (South Dakota) is located south of Medina Lake (Texas).


      Step 1: Recall the general geographic positions of South Dakota and Texas.

      South Dakota is a northern state in the central US, while Texas is in the southern
      US.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      South Dakota is clearly north of Texas. States generally line up (from north
      to south) as: North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas.


      Step 3: Consider the specific lakes.

      Lake Thompson is in South Dakota (SD), which means it''s in the northern state.

      Medina Lake is in Texas (TX), which means it''s in the southern state.


      Since South Dakota is north of Texas, and these lakes are in their respective
      states, Lake Thompson (in SD) must be north of Medina Lake (in TX), not south
      of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare the geographic locations

      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      South Dakota is located in the northern part of the central United States, while
      Texas is in the southern part of the country. Specifically, South Dakota is
      many states north of Texas.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions of the lakes.

      Since South Dakota is significantly north of Texas, any lake in South Dakota
      (including Lake Thompson) would be north of any lake in Texas (including Medina
      Lake).


      NO

      Since Lake Thompson is in South Dakota, and Medina Lake is in Texas, it''s very
      likely that Lake Thompson is NORTH of Medina Lake, not south of it.


      To be completely certain, I''d need the exact coordinates of both lakes, but

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - South Dakota is a northern state, located in the upper midwest region of the
      US

      - Texas is a southern state, located along the Gulf Coast region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - South Dakota is significantly north of Texas on the map

      - Any lake in South Dakota would generally be north of any lake in Texas


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about Lake Thompson''s position relative to Medina
      Lake.

      - Since Lake Thompson is in South Dakota (a northern state) and Medina Lake
      is in Texas (a southern state), Lake Thompson must be north of Medina Lake,

      First, let''s establish the locations:

      1. Walloon Lake is in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern United States

      2. Jackson Lake is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United States


      Generally speaking, Michigan is significantly north of Georgia in the United
      States. Michigan borders Canada and is one of the northernmost states in the
      contiguous US, while Georgia is near the Gulf of Mexico in the South.


      So Walloon Lake in Michigan would be north of Jackson Lake in Georgia, not south
      of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO - Walloon Lake, MI is NOT located south of Jackson
      Lake, GA. It is located north of it.</think>To answer whether Walloon Lake,
      MI is located south of Jackson Lake, GA, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of Michigan and Georgia.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the northern United States, bordering the Great
      Lakes region

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - Michigan is substantially north of Georgia in the United States

      - Michigan is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, while Georgia
      is one of the southern states


      Step 3: Since the lakes are in their respective states, Walloon Lake in Michigan
      would be positioned north of Jackson Lake in Georgia, not south of it.


      NO - Walloon Lake, MI is not located south of Jackson Lake, GA.'

      to determine the locations of both Walloon Lake, MI and Jackson Lake, GA, specifically
      their latitudes, and then compare them.


      Walloon Lake is in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern United States.

      Jackson Lake is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Generally speaking, Michigan is located much further north than Georgia. Michigan
      borders Canada and the Great Lakes, while Georgia is close to Florida in the
      Deep South.


      So geographically:

      - Walloon Lake, MI should be at a higher latitude (more northern)

      - Jackson Lake, GA should be at a lower latitude (more southern)


      If Walloon Lake is located south of Jackson Lake, it would mean Walloon Lake
      has a lower latitude than Jackson Lake. Based on the general geography of the
      US, this seems unlikely because Michigan is north of Georgia.


      Therefore, Walloon Lake, MI is likely NOT located south of Jackson Lake, GA,
      but rather north of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of
      these two lakes by comparing their latitudes.

      Michigan is in the northern United States, bordering the Great Lakes and Canada.

      Georgia is in the southeastern United States, much further south.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions.

      States in the northern US (like Michigan) have higher latitudes than states
      in the southern US (like Georgia).

      Walloon Lake is in Michigan, so it would be at a higher latitude.

      Jackson Lake is in Georgia, so it would be at a lower latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Since Walloon Lake (MI) is in a northern state and Jackson Lake (GA) is in a
      southern state, Walloon Lake is located north of Jackson Lake, not south.

      - Buena Vista Lake is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Washington and California.

      - Washington is located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States

      - California is located along the west coast, south of Washington

      - Washington is entirely north of California


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the lakes.

      Since Washington state is entirely north of California state, any lake in Washington
      (including Rattlesnake Lake) must be north of any lake in California (including
      Buena Vista Lake).


      NO, Rattlesnake Lake, WA is not located south of Buena Vista Lake, CA. It is

      4) California is positioned on the west coast, south of Washington

      5) All of Washington state is geographically north of California


      Since Rattlesnake Lake is in Washington and Buena Vista Lake is in California,

      south of Water Ranch Lake in Arizona.


      To answer this, I need to think about the north-south positions of Montana and
      Arizona within the United States.


      Montana is a northern state, bordering Canada, while Arizona is a southwestern
      state bordering Mexico. In terms of latitude:

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Arizona is one of the southernmost states in the contiguous US


      Therefore, Montana (where the Sapphire Mountains are located) is definitely
      north of Arizona (where Water Ranch Lake is located).


      Since the Sapphire Mountains are in Montana, and Montana is north of Arizona,
      the Sapphire Mountains cannot be south of Water Ranch Lake in Arizona. They
      must be north of it.</think>To determine if Sapphire Mountains, MT is located
      south of Water Ranch Lake, AZ, I need to consider the geographic positions of
      Montana and Arizona.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Montana is located in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada to the
      north.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico to the
      south.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      Montana is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.

      Arizona is much further south, being one of the southernmost states in the contiguous
      US.


      Step 3: Make the specific comparison.

      Since the Sapphire Mountains are in Montana, and Montana is entirely north of
      Arizona, the Sapphire Mountains must be north of Water Ranch Lake in Arizona.


      NO, Sapphire Mountains, MT is not located south of Water Ranch Lake, AZ. It
      is located north of it.'

      Minnesota (MN) is a northern state, bordering Canada. It''s located in the upper
      Midwest region of the United States.


      Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central United States, much further south
      than Minnesota.


      Given the general geography of the United States:

      - Minnesota is significantly north of Oklahoma

      - Therefore, Red Lake in Minnesota would be north of Lake Overholser in Oklahoma,
      not south of it


      Since Red Lake is in Minnesota (a northern state) and Lake Overholser is in
      Oklahoma (a more southern state), Red Lake would be located NORTH of Lake Overholser,
      not south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of Red Lake in Minnesota and Lake Overholser in Oklahoma.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' locations.

      Minnesota is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada. It''s
      one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.


      Step 2: Consider Oklahoma''s location.

      Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States, considerably south of
      Minnesota.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Since Red Lake is in Minnesota (a northern state) and Lake Overholser is in
      Oklahoma (a more southern state), Red Lake must be north of Lake Overholser.


      Step 4: Answer the specific question.

      The question asks if Red Lake is south of Lake Overholser. Based on my reasoning,
      this is not correct.

      Let me think about the general geography of the western United States:


      Idaho is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It''s
      located north of Nevada and Utah, west of Montana and Wyoming, east of Washington
      and Oregon, and south of Canada.


      California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering Oregon to the

      partially in eastern Washington), near the city of Spokane.

      - The San Jacinto Mountains are in southern California, in Riverside County,
      not far from Palm Springs.


      Given that Idaho is north of California, and specifically that the Spokane area

      To answer whether Echo Lake is south of Topock Gorge, I need to compare their
      latitudes:

      - If Echo Lake is at a lower latitude than Topock Gorge, then the answer is
      YES

      - If Echo Lake is at a higher latitude than Topock Gorge, then the answer is
      NO

      - Montana is a northern state bordering Canada

      - Arizona is a southwestern state bordering Mexico


      In terms of latitude:

      - Montana is generally much further north than Arizona

      First, I''ll think about their states:

      - Anaconda Range is in Montana (MT), which is in the northern part of the United
      States

      - Bristol Lake is in California (CA), which is on the west coast


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Montana borders Canada and is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous
      US

      - California extends quite far north and south along the west coast


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Montana is generally north of California

      - Therefore, locations in Montana would typically be north of locations in California


      The Anaconda Range is a mountain range in Montana, which would be positioned
      in the northern US.

      Bristol Lake in California would be positioned further south.


      So, Anaconda Range, MT would be NORTH of Bristol Lake, CA, not south of it.</think>I

      - Bristol Lake is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Montana is in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - California is on the west coast, extending from the middle to the southern
      portion of the country


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Montana is entirely north of California in terms of latitude

      - Any location in Montana would be north of most locations in California


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison.

      - The Anaconda Range, being in Montana, is located in the northern United States

      - Bristol Lake in California is further south


      Therefore, the Anaconda Range is NOT south of Bristol Lake - it''s north of

      Given the relative positions of these states, Bridger Range (in Montana) would
      be north of Rainbow Lake (in Arizona).</think># Is Bridger Range, MT located
      south of Rainbow Lake (Arizona), AZ?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Bridger Range is in Montana (MT)

      - Rainbow Lake is in Arizona (AZ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Montana is located in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico


      ## Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Arizona is much further south than Montana


      ## Conclusion

      Since Bridger Range is in Montana, and Montana is significantly north of Arizona
      (where Rainbow Lake is located), Bridger Range cannot be south of Rainbow Lake.

      Canada.

      Ivanpah Lake is in California (CA). California is on the west coast and extends
      quite far south.


      Now I need to be more specific about their locations:


      Swiftcurrent Lake is located in Glacier National Park in the northwestern part

      US.


      Ivanpah Lake is a dry lake bed located in the Mojave Desert in southeastern
      California, near the Nevada and California border. This is in the southern part
      of California.


      Given that Montana is entirely north of California, and Swiftcurrent Lake is

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is in Montana (MT), which is a northern state bordering
      Canada.

      - Ivanpah Lake is in California (CA), which is a western state extending from
      the middle to the southern part of the US West Coast.


      Step 2: Consider more specific locations.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is located in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana,
      very close to the Canadian border.

      - Ivanpah Lake is a dry lake bed in the Mojave Desert of southeastern California,
      near the Nevada border.

      - Montana is entirely north of California on the map.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake, being in northern Montana, is much further north than Ivanpah
      Lake, which is in southern California.


      NO. Swiftcurrent Lake, MT is not located south of Ivanpah Lake, CA; it is located

      (MT) and Ivanpah Lake in California (CA). Specifically, I need to determine
      if Swiftcurrent Lake is located south of Ivanpah Lake.


      First, let me think about the general geographic locations:


      - Montana (MT) is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - California (CA) is a western coastal state that extends quite far south


      Generally speaking, Montana is north of California. But I need to be precise
      about these specific lakes.


      Swiftcurrent Lake is located in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana,
      very close to the Canadian border. This puts it in the far northern part of
      the continental US.


      Ivanpah Lake is a dry lake in the Mojave Desert of California, near the Nevada-California
      border. It''s in the southeastern part of California, which is much further
      south than Montana.


      Since Montana is north of California, and Swiftcurrent Lake is in northern Montana
      while Ivanpah Lake is in southern California, Swiftcurrent Lake must be north
      of Ivanpah Lake, not south of it.</think>I''ll solve this step by step by considering
      the geographic locations of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of the states.

      - Montana (MT) is a northern state that borders Canada.

      - California (CA) is a western coastal state that extends much further south.


      Step 2: Locate the specific lakes within their states.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is located in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana,
      very close to the Canadian border.

      - Ivanpah Lake is a dry lake bed located in the Mojave Desert in southeastern
      California, near the Nevada border.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Montana as a whole is significantly north of California.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is in the northern part of Montana, making it extremely
      far north.

      - Ivanpah Lake is in the southern part of California, making it relatively far
      south.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Swiftcurrent Lake is in northern Montana and Ivanpah Lake is in southern
      California, Swiftcurrent Lake must be north of Ivanpah Lake, not south of it.

      In the United States, states are arranged such that:

      - Montana is in the northern part of the country

      - California is on the west coast and extends from the middle to the southern
      part of the country


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Montana is entirely north of California

      - Montana (MT) is in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - California (CA) is on the west coast, extending from roughly the middle to
      the southern part of the country


      ## Step 2: Determine state positions

      - Montana is entirely north of California in terms of latitude


      ## Step 3: Locate the specific lakes

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana

      - Ivanpah Lake is in the Mojave Desert in southern California near the Nevada
      border


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      Since Montana is entirely north of California, and Swiftcurrent Lake is in Montana
      while Ivanpah Lake is in southern California, Swiftcurrent Lake must be north
      of Ivanpah Lake, not south.

      - Ivanpah Lake is in California (CA), which is in the western United States.


      Step 2: I need to compare their north-south positions.

      - Montana is generally north of California. Montana borders Canada to the north,
      while California is further south, bordering Mexico.

      - Within these states, I need to consider the specific locations of these lakes.


      Step 3: More specifically:

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is in Glacier National Park in the northwestern part of
      Montana, very close to the Canadian border. This puts it quite far north in
      the continental US.

      - Ivanpah Lake is in the Mojave Desert in southeastern California, near the

      Step 1: Let me consider where Michigan and Florida are located in the United
      States.

      Michigan is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada and
      the Great Lakes.

      Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States, at the southern tip
      of the continental US.


      Step 2: In general, locations in Michigan are north of locations in Florida.
      This is because Michigan is in the northern US while Florida is at the southern
      end of the country.


      Step 3: Therefore, Union Lake in Michigan would be located north of Lake Tohopekaliga
      in Florida.


      Step 4: To answer the specific question "Is Union Lake (Michigan), MI located
      south of Lake Tohopekaliga, FL?" - the answer would be NO, because Union Lake
      in Michigan is north of Lake Tohopekaliga in Florida, not south of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two lakes by looking at their
      locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these lakes are located. Union Lake is in
      Michigan (MI), which is in the northern United States. Lake Tohopekaliga is
      in Florida (FL), which is in the southernmost part of the contiguous United
      States.


      Step 2: Michigan is significantly north of Florida on a map of the United States.
      Michigan borders Canada and the Great Lakes in the northern part of the country,
      while Florida extends into the Gulf of Mexico and is the southernmost state
      in the continental US.


      Step 3: Since Union Lake is in Michigan, and Michigan is entirely north of Florida,
      Union Lake must be north of any location in Florida, including Lake Tohopekaliga.


      Step 4: Therefore, Union Lake (Michigan) is NOT south of Lake Tohopekaliga (Florida)
      - it''s north of it.

      - Lake Tohopekaliga is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Michigan is generally located much further north than Florida.

      - Michigan is in the northern part of the continental US, bordering Canada.

      - Florida is the southernmost state in the continental US.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      Since Michigan is significantly north of Florida, Union Lake in Michigan would

      Step 1: Determine the general locations of Michigan and Florida.

      Michigan is in the northern United States, in the Great Lakes region near the
      Canadian border.

      Florida is in the southeastern United States and is the southernmost state in
      the continental US.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      Michigan is much further north than Florida. All locations in Michigan (including
      Union Lake) would be north of locations in Florida (including Lake Tohopekaliga).


      Step 3: Make the conclusion.

      Since Michigan is entirely north of Florida on a map of the United States, Union
      Lake in Michigan must be north of Lake Tohopekaliga in Florida, not south of
      it.

      Matagorda Bay is a bay on the Texas Gulf Coast, in the southern part of Texas,
      which borders the Gulf of Mexico.


      Since Iowa is north of Texas, and Matagorda Bay is in southern Texas, the Iowa
      River must be north of Matagorda Bay, not south of it.

      - Iowa River is in the state of Iowa, which is located in the Midwest region
      of the United States.

      - Matagorda Bay is located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern part
      of the state.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Iowa and Texas.

      - Iowa is a northern state, positioned in the middle of the continental US.

      - Texas is much further south, bordering Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Iowa is entirely north of Texas on a map of the United States.

      - Matagorda Bay, being on the Gulf Coast of Texas, is in the southern portion
      of Texas.


      Therefore, the Iowa River must be north of Matagorda Bay, not south of it.

      Iowa River is in Iowa (IA), which is a state in the northern United States,
      roughly in the midwest region. Iowa is north of Texas.


      Matagorda Bay is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States, bordering

      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Iowa is entirely north of Texas, and the Iowa River runs through Iowa,
      the Iowa River must be north of Matagorda Bay.

      - The question asks if Iowa River is south of Matagorda Bay, which is the opposite

      latitudes of both lakes.


      Minnesota (MN) is a northern state, located in the upper Midwest of the United
      States, bordering Canada. Texas (TX) is a southern state, located along the
      Gulf of Mexico and bordering Mexico.


      Generally speaking, Minnesota is much further north than Texas. Lake Phalen
      is in Minnesota, so it would be further north. Lake Conroe is in Texas, so it
      would be further south.


      So Lake Phalen (in Minnesota) would be NORTH of Lake Conroe (in Texas), not
      south of it.


      The answer should be NO - Lake Phalen is not south of Lake Conroe. It''s the
      opposite - Lake Phalen is north of Lake Conroe.</think># Is Lake Phalen, MN
      located south of Lake Conroe, TX?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1. Lake Phalen is located in Minnesota (MN), which is a northern state in the
      upper Midwest region of the United States.


      2. Lake Conroe is located in Texas (TX), which is a southern state bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico.


      3. Geographically, Minnesota is positioned much further north than Texas within
      the United States.


      4. Therefore, any lake in Minnesota (including Lake Phalen) would be located
      north of a lake in Texas (including Lake Conroe).


      5. Since Lake Phalen is north of Lake Conroe (not south), the statement is incorrect.

      which is in the northern United States.


      Lake Miccosukee, FL would be a lake in Florida. Florida is in the southeastern
      United States, much further south than Michigan.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of Michigan and Florida.

      - Michigan is in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States, extending south toward the Caribbean.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Michigan, including the Straits of Mackinac, is significantly further north
      than any part of Florida.

      - Florida, including Lake Miccosukee, lies entirely south of Michigan.

      The Straits of Mackinac is a narrow waterway in Michigan that connects two of
      the Great Lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. It''s located in the northern
      part of Michigan, between Michigan''s Upper and Lower Peninsulas.


      Lake Miccosukee is a lake in Florida. Given the "FL" abbreviation, this confirms
      it''s in Florida.


      Now I need to determine which is further south:


      Michigan is in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      Florida is in the southeastern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      Florida is significantly south of Michigan. In fact, Florida is one of the southernmost

      First, let me think about where these locations are:


      1. Straits of Mackinac is located in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern
      United States. Specifically, the Straits of Mackinac connect Lake Michigan and
      Lake Huron, and are situated in the northern part of Michigan.


      2. Lake Miccosukee is located in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern
      United States, significantly south of Michigan.


      Since Florida is a southern state and Michigan is a northern state, it follows
      that Lake Miccosukee in Florida would be south of the Straits of Mackinac in

      - The Straits of Mackinac are located in Michigan (MI), in the northern United
      States. They connect Lakes Michigan and Huron.

      - Lake Miccosukee is located in Florida (FL), in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Michigan is a northern state, located near the Canadian border.

      - Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental US.

      - Therefore, any location in Michigan would be north of any location in Florida.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - Since the Straits of Mackinac are in Michigan (north) and Lake Miccosukee
      is in Florida (south), the Straits of Mackinac must be north of Lake Miccosukee,
      not south of it.

      - Mountain Lodge Lake is in Florida (southern US)

      - Indian Lake is in Ohio (OH)

      - Mountain Lodge Lake is in Florida (FL)

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Florida is significantly farther south than Ohio

      - Any location in Ohio would be north of most or all locations in Florida


      Since Indian Lake is in Ohio (a northern state) and Mountain Lodge Lake is in
      Florida (a southern state), Indian Lake must be north of Mountain Lodge Lake,
      not south of it.

      1. Indian Lake in Ohio

      2. Mountain Lodge Lake in Florida


      Specifically, I need to determine if Indian Lake in Ohio is located south of
      Mountain Lodge Lake in Florida.


      Let me think about this geographically:

      - Ohio is a northern state, located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Florida is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico


      Generally, Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental US,

      So, for Indian Lake (in Ohio) to be south of Mountain Lodge Lake (in Florida),
      would be unlikely given the general geographic positions of these states.


      Unless there''s some unusual geographic quirk where Mountain Lodge Lake is at
      the extreme northern tip of Florida and Indian Lake is at the extreme southern
      tip of Ohio, the answer would be NO - Indian Lake in Ohio is NOT south of Mountain

      - Ohio is located in the Midwestern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States, and is one of the southernmost
      states in the continental US


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positioning.

      - Ohio is entirely north of Florida on the map

      - Therefore, any lake in Ohio would be north of any lake in Florida


      NO, Indian Lake (Ohio) is NOT located south of Mountain Lodge Lake, Florida.

      relative geographical positions of two places in the US:

      1. Big Sandy Lake, Minnesota (MN)

      2. Sans Bois Mountains, Oklahoma (OK)


      I need to determine which one is further north.


      Minnesota is a northern state, bordering Canada, while Oklahoma is much further
      south, not far from Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.


      In the US, states generally follow a pattern where northern states are further
      north than southern states. Minnesota is definitely north of Oklahoma.


      So if Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota, and the Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma,
      then Big Sandy Lake would be north of the Sans Bois Mountains, not south of
      them.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare the geographic locations
      of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify the locations by state.

      - Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south arrangement of these states.

      - Minnesota is a northern state, located near the Canadian border

      - Oklahoma is much further south, positioned in the southern central United
      States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Minnesota is significantly north of Oklahoma on any US map. Since Big Sandy
      Lake is in Minnesota and the Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma, the lake must
      be north of the mountains, not south.
