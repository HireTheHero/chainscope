      **Step 1: Identify the location of the Sapphire Mountains, MT**

      - The Sapphire Mountains are located in western Montana.

      - They run primarily in a north-south direction along the border of Ravalli
      and Granite counties.

      - This places them in the northern United States.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Water Ranch Lake, AZ**

      - Water Ranch Lake is located in Gilbert, Arizona.

      - Gilbert is in the southeastern part of the Phoenix metropolitan area.

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States and is much farther south than
      Montana.


      **Step 3: Compare the latitudes**

      - Montana is generally much farther north than Arizona.

      - Therefore, the Sapphire Mountains in Montana are located north of Water Ranch
