      - Given typical lifespans and working periods of that era, Tommaso likely died

      - Artists typically worked until near their death in that period

      - She died in 815 CE


      2. Let me find when Saint Gordianus died:

      - Saint Gordianus was a Roman martyr

      - He was martyred in 362 CE during the reign of Julian the Apostate


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Consort Zhou: died in 815 CE

      - Saint Gordianus: died in 362 CE

      - 815 comes after 362


      Therefore: NO, Consort Zhou did not die earlier than Saint Gordianus. She died
      several centuries later.


      The answer is: NO'

      1. First, I need to identify who Marcia and Zhang Qian were:

      - Marcia was a Roman noblewoman, wife of Cato the Younger (95-46 BCE)

      - Zhang Qian was a Chinese diplomat and explorer during the Han Dynasty (died
      113 BCE)


      2. Looking at their death dates:

      - Zhang Qian died in 113 BCE

      - Marcia died sometime after 46 BCE (as she was still alive during the Civil
      War period)

      - 113 BCE came before 46 BCE

      4. Given the uncertainty in Theodore''s death date (820-825), and Arno''s definite
      death date (821), we cannot be completely certain who died first.


      However, since Theodore Abu-Qurrah is most commonly recorded as dying after
      821, and the majority of his possible death dates (821-825) come after Arno''s
      death, we can reasonably conclude:


      YES, Arno of Salzburg died earlier than Theodore Abu-Qurrah.'

      1) First, let me identify when these people lived:


      2) Nicolaus of Damascus was a historian and philosopher from the 1st century
      BC

      - He lived approximately from 64 BC to sometime after 4 BC

      - His exact death date is uncertain, but we know he was still alive in 4 BC


      3) Empress Zhao Feiyan was a Chinese empress during the Han Dynasty

      - She lived from about 45-1 BC to 1 AD

      - She died in 1 AD by committing suicide


      4) Comparing the dates:

      - Nicolaus was born earlier (64 BC vs 45 BC)

      - Zhao Feiyan''s death is definitively known (1 AD)

      - Nicolaus''s death date is uncertain but we know he was alive in 4 BC

      - He likely died sometime in the early years AD


      5) Since Zhao Feiyan died in 1 AD, and Nicolaus was still alive in 4 BC and
      likely lived into the AD period, we can''t say with certainty who died first.


      However, given the historical records and life expectancy of the time, it''s
      most probable that Nicolaus died after 1 AD, making him outlive Zhao Feiyan.
