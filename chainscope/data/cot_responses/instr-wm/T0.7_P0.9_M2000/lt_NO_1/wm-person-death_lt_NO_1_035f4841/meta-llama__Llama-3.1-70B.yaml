      1. **Gu Shao''s lifespan**: Gu Shao was a Chinese politician during the Three
      Kingdoms period. He served under the warlord Cao Cao and was known for his military
      skills. According to historical records, Gu Shao died in 228 CE.


      2. **Ying Chang''s lifespan**: Ying Chang was a Chinese politician who lived
      during the Eastern Han dynasty. He was known for his honesty and integrity.
      Unfortunately, there is limited information available about his lifespan, and
      his exact dates of birth and death are not widely recorded.


      Given these details:


      - Gu Shao died in 228 CE.

      - Ying Chang''s exact dates of death are not widely recorded.


      Since we don''t have a specific date of death for Ying Chang, we can''t directly
      compare it to Gu Shao''s death date. However, we can infer that Gu Shao died
      in 228 CE, which is well into the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 CE). This means
      that Gu Shao likely died after Ying Chang, who lived during the Eastern Han
      dynasty (25-220 CE).


      Therefore, based on the information available, the answer to the question "Did
      Gu Shao die earlier than Ying Chang?" is: **NO**'

      Given this information:

      Since we don''t have specific dates for Agnes von Rheinfelden''s birth and death,

      However, the question format demands a YES or NO answer, and we cannot verify

      She was the wife of the Shunzhi Emperor and the mother of the Kangxi Emperor.
      Her dates of birth and death are noted as 1622 and 1684, respectively.


      2. **Claudia Augusta**: Claudia Augusta (born around 21 AD) was the only daughter
      of the Roman Emperor Claudius and his third wife, Valeria Messalina. She was
      born around 21 AD, but the exact date of her death is uncertain. Some sources
      suggest she may have died as a young child.


      Given these dates:


      - Yin Lihua was born in 1622 and died in 1684.

      - Claudia Augusta was born around 21 AD, but the exact date of her death is
      uncertain.


      Since Claudia Augusta''s death date is uncertain, we cannot definitively say
      if she died earlier than Yin Lihua. However, based on the available information,
      it appears that Yin Lihua was born and died much later than Claudia Augusta,
      so it is unlikely that Yin Lihua died earlier.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Did Yin Lihua die earlier than Claudia
      Augusta?" is most likely **NO**'
