      - Aldhelm was an Anglo-Saxon monk, scholar, and Bishop of Sherborne who lived
      from c. 639-709 AD

      - Sisinnius was a Pope who served very briefly in 708 AD

      3. Analyze their death dates:

      - Aldhelm died in 709 AD

      - Sisinnius died in 708 AD


      4. Compare their death years:

      - 709 is later than 708

      - She lived from around 1103 to 1159

      - Her death year was 1159

      3. Given the information I have:

      - Abu''l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi lived from 1116-1201 CE

      - For William Devereux, I lack definitive biographical information


      4. Without knowing William Devereux''s dates, I cannot conclusively determine
      whether Abu''l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi died earlier or later.


      Therefore, I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question due to insufficient
      information about William Devereux.'
    a9c3b5b9-0c9e-43df-82aa-1227dc2f0554: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Abu''l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi was a medieval Islamic scholar and historian who
      lived from 1116 to 1201 CE.


      2. William Devereux was an English historical figure, but I do not immediately
      know his precise lifespan.


      3. However, since Abu''l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi lived from 1116 to 1201 CE, which
      is in the 12th century, and this predates most known European historical figures
      outside of the classical period, it is very likely he died earlier.


      4. Without specific information about William Devereux''s lifespan, I cannot
      be 100% certain, but the probability is extremely high that Abu''l-Faraj ibn
      al-Jawzi died earlier.


      5. To be absolutely certain, I would need to confirm William Devereux''s dates
      of birth and death.


      Given the available information and reasoning, my answer is:


      YES'

      1. First, I''ll find the lifespan of Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Razi:

      - Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Razi was a medieval Islamic scholar

      - He lived from around 864 to 934 CE


      2. Next, I''ll find the lifespan of Louis IV of France:

      - Louis IV (also known as Louis d''Outremer) lived from 920 to 954 CE


      3. Comparing their lifespans:

      - Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Razi: 864-934 CE

      5. For Adelheid van Tours, I do not have a precise record of her exact dates
      of birth and death.


      6. Without knowing her specific lifespan, I cannot definitively state whether
      she died before or after Rudolf of Fulda.


      7. Given the lack of definitive information, I cannot confidently answer this
      question.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. Since I cannot be certain,
      I will default to a response that acknowledges my lack of complete information.


      NO (with the caveat that this is based on insufficient information to be fully
