      Wichita County is in the north-central part of Texas, while Foard County is
      adjacent to or near Wichita County. Specifically, Foard County is located to
      the southwest of Wichita County.


      Step 4: Compare their north-south positioning.

      If Foard County is southwest of Wichita County, then Foard County is south of
      Wichita County (and Wichita County is north of Foard County).


      NO. Wichita County, TX is NOT located south of Foard County, TX. Rather, Wichita
      County is located north of Foard County.'

      Step 1: I need to determine the relative positions of Wichita County and Foard
      County in Texas.


      Step 2: Wichita County is located in north Texas, along the Texas-Oklahoma border.
      It contains the city of Wichita Falls.


      Step 3: Foard County is also in north Texas, but I need to determine its position
      relative to Wichita County.


      Step 4: Foard County is located directly west of Wichita County in the Texas
      Panhandle region. They don''t have a north-south relationship - they have an
      east-west relationship, with Wichita County to the east and Foard County to
      the west.


      Step 5: Since Foard County is west of Wichita County (not north or south), Wichita
      County is not south of Foard County.


      NO'

      2) Wichita County is located in north Texas, along the Oklahoma border.


      3) Foard County is also located in north Texas.


      4) Looking at their relative positions: Wichita County is positioned in the
      north-central part of Texas, while Foard County is directly to the west of Wichita
      County.


      5) Since they are adjacent counties with Foard County to the west of Wichita
      County, neither is directly north or south of the other. They are positioned
      east-west relative to each other.

      Step 2: Foard County is also in north Texas, in the general vicinity of Wichita
      County.


      Step 3: To determine their relative positions, I need to identify which county
      is further north or south.


      Step 4: Wichita County is positioned along the Red River at the Oklahoma border,
      while Foard County is located just to the southwest of Wichita County.


      Step 5: This means Wichita County is north of Foard County, not south of it.


      NO, Wichita County, TX is not located south of Foard County, TX. It is actually

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Grainger County is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Dunklin County is in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Tennessee is located south of Missouri in the United States.

      - Missouri borders Tennessee''s northern neighbor, Kentucky.


      Step 3: More specifically, Tennessee is in the southeastern United States, while
      Missouri is in the midwestern/central United States.


      Step 4: Looking at their relative positions:

      - Dunklin County is in the southeastern corner of Missouri (in what''s known
      as the "bootheel" of Missouri)

      - Grainger County is in northeastern Tennessee


      Step 5: Even though Dunklin County is in the southernmost part of Missouri,
      and Grainger County is in the northern part of Tennessee, Tennessee as a whole
      lies south of Missouri.


      Therefore, Grainger County, TN is located south of Dunklin County, MO.

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the US

      - Tennessee is directly west of North Carolina

      - In terms of north-south positioning, Tennessee is generally north of North
      Carolina


      Step 3: Check the specific counties'' positions.

      - Wake County is in central/eastern North Carolina (where Raleigh is located)

      - Sevier County is in eastern Tennessee (near the Great Smoky Mountains)

      - Eastern Tennessee borders western North Carolina


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Sevier County, TN is in the mountainous region of eastern Tennessee

      - Wake County, NC is further south in the central part of North Carolina

      - Geographically, Sevier County is indeed north of Wake County


      Therefore, YES, Wake County, NC is located south of Sevier County, TN.'

      Step 1: I need to determine the relative positions of Brown County and Outagamie
      County in Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Brown County, WI is located in northeastern Wisconsin, with its county
      seat being Green Bay.


      Step 3: Outagamie County, WI is also located in northeastern Wisconsin, with
      its county seat being Appleton.


      Step 4: Looking at their geographic positions, Outagamie County is directly
      west of Brown County.


      Step 5: In terms of north-south positioning, Outagamie County is actually slightly
      north of parts of Brown County, but also extends to similar latitudes. They
      are roughly at the same latitude, with Outagamie being slightly more to the
      west rather than being clearly north or south of Brown County.


      Step 6: Since Brown County is not positioned south of Outagamie County (they
      are more side-by-side with Brown to the east), the answer is NO.

      Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Brown County contains the city of Green Bay and is located in northeastern
      Wisconsin.


      Step 3: Outagamie County contains Appleton and is also in northeastern Wisconsin.


      Step 4: Looking at their relative positions, Outagamie County is directly west
      and slightly south of Brown County.


      Step 5: This means Brown County is positioned to the northeast of Outagamie
      County.


      Step 6: If Brown County is northeast of Outagamie County, then Brown County
      cannot be south of Outagamie County.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties in Wisconsin.

      - Brown County, WI is located in northeastern Wisconsin, containing the city
      of Green Bay.

      - Outagamie County, WI is also in northeastern Wisconsin, containing the city
      of Appleton.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions to each other.

      - Brown County is positioned to the northeast of Outagamie County.

      - Outagamie County borders Brown County on its western side.

      - This means Brown County is east of Outagamie County, not south of it.


      Step 3: Confirm the north-south relationship.

      - The counties share a border that runs roughly east-west.

      - Brown County is slightly north and east of Outagamie County, not south of

      - Outagamie County borders Brown County on its western side.

      - When looking at a map of Wisconsin, Outagamie is to the west of Brown, not
      north or south.


      Step 3: To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.

      - These counties are primarily adjacent east-west to each other.

      - They are at roughly the same latitude, with Brown County perhaps slightly
      north of Outagamie County, but primarily they are east-west neighbors.


      Based on this analysis, Brown County is not south of Outagamie County - they
      are at similar latitudes with Brown County being east of Outagamie County.

      - However, Brown County is slightly more to the north on average compared to
      Outagamie County.


      Step 3: Determine if Brown County is south of Outagamie County.

      - Maury County is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Muskogee County is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern United States

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Tennessee is generally east of Oklahoma

      - Tennessee is roughly at the same latitude as Oklahoma, with Tennessee being
      slightly more southern on average


      Step 4: Look more specifically at these counties.

      - Maury County is in central Tennessee

      - Muskogee County is in eastern Oklahoma

      Bosque County is located in central Texas, somewhat to the northwest of Waco.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Coke County, TX is located.

      Coke County is located in west-central Texas, to the west of San Angelo.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Bosque County is in central Texas, while Coke County is in west-central Texas.
      Looking at their relative positions, Bosque County is located in the eastern
      part of central Texas, while Coke County is further west but also further north.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Bosque County is actually located southeast of Coke County. Since we''re specifically
      asking about north-south positioning, Bosque County is south of Coke County.

      - Bosque County is located in central Texas, to the northwest of Waco.

      - Coke County is located in west-central Texas, to the east of Midland.


      Step 2: Let me consider their positions in terms of latitude.

      - Bosque County is in central Texas, roughly between Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin.

      - Coke County is further west and somewhat north of Bosque County.


      Step 3: On a Texas map, Bosque County is positioned more to the east and south
      compared to Coke County, which is more to the northwest of Bosque County.


      Step 4: Checking their relative north-south positioning specifically, Bosque
      County is generally located south and east of Coke County.


      NO - Bosque County, TX is not located south of Coke County, TX. It''s actually
      located east and slightly south of Coke County.


      Wait, I need to verify this. Looking more carefully at their exact positions,
      Bosque County is indeed east of Coke County, but it''s actually slightly southeast.
      This means Bosque County is south of Coke County.


      YES - Bosque County, TX is located south of Coke County, TX.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Bronx County is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located in the
      southeastern part of New York State.

      - Ashland County is located in north-central Ohio.


      Step 2: Consider their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - New York City (including the Bronx) is located roughly around 40.7-40.9 degrees
      north latitude.

      - Ashland County, Ohio is located roughly around 40.8-41.0 degrees north latitude.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Both counties are at similar latitudes, but the Bronx is slightly more to
      the east coast.

      - In terms of north-south positioning, they are very close, with Ashland County
      being slightly more northerly on average.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on general geographic knowledge.

      - Ohio is generally west of New York, but for "south of" we need to compare
      latitudes.

      - The Bronx is generally slightly south of Ashland County''s latitude.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Volusia County is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.

      - Karnes County is in Texas (TX), which is in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - Florida extends southward into the Gulf of Mexico and is generally south of
      most of the continental US.

      - Texas is also a southern state, but its position relative to Florida needs
      to be compared.


      Step 3: More specific geographic knowledge.

      - Volusia County is in east-central Florida, on the Atlantic coast.

      - Karnes County is in south Texas, but not at the southernmost part of Texas.


      Step 4: Comparing latitudes.

      - Florida''s peninsula extends much further south than Texas.

      - However, Volusia County is not in southern Florida but in the central part
      of the state.

      Step 1: Let me recall the geographic layout of counties in southern Minnesota.

      Steele County is located in southern Minnesota.

      Waseca County is also located in southern Minnesota.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      Steele County is located directly east of Waseca County. They share a border,
      with Steele County on the east side and Waseca County on the west side.


      Step 3: Consider north-south positioning.

      Since they are adjacent counties that share an east-west border, they are approximately
      at the same latitude. Steele County is not significantly north or south of Waseca
      County - they are side by side on an east-west axis.


      NO. Steele County, MN is not located south of Waseca County, MN. It is located
      to the east of Waseca County.'

      Let me think about the relative locations of these Florida counties:


      1) Highlands County is located in the central part of Florida, in the interior
      of the state.


      2) Sarasota County is located on the western coast of Florida along the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      3) In terms of north-south positioning, Highlands County is positioned roughly
      in the middle of the Florida peninsula.


      4) Sarasota County is also in the middle section of Florida''s Gulf Coast.


      5) Specifically, Highlands County is south of Orlando and northeast of Fort
      Myers.


      6) Sarasota County is south of Tampa Bay and north of Fort Myers.


      7) When comparing their latitudes, Highlands County is indeed south of Sarasota
      County, though they are not directly adjacent to each other (Charlotte County
      and DeSoto County separate them).


      Based on this geographic analysis, the answer is:

      - Sarasota County is in southwest Florida, roughly in the middle of Florida''s
      western coastline.

      - Highlands County is in south-central Florida, east of the coastal counties.


      Step 3: Comparing their latitudes:

      - Highlands County is positioned roughly at the same latitude as Sarasota County,
      but extends further south.

      - Highlands County borders Glades County and Okeechobee County to its south,
      which are at a similar latitude to the southern portion of Sarasota County.


      Step 4: Looking at their relative positions on the map:

      - While parts of both counties are at similar latitudes, Highlands County extends
      further south than Sarasota County.

      - Highlands County is positioned southeast of Sarasota County, not directly
      south.


      Based on this analysis, Highlands County is positioned to the southeast of Sarasota
      County and extends further south than Sarasota County.


      NO. Highlands County is not directly south of Sarasota County, but rather southeast,

      Gilmer County is located in the northern part of Georgia, in the Appalachian
      Mountains region.

      Georgia is in the southeastern United States.

      Northern Georgia has a latitude of approximately 34-35 degrees North.


      Step 2: Let me identify the approximate latitude of Santa Barbara County, California.

      Santa Barbara County is located on the central coast of California.

      California is on the west coast of the United States.

      Santa Barbara County has a latitude of approximately 34-35 degrees North.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Both counties are at roughly similar latitudes (around 34-35 degrees North).

      However, Gilmer County in northern Georgia is slightly further north than Santa
      Barbara County in California.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Gilmer County is slightly further north, it is NOT south of Santa Barbara
      County.


      NO'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Jerome County is in Idaho (ID)

      - Klamath County is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Oregon is located directly north of Idaho (Oregon borders Idaho''s northern
      boundary)

      - Therefore, any county in Idaho would be south of any county in Oregon, assuming
      they''re roughly in the same east-west position


      Step 3: Check if these counties are roughly in the same east-west position.

      - Jerome County is in south-central Idaho

      - Klamath County is in southern Oregon

      - While they may not be directly north-south of each other, the question only
      asks about the north-south relationship


      Step 4: Make the determination based on state boundaries.

      - Since Jerome County is in Idaho, and Idaho is south of Oregon, Jerome County
      must be south of Klamath County


      NO

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Ionia County is in Michigan (MI)

      - Cheshire County is in New Hampshire (NH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region

      - New Hampshire is in the Northeast region (New England)


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New Hampshire is located in the far northeastern part of the US

      - Michigan is located more centrally and to the west

      - In general, New Hampshire is farther north than Michigan


      Step 4: Be more specific about these particular counties.

      - Ionia County, MI is in the central part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula

      - Cheshire County, NH is in the southwestern part of New Hampshire

      - Even though Cheshire is in southern NH, New Hampshire as a whole is significantly
      north of Michigan''s position


      Step 5: Make the north-south comparison.

      - New Hampshire, including its southern counties like Cheshire, is generally
      north of Michigan''s position

      - Therefore, Ionia County, MI would be south of Cheshire County, NH


      YES, Ionia County, MI is located south of Cheshire County, NH.'
