      - Crenshaw County is in south Alabama

      - Natchitoches Parish is in central Louisiana


      2) To compare their latitudes:

      - Crenshaw County, AL is in the southern third of Alabama

      3) However, since Crenshaw County is in southern Alabama, and Natchitoches Parish
      is in central Louisiana, I need to consider their specific positions:

      - Crenshaw County, AL is further north than the Louisiana coastline

      - Natchitoches Parish, being in central Louisiana, is well north of the Gulf
      Coast

      1) First, let me locate both counties:

      - Preston County is in northern West Virginia

      - Baltimore County is in northern Maryland


      2) Let me consider their relative positions:

      - Maryland is north of West Virginia

      - Baltimore County is in the northern part of Maryland

      - Preston County is in the northern part of West Virginia

      - Even though both are in northern parts of their states, Maryland itself is

    c7c45de9-f40f-4c01-bbb5-344d2b0e6811: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Wake County, NC is in central North Carolina. It contains the state capital
      Raleigh.


      2) Sevier County, TN is in eastern Tennessee, in the Great Smoky Mountains region.


      3) Tennessee and North Carolina share a border, with Tennessee being directly
      north of North Carolina.


      4) Sevier County is right along the TN/NC border in Tennessee.


      5) Wake County is well into central NC, quite a distance from the TN border.


      6) Since Tennessee is north of North Carolina, and Wake County is deeper into
      NC while Sevier County is at the TN/NC border, Wake County must be south of
      Sevier County.


      Answer: YES'

      3. For counties near the MT-ND border:

      - Wibaux County, MT is directly on the border with North Dakota

      - Golden Valley County, ND is not on the border with Montana - it''s actually
      in the interior of North Dakota


      4. Most importantly for this question:

      - Wibaux County, MT is roughly at the same latitude as McKenzie County, ND

      - Golden Valley County, ND is south of McKenzie County, ND

      - Therefore, Wibaux County, MT is actually north of Golden Valley County, ND


      NO'
    8cc3e6a6-3d48-4e08-b3d7-15be179dd87d: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me identify the states:

      - Wibaux County is in Montana (MT)

      - Golden Valley County is in North Dakota (ND)


      2. Consider the states'' positions:

      - Montana and North Dakota share a border

      - Montana is directly west of North Dakota


      3. Since these counties are in different states that are side-by-side (not one
      above the other), neither county can be directly south or north of the other.


      4. Therefore, Wibaux County, MT cannot be south of Golden Valley County, ND
      - they have an east-west relationship rather than a north-south one.


      Answer: NO'
    b9179acb-d861-4a4d-9e92-0f7ccea5669c: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate both counties:

      - Wibaux County is in eastern Montana

      - Golden Valley County is in western North Dakota


      2. Since one county is in Montana and one is in North Dakota, I need to consider
      their relative positions:

      - Montana and North Dakota share a border

      - The border between them runs east-west


      3. Since the Montana-North Dakota border runs east-west:

      - All Montana counties are directly west of North Dakota counties

      - They are at roughly the same latitude


      4. Therefore, Wibaux County, MT is not south of Golden Valley County, ND - they
      are at approximately the same latitude, with Wibaux being to the west.


      Answer: NO'

      3. When two states share a border running north-south, their counties'' relative
      north-south positions can be compared


      4. Looking at the location of these specific counties:

      - Wibaux County, MT is right on the Montana-North Dakota border

      - Golden Valley County, ND is NOT on the Montana-North Dakota border, but is
      further south in western North Dakota


      5. Therefore, Wibaux County, MT is actually NORTH of Golden Valley County, ND

    c6ce23ac-6836-42fd-b45e-4a41f15394a1: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to determine if these counties are near each other

      - Wibaux County, MT is in eastern Montana

      - Golden Valley County, ND is in western North Dakota


      2. Next, I need to consider their relative positions

      - Montana and North Dakota share a border

      - That border runs east-west (it''s a straight line of latitude)

      - Montana is always west of North Dakota, not north or south


      3. Therefore:

      - Since these counties are in different states separated by an east-west border

      - And Montana is not north or south of North Dakota

      - The question of one being "south of" the other doesn''t apply in this case


      NO'
