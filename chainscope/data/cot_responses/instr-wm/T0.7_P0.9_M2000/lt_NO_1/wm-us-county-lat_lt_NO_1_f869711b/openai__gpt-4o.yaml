    320c46a8-070e-4f68-852d-e32de6ba5d88: 'To determine whether Pearl River County,
      MS is located south of Evangeline Parish, LA, let''s consider the geographic
      locations of both:


      1. **Pearl River County, MS**: Located in the southeastern part of Mississippi,
      it borders the state of Louisiana. It is relatively close to the Gulf of Mexico
      and the southern border of Mississippi.


      2. **Evangeline Parish, LA**: This parish is located in the central part of
      Louisiana, not far from the state''s southern border but more inland compared
      to the coastal areas.


      Now, comparing the latitudes:


      - Pearl River County is situated in the southern part of Mississippi, which
      is generally south of the central regions of Louisiana.

      - Evangeline Parish is centrally located within Louisiana, likely placing it
      north of the more coastal Pearl River County.


      Based on this reasoning, Pearl River County, MS is indeed located south of Evangeline
      Parish, LA.
