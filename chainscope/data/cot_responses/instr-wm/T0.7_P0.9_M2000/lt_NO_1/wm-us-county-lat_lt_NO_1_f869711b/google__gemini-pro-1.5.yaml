      3. Cape May County is in New Jersey, which is an eastern state.

      4. Western states are generally south of eastern states only if the eastern
      state is very far north (e.g. Maine). New Jersey is not that far north.

      5. Thus, Carson City is likely west, and possibly a little north, of Cape May
      County, but not south.
