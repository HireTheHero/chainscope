      \ please verify the current population numbers from a reliable source. However,\
      \ if the data is as of the last available Census (2020) or a recent estimate,\

      \ a population of approximately 28,000.\n- Le Sueur County, MN had a population\
      \ of approximately 28,000 as well.\n\nGiven these approximate figures, the populations\
      \ are quite similar, but you would need the exact current figures to determine\
      \ if one is definitively less populous than the other.\n\nPlease verify the\
      \ current population numbers to make an accurate comparison. If the current\
      \ data shows Dunklin County, MO has a lower population than Le Sueur County,\
