      Now, I need to compare the populations of St. James Parish, LA (20,192), and
      Hempstead County, AR (20,865).


      Since 20,192 is less than 20,865, St. James Parish, LA, is indeed less populous
      than Hempstead County, AR.

      the population of Oglala Lakota County, SD, with that of Glacier County, MT.
      Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Identify the counties**: Oglala Lakota County is located in the state of
      South Dakota (SD), and Glacier County is located in the state of Montana (MT).


      2. **Find population data**: To compare the populations, we would typically
      look for the most recent data from the United States Census Bureau or other
      reliable sources. However, for the purpose of this exercise, let''s proceed
      with general knowledge and assume we have access to such data.


      3. **Compare the populations**: As of my last update, Oglala Lakota County,
      SD, has a relatively small population, reflecting its rural and reservation
      nature. Glacier County, MT, also has a small population but is known for its
      significant Native American reservation and the Glacier National Park, which
      might influence its population size and density.


      4. **Specific population figures**: Without the most current or exact figures,
      we can still reason based on general trends. Oglala Lakota County is known to
      be one of the least populous counties in the United States, given its remote
      location and the challenges faced by its residents. Glacier County, while also
      sparsely populated, might have a slightly larger population due to its national
      park and the economic activities surrounding it.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general trend and without the exact figures, it''s
      reasonable to infer that Oglala Lakota County, SD, could indeed be less populous
      than Glacier County, MT, based on the economic and geographical factors influencing
      population sizes. However, this conclusion is drawn without the most current
      data, which could alter the assessment.


      Based on the reasoning and considering the need for specific, up-to-date population
      figures to make an accurate comparison, the answer to whether Oglala Lakota
      County, SD, is less populous than Glacier County, MT, would generally lean towards
      "yes" given the context provided, but remember, this is a reasoned guess without
      current statistics.
