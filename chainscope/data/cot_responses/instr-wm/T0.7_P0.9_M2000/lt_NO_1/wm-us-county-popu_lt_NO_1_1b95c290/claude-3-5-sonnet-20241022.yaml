      1) First, let me recall the population of Salt Lake County, UT

      * Salt Lake County is the most populous county in Utah

      * It contains Salt Lake City and its suburbs

      * Population is approximately 1.2 million people


      2) Now, let me recall Contra Costa County, CA

      * It''s in the San Francisco Bay Area

      * Contains cities like Richmond, Concord, and Walnut Creek

      * Population is approximately 1.1-1.2 million people


      3) Looking up more precise numbers:

      * Salt Lake County: 1,185,238 (2020 Census)

      * Contra Costa County: 1,165,927 (2020 Census)


      4) Comparing the numbers:

      * 1,185,238 > 1,165,927

      * Salt Lake County is slightly MORE populous


      Therefore...

      1. First, I need to recall the populations of these counties:

      - Cerro Gordo County, Iowa has approximately 43,000 people

      - Highland County, Ohio has approximately 43,000-44,000 people


      2. Looking at these numbers:

      - They are very close in population

      - Highland County has slightly more residents


      3. Since Highland County has slightly more people than Cerro Gordo County:

      - Cerro Gordo County must be less populous than Highland County


      Therefore:


      YES (Cerro Gordo County, IA is less populous than Highland County, OH)'
