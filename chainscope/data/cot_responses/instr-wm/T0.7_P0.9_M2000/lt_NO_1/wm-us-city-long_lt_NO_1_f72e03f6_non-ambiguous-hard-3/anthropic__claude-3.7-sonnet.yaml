      - La Vergne is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic arrangement of these states.

      - Tennessee is located west of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is on the east coast, while Tennessee is inland


      Step 3: Since these cities are in their respective states, we can determine

      - Mole Lake is in Wisconsin (WI), which is east of Minnesota (MN).

      - Maple Lake is in Minnesota (MN), which is west of Wisconsin (WI).


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Minnesota is directly west of Wisconsin.

      - Wisconsin''s western border touches Minnesota''s eastern border.


      Step 3: Given the general positions of these states, a city in Wisconsin (Mole
      Lake) would typically be east of a city in Minnesota (Maple Lake), not west.


      Step 4: While there could be exceptions if Mole Lake were in far western Wisconsin
      and Maple Lake were in far eastern Minnesota, this would be unusual given the
      standard geography.


      NO, Mole Lake, WI is not located west of Maple Lake, MN. It is located east
      of Maple Lake, MN.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both cities.

      - Mickleton is in New Jersey (NJ), which is on the eastern seaboard of the United
      States.

      - Chillicothe is in Ohio (OH), which is in the Midwest region of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship of these states.

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States.

      - Ohio is inland, west of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but east of states like
      Indiana and Illinois.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - States on the East Coast (like New Jersey) are generally east of Midwestern
      states (like Ohio).

      - Moving from east to west in the US, you would typically go from New Jersey
      toward Ohio, not the other way around.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Step 1: I need to determine the geographical locations of both cities.

      - Pickensville, AL is in Alabama, which is in the southeastern United States.

      - Hurst, TX is in Texas, which is in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Looking at their relative positions:

      - Alabama is located to the east of Texas on the US map.

      - Pickensville is in western Alabama, near the Mississippi border.

      - Hurst is in northeastern Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.


      Step 3: Even though Pickensville is in western Alabama, the entire state of
      Alabama lies east of Texas. So any city in Alabama, including Pickensville,
      would be east of cities in Texas, including Hurst.


      NO, Pickensville, AL is not located west of Hurst, TX. It is located east of
      Hurst, TX.'

      - Mount Vista is in the western part of Washington, close to the Pacific coast.

      - Umapine is in the eastern part of Oregon, much further inland.

      - Locations closer to the Pacific coast are more western than inland locations.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on longitude.

      - Mount Vista is significantly further west than Umapine.

      - Umapine is in the inland, eastern region of the Pacific Northwest.


      NO, Umapine, OR is not located west of Mount Vista, WA. It is located east of

      First, I need to determine the locations of both places:

      - Umapine, Oregon is in northeastern Oregon, near the Washington state border

      - Mount Vista, Washington is in southwestern Washington, near the Oregon border
      and close to Vancouver, WA


      To determine which is further west, I need to compare their relative positions:

      - Umapine, OR is located in the northeastern part of Oregon

      - Mount Vista, WA is near Vancouver, WA, which is on the western side of Washington
      state along the Columbia River


      Geographically, southwestern Washington (where Mount Vista is) is west of northeastern
      Oregon (where Umapine is). The Pacific coast is to the west, and as you move
      inland, you go eastward. Mount Vista is closer to the Pacific coast than Umapine.


      Therefore, Umapine, OR is NOT west of Mount Vista, WA. Instead, Umapine is east
      of Mount Vista.
