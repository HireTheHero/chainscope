      4. **Consider East-West position within states:** While Colorado is west of
      Utah, Parker is on the *eastern* side of Colorado, and Murray is relatively
      central in Utah. This could potentially mean Murray is actually further west.

      5. **More precise comparison:**  It''s necessary to imagine a north-south line
      running through Murray, UT.  Is Parker, CO to the west of that line?  Due to
      Colorado''s location entirely west of Utah, it is almost certain that Parker,
      CO *is* west of such a line.

      west, we need to consider their longitudes. Higher longitude values are further
      west. Colorado is further west than Utah.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since Colorado is west of Utah, and Parker and Murray are
      relatively close to their respective major cities, Parker, CO is west of Murray,
      UT.
