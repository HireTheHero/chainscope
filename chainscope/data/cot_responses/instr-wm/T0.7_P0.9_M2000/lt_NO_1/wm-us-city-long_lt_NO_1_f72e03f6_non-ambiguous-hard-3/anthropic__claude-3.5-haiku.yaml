      3. Looking at a US map, Pennsylvania is on the east coast, while Illinois is
      in the midwest.


      4. Pennsylvania is east of Illinois.


      5. Therefore, a city in eastern Pennsylvania (Orwigsburg) would be east of a
      city in western Illinois (Coal Valley).


      6. So Orwigsburg is NOT west of Coal Valley.
