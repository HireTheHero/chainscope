    e895f43e-2051-42b6-a8dc-5c3d0a8e18de: 'Okay, here''s the step-by-step thinking:


      1.  **Identify the first movie:** "Bal Bramhachari" directed by Prakash Mehra.

      2.  **Research the first movie''s director and existence:** A search for "Bal
      Bramhachari Prakash Mehra" reveals that Prakash Mehra did *not* direct a film
      titled "Bal Bramhachari." There is a notable Hindi film titled "Bal Brahmachari"
      released in 1996, but it was directed by Swaroop Kumar. Prakash Mehra is famous
      for films like *Zanjeer*, *Muqaddar Ka Sikandar*, *Laawaris*, etc.

      3.  **Conclusion for the first movie:** Since Prakash Mehra did not direct a
      film called "Bal Bramhachari," this specific film "Prakash Mehra''s Bal Bramhachari"
      effectively does not exist as described, and therefore has no runtime under
      his direction.

      4.  **Identify the second movie:** "Speaking Parts" directed by Atom Egoyan.

      5.  **Research the second movie''s runtime:** Atom Egoyan''s "Speaking Parts"
      (1989) has a runtime of 92 minutes.

      6.  **Compare:** Since "Prakash Mehra''s Bal Bramhachari" as specified does
      not exist and thus has no runtime, it cannot have a runtime shorter than "Speaking
      Parts." The premise of the question (that "Prakash Mehra''s Bal Bramhachari"
      *has* a runtime to compare) is flawed. Therefore, the statement that it has
      a *shorter* runtime is false.
