      I need to determine whether a given number is a prime number. A prime number
      is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So,
      if I can find any divisors other than 1 and the number itself, then it''s not
      a prime number.


      ### Step 2: Basic Requirements

      For a number to be prime, it must be greater than 1. If it''s 1 or less, it
      can''t be prime.


      ### Step 3: Possible Approach

      I can try to divide the number by all numbers less than itself. If any of them
      divide without a remainder, the number isn''t prime.


      ### Step 4: Optimizing the Approach

      Dividing by all numbers is inefficient. I can stop checking once I''ve reached
      the square root of the number. Beyond the square root, any factors would have
      been found already.


      ### Step 5: Implementing the Approach

      Let''s say I have a number, say 17. I''ll check divisibility by 2, 3, 4, etc.
      up to the square root of 17 (which is about 4.12). Since 17 isn''t divisible
      by 2, 3, or 4, it''s a prime number.


      ### Step 6: Conclusion

      If a number has no divisors other than 1 and itself, it''s a prime number.

      ### Step-by-step reasoning:

      - Alan & Naomi is a feature-length film with a runtime of 95 minutes.

      - Mexican Boarders is a short film with a runtime of 6 minutes.

      - Comparing the two, 95 minutes (Alan & Naomi) is significantly longer than
      6 minutes (Mexican Boarders).


      ### Final Answer: **NO**'

      \ both movies:\n\n1. **Rustlers' Rhapsody**\n   - **Director:** Hugh Wilson\n\
      \   - **Release Year:** 1985\n   - **Genre:** Western comedy\n\n2. **Supertwink**\n\

      \ law of motion\n- **Friction**\n- **Motion**\n\n### Solution\n\n**Step 1: Determine\
      \ the acceleration of the system**\n\nThe system consists of two masses, which\
      \ are connected by a rope over a pulley. The masses are 7 kg and 11 kg. The\
      \ system is moving under the influence of gravity, with the heavier mass pulling\
      \ the lighter one.\n\nThe force of gravity acting on each mass is given by Newton's\
      \ second law, F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.\n\
      \nThe force of gravity on the 11 kg mass is:\nF1 = 11 kg * 9.8 m/s\xB2 = 107.8\
      \ N\n\nThe force of gravity on the 7 kg mass is:\nF2 = 7 kg * 9.8 m/s = 68.6\
      \ N\n\nThe net force acting on the system is:\nFnet = F1 - F2 = 107.8 N - 68.6\
      \ N = 39.2 N\n\nThe total mass of the system is:\nm = 11 kg + 7 kg = 18 kg\n\
      \nThe acceleration of the system is:\na = Fnet / m = 39.2 N / 18 kg = 2.17 m/s\xB2\
      \n\n**Step 2: Determine the tension in the rope**\n\nThe tension in the rope\
      \ is the same throughout the system, so it can be calculated using the acceleration\
      \ found in Step 1.\n\nThe force acting on the 11 kg mass is:\nF1 = T - F1 =\
      \ T - 107.8 N\n\nThe force acting on the 7 kg mass is:\nF2 = T - F2 = T - 68.6\
      \ N\n\nThe net force on the system is:\nFnet = F1 - F2 = T - 107.8 N - T + 68.6\
      \ N = -39.2 N\n\nThe acceleration of the system is:\na = Fnet / m = -39.2 N\
      \ / 18 kg = -2.17 m/s\xB2\n\nThis implies that the system is moving in the opposite\
      \ direction of the applied force, which is not possible. Hence, there is an\
      \ error in the calculation.\n\n**Step 3: Correct the calculation for the tension\
      \ in the rope**\n\nThe net force on the system is:\nFnet = F1 - F2 = 107.8 N\
      \ - 68.6 N = 39.2 N\n\nThe acceleration of the system is:\na = Fnet / m = 39.2\
      \ N / 18 kg = 2.17 m/s\xB2\n\nThe net force acting on the 11 kg mass is:\nFnet\
      \ = T - F1 = T - 107.8 N\n\nThe net force acting on the 7 kg mass is:\nFnet\
      \ = T - F2 = T - 68.6 N\n\nThe system is moving in the same direction of the\
      \ applied force, so the tension is:\nT = F1 + a = 107.8 N + 2.17 m/s\xB2 = 110.97\
      \ N\n\nThe tension in the rope is 110.97 N.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the friction\

      \ on the 7 kg mass is 15.19 N.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the total friction acting\

      ### Step 1: Identify the runtimes of both movies.

      - **Lo Wei''s *Spiritual Kung Fu***: This is a 1978 Hong Kong martial arts film
      directed by Lo Wei. Its runtime is approximately **95 minutes**.

      - **Friz Freleng''s *Cats and Bruises***: This is a 1954 animated short film
      directed by Friz Freleng. Its runtime is approximately **6 minutes**.


      ### Step 2: Compare the runtimes.

      - *Spiritual Kung Fu* has a runtime of 95 minutes.

      - *Cats and Bruises* has a runtime of 6 minutes.


      ### Step 3: Determine if *Spiritual Kung Fu* has a shorter runtime than *Cats
