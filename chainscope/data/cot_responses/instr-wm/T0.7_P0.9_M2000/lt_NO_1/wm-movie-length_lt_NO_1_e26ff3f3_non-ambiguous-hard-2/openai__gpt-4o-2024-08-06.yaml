      "Pippi Longstocking" (1969), has a runtime of approximately 101 minutes.

      is a film directed by Hugh Wilson, released in 1985. The runtime of this film
      is approximately 88 minutes.


      2. **Identify the runtime of "Supertwink":** "Supertwink" is a film directed
      by Richard Christy. However, "Supertwink" is not a widely recognized or mainstream
      film, and information about its runtime may not be readily available. If we
      assume that "Supertwink" is a short film or a low-budget independent project,
      it could have a shorter runtime than a typical feature film. However, without
      specific information about its runtime, we must assume a standard feature film
      runtime for comparison.


      3. **Compare the runtimes:** Without concrete information on "Supertwink," we
      have to rely on the assumption that if it were a feature film, its runtime might
      be around 90 minutes or more. However, given the uncertainty and the fact that
      "Rustlers'' Rhapsody" has a known runtime of 88 minutes, we cannot conclusively
      state that it has a shorter runtime than "Supertwink" without specific data.


      Based on the available information and assumptions, the answer is: **NO** (we
      cannot definitively say "Rustlers'' Rhapsody" has a shorter runtime without
      more specific information about "Supertwink").'

      1. **Insaaf Ki Devi**: This is a 1992 Indian film directed by S.A. Chandrasekhar.
      Indian films from this era typically have runtimes ranging from 120 to 180 minutes.
      However, specific runtime details for this movie aren''t widely documented online,

      2. **Black Emanuelle 2**: This is a 1976 Italian film directed by Bitto Albertini.
      The runtime for this film is approximately 91 minutes (or 1 hour and 31 minutes).


      Without the exact runtime of "Insaaf Ki Devi," we must rely on general knowledge
      of film lengths from that region and era. Given that many Indian films often
      exceed 90 minutes, it is reasonable to infer that "Insaaf Ki Devi" likely has

      1. **Juan & Ted: Wanted**: This is a Filipino comedy film released in 2000.
      The typical runtime for a comedy film is around 90 to 100 minutes. However,
      specific information about this film''s runtime would need to be looked up for
      accuracy. For the sake of reasoning, let''s assume it falls within this typical
      range.


      2. **War Story** by Peter Lord: It seems there might be confusion here. Peter
      Lord is known for animated films such as "Chicken Run" and "The Pirates! Band
      of Misfits." There is no well-known film titled "War Story" directed by him.
      "War Story" is, however, a drama film directed by Mark Jackson, not Peter Lord,
      and it has a runtime of about 90 minutes.


      Given this information, since "Juan & Ted: Wanted" is likely around 90 to 100
      minutes and "War Story" directed by Mark Jackson is about 90 minutes, it is
      difficult to definitively conclude which is shorter without precise runtime
      data for "Juan & Ted: Wanted."


      Based on typical runtimes, it is likely that both films have a similar runtime,

      the other.
