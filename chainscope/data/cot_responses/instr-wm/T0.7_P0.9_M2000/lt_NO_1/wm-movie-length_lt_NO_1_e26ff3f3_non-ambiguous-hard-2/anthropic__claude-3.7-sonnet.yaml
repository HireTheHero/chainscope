      which film has the longer runtime.


      Step 1: Identify the runtime of "Parullat" directed by Gjergj Xhuvani.

      "Parullat" (also known as "Slogans") is a 2001 Albanian film with a runtime
      of approximately 90 minutes.


      Step 2: Identify the runtime of "Within the Woods" directed by Sam Raimi.

      "Within the Woods" is a 1978 short horror film made by Sam Raimi with a runtime
      of approximately 30 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      Parullat: 90 minutes

      Within the Woods: 30 minutes


      Step 4: Determine if Parullat has a shorter runtime than Within the Woods.

      90 minutes is greater than 30 minutes, so Parullat has a longer runtime, not
      a shorter one.

      which film has the shorter runtime.


      Step 1: Identify the runtimes of both films.

      - Gjergj Xhuvani''s "Parullat" (also known as "Slogans") has a runtime of approximately
      90 minutes.

      - Sam Raimi''s "Within the Woods" is a short film with a runtime of approximately
      30 minutes. It was Raimi''s early work that later influenced "The Evil Dead."


      Step 2: Compare the runtimes.

      - "Parullat": 90 minutes

      - "Within the Woods": 30 minutes

      - 90 minutes is greater than 30 minutes


      Step 3: Determine which film has the shorter runtime.

      - "Within the Woods" at 30 minutes is shorter than "Parullat" at 90 minutes.


      Step 4: Answer the original question: Does Gjergj Xhuvani''s "Parullat" have
      a shorter total runtime than Sam Raimi''s "Within the Woods"?

      Since "Parullat" (90 min) is longer than "Within the Woods" (30 min), not shorter,
      the answer is:

      Step 1: I need to find the runtime of Gjergj Xhuvani''s "Parullat".

      - "Parullat" (also known as "Slogans") is an Albanian film directed by Gjergj
      Xhuvani.

      - The runtime of "Parullat" is approximately 90 minutes.


      Step 2: I need to find the runtime of Sam Raimi''s "Within the Woods".

      - "Within the Woods" is a 1978 short horror film directed by Sam Raimi.

      - It was a prototype/precursor to "The Evil Dead" and has a runtime of approximately
      30 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      - "Parullat": ~90 minutes

      - "Within the Woods": ~30 minutes

      - 90 minutes is greater than 30 minutes, so "Parullat" has a longer runtime
      than "Within the Woods".


      Therefore, does Gjergj Xhuvani''s "Parullat" have a shorter total runtime than
      Sam Raimi''s "Within the Woods"?

      - "Loopy De Loop" was a series of theatrical cartoon shorts created by William

      - "War Requiem" is a single film with a defined 92-minute runtime.

      - "Loopy De Loop" refers to individual cartoon shorts, not a single feature
      film. Even if we were to combine all Loopy De Loop shorts ever made (there were
      48 shorts in total), the combined runtime would be approximately 288-336 minutes

      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - "War Requiem" has a runtime of 92 minutes.

      - Any individual "Loopy De Loop" short is around 6-7 minutes.

      - The entire series of "Loopy De Loop" shorts combined would be much longer
      than 92 minutes.


      NO - Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem" does not have a shorter total runtime than
      William Hanna''s "Loopy De Loop" if we''re comparing to a single Loopy De Loop
      short. However, if comparing to the entire series, then War Requiem is shorter.

      - "War Requiem" is a feature film with a 92-minute runtime

      - "Loopy De Loop" episodes were short cartoons of approximately 6-7 minutes

      Step 1: I need to determine the runtime of Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem."

      - "War Requiem" is a 1989 film by Derek Jarman that''s an adaptation of Benjamin
      Britten''s musical piece of the same name.

      - The film has a runtime of approximately 92 minutes.


      Step 2: I need to determine the runtime of William Hanna''s "Loopy De Loop."

      - "Loopy De Loop" was not a single film but a series of theatrical cartoon shorts
      produced by Hanna-Barbera from 1959 to 1965.

      - Each "Loopy De Loop" cartoon short typically ran for about 6-7 minutes.

      - Even if we consider the longest possible single "Loopy De Loop" cartoon, it
      would be significantly shorter than 92 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - "War Requiem" at 92 minutes is much longer than any single "Loopy De Loop"

      First, I need to identify the runtimes of both films:


      1) Derek Jarman''s "War Requiem" (1989) is a film adaptation of Benjamin Britten''s
      musical piece of the same name. The film has a runtime of approximately 92 minutes.


      2) "Loopy De Loop" was a series of theatrical cartoon shorts created by William
      Hanna (and Joseph Barbera) at Hanna-Barbera. These were short animated cartoons
      that typically ran about 6-7 minutes each. Even if we consider the entire series
      collectively, each individual Loopy De Loop cartoon was very short.


      Comparing the two:

      - "War Requiem" is a feature-length film at 92 minutes

      - Each "Loopy De Loop" cartoon was only about 6-7 minutes


      Since the question asks about total runtime, and even if we were to add up multiple
      Loopy De Loop shorts, it would take approximately 13-15 shorts to equal the
      length of War Requiem. If we''re comparing the runtime of War Requiem to a single
      Loopy De Loop short (which is the most straightforward interpretation), then
      War Requiem is definitely longer.


      NO, Derek Jarman''s War Requiem does NOT have a shorter total runtime than William
      Hanna''s Loopy De Loop. It has a longer runtime.'

      Step 2: Identify "Transylvania 6-5000" directed by Maurice Noble.

      There''s a potential confusion here. There are two notable works with this title:

      - A 1963 Looney Tunes animated short directed by Chuck Jones and Maurice Noble,
      which runs about 7 minutes

      - A 1985 comedy horror film directed by Rudy De Luca, which runs about 93 minutes


      Since the question specifically mentions Maurice Noble as the director, I should
      consider the animated short, which is about 7 minutes long.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - "The Spirit of ''76" (Lucas Reiner): 83 minutes

      - "Transylvania 6-5000" (Maurice Noble): 7 minutes


      Step 4: Determine if the first is shorter than the second.

      First, I need to determine the runtimes of both films:


      1) "The Spirit of ''76" (1990) directed by Lucas Reiner has a runtime of approximately
      83 minutes.


      2) "Transylvania 6-5000" (1963) directed by Maurice Noble is an animated short
      film with a runtime of approximately 7 minutes. This is a Looney Tunes cartoon
      featuring Bugs Bunny.


      Now I can compare the two runtimes:

      - "The Spirit of ''76": 83 minutes

      - "Transylvania 6-5000": 7 minutes


      Since 83 minutes is greater than 7 minutes, "The Spirit of ''76" has a longer
      runtime than "Transylvania 6-5000".


      The question asks if "The Spirit of ''76" has a shorter runtime, which is not
      the case.

      the shorter runtime.


      Step 4: Answer the specific question asked.

      The question asks if "Star 80" has a shorter runtime than "Snow Business," not
      which film is shorter overall.


      NO. Bob Fosse''s "Star 80" does not have a shorter total runtime than Friz Freleng''s
      "Snow Business."'

      Step 1: Identify "Star 80" runtime.

      "Star 80" is a 1983 biographical drama film directed by Bob Fosse. Its runtime
      is approximately 103 minutes (1 hour and 43 minutes).


      Step 2: Identify "Snow Business" runtime.

      "Snow Business" is a Looney Tunes animated short film directed by Friz Freleng.
      As a typical Looney Tunes short, it would have a runtime of about 6-8 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      "Star 80": ~103 minutes

      "Snow Business": ~7 minutes (typical for Looney Tunes shorts)


      Step 4: Determine if "Star 80" has a shorter runtime than "Snow Business".

      103 minutes is greater than 7 minutes, so "Star 80" has a longer runtime, not

      - "Star 80" has a runtime of about 104 minutes

      - "Snow Business" has a runtime of about 6-8 minutes

      - 104 minutes is clearly longer than 6-8 minutes


      Step 3: Determine if "Star 80" has a shorter runtime than "Snow Business."

      Since "Star 80" (104 minutes) is longer than "Snow Business" (6-8 minutes),

      - "Aadi" is a movie directed by V. V. Vinayak

      - "Your Witness" is a movie directed by Robert Montgomery


      Step 2: Find the runtime of "Aadi".

      "Aadi" is a 2002 Telugu action film directed by V. V. Vinayak. Its runtime is
      approximately 165 minutes (2 hours and 45 minutes).


      Step 3: Find the runtime of "Your Witness".

      "Your Witness" (also known as "Eye Witness" in the US) is a 1950 British courtroom
      drama directed by Robert Montgomery. Its runtime is approximately 104 minutes

      1) "Nee Varuvai Ena" (1999) is a Tamil film directed by Rajakumaran. Based on
      available information, this appears to be a standard Tamil feature film. Tamil
      feature films typically run between 120-180 minutes (2-3 hours).

      by Jon Alpert. This HBO documentary has a runtime of approximately 60 minutes
      (1 hour).


      Comparing these runtimes:

      - "Come Dance with Me!" (original French title: "Voulez-vous danser avec moi?")
      has a runtime of approximately 111 minutes.


      Step 2: Let me find the runtime of "Room and Bird" directed by Friz Freleng.

      - "Room and Bird" is a Looney Tunes animated short film from 1951 directed by
      Friz Freleng.

      - As a Looney Tunes short, it has a runtime of approximately 7 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      - "Come Dance with Me!" runtime: 111 minutes

      - "Room and Bird" runtime: 7 minutes

      - 111 minutes is greater than 7 minutes


      Therefore, "Come Dance with Me!" has a longer runtime than "Room and Bird,"
      not a shorter one.

      - "Room and Bird" runtime: ~7 minutes


      Step 3: Determine if the first film has a shorter runtime than the second.

      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      - "Anveshana": 143 minutes

      Since 90 minutes is less than 143 minutes, "Thirty Three" has a shorter runtime

      minutes), then "War Story" has a shorter runtime.

      Ajooba (also known as "Adventures of Ajooba" or "The Return of the Hurricane")
      is a 1991 Indian fantasy film. Its runtime is approximately 174 minutes (2 hours
      and 54 minutes).


      Step 2: Determine the runtime of "Dancers" directed by Herbert Ross.

      "Dancers" is a 1987 drama film directed by Herbert Ross. Its runtime is approximately
      99 minutes (1 hour and 39 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      Ajooba: 174 minutes

      Dancers: 99 minutes

      174 minutes > 99 minutes


      Since Ajooba has a longer runtime than Dancers (not shorter), the answer is:

      Step 1: Let me identify the runtime of "Ajooba" directed by Shashi Kapoor.

      Ajooba (also known as "The Adventures of Ajooba") was released in 1991 and has
      a runtime of approximately 174 minutes (2 hours and 54 minutes).


      Step 2: Let me identify the runtime of "Dancers" directed by Herbert Ross.

      "Dancers" was released in 1987 and has a runtime of approximately 122 minutes
