      1. First, I''ll find the runtime of Blood from the Mummy''s Tomb:

      - This is a 1971 British horror film

      - Its runtime is approximately 87 minutes


      2. Next, I''ll find the runtime of Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!:

      - This is a 2000 Japanese animated film

      - Its runtime is approximately 40 minutes


      3. Comparing the two runtimes:

      - Blood from the Mummy''s Tomb: 87 minutes

      - Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!: 40 minutes

      - 87 minutes is longer than 40 minutes


      4. Answering the specific question:

      - The question asks if Blood from the Mummy''s Tomb has a shorter runtime

      - Since it does NOT have a shorter runtime, the answer is NO

      4. Determining the answer:

      - 150 minutes is LONGER than 100 minutes

      Step 3: Comparison

      - Villu: 150 minutes
