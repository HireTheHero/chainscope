      Step 1: Identify the runtime of Vidukathai.

      - "Vidukathai" is a Tamil-language film directed by Agathiyan, released in 1997.

      - The runtime of Vidukathai is approximately 135 minutes (2 hours and 15 minutes).


      Step 2: Identify the runtime of The Man Inside.

      - "The Man Inside" directed by Bobby Roth was released in 1990.

      - The runtime of The Man Inside is approximately 93 minutes (1 hour and 33 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      - Vidukathai: 135 minutes

      - The Man Inside: 93 minutes


      Since 135 minutes is longer than 93 minutes, Vidukathai does not have a shorter

      we need to determine the runtime of each film and then compare them.


      Step 1: Determine the runtime of "Sherman''s March" by Ross McElwee.

      - "Sherman''s March" (1986) is a documentary film by Ross McElwee.

      - It has a runtime of approximately 157 minutes.


      Step 2: Determine the runtime of "Yolki".

      - Ignas Jonynas is a Lithuanian director known for the film "The Gambler" (2013),

      - However, assuming the question intends to compare "Sherman''s March" with
      "Yolki" (2010), we proceed with that.


      Step 3: Determine the runtime of "Yolki" (2010).

      - "Yolki" (2010) has a runtime of approximately 90 minutes.


      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      - "Sherman''s March": 157 minutes.

      - "Yolki": 90 minutes.


      157 minutes is longer than 90 minutes.

      1. Identify the runtime of "Sherman''s March".

      2. Identify the runtime of "Yolki".

      3. Compare the two runtimes to answer whether "Sherman''s March" is shorter.


      Step 1: "Sherman''s March" (1986), a documentary by Ross McElwee, has a runtime
      of approximately 157 minutes.


      Step 2: "Yolki" (also known as "Six Degrees of Celebration") is a Russian film

      directed the Lithuanian film "The Gambler" (2013), not "Yolki".


      So there''s a discrepancy in the question: Ignas Jonynas did not direct "Yolki".


      However, assuming the question intended to refer to "Yolki" (2010), regardless
      of the director attribution, we can proceed.


      "Yolki" (2010) has a runtime of approximately 90 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes:

      - "Sherman''s March" = 157 minutes

      - "Yolki" = 90 minutes


      Since 157 minutes > 90 minutes, "Sherman''s March" has a longer runtime.

      \ referring to?\n2. What is the total runtime of that film or films?\n3. What\
      \ is Costa-Gavras's Family Business, and what is its runtime?\n4. Then compare\
      \ the runtimes.\n\nStep 1: Identify \"John Putch's Atlas Shrugged\"\n\nJohn\
      \ Putch directed \"Atlas Shrugged: Part II\", the second installment of a film\
      \ trilogy adaptation of Ayn Rand's novel \"Atlas Shrugged\". The trilogy is:\n\
      \n- Part I (2011) \u2013 directed by Paul Johansson\n- Part II (2012) \u2013\
      \ directed by John Putch\n- Part III (2014) \u2013 directed by James Manera\n\
      \nSo when we say \"John Putch's Atlas Shrugged\", it's most accurate to refer\
      \ to \"Atlas Shrugged: Part II\" only, unless the question loosely refers to\
      \ the trilogy\u2014which would not be accurate to attribute solely to John Putch.\n\
      \nBut since the question says \u201CJohn Putch\u2019s Atlas Shrugged\u201D,\
      \ we will assume it refers to Part II only.\n\nStep 2: Find the runtime of \"\
      Atlas Shrugged: Part II\"\n\n\"Atlas Shrugged: Part II\" (2012) has a runtime\
      \ of approximately 112 minutes.\n\nStep 3: Identify \"Costa-Gavras's Family\
      \ Business\"\n\nHere is a potential point of confusion. Costa-Gavras is a Greek-French\
      \ director known for political films like \"Z\", \"Missing\", and \"State of\
      \ Siege\". However, there is no record of a movie titled \"Family Business\"\
      \ directed by Costa-Gavras.\n\nThere is a 1989 movie titled \"Family Business\"\
      \ directed by Sidney Lumet, starring Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman, and Matthew\
      \ Broderick.\n\nSo either the question contains an error (wrongly attributing\
      \ \"Family Business\" to Costa-Gavras), or there is an obscure or unknown film\
      \ by that title from Costa-Gavras. After checking, there is no mainstream or\
      \ widely acknowledged film titled \"Family Business\" directed by Costa-Gavras.\n\
      \nAssuming the question intends to refer to a film titled \"Family Business\"\
      \ directed by Costa-Gavras, and assuming hypothetically such a film exists,\
      \ we must find its runtime.\n\nHowever, since there is no such film, we cannot\
      \ compare.\n\nAlternative interpretation:\n\nIf the question meant \"Sidney\
      \ Lumet's Family Business\", then its runtime is approximately 110 minutes.\n\
      \nBut that\u2019s not what the question asks.\n\nSo either the question is based\
      \ on incorrect attribution (naming Costa-Gavras instead of Sidney Lumet), or\
      \ it is referring to a different, possibly obscure film.\n\nHowever, for the\
      \ sake of proceeding, let\u2019s assume the question refers to a film titled\
      \ \"Family Business\" that exists and has a runtime to compare.\n\nLet\u2019\
      s suppose Costa-Gavras made a film (hypothetically) called \"Family Business\"\
      , and it had a runtime longer than 112 minutes.\n\nBut since we cannot verify\
      \ any such film by Costa-Gavras exists, and we cannot confirm any runtime, we\
      \ cannot make a fair comparison.\n\nTherefore, based on known facts:\n\n- \"\
      Atlas Shrugged: Part II\" (John Putch) = 112 minutes\n- No known film \"Family\
      \ Business\" by Costa-Gavras exists\n\nConclusion:\n\nGiven that we cannot identify\
      \ a Costa-Gavras film titled \"Family Business\", we cannot definitively compare\
      \ runtimes. But if the question contains an error and meant Sidney Lumet's \"\
      Family Business\" (110 minutes), then Atlas Shrugged: Part II (112 minutes)\
      \ is slightly longer.\n\nSo, assuming the question meant the 110-minute \"Family\
      \ Business\" (1989), and comparing it to the 112-minute \"Atlas Shrugged: Part\
      \ II\", the answer would be:\n\nNO \u2014 John Putch\u2019s Atlas Shrugged does\

      to determine the correct answer.


      **Step 1: Identify the movies and their runtimes.**


      We need to find the total runtime of:

      - "Shahenshah" (1988), directed by Virender Anand.

      - "The Last Blood" (1991), directed by Wong Jing.


      **Step 2: Find the runtime of Shahenshah.**


      "Shahenshah" (1988) is a Bollywood film starring Amitabh Bachchan. Bollywood
      films from that era tend to have longer runtimes. According to available sources,
      the runtime of Shahenshah is approximately:

      - 186 minutes (or 3 hours and 6 minutes).


      **Step 3: Find the runtime of The Last Blood.**


      "The Last Blood" (also known as "Hard Boiled 2" in some markets) is a Hong Kong
      action film directed by Wong Jing. Hong Kong action films typically have shorter
      runtimes. According to sources, the runtime of The Last Blood is approximately:

      - 90 minutes (or 1 hour and 30 minutes).


      **Step 4: Compare the two runtimes.**


      - Shahenshah: 186 minutes

      - The Last Blood: 90 minutes


      186 minutes is clearly longer than 90 minutes.


      **Conclusion:**


      Does Shahenshah have a shorter total runtime than The Last Blood?

      and 10 minutes).


      Step 2: Find the runtime of Harold F. Kress''s Apache War Smoke.


      - "Apache War Smoke" is a 1952 Western film directed by Harold F. Kress.

      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.


      - Chandralekha (1995): ~130 minutes

      - Apache War Smoke (1952): ~67 minutes


      130 minutes is clearly longer than 67 minutes, meaning Chandralekha has a longer

      we need to:


      **Step 1: Identify the runtime of Ram Gopal Varma''s *Shiva*.**


      There are two films directed by Ram Gopal Varma with the title *Shiva*:

      - A Hindi remake/reboot also titled *Shiva* (2006).

      - *Shiva* (1989) has a runtime of approximately 145 minutes.

      - *Shiva* (2006) has a runtime of approximately 125 minutes.


      So either version of *Shiva* is over 2 hours long.


      **Step 2: Identify the runtime of Melanie Hogan''s *Kanyini*.**


      - *Kanyini* (2006) is a documentary film directed by Melanie Hogan.

      - It has a runtime of approximately 52 minutes.


      **Step 3: Compare the runtimes.**


      - *Shiva* (either version) is longer than 125 minutes.

      with Aardman Animations. However, there is no widely known movie titled "War
      Story" directed by Peter Lord. There is a short animated film titled "War Story"
      from 1989, part of the "Lip Synch" series by Aardman Animations, and it is directed
      by Peter Lord. The runtime of this short film is approximately 6 minutes.
