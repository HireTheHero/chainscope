      relative positions.


      1. **Maud Island:** Maud Island is located in New Zealand, specifically in the
      Marlborough Sounds at the northern end of the South Island.


      2. **Arthur River, Tasmania:** The Arthur River is located on the northwestern
      coast of Tasmania, Australia.


      3. **Comparing their positions:** Since Maud Island is in New Zealand and the
      Arthur River is in Tasmania, we need to determine which is further south.


      - New Zealand''s South Island, where Maud Island is located, is south of the
      mainland of Australia.

      - Tasmania, however, is an island south of the Australian mainland.


      Now, let''s consider the latitude:


      - The northern part of New Zealand''s South Island is generally north of Tasmania.


      Therefore, Maud Island, being part of New Zealand''s South Island, is located
      north of the Arthur River in Tasmania.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      **NO**'

      States, located in the state of Idaho. Its approximate latitude is 47.5 degrees
      North.


      2. **Identify the Latitude of Central Hungary**: Central Hungary, where Budapest
      is located, has an approximate latitude of 47.5 degrees North as well.


      3. **Comparison**: Since both Wallace, Idaho and Central Hungary have the same
      approximate latitude, Wallace is neither south nor north of Central Hungary.
      They are roughly at the same latitude.


      Given this analysis, the question of whether Wallace, Idaho is located south
      of Central Hungary would be answered with a clear **NO**.'

      2. **Mattanur**: This is a town in the Kannur district of Kerala, India, located

      - India is located in the Eastern Hemisphere, specifically in South Asia, and
      Mattanur is also north of the equator.

      located to the south.


      - If it has a higher latitude coordinate, it is to the north.

      - Tamil Nadu, where Thuvakudi is located, is in the southern part of India.


      When comparing which is more southern, we look at their latitudinal positions:


      - Benishangul-Gumuz is approximately around 9-12 degrees north of the equator.

      - Thuvakudi, being in Tamil Nadu, is approximately around 10-11 degrees north
      of the equator.


      Based on this information, both locations are relatively close in terms of latitude,
      but Thuvakudi is slightly further south than the Benishangul-Gumuz Region.


      Thus, the answer is: **NO**. Benishangul-Gumuz Region is not located south of
      Thuvakudi.'
