      3. When comparing their positions:

      - Both are in the panhandle

      - Escambia County (where Bellview is) is west of Leon County

      - They are roughly at the same latitude

      - Neither is significantly north or south of the other


      Answer: NO

      (Bellview is not south of Leon County - they are at approximately the same latitude,
      with Bellview being to the west)'

      2. Next, let''s locate Leon County, FL

      - Leon County is also in Florida''s panhandle

      - Tallahassee (state capital) is in Leon County

      - Leon County is much further east than Escambia County


      3. Now, let''s compare their latitudes

      - Both Bellview and Leon County are in the Florida panhandle

      - They are at roughly the same latitude

      - Bellview is neither significantly north nor south of Leon County

      - They run roughly along the same east-west line
