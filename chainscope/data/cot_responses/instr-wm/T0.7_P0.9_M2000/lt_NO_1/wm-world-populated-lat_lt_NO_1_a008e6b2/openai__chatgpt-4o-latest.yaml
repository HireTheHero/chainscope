      \ from around **25\xB0S to 28\xB0S**, and Condamine is at **26.9\xB0S**, part\
      \ of Misiones is north of Condamine, but part of it is also south.  \n\n5. **Final\
      \ Conclusion**:  \n   - Since parts of Misiones are **both north and south**\
      \ of Condamine, the answer to whether Misiones is **located south** of Condamine\
      \ is **partially true but not entirely**.  \n   - However, given the phrasing\
      \ of the question (\"Is Misiones Province located south of Condamine?\"), the\
      \ most accurate simple answer is **NO**, because not all of Misiones is south\
      \ of Condamine.  \n\n**Final Answer: NO**."
