      2. **General Melbourne Geography:** Melbourne generally expands outwards from
      the city center towards the north, east, south, and west.  Suburbs further from
      the city centre in a particular direction are generally considered to be more
      "south," "north," "east," or "west."

      in the south-eastern suburbs. Monbulk is in the outer eastern suburbs, further
      east and significantly further from the city centre.  Crucially, Monbulk is
      located in the Dandenong Ranges, a mountainous area to the east and north-east
      of central Melbourne.


      4. **Relative Position:**  Since Monbulk is further east and in the ranges (which

      2. **General Melbourne geography:**  Melbourne generally spreads outward from
      the city center and Port Phillip Bay (south).  Suburbs further from the bay
      tend to be further north.

      Urswick, so disambiguation is important.

      2. **Disambiguate Urswick:**  Given the context of North Yorkshire, the most
      likely Urswick is Urswick, Cumbria.  There''s also an Urswick, Lancashire, but
      that''s less likely given the question''s focus.

      3. **Determine relative positions:**  Cumbria is generally north-west of North
      Yorkshire. Therefore, Urswick, Cumbria would be north/north-west of Lofthouse,
      North Yorkshire.

      helps narrow it down.

      2. **Locate Urswick:** We need to find Urswick.  There are a few places called
      Urswick, so being precise is important. The most likely candidate is Urswick
      in Cumbria, England.

      3. **Determine relative positions:** Once both locations are found, we need
      to compare their latitudes.  A location further south will have a lower latitude.


      Since Urswick, Cumbria is significantly south of Lofthouse, North Yorkshire,
      the answer is YES.

      2. **Locate Saint Catherine, Egypt:** Saint Catherine is in the Sinai Peninsula,
      Egypt.  This is in the Northern Hemisphere as well.


      3. **Compare Latitudes:**  To determine if Manang is south of Saint Catherine,
      we need to compare their latitudes.  A place further south will have a lower
      latitude.


      4. **Approximate Latitudes:** Manang is around 28-29 degrees North latitude.
      Saint Catherine is around 28 degrees North latitude.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since Manang and Saint Catherine are at approximately the
      same latitude, Manang is not south of Saint Catherine.

      Lake is in Central California, near Yosemite National Park.


      2. **Locate Suji-gu:** Suji-gu is a district in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, South
      Korea.


      3. **Compare Locations:** California is in North America, and South Korea is
      in Asia. Therefore, Bass Lake is much further east than Suji-gu.  Latitude doesn''t
      directly determine North/South within different continents.


      4. **Determine if Bass Lake is South of Suji-gu:** While Bass Lake is further
      south in terms of latitude compared to Suji-gu, the question is about a general
      directional sense. Given their locations on completely different continents,
      separated by the Pacific Ocean,  Bass Lake is not considered "south" of Suji-gu
      in the conventional sense.

      Australia.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** New Zealand is generally southeast of Australia,
      and thus Tasmania.


      4. **Consider "south of":** While New Zealand is southeast of Tasmania, a portion
      of it does lie directly south of Tasmania. We need to determine if Maud Island
      falls within that portion. Maud Island is in the Marlborough Sounds at the top
      of the South Island of New Zealand, which is indeed south of Tasmania.

      is a small island off the east coast of Tasmania, Australia.


      2. **Locate Arthur River:** Arthur River is a town at the mouth of the Arthur
      River, on the northwest coast of Tasmania.


      3. **East vs. West:** East and West are opposite directions.  Maud Island is
      east, and Arthur River is west.  Therefore, Maud Island cannot be directly south
      of Arthur River.


      4. **Consider South:** Even though Maud Island is much further east, it could
      theoretically be south if it was far enough south to be at a lower latitude
      than Arthur River.


      5. **Check Latitudes (if possible):**  Without specific coordinates, we can''t
      definitively check exact latitudes. However, general knowledge of Tasmanian
      geography tells us Maud Island is not exceptionally far south within Tasmania.


      6. **Conclusion:** Given the significant east/west separation and the general
      understanding of Tasmanian geography, it is highly unlikely Maud Island is south
      of Arthur River.
