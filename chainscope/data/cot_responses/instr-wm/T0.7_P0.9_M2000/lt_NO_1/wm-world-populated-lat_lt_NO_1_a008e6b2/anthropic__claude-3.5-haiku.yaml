    bbd08a36-bfee-4040-b391-dcb50f8dcc71: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate ''Ili''ili and Rurrenabaque on a map.


      2. ''Ili''ili appears to be a place in American Samoa, located in the South
      Pacific Ocean.


      3. Rurrenabaque is a town in Bolivia, located in the Amazon basin in the northern
      part of that country.


      4. These locations are on different continents - ''Ili''ili is in Oceania, while
      Rurrenabaque is in South America.


      5. Specifically, ''Ili''ili is in the Southern Hemisphere, while Rurrenabaque
      is also in the Southern Hemisphere.


      6. However, they are very far apart, with thousands of miles between them.


      7. Comparing their latitudes, ''Ili''ili is much further south than Rurrenabaque.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, ''Ili''ili is NOT located south of Rurrenabaque.'

      3. Maud Island is actually located in the Marlborough Sounds of New Zealand,
      not in Tasmania at all.


      4. Since Maud Island is not even in Tasmania, it cannot be south of Arthur River
      in Tasmania.


      5. Therefore, the answer is NO.


      NO'
