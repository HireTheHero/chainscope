      is a city with a relatively flat topography. The suburbs of Melbourne generally
      extend outward from the city center in a radial pattern.


      3. **Determine Cardinal Directions**: To determine if one place is south of
      another, we need to consider their positions relative to the cardinal directions
      (north, south, east, west). In Melbourne, the city center is generally considered
      the reference point for these directions.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Caulfield East is located in the southeastern suburbs
      of Melbourne, relatively close to the city center. Monbulk is located to the
      east of Melbourne, in the Dandenong Ranges, which are a series of hills and
      mountains.

      Canada.


      2. **Latitude Comparison**: Both Geneseo and Malahide are in North America,
      but they are in different countries. The United States and Canada share a long
      border, so we need to consider their positions relative to this border.

      part of the United States, while Malahide, Ontario, is in the southern part
      of Canada, near the border with the United States.


      4. **North-South Comparison**: To determine if one place is south of another,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Places with lower latitudes are closer to
      the equator, hence "south" of places with higher latitudes.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general geographical context, Geneseo, New York,

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Without precise coordinates, we can make an educated
      guess based on the general geography of England. Northern England is generally
      at a higher latitude than southern England. Therefore, if Urswick and Lofthouse
      are both in northern England, they are likely at a similar latitude.


      4. **Consider the specific locations**: Urswick is a village in Cumbria, a county
      in the northwest of England. Lofthouse is a village in North Yorkshire, another
      county in northern England. Both counties are relatively close to each other,
      suggesting that the two villages are likely at a similar latitude.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographical positions and the specific
      locations of Urswick and Lofthouse, it is likely that Urswick is not located
      south of Lofthouse, but rather at a similar latitude. Therefore, the answer
      to the question is **NO**'

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Urswick
      and Lofthouse, North Yorkshire. Urswick is a village in Cumbria, England, while
      Lofthouse is a village in North Yorkshire, England.


      2. **Determine general geographic locations**: Next, we need to determine the
      general geographic locations of Cumbria and North Yorkshire. Cumbria is located
      in the northwestern part of England, while North Yorkshire is located in the
      northeastern part of the country.


      3. **Compare latitudes**: To determine if Urswick is south of Lofthouse, we
      need to compare their latitudes. Places with lower latitudes are closer to the
      equator, hence "south" of places with higher latitudes.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general geographic locations of Cumbria and North
      Yorkshire, it is reasonable to assume that Urswick is located south of Lofthouse,
      North Yorkshire.

      2. **Determine Geographic Locations**: Next, we determine the geographic locations
      of both. Carentan, being in France, is generally located at a higher latitude
      compared to Consul, Saskatchewan, which is in Canada.


      3. **Compare Latitudes**: France, where Carentan is located, is generally north
      of Canada, where Consul is. This means that Carentan is likely north of Consul,
      not south.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the information about the geographic locations of Carentan
      and Consul, we can conclude that Carentan is not located south of Consul, Saskatchewan.

      of Leicestershire, England. Vollenhove is a town in the province of Overijssel,
      Netherlands.


      2. **Determine the general geographic locations**: Next, we determine the general
      geographic locations of both. England, where Appleby Magna is situated, is an
      island nation located off the northwest coast of continental Europe. The Netherlands,
      where Vollenhove is located, is a country on the continent of Europe, specifically
      in the western part.


      3. **Compare latitudes**: To determine if one place is south of another, we
      need to compare their latitudes. Places with lower latitudes are closer to the
      equator, hence "south" of places with higher latitudes. Without specific coordinates,

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Temotu
      Province and Conflict Group. Temotu Province is located in the Solomon Islands,
      a country in the South Pacific Ocean. Conflict Group, also known as the Conflict
      Islands, is an archipelago in Papua New Guinea, located to the north of Australia.


      2. **Consider Geographical Positions**: Temotu Province is located in the eastern
      part of the Solomon Islands, and the Solomon Islands are situated to the east
      of Papua New Guinea. The Conflict Islands are located in the southeastern part
      of Papua New Guinea.


      3. **Compare Latitudes**: To determine if Temotu Province is south of Conflict
      Group, we need to compare their latitudes. Latitudes measure the distance north
      or south of the equator. The higher the latitude, the closer a location is to
      the North or South Pole.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions and latitudes of Temotu
      Province and Conflict Group, we can conclude that Temotu Province is not located
      south of Conflict Group. Instead, Temotu Province is located east of Conflict
      Group, and it is situated in the eastern part of the Solomon Islands, while
      Conflict Group is in the southeastern part of Papua New Guinea.

      6. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are south of the equator, it is
      possible that ''Ili''ili is south of Rurrenabaque. However, without specific
      coordinates or more detailed information about their latitudes, we cannot definitively
      say if ''Ili''ili is south of Rurrenabaque. It would require more precise data

      2. **Dunolly Location**: Dunolly is a town located in the northern part of Victoria,
      Australia. It is situated in the Loddon Shire, about 190 kilometers northwest
      of Melbourne, the capital of Victoria.


      3. **Mangalore Location**: Mangalore is a town located in the central part of
      Victoria, Australia. It is situated in the Strathbogie Shire, approximately
      130 kilometers north of Melbourne.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Dunolly is south of Mangalore, we
      need to consider their relative positions within Victoria. Both towns are in
      Victoria, but they are not directly north-south of each other.


      5. **Directional Analysis**: Victoria''s layout can be thought of in terms of
      its cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) with Melbourne as a reference
      point. Dunolly is located northwest of Melbourne, while Mangalore is located
      north of Melbourne. However, their positions are not strictly north-south in
      relation to each other.


      6. **North-South Orientation**: When considering the north-south orientation,
      we must understand that Dunolly and Mangalore are not directly aligned on a
      north-south axis. They are both north of Melbourne, but Dunolly is more to the
      west.


      7. **Conclusion**: Given the general layout of Victoria and without precise
      latitude and longitude coordinates, we can reason that Dunolly is not specifically
      south of Mangalore but rather more to the west. The question asks for a comparison
      of their south-north positioning, not east-west. Therefore, considering typical
      urban layouts and without specific geographic data indicating otherwise, we
      would conclude that Dunolly is not south of Mangalore based on their general
      locations within Victoria.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      the geographic locations of Beit Yashout and Maibara.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Beit Yashout is a village in northern Israel,
      while Maibara is a city in Shiga Prefecture, Japan.


      2. **Consider the General Geographical Regions**: Israel is located in the Middle
      East, while Japan is located in East Asia. The Middle East is generally south
      of East Asia.


      3. **Compare the Latitudes**: Without precise coordinates, we can make a general
      comparison based on the countries'' locations. Japan is at a higher latitude
      than Israel, which means it is located further north.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Beit Yashout is in Israel, which is in the Middle
      East, and Maibara is in Japan, which is in East Asia, we can conclude that Beit
      Yashout is likely south of Maibara. However, without precise coordinates, we

      \n4. **Kolkata's Latitude**: Kolkata's latitude is approximately 22.57\xB0N.\
      \ This means it is north of the equator.\n\n5. **Sandwip's Latitude**: Sandwip's\
      \ latitude is approximately 22.50\xB0N. This means it is also north of the equator.\n\
      \n6. **Latitude Comparison**: Since both places are north of the equator and\

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify where Wallace, Idaho,
      and Central Hungary are located. Wallace is a city in Shoshone County, Idaho,
      in the United States. Central Hungary is a region in the central part of Hungary,
      a country in Central Europe.


      2. **Determine general geographic locations**: Next, we determine the general
      geographic locations of both. Wallace, being in Idaho, is in the western part
      of the United States. Central Hungary is in the heart of Europe, east of the
      United States.


      3. **Compare latitudes**: The United States, where Wallace is located, is generally
      north of Hungary, where Central Hungary is situated. This means that Wallace
      is likely north of Central Hungary, not south.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the information about the geographic locations of Wallace,
      Idaho, and Central Hungary, we can conclude that Wallace is not located south
      of Central Hungary.

      is a village in Syria as well.


      2. **Determine Geographic Locations**: Next, we determine the geographic locations
      of both. Qabu Shamsiyah is located in the Latakia Governorate, in the western
      part of Syria. Deir Huwayt is also located in Syria but in the Hama Governorate,
      which is more towards the center of the country.


      3. **Compare Latitudes**: To determine if one place is south of another, we

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of The Reeds
      and Rainbow Beach, Queensland. The Reeds is a locality in South Australia, while
      Rainbow Beach is a coastal town in Queensland, Australia.


      2. **Consider Latitude**: To determine if one place is south of another, we
      need to consider their latitudes. The southern hemisphere is generally south
      of the northern hemisphere, so we''ll focus on the southern hemisphere.


      3. **South Australia vs. Queensland**: The Reeds is located in South Australia,
      which is in the southern part of Australia. Queensland, where Rainbow Beach
      is situated, is in the northeastern part of the country.


      4. **Compare Latitudes**: South Australia generally has lower latitudes compared
      to Queensland. This means that South Australia is located more to the south
      than Queensland.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that The Reeds is in South Australia and Rainbow Beach
      is in Queensland, and considering the general latitudinal positions of these

      Mujeres and Utran. Isla Mujeres is an island located off the coast of Cancun,
      Mexico, in the Caribbean Sea. Utran is a town in the state of Gujarat, India,
      located in the western part of the country.


      2. **Consider Geographical Positions**: Isla Mujeres is situated in the northern
      part of the Caribbean Sea, while Utran is in western India, which is on the
      Asian continent. India is generally east of Mexico, and both are located in
      different hemispheres (northern and southern).


      3. **Latitude Comparison**: To determine if one place is south of another, we
      need to compare their latitudes. Places with lower latitudes are closer to the
      equator, hence "south" of places with higher latitudes. However, in this case,
      the geographical separation is significant, and the latitude comparison might
      not be straightforward.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the substantial geographical distance and the fact
      that they are on different continents, Isla Mujeres is not located south of

      and Lutterworth are located. Santon Downham is a village in Suffolk, England,
      and Lutterworth is a market town in Leicestershire, England.


      2. **Determine their general positions**: Next, we determine the general positions
      of both. Suffolk, where Santon Downham is located, is generally east of Leicestershire,
      where Lutterworth is situated.


      3. **Compare their latitudes**: England is relatively small, and there''s not
      a significant difference in latitude between Suffolk and Leicestershire. Therefore,
      we can''t make a clear determination based solely on latitude.


      4. **Consider their east-west positions**: Since latitude doesn''t give a clear
      answer, we need to consider their east-west positions. Suffolk is east of Leicestershire,
      which means that Santon Downham is likely east of Lutterworth.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the information about the locations and their east-west

      Condamine is a town in Queensland, Australia.


      2. **Consider their countries'' positions**: Argentina is located in South America,
      while Australia is located in the southern hemisphere but is an island continent
      in the Pacific Ocean.


      3. **Analyze their latitudinal positions**: Without exact coordinates, we know
      that Argentina is generally at lower latitudes (closer to the equator) compared
      to Australia. This means that Misiones Province is likely to be at a lower latitude
      than Condamine, Queensland.


      4. **Determine their relative north-south position**: Since Misiones Province
      is in Argentina, which is generally south of Australia, it''s reasonable to
      assume that Misiones Province is indeed located south of Condamine, Queensland.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographical positions of Argentina
      and Australia, and without precise latitude and longitude coordinates, we can
      conclude that Misiones Province is likely located south of Condamine, Queensland.

      England, while Thornton is a village in West Yorkshire, England.


      2. **Consider their relative positions**: Both Lancashire and West Yorkshire
      are counties in the north of England. To determine if Medlar-with-Wesham is
      south of Thornton, we need to consider their relative positions within England.


      3. **Analyze the north-south orientation**: England is generally elongated from
      north to south, with Scotland to the north and the English Channel to the south.
      Therefore, to be south of Thornton, Medlar-with-Wesham would need to be located
      south of West Yorkshire.


      4. **Compare locations within England**: Without precise coordinates, we can''t
      determine the exact latitude of each location, but we can make a general assessment
      based on their positions within England. Lancashire is to the west of West Yorkshire,
      so it''s unlikely that Medlar-with-Wesham is significantly south of Thornton.

      and Hummelo are located. Stanton, Gloucestershire is a village in England, United
      Kingdom, while Hummelo is a town in the Netherlands.


      2. **Determine the general geographic positions**: Next, we need to consider

      an island nation located to the west of continental Europe, while the Netherlands
      is a country in northwestern Europe.


      3. **Compare latitudes**: To determine if one place is south of another, we
      need to compare their latitudes. Places with lower latitudes are closer to the
      equator, hence "south" of places with higher latitudes.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic positions and without specific
      coordinates, we can reason that Stanton, Gloucestershire, which is located in
      England, is likely to be south of Hummelo, which is in the Netherlands. However,

      in the southern hemisphere. Australia is located to the west of New Zealand.


      3. **Consider the general north-south orientation**: Australia is generally
      north of New Zealand, but the specific locations of Murrayville and Waitangi
      are not very close to each other. Murrayville is located in the southern part
      of Australia, while Waitangi is in the northern part of New Zealand.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general north-south orientation of Australia and
      New Zealand, and considering the specific locations of Murrayville and Waitangi,
      we can conclude that Murrayville is **not** located south of Waitangi. Instead,
      Murrayville is located to the west of Waitangi.
