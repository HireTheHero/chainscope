      Step 1: Let me identify where Kewaunee Power Station is located.

      Kewaunee Power Station is in Wisconsin, specifically on the western shore of
      Lake Michigan in Kewaunee County.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is located.

      Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in Illinois, specifically in Chicago, which
      is also on the western shore of Lake Michigan.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois. Kewaunee County, WI is in the eastern
      part of Wisconsin, well north of the Wisconsin-Illinois border. Chicago is in
      the northeastern part of Illinois, near the Illinois-Wisconsin border, but still
      south of Wisconsin.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Kewaunee Power Station is in Wisconsin (north) and Chicago Avenue Pumping
      Station is in Chicago, Illinois (south), Kewaunee Power Station is located NORTH
      of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, not south.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Wisconsin and Illinois.

      - Wisconsin is located north of Illinois

      - Kewaunee would likely be in eastern Wisconsin near Lake Michigan

      - A Chicago Avenue Pumping Station would be in Chicago, which is in northeastern

      border.


      Step 4: The Chicago Avenue Pumping Station would be in Chicago, Illinois, which
      is south of Wisconsin.


      Since Kewaunee Power Station is in Wisconsin (north) and Chicago Avenue Pumping
      Station is in Chicago, Illinois (south), Kewaunee Power Station cannot be south

      Allegheny Reservoir, PA and High Rock Lake, NC


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two bodies of water.


      ## Step 1: Geographic locations

      - Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua Dam) is located in northwestern Pennsylvania,
      near the New York border.

      - High Rock Lake is located in central North Carolina.


      ## Step 2: State positions

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, bordering New York and the Great Lakes region.

      - North Carolina is a southern state, located along the Atlantic coast in the
      southeastern United States.

      - Pennsylvania is entirely north of North Carolina.


      ## Step 3: Conclusion

      Since Pennsylvania is located north of North Carolina, and these water bodies
      are within their respective states, Allegheny Reservoir in PA must be north
      of High Rock Lake in NC, not south of it.


      NO, Allegheny Reservoir, PA is not located south of High Rock Lake, NC. It is
      located north of it.'

      of Guist Creek Lake, KY and Walking Horse Hotel, TN to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Guist Creek Lake is in Kentucky (KY)

      - Walking Horse Hotel is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Kentucky and Tennessee.

      - Kentucky is located north of Tennessee (Kentucky borders Tennessee along Tennessee''s
      northern border)


      Step 3: Apply this general state relationship to the specific locations.

      - Since Guist Creek Lake is in Kentucky, and Kentucky is generally north of
      Tennessee, and Walking Horse Hotel is in Tennessee, Guist Creek Lake would typically
      be north of Walking Horse Hotel.


      Step 4: Determine if there are any exceptions to consider.

      - While state borders can be irregular, the general north-south relationship
      between Kentucky and Tennessee is consistent.

      - Without specific coordinates indicating an unusual location near the border,
      I should rely on the general geographic relationship.


      NO (Guist Creek Lake, KY is not south of Walking Horse Hotel, TN, but rather

      a location in Kentucky (like Guist Creek Lake) would typically be north of a
      location in Tennessee (like Walking Horse Hotel).


      Step 5: For a Kentucky location to be south of a Tennessee location would be
      unusual given their state boundaries, as it would require the Kentucky location
      to be in a southern part of Kentucky that dips below a northern part of Tennessee,
      which isn''t the typical arrangement of these states.


      Based on this geographic reasoning about the relative positions of Kentucky
      and Tennessee, Guist Creek Lake in Kentucky is almost certainly north of Walking
      Horse Hotel in Tennessee, not south of it.

      Step 2: Let me identify where Barker Reservoir, TX is located.

      Barker Reservoir is located in southeast Texas, specifically in the Houston
      metropolitan area.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      Arkansas is located north of Texas on the map of the United States. However,
      I need to be more specific about these particular locations.


      Step 4: More precise comparison.

      DeGray Lake is in southwestern Arkansas, while Barker Reservoir is in southeastern
      Texas (Houston area). On a north-south axis, Arkansas is entirely north of Texas,
      meaning any location in Arkansas would be north of any location in Texas.


      NO. DeGray Lake, AR is NOT located south of Barker Reservoir, TX. It is located
      north of it, since Arkansas is north of Texas.'

      - Barker Reservoir, being in southeastern Texas (Houston area), is in the southern
      portion of Texas


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since DeGray Lake is in Arkansas (a state north of Texas), and Barker Reservoir
      is in southern Texas, DeGray Lake would be north of Barker Reservoir, not south.


      NO, DeGray Lake, AR is not located south of Barker Reservoir, TX. It is located

      - New York state is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region, south of New York.


      Step 3: Since Rondout Reservoir is in New York, and Lake Centennial is in Maryland,
      and New York is north of Maryland, Rondout Reservoir must be north of Lake Centennial.

      - Indiana is a state located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is a state located in the southeastern United States

      - Geographically, Indiana is north of Tennessee


      Step 3: Since Griffy Lake is in Indiana, and Arnold Engineering Development
      Complex is in Tennessee, and Indiana is north of Tennessee, Griffy Lake cannot
      be south of the Arnold Engineering Development Complex.


      NO'
    fbdb12d8-a920-453b-a4d2-7bae8da51604: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Griffy Lake is in Indiana (IN)

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions.

      - Indiana is a state in the northern part of the United States

      - Tennessee is a state south of Indiana


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Griffy Lake is in Bloomington, Indiana, in the southern part of Indiana

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tullahoma, Tennessee, in the
      central part of Tennessee


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Even though Griffy Lake is in southern Indiana, Indiana as a whole is north
      of Tennessee

      - The southernmost parts of Indiana are still generally north of central Tennessee


      Step 5: Make the final determination.

      - Since Indiana is north of Tennessee, and Griffy Lake is in Indiana while Arnold
      Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, Griffy Lake would be north
      of the complex, not south.


      NO, Griffy Lake, IN is not located south of Arnold Engineering Development Complex,
      TN. It is located north of it.'
    fbfd8286-ff25-4361-8710-dcacdf40f51e: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both places.

      - Griffy Lake is in Indiana (IN)

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Indiana is a state that is north of Tennessee

      - States in the US are generally arranged with northern states above southern
      states


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within these states.

      - Even though Griffy Lake is in southern Indiana, Indiana as a whole is still
      north of Tennessee

      - The Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, which is south
      of Indiana

      - The specific locations within their states wouldn''t change the general north-south
      relationship between these two states


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geographic positions.

      - Since Indiana is north of Tennessee, Griffy Lake (IN) would be north of the
      Arnold Engineering Development Complex (TN), not south of it


      NO, Griffy Lake, IN is not located south of Arnold Engineering Development Complex,
      TN. It is located north of it.'
