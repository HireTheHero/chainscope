      1. **Identify the location of Little Goose Dam, WA**: Little Goose Dam is located
      on the Snake River in southeastern Washington.


      2. **Identify the location of Anderson Ranch Dam, ID**: Anderson Ranch Dam is
      located on the South Fork of the Boise River in southwestern Idaho.


      3. **Compare the latitudes of the two locations**: Washington is generally north
      of Idaho, but specific locations need to be compared. Little Goose Dam is at
      a latitude of approximately 46.6 degrees north. Anderson Ranch Dam is at a latitude
      of approximately 43.5 degrees north.


      Since 46.6 degrees north is greater than 43.5 degrees north, Little Goose Dam
      is indeed north of Anderson Ranch Dam.

      the relative geographical locations of Star Lite Motel in Minnesota (MN) and
      Lewis and Clark Lake in Nebraska (NE).


      1. **Location of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE**: Lewis and Clark Lake is located
      on the border of South Dakota (SD) and Nebraska (NE). The lake is primarily
      in the northeastern part of Nebraska, along the Missouri River.


      2. **Location of Star Lite Motel, MN**: To accurately answer the question, we
      would need to identify the specific location of the Star Lite Motel in Minnesota,
      since Minnesota is a large state. However, without the specific city or town,
      we can consider the general positioning of Minnesota relative to Nebraska. Minnesota
      is located north of Nebraska.


      3. **Comparison**: Since Minnesota is north of Nebraska, any location within
      Minnesota, including the Star Lite Motel, would generally be north of Lewis
      and Clark Lake, located in northeastern Nebraska.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      NO, Star Lite Motel, MN is not located south of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE.'

      down the process into the following steps:


      1. **Identify the location of Star Lite Motel, MN**: First, we need to determine
      the general location of the Star Lite Motel within Minnesota. Minnesota is a
      state in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada to the north.


      2. **Identify the location of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE**: Lewis and Clark Lake
      is a reservoir located on the border between Nebraska and South Dakota, primarily

      3. **Compare the latitudinal positions**: Since Minnesota is located north of
      Nebraska, and Lewis and Clark Lake is positioned near the northern border of
      Nebraska and southern South Dakota, it is likely that any location in Minnesota,
      including the Star Lite Motel, would be north of Lewis and Clark Lake.
