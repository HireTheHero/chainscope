      Anderson Ranch Dam is located in southwestern Idaho.


      Looking at a map, I can see that Little Goose Dam is further north than Anderson
      Ranch Dam.


      Therefore, Little Goose Dam is NOT located south of Anderson Ranch Dam.


      The answer is: NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Little Goose Dam, WA:

      - Little Goose Dam is located on the Snake River in Washington state


      2. Next, I''ll locate Anderson Ranch Dam, ID:

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is located on the South Fork Boise River in Idaho


      3. Now I''ll consider their relative geographic positions:

      - Washington is north of Idaho

      - The Snake River flows through southeastern Washington and southwestern Idaho

      - Therefore, Little Goose Dam (in Washington) would actually be NORTH of Anderson
      Ranch Dam (in Idaho)


      4. The question asks: "Is Little Goose Dam, WA located south of Anderson Ranch

      Lake, Illinois.


      5. Therefore, St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church is north of Bayles
      Lake.


      6. The question asks if Bayles Lake is south of the church.


      7. Since the church is actually north of Bayles Lake, the answer is NO.

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Nashville is located in north-central Tennessee, while Lewis Smith Lake is in
      north-central Alabama.


      Looking at a map, Nashville is north of Lewis Smith Lake.


      Since the Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville, and Nashville is north

      1. First, let''s clarify the location references:

      - UCCU Center

      - UT (University of Texas?)

      - Black Canyon Lake

      - Arizona (AZ)


      2. I notice some potential geographical inconsistencies:

      - UCCU Center is typically associated with Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah

      - Black Canyon Lake is located in Arizona

      - The location references seem mixed


      3. To definitively answer the question, I would need to confirm:

      - The exact location of UCCU Center

      - The precise location of Black Canyon Lake


      4. Based on my current geographical knowledge:

      - UCCU Center is in Utah, not Arizona

      - Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona

      - They are in different states


      5. Therefore, the question cannot be answered with a simple geographic relationship
      between these two locations.


      However, since the question requires a YES or NO answer, and I cannot confidently
      place UCCU Center south of Black Canyon Lake, I will default to:


      NO'

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: St. Matthew Cathedral is located in South Bend, which is in the northern
      part of Indiana, near the Michigan border.


      Step 2: Brookville Lake Dam is located in southeastern Indiana, in Franklin
      County.


      Step 3: By comparing their locations, St. Matthew Cathedral is significantly
      north of Brookville Lake Dam.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.


      St. Matthew Cathedral is NOT located south of Brookville Lake Dam.'
