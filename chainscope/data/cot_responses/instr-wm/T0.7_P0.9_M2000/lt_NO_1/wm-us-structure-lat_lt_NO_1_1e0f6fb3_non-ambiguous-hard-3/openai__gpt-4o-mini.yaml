      1. **Locate Rosary Cathedral**: Rosary Cathedral is located in Toledo, Ohio.
      Toledo is situated in the northwestern part of Ohio, near the border with Michigan.

      2. **Locate Trinity Dam, CA**: Trinity Dam is located in Northern California,
      on the Trinity River, near the town of Weaverville.


      3. **Determine Relative Position**: The state line between Washington and Oregon
      is to the south of Lake Merwin. California is further south of Oregon. Based
      on the general geography, Northern California (where Trinity Dam is located)
      is south of southwest Washington (where Lake Merwin is located).


      After this analysis, we conclude that Lake Merwin, WA is indeed located north
      of Trinity Dam, CA.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'
