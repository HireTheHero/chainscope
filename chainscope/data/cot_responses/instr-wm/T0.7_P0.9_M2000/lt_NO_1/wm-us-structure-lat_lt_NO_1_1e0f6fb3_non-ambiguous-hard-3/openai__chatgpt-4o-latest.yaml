      OR, we need to compare their geographic locations in terms of latitude.


      ### Step 1: Identify the location of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral

      - St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is located in Seattle, Washington.

      - Seattle is generally in the northern part of the U.S. state of Washington.


      ### Step 2: Identify the location of Aladdin Theater

      - The Aladdin Theater is located in Portland, Oregon.

      - Portland is south of Seattle, in the northern part of Oregon.


      ### Step 3: Compare geographic positions

      - Seattle, WA is located at a higher latitude than Portland, OR, meaning it
      is farther north.

      - Therefore, St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral, being in Seattle, is north of
      the Aladdin Theater in Portland.


      ### Conclusion:

      Since Seattle is north of Portland, the cathedral in Seattle is not south of
      the theater in Portland.
