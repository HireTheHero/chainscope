    6923530f-6926-4953-ac11-31f126a6695e: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Lac qui Parle, MN:** This is in western Minnesota. A quick mental
      map or check shows it''s quite far north in the US.


      2.  **Locate Tuttle Creek Lake, KS:** This is near Manhattan, Kansas. Kansas
      is a plains state, generally in the central part of the US, and significantly
      south of Minnesota.


      3.  **Compare Latitudes:** Without even looking up precise coordinates, it''s
      clear from a general understanding of US geography that Minnesota is much further
      north than Kansas. If something is "north" of something else, then the "something
      else" is "south" of the first thing.


      4.  **Formulate the answer to the question:** The question asks if Lac qui Parle,
      MN is *south* of Tuttle Creek Lake, KS. Since Minnesota is north of Kansas,
      it means Lac qui Parle, MN is *north* of Tuttle Creek Lake, KS.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Lac qui Parle, MN located south of
      Tuttle Creek Lake, KS?" is:


      NO'

      \n3.  **Re-evaluating \"Edison Theatre, NY\":** The wording \"Edison Theatre,\
      \ NY\" is crucial. If it's *any* Edison Theatre in New York, we need to consider\
      \ the full latitudinal range of New York State.\n\n    *   New York State's\

      \ is north of 43.4\xB0N.\n\n    *   However, if it refers to a more common \"\
      Edison Theatre\" in New York City or even central New York, it would be south.\n\
      \n4.  **Addressing the Ambiguity and Finding the *Most Likely* Interpretation:**\
      \ When a specific name like \"Edison Theatre, NY\" is given without a city,\
      \ it usually points to a prominent or singular entity. There isn't a universally\
      \ famous \"Edison Theatre\" in New York that immediately comes to mind *outside*\
      \ of NYC. The most famous \"Edison Theatre\" *associated with a university*\
      \ is in St. Louis, MO, which is explicitly *not* NY.\n\n    If the question\
      \ *intended* for it to be north, it would likely specify a northern NY city\
      \ (e.g., \"Edison Theatre in Plattsburgh, NY\"). Without that, the default assumption\
      \ for \"NY\" for a general landmark is often New York City or the more populated,\
      \ southern/central parts of the state.\n\n    However, the question asks \"\
      is Lake Rescue (Vermont), VT located south of Edison Theatre, NY?\". This means\
      \ we need to find *any* possible \"Edison Theatre, NY\" that would make the\
      \ statement true or false.\n\n    Let's consider the *possibility* of an Edison\
      \ Theatre in northern NY. A quick search reveals that there isn't a widely known\
      \ \"Edison Theatre\" in northern New York. The most famous one *in New York*\
      \ is indeed in NYC.\n\n    But, let's assume for a moment there *could* be one\
      \ in northern NY. If so, Lake Rescue (43.4\xB0N) would *not* be south of it\
      \ if it were north of 43.4\xB0N.\n\n    However, the phrasing \"Edison Theatre,\
      \ NY\" without further specificity strongly implies a singular, recognizable\
      \ location. The only prominent \"Edison Theatre\" in New York is in New York\
      \ City (or former theatres in NYC).\n\n    *   Lake Rescue, VT: ~43.4\xB0N\n\
      \    *   Edison Theatre (NYC): ~40.7\xB0N\n\n    If the Edison Theatre is in\
      \ NYC, then Lake Rescue (43.4\xB0N) is *north* of it (40.7\xB0N). Therefore,\
      \ Lake Rescue is *not* located south of the Edison Theatre in NYC.\n\n    Let's\
      \ re-read the question carefully: \"Is Lake Rescue (Vermont), VT located south\
      \ of Edison Theatre, NY?\"\n\n    If Edison Theatre, NY is in NYC (40.7\xB0\
      N), and Lake Rescue, VT is at 43.4\xB0N, then Lake Rescue is *north* of the\
      \ Edison Theatre. So, the answer would be NO.\n\n    But what if there's an\
      \ obscure \"Edison Theatre\" far up north in NY? Like in Plattsburgh (44.7\xB0\
      N)? In that case, Lake Rescue (43.4\xB0N) *would* be south of it. This makes\
      \ the question tricky due to the lack of a specific city for the theatre.\n\n\
      \    However, for a \"YES or NO\" question, we typically look for the most common\
      \ or intended interpretation. The most prominent \"Edison Theatre\" in New York\
      \ is in New York City.\n\n    Let's assume the most prominent \"Edison Theatre\"\
      \ in New York, which is the Edison Ballroom/former Edison Theatre in New York\
      \ City.\n    *   Lake Rescue, VT: approximately 43.4\xB0 N latitude.\n    *\
      \   Edison Theatre, New York City, NY: approximately 40.7\xB0 N latitude.\n\n\
      \    Since 43.4\xB0 N is *greater* than 40.7\xB0 N, Lake Rescue is *north* of\
      \ the Edison Theatre in New York City.\n\n    Therefore, Lake Rescue is *not*\
      \ located south of the Edison Theatre in New York City.\n\n    If there were\
      \ an \"Edison Theatre\" in northern New York (e.g., Plattsburgh, NY, at approx.\
      \ 44.7\xB0 N), then Lake Rescue (43.4\xB0 N) *would* be south of it. The ambiguity\
      \ of \"Edison Theatre, NY\" without a specific city is the core of the problem.\n\
      \n    However, in such questions, the lack of specificity usually points to\
      \ the most well-known or central location. The most well-known \"Edison Theatre\"\
      \ in New York is in NYC.\n\n    Let's try to find an Edison Theatre in NY that\
      \ would make it \"YES\". If \"Edison Theatre, NY\" refers to something in the\
      \ very northern part of NY state, for example, near the Canadian border (around\
      \ 45\xB0N), then Lake Rescue (43.4\xB0N) would indeed be south of it.\n\n  \
      \  Is there a famous \"Edison Theatre\" in northern New York? A quick search\
      \ doesn't reveal one that would be considered a general landmark. The \"Edison\
      \ Theatre\" is overwhelmingly associated with NYC.\n\n    Given the phrasing,\
      \ and the common understanding of geographical references:\n\n    *   Lake Rescue,\
      \ VT location (Ludlow): ~43.4\xB0N\n    *   Edison Theatre, NY (most prominent,\
      \ NYC): ~40.7\xB0N\n\n    Since 43.4\xB0N is north of 40.7\xB0N, Lake Rescue\
      \ is *north* of the Edison Theatre in NYC.\n\n    Therefore, the statement \"\
      Is Lake Rescue (Vermont), VT located south of Edison Theatre, NY?\" would be\
      \ false under this most common interpretation.\n\n    However, the question\
      \ *only* asks for a YES or NO. If *any* \"Edison Theatre, NY\" exists that fulfills\
      \ the condition, then the answer is YES. If *none* exists, the answer is NO.\n\
      \n    Let's consider the full latitudinal range of New York:\n    *   Southernmost\
      \ point: ~40.5\xB0 N\n    *   Northernmost point: ~45.0\xB0 N\n\n    Lake Rescue,\
      \ VT is at ~43.4\xB0 N.\n\n    If there is an \"Edison Theatre\" at 44\xB0 N\
      \ in NY, then Lake Rescue (43.4\xB0 N) *is* south of it.\n    If there is an\
      \ \"Edison Theatre\" at 42\xB0 N in NY, then Lake Rescue (43.4\xB0 N) *is not*\
      \ south of it.\n\n    Since the question does not specify *which* Edison Theatre\
      \ in NY, and it is *possible* for an Edison Theatre to exist in northern NY\
      \ (even if not famous), which would place Lake Rescue to its south, the answer\
      \ should be YES if *any* such location exists.\n\n    However, the typical interpretation\
      \ of such questions (without further specifying the city/region) leans towards\
      \ the most prominent or default location. The most prominent \"Edison Theatre\"\
      \ in NY is in NYC.\n\n    Let's assume the question is not a trick question\
      \ about an obscure, non-famous theatre. If it refers to the most commonly recognized\

      **Step 1: Locate Youghiogheny River Lake, PA**

      *   Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania.


      **Step 2: Locate R. D. Bailey Lake, WV**

      *   R. D. Bailey Lake is in southern West Virginia.


      **Step 3: Compare their relative positions (North/South)**

      *   Pennsylvania is generally north of West Virginia.

      *   Even though Youghiogheny River Lake is in *southwestern* PA and R.D. Bailey
      Lake is in *southern* WV, Pennsylvania itself is further north on the map.

      *   If you look at a map, Youghiogheny River Lake is clearly situated to the
      north of R. D. Bailey Lake.


      **Conclusion:** Youghiogheny River Lake, PA is *not* located south of R. D.
      Bailey Lake, WV. It is located to the north.
