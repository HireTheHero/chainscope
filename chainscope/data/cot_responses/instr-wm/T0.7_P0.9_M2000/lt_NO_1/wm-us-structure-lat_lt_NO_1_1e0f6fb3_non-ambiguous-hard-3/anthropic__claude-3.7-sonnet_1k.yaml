      1. Is Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus (Knoxville, Tennessee), TN
      located south of Lake Martin, AL?


      I need to determine the relative geographical positions of:

      - Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in Knoxville, Tennessee

      - Lake Martin, Alabama


      First, let me establish where these locations are:

      - Knoxville is in eastern Tennessee, in the southern United States

      - Lake Martin is in Alabama, which is south of Tennessee


      The general geography of these states is:

      - Tennessee is directly north of Alabama

      - Tennessee borders Alabama along Alabama''s northern border


      Since Knoxville is in Tennessee, and Tennessee is north of Alabama, Knoxville
      would be north of most places in Alabama, including Lake Martin.


      Therefore, the Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in Knoxville, Tennessee
      would be NORTH of Lake Martin, Alabama - not south of it.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these two
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - The Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus is in Knoxville, Tennessee

      - Lake Martin is in Alabama


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Tennessee and Alabama.

      - Tennessee is located directly north of Alabama

      - Alabama shares its northern border with Tennessee


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - Knoxville is in eastern Tennessee

      - Lake Martin is in central/eastern Alabama


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Since Tennessee is north of Alabama, and Knoxville is in Tennessee while Lake
      Martin is in Alabama, the Cathedral in Knoxville would be north of Lake Martin,
      not south of it.

      locations of two places:

      1. Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in Knoxville, Tennessee

      2. Lake Martin in Alabama


      First, let me identify where Knoxville, Tennessee is located. Knoxville is in
      eastern Tennessee, near the border with North Carolina.


      Next, let me identify where Lake Martin is in Alabama. Lake Martin is a reservoir
      located in central Alabama.


      Now I need to determine whether Knoxville, TN is south of Lake Martin, AL.


      Tennessee is generally north of Alabama. Alabama is on the Gulf Coast, while
      Tennessee is further inland and north. Specifically, Knoxville is in the eastern
      part of Tennessee, which would still put it north of central Alabama where Lake
      Martin is located.


      So Knoxville, Tennessee (where the Cathedral is located) should be north of
      Lake Martin, Alabama - not south of it.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative geographical positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus.

      This cathedral is in Knoxville, Tennessee, which is located in the eastern part
      of Tennessee.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Martin.

      Lake Martin is a reservoir located in central Alabama.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Tennessee is entirely north of Alabama on the map of the United States. Knoxville
      is in eastern Tennessee, which is still positioned north of central Alabama
      where Lake Martin is located.


      Step 4: Determine directional relationship.

      Since Knoxville, TN is north of Lake Martin, AL, the Cathedral of the Most Sacred
      Heart of Jesus cannot be south of Lake Martin.

      - Knoxville is in eastern Tennessee.

      - Lake Martin is in east-central Alabama.


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      First, Gavins Point Dam is located on the Missouri River at the Nebraska-South
      Dakota border. It''s in the northeastern part of Nebraska.


      Nichols Hall is likely on a university campus in Kansas. Kansas State University

      Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada, while Kansas is located in
      the central United States.


      3. Generally speaking, Minnesota is north of Kansas. States in the US are arranged
      roughly with northern states being at higher latitudes than southern states.


      4. Since Lac qui Parle is in Minnesota, and Tuttle Creek Lake is in Kansas,

      2. Kewaunee Power Station would be in Wisconsin.

      3. Chicago Avenue Pumping Station would be in Chicago, Illinois.

      - Wisconsin is a state that borders Illinois to the north

      - Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, on Lake Michigan

      - Kewaunee is likely in eastern Wisconsin, possibly also on Lake Michigan


      Given the general geography of these states, a location in Wisconsin would typically

      1. The question is asking about the relative positions of two places: Council
      Grove Lake, KS (Kansas) and One Main Place in Dallas, TX (Texas).


      2. Specifically, I need to determine if Council Grove Lake is south of One Main
      Place.


      3. First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of Kansas and Texas.
      Kansas is a state in the central United States, while Texas is in the south-central
      United States. Generally, Kansas is north of Texas.


      4. Council Grove Lake would be somewhere in Kansas, while One Main Place would
      be in Dallas, which is in northern Texas.


      5. Since Kansas is generally north of Texas, and Dallas is in northern Texas,
      it''s very likely that Council Grove Lake in Kansas is north of One Main Place
      in Dallas, Texas.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Kansas is located directly north of Oklahoma, which borders Texas to the north.
      This means Kansas is north of Texas.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Council Grove Lake is in Kansas

      - Dallas is in northern Texas, but still within Texas


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      Since Kansas is entirely north of Texas, and Council Grove Lake is in Kansas
      while One Main Place is in Dallas, Texas, Council Grove Lake must be north of
      One Main Place.


      NO, Council Grove Lake, KS is not located south of One Main Place in Dallas,

      To answer this, I need to think about the relative positions of Pennsylvania
      and North Carolina:

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern part of the United States


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of North Carolina

      - This means that locations in Pennsylvania are typically north of locations

      To answer this, I need to determine the relative positions of these lakes. Pennsylvania
      is a northern state, while North Carolina is a southern state in the US.


      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, bordering New York
      to the north, Ohio to the west, West Virginia to the southwest, Maryland to
      the south, Delaware to the southeast, and New Jersey to the east.


      North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States, much further south
      than Pennsylvania. North Carolina borders Virginia to the north, Tennessee to
      the west, Georgia and South Carolina to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to
      the east.


      Since Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina in general, and East Branch Clarion
      River Lake is in Pennsylvania while Badin Lake is in North Carolina, it''s almost
      certain that East Branch Clarion River Lake is located NORTH of Badin Lake,
      not south of it.


      So the answer would be NO, East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA is not located

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Pennsylvania is substantially north of North Carolina

      - Lakes within these states generally follow this same north-south relationship

      the relative positions of two locations:

      1. Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio

      2. South Holston Lake in Tennessee


      I need to determine if the location in Ohio is south of the location in Tennessee.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Ohio is a northern state, bordering Lake Erie

      - Tennessee is south of Ohio

      - Generally speaking, locations in Ohio would be north of locations in Tennessee


      North Jackson, Ohio would be in Ohio, so it would be north of Tennessee. South
      Holston Lake is in Tennessee, so the Basilica in North Jackson, Ohio would be
      north of South Holston Lake in Tennessee, not south of it.


      So the answer should be NO, the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of
      Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio is NOT located south of South Holston Lake, Tennessee.</think>I
      need to determine the relative geographical positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      Ohio is located in the northern United States, while Tennessee is located in
      the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Determine the north-south relationship between these states.

      Ohio is geographically north of Tennessee. Looking at a U.S. map, Tennessee
      sits below (south of) Ohio.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations.

      North Jackson, Ohio is in Ohio, so it inherits the state''s northern position.

      South Holston Lake is in Tennessee, so it inherits Tennessee''s southern position.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about their relative positions.

      Since Ohio is north of Tennessee, the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady
      of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio must be north of South Holston Lake in Tennessee
      - not south of it.

      1) North Jackson, Ohio is in Ohio state, which is generally north of Tennessee
      state.

      2) South Holston Lake is in Tennessee (TN), as indicated in the question.

      3) In the United States, Ohio is located north of Tennessee. Ohio borders Kentucky

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the Southeastern United States

      - Ohio is positioned north of Tennessee on a map


      Step 3: Confirm the specific locations.

      - North Jackson, Ohio is in northeastern Ohio

      - South Holston Lake is in northeastern Tennessee

      - Even within these states, the general north-south relationship holds


      Since Ohio is north of Tennessee geographically, the Basilica and National Shrine

      1. Little Goose Dam in Washington state (WA)

      2. Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho (ID)


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.
      If Little Goose Dam has a lower latitude than Anderson Ranch Dam, then Little
      Goose Dam is south of Anderson Ranch Dam.


      Let me recall what I know about these dams:


      Little Goose Dam is on the Snake River in Washington state. The Snake River
      generally flows west through southern Idaho, then turns north to form part of
      the Idaho-Oregon border, then turns west again into Washington.


      Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho, likely on a river system in that state.


      Based on the general geography of the northwest US:

      - Washington state is north of Idaho

      - The Snake River in Washington is in the southern part of the state

      - Idaho extends quite far south


      Given that Little Goose Dam is in Washington (a northern state) and on the Snake
      River (which flows through southern Idaho before reaching Washington), it''s
      most likely that Little Goose Dam is north of Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho. This
      is because to reach Washington, the Snake River flows northward from Idaho.


      So my reasoning suggests that Little Goose Dam is NOT south of Anderson Ranch
      Dam, but rather north of it.</think># Is Little Goose Dam, WA located south
      of Anderson Ranch Dam, ID?


      I need to consider the geographic locations of these two dams:


      1. Little Goose Dam is located on the Snake River in southeastern Washington
      state.

      2. Anderson Ranch Dam is located in south-central Idaho.


      Looking at the geography of the Pacific Northwest:

      - Washington state is generally north of Idaho

      - The Snake River flows from eastern Idaho, turns north along the Idaho-Oregon
      border, then west into Washington

      - Little Goose Dam is in the southern part of Washington

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is in the central-southern region of Idaho


      Based on these locations, Little Goose Dam in Washington would be positioned
      to the northwest of Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho. Since "north" is the key directional
      difference here, Little Goose Dam would not be south of Anderson Ranch Dam.

      1. Little Goose Dam is located in Washington state (WA)

      2. Anderson Ranch Dam is located in Idaho state (ID)


      I need to figure out their relative positions to determine if Little Goose Dam
      is south of Anderson Ranch Dam.


      Washington state is generally north of Idaho, but their borders are complex.
      I need to identify where these specific dams are located within their respective
      states.


      Little Goose Dam is on the Snake River in southeastern Washington.

      Anderson Ranch Dam is on the South Fork of the Boise River in southwestern Idaho.


      The Snake River forms part of the border between Idaho and Oregon/Washington,
      and runs generally westward through southern Idaho and then northward along
      the Idaho-Oregon border before entering Washington.


      Given this geography:

      - Little Goose Dam on the Snake River in Washington would be in the southeastern
      part of Washington

      - Anderson Ranch Dam on the South Fork of the Boise River would be in southwestern
      Idaho


      Since Washington is north of Idaho, and Little Goose Dam is in southeastern
      Washington while Anderson Ranch Dam is in southwestern Idaho, Little Goose Dam
      is likely north of Anderson Ranch Dam, not south.


      Therefore, Little Goose Dam is NOT south of Anderson Ranch Dam.</think>I need
      to determine the relative geographic positions of these two dams.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both dams.

      - Little Goose Dam is located on the Snake River in southeastern Washington
      (WA).

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is located on the South Fork of the Boise River in southwestern
      Idaho (ID).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Washington and Idaho.

      - Washington state is generally positioned to the north and west of Idaho.

      - The Snake River flows through southern Idaho, forms part of the Idaho-Oregon
      border, then turns and flows west into Washington.


      Step 3: Determine their relative north-south positioning.

      - Little Goose Dam, being in southeastern Washington on the Snake River, is
      in the northern part of this river system.

      - Anderson Ranch Dam, being in southwestern Idaho, is positioned farther south.

      - Washington''s southern border is north of Idaho''s central region where Anderson
      Ranch Dam is located.


      NO. Little Goose Dam is not south of Anderson Ranch Dam; it is north of it.'

      2. Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho (ID)


      Let me think about their geographic locations:


      Little Goose Dam is located on the Snake River in Washington state. The Snake
      River runs through the southern part of Washington state.


      Anderson Ranch Dam is located in Idaho. Idaho is east of Washington state. Within
      Idaho, the Anderson Ranch Dam is on the South Fork of the Boise River in southwestern
      Idaho.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Washington state is generally north of Idaho, though their borders are not
      strictly horizontal

      - The Snake River in southern Washington runs along part of the Washington-Idaho
      border

      - Little Goose Dam is in the southeastern part of Washington

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is in southwestern Idaho


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, Little Goose Dam in Washington would
      be located north of Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho. Washington is more northern
      than Idaho, and particularly for these locations, Little Goose Dam would be
      in the northern part of the Snake River system while Anderson Ranch Dam would
      be further south in Idaho.

      it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two

      - Little Goose Dam is located on the Snake River in southeastern Washington

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is located on the South Fork of the Boise River in southwestern
      Idaho.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Washington and Idaho.

      - Washington state is generally north of Idaho, though they share an irregular
      border.

      - The Snake River forms part of the Washington-Idaho border in some areas.


      Step 3: Determine their specific positions.

      - Little Goose Dam is in the Snake River system in Washington, near the towns
      of Starbuck and Riparia.

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is in the Boise River watershed in southwestern Idaho,
      northeast of Boise.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Little Goose Dam is located in the more northern state (Washington).

      - Within these states'' relative positions, Little Goose Dam sits at a higher
      latitude than Anderson Ranch Dam.

      1. Little Goose Dam is located on the Snake River in Washington state. The Snake
      River flows generally west through southern Washington.


      2. Anderson Ranch Dam is located in Idaho. Idaho is east of Washington state.


      However, that''s not enough information to determine if one is south of the
      other. I need to know their north-south positioning (latitude).


      Little Goose Dam is in southeastern Washington on the Snake River.

      Anderson Ranch Dam is in southwestern Idaho on the South Fork of the Boise River.


      The Snake River forms part of the border between Idaho and Oregon/Washington,
      flowing generally westward. The Snake River is in the southern part of Washington
      state.


      Idaho is positioned such that most of it is north of Nevada and Utah, and east
      of Washington and Oregon.


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, the Snake River in Washington (where
      Little Goose Dam is) is generally in the southern part of Washington, but still
      in the northern part of the overall region. Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho is likely
      further south, since it''s on the Boise River system in southwestern Idaho.

      the relative geographical positions of two locations in the US:

      1. North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory in New York (NY)

      2. AFI Silver in Maryland (MD)


      I need to determine if the first location is south of the second.


      First, let me consider the states:

      - North Tonawanda is in New York state, which is in the northeastern US

      - AFI Silver is in Maryland, which is south of New York


      Maryland is generally south of New York state. So geographically speaking, a
      location in New York would be north of a location in Maryland, not south of
      it.


      To be more specific:

      - North Tonawanda would be in western or northern New York (I believe it''s
      near Buffalo in western NY)

      - AFI Silver is likely in the Maryland area (possibly near Washington DC or
      Baltimore)


      Since New York is north of Maryland, North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory would
      be north of AFI Silver, not south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative
      geographical positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are situated.

      - North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory is in New York (NY)

      - AFI Silver is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      New York is located in the northeastern United States, while Maryland is located
      in the mid-Atlantic region, south of New York.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      Since North Tonawanda is in New York, and New York is north of Maryland (where
      AFI Silver is located), the North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory must be north
      of AFI Silver, not south of it.


      NO (North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory is not south of AFI Silver, it is north
      of it)'

      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the Thousand Islands region of the
      St. Lawrence River in northern New York state, near the US-Canada border.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Shofuso Japanese House and Garden, PA.

      Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is located in Philadelphia, in the southeastern
      part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Northern New York state is geographically north of Pennsylvania. The Thousand

      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Boldt Castle is in northern NY near the Canadian border, and Shofuso is

      ## Step 1: Locate Boldt Castle, NY

      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the Thousand Islands region of the
      St. Lawrence River in Alexandria Bay, New York. This area is in the far northern
      part of New York State, near the Canadian border.


      ## Step 2: Locate Shofuso Japanese House and Garden, PA

      Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is located in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania. Philadelphia is in the southeastern portion of Pennsylvania.


      ## Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      New York State is generally north of Pennsylvania. The Thousand Islands region
      where Boldt Castle is situated is at the northern edge of New York State, while
      Philadelphia is in the southern portion of Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, Boldt Castle is significantly NORTH of Shofuso Japanese House and

      1. Boldt Castle is located in Alexandria Bay, New York, which is in the Thousand
      Islands region of the St. Lawrence River in upstate New York, near the Canadian
      border. This is in the northern part of New York state.


      2. Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
      which is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      To determine if Boldt Castle is south of Shofuso, I need to compare their latitudes:

      - Northern New York (near the Canadian border) is quite far north in the US

      - Philadelphia is in the southern part of Pennsylvania


      Pennsylvania is generally south of New York state, and Philadelphia is in southern
      Pennsylvania, while Boldt Castle is in northern New York near Canada.


      Therefore, Boldt Castle is almost certainly north of Shofuso Japanese House
      and Garden, not south of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative geographic positions of these two landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both sites.

      - Boldt Castle is located in Alexandria Bay in the Thousand Islands region of
      northern New York, near the Canadian border.

      - Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
      in the southeastern part of that state.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Northern New York (especially near the Canadian border) is significantly further
      north in the United States.

      - Philadelphia is in the southern portion of Pennsylvania, which is generally
      south of New York State.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - Boldt Castle is in the northern part of New York State

      - Philadelphia (where Shofuso is located) is south of New York State


      NO, Boldt Castle is NOT located south of Shofuso Japanese House and Garden.
      It is located north of it.'

      Maine is the northernmost state in New England, while Rhode Island is in southern
      New England.


      Looking at these states north to south:

      - Maine (ME)

      - New Hampshire (NH)

      - Massachusetts (MA)

      - Rhode Island is also in the northeastern US, but is significantly further
      south than Maine


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Maine is north of Rhode Island, locations in Maine would generally be
      north of locations in Rhode Island

      - Lewiston is in central/southern Maine, but still well north of the Rhode Island
      border

      - The Scituate Reservoir is in central Rhode Island


      Therefore, the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston, Maine is located
      NORTH of the Scituate Reservoir in Rhode Island, not south of it.

      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is in Oklahoma,
      while the Blackstone Hotel is in Texas, the reservoir is likely north of the
      hotel, not south.</think># Reasoning Step by Step


      To determine if Robert S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma is located south of Blackstone
      Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas, I need to establish their relative geographic positions.


      1. **Robert S. Kerr Reservoir location**: This reservoir is located in eastern
      Oklahoma on the Arkansas River.


      2. **Blackstone Hotel location**: This historic hotel is in Fort Worth, which
      is in north-central Texas.


      3. **Comparing the locations**: Oklahoma is positioned directly north of Texas
      on the map. Since the reservoir is in Oklahoma and the hotel is in Texas, the
      reservoir must be north of the hotel.


      4. **Directional conclusion**: If the reservoir is north of the hotel, then
      it cannot be south of it.


      # Answer: NO


      Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is not located south of Blackstone Hotel; it''s located
      north of it.'

      2. Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas


      Let me think about their general locations:


      Oklahoma is generally north of Texas on the US map. So if the Robert S. Kerr
      Reservoir is in Oklahoma, and the Blackstone Hotel is in Fort Worth, Texas,
      then it''s likely that the reservoir is NOT south of the hotel.


      To be more precise:

      - Fort Worth is in north-central Texas

      - I need to determine where in Oklahoma the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is located


      The Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is likely in eastern Oklahoma on the Arkansas River.
      Eastern Oklahoma would still be north of Fort Worth, Texas.


      So based on the general geography of the United States, with Oklahoma being
      north of Texas, Robert S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma would NOT be south of the
      Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas.</think># Determining the North-South
      Relationship Between Two Locations


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of Robert
      S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma and the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is located in eastern Oklahoma

      - Blackstone Hotel is in Fort Worth, which is in north-central Texas


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of Oklahoma and Texas

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas on the US map

      - Fort Worth is situated in the northern portion of Texas

      - Even the southernmost parts of Oklahoma are generally north of Fort Worth


      ## Step 3: Make the comparison

      Since Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is in Oklahoma, and Oklahoma is north of Fort
      Worth, Texas, the reservoir cannot be south of the Blackstone Hotel.

      of the hotel.


      First, let''s locate Robert S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma:

      Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is in eastern Oklahoma, on the Arkansas River. Oklahoma
      is generally north of Texas.


      Next, let''s locate Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas:

      Fort Worth is a city in north-central Texas.


      Given that Oklahoma is generally north of Texas, and Robert S. Kerr Reservoir
      is in Oklahoma while the Blackstone Hotel is in Texas, the reservoir is likely
      north of the hotel, not south.


      However, I should be careful because borders can be irregular, and sometimes

      Step 2: Locate Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas.

      The Blackstone Hotel is in Fort Worth, which is in north-central Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas. The border between Oklahoma and Texas runs
      east-west, with Oklahoma positioned above Texas on the map. Even eastern Oklahoma
      (where Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is located) is north of north-central Texas
      (where Fort Worth is located).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, Robert S. Kerr Reservoir must be north of
      the Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, not south of it.

      Bayles Lake is in Illinois. Illinois is generally north of Missouri, as Missouri
      borders Illinois on its south. However, the exact locations within these states
      matter.


      Perryville, Missouri is in the eastern part of Missouri, not far from the Mississippi
      River which separates Missouri and Illinois.


      Bayles Lake, Illinois - I''m not entirely sure of its exact location, but I
      believe it''s in the eastern part of Illinois.


      If I were to make an educated guess:

      - Missouri is generally south of Illinois

      - Perryville is in southeastern Missouri

      - Bayles Lake is probably in central or northern Illinois


      This would suggest that Bayles Lake is likely north of St. Mary''s of the Barrens
      Catholic Church, which would make the answer "NO" - Bayles Lake is not south
      of the church.


      However, I should be careful about making assumptions without knowing the exact
      locations. Illinois extends quite far south, and its southern tip is actually
      south of parts of Missouri. So I can''t be completely certain without the exact

      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations
      by comparing their latitudes.


      ## Step 1: Locate Perryville, Missouri

      Perryville is located in eastern Missouri, near the Mississippi River border
      with Illinois. Missouri is generally south of Illinois.


      ## Step 2: Locate Bayles Lake, Illinois

      Bayles Lake is located in Iroquois County in east-central Illinois, near the
      town of Loda.


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      - Central/eastern Illinois is significantly north of the Missouri-Illinois border

      - Perryville, Missouri is in the southeastern part of Missouri

      - Illinois does extend far enough south to be below parts of Missouri, but Bayles
      Lake is not in southern Illinois - it''s in the central/northern portion of
      the state


      ## Conclusion: NO

      Bayles Lake in Illinois is located north of St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic
      Church in Perryville, Missouri, not south of it.'

      Let me locate each place:


      1. Bayles Lake, Illinois - This is a lake/community in Illinois

      2. St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church in Perryville, Missouri


      In general geographic terms:

      - Illinois is north of Missouri (Illinois is above Missouri on the map)

      - However, I need to be more specific about these particular locations


      Perryville, Missouri is in the southeastern part of Missouri, not far from the

      Missouri extends further south than Illinois. Since Perryville is in southeastern
      Missouri (relatively southern part of the state) and Bayles Lake is likely in

      I need to compare the geographic locations of these two places by examining

      ## Step 1: Locate both places

      - Bayles Lake is in east-central Illinois, near Loda

      - St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church is in Perryville, Missouri, which
      is in southeastern Missouri


      ## Step 2: Compare their relative positions

      - Illinois is generally north of Missouri on the US map

      - Perryville, MO is located in the southeastern part of Missouri, close to the
      Mississippi River

      - Bayles Lake is in the eastern part of central Illinois


      ## Step 3: Analyze latitude relationships

      - Southeastern Missouri (where Perryville is located) is generally south of
      central Illinois

      - Even though Illinois and Missouri border each other, Bayles Lake is in a more
      northern part of Illinois relative to Perryville''s position in Missouri


      Therefore, Bayles Lake in Illinois is NOT south of St. Mary''s of the Barrens

      - Utah (UT) is further south, located in the western United States but not bordering
      Canada


      In terms of their relative positions:

      - Montana is north of Utah

      Since Hebgen Lake is in Montana and Causey Reservoir is in Utah, and Montana
      is generally north of Utah, Hebgen Lake would be north of Causey Reservoir (not
      south of it).

      1) Hebgen Lake is in Montana (MT)

      2) Causey Reservoir is in Utah (UT)


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to know their relative positions.
      In the United States:

      - Montana is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - Utah is south of Montana


      Generally speaking, locations in Montana would be north of locations in Utah.
      However, I should be careful because specific locations within states could
      vary - a location in southern Montana could potentially be at a similar latitude
      as a location in northern Utah.


      But given the general geography:

      - Montana is entirely north of Utah

      - Therefore, Hebgen Lake in Montana would be north of Causey Reservoir in Utah

      - This means Hebgen Lake is NOT south of Causey Reservoir


      So the answer should be NO.</think>To answer whether Hebgen Lake, MT is located
      south of Causey Reservoir, UT, I need to consider their geographic locations.

      Utah is located south of Montana.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of these specific bodies of water.

      Since Montana is entirely north of Utah in terms of latitude, any lake in Montana
      (including Hebgen Lake) would be north of any reservoir in Utah (including Causey
      Reservoir).


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      First, I need to recall the general geographic relationship between Montana
      and Utah:

      - Montana is a state in the northwestern United States

      - Utah is southwest of Montana

      Yellowstone National Park.

      3) In terms of latitude, Montana is generally north of Utah

      4) Hebgen Lake specifically is in southwestern Montana, near Yellowstone National

      5) Causey Reservoir is in northern Utah, east of Ogden

      6) Even though Hebgen Lake is in southern Montana and Causey Reservoir is in

      But let me verify with more specific geographical knowledge. New York state
      extends north-south quite a bit, and Connecticut is east of parts of New York.

      2. **Battell Chapel, CT** is a chapel located on the Yale University campus

      - The Adirondack region of New York is significantly north of Connecticut

      - New Haven is located in southern Connecticut

      - Geographically, northern New York state (including the Adirondacks) is north

      to determine the relative geographical positions of Cranberry Lake, NY and Battell
      Chapel, CT.


      First, let me identify where these places are located:


      1. Cranberry Lake is in New York state (NY)

      2. Battell Chapel is in Connecticut (CT)


      I need to determine their approximate coordinates or at least their relative
      north-south positioning.


      Cranberry Lake, NY is likely in the Adirondack region of upstate New York, which
      is in the northern part of the state.


      Battell Chapel is likely at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, which
      is in the southern part of Connecticut.


      Geographically, New York state is generally north of Connecticut. The Adirondack
      region where Cranberry Lake is located would be even further north in New York.


      So, Cranberry Lake, NY is almost certainly north of Battell Chapel, CT - not
      south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two
      locations to answer whether one is south of the other.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Cranberry Lake is in New York state (NY)

      - Battell Chapel is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Determine their general positions.

      - Cranberry Lake, NY is located in the Adirondack region of northern New York
      state

      - Battell Chapel is located at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in
      the southern part of Connecticut


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - New York state is generally north of Connecticut

      - The Adirondack region where Cranberry Lake is located is in the northern part
      of New York, placing it even further north relative to Connecticut

      - New Haven, CT is in the southern portion of Connecticut


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on this geographic relationship.

      Since Cranberry Lake is in northern New York, and Connecticut (including New
      Haven where Battell Chapel is located) is south of this region, Cranberry Lake
      is north of Battell Chapel, not south of it.

      Cranberry Lake is a lake and a community in New York state, located in the Adirondack
      Mountains in St. Lawrence County in northern New York.


      Battell Chapel is likely located at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.


      New York state is generally north of Connecticut, with New York extending much
      further north than Connecticut does. The Adirondack region of New York where
      Cranberry Lake is located is in the northern part of the state.


      So if Cranberry Lake is in northern New York, and Battell Chapel is in Connecticut
      which is south of most of New York, then Cranberry Lake would be north of Battell
      Chapel, not south of it.


      Therefore, Cranberry Lake, NY is NOT located south of Battell Chapel, CT. It''s
      located north of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these

      - Battell Chapel is located at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - New York state is generally positioned north of Connecticut.

      - The Adirondack region where Cranberry Lake is situated is in the northern
      part of New York state.

      - New Haven, Connecticut is in the southern part of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Cranberry Lake is in northern New York, putting it at a higher latitude (more
      northerly position).

      - Battell Chapel in New Haven is at a lower latitude (more southerly position).


      Therefore, Cranberry Lake, NY is located NORTH of Battell Chapel, CT, not south

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)

      - Navajo Lake is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Colorado and New Mexico.

      Colorado is directly north of New Mexico in the United States. Colorado''s southern
      border connects with New Mexico''s northern border.


      Step 3: Since Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado and Navajo Lake is in New

      - Navajo Lake is located in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Colorado and New Mexico.

      Colorado is directly north of New Mexico. Colorado''s southern border connects
      with New Mexico''s northern border.


      Step 3: Analyze the specific locations within their states.

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is near Nederland in Boulder County, which is in the
      north-central part of Colorado.

      - Navajo Lake straddles the Colorado-New Mexico border in the northwestern part
      of New Mexico.


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes.

      Since Barker Meadow Reservoir is in northern Colorado, and Navajo Lake is in
      northern New Mexico (and partly in southern Colorado), Barker Meadow Reservoir
      would be north of Navajo Lake, not south.

      Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado (CO), while Navajo Lake is in New Mexico

      Generally speaking, Colorado is north of New Mexico since Colorado borders New

      To be more precise:

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is near Nederland, Colorado, in the north-central
      part of the state.

      - Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado-New Mexico border.


      Since Colorado is north of New Mexico, and Barker Meadow Reservoir is not in

      region of Colorado

      - Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado-New Mexico border


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Colorado is north of New Mexico, and Barker Meadow Reservoir is not in
      the extreme southern portion of Colorado (it''s actually in the northern half),
      it must be north of Navajo Lake, not south of it.

      to determine the geographic locations of Oologah Lake in Oklahoma and Lady Bird
      Lake in Texas, and compare their north-south positions.


      First, let me recall the general geography:

      - Oklahoma (OK) is generally north of Texas (TX)

      - Texas is along the southern border of the United States

      - Oklahoma borders Texas on its north side


      So just based on state positions, a lake in Oklahoma would typically be north
      of a lake in Texas.


      Let me think more specifically about these lakes:


      Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma, in the northeastern part of the state.

      Lady Bird Lake is in Texas, and I believe it''s in Austin, which is in central
      Texas.


      Given that Oklahoma is north of Texas, and these lakes are in their respective
      states, Oologah Lake should be north of Lady Bird Lake, not south of it.


      So to answer the question "Is Oologah Lake, OK located south of Lady Bird Lake,
      TX?" - the answer should be NO.</think># Is Oologah Lake, OK located south of
      Lady Bird Lake, TX?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Oologah Lake is located in northeastern Oklahoma (OK)

      - Lady Bird Lake is located in Austin, in central Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Oklahoma and Texas.

      - Oklahoma is positioned directly north of Texas on the US map

      - Texas is below Oklahoma, sharing a border along Oklahoma''s southern edge


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the lakes.

      - Since Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma, and Lady Bird Lake is in Texas

      - And Oklahoma is north of Texas

      - Oologah Lake must be north of Lady Bird Lake, not south of it

    045ba10f-4bc6-4448-a99e-f92f1cb3b576: '<think>Let me break this down:


      1. We need to determine the relative geographical positions of two locations:
      "Big Pink, NY" and "St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis, Maryland."


      2. I need to determine if Big Pink is south of St. Anne''s Church.


      First, let me identify the locations:


      Big Pink is likely referring to a building in New York. Based on my knowledge,
      there''s a building called "The Big Pink" or sometimes just "Big Pink" which
      is in West Saugerties, New York. This is where the rock group The Band recorded
      their first album in the late 1960s.


      St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis, Maryland is a historic church in the capital
      city of Maryland.


      Now for the geographical relationship:

      - New York is generally north of Maryland.

      - West Saugerties, NY (where Big Pink is located) is in upstate New York, which
      is definitely north of Maryland.

      - Annapolis, MD (where St. Anne''s Church is located) is in central Maryland,
      near the Chesapeake Bay.


      Since New York is north of Maryland, and specifically West Saugerties is in
      upstate New York, which is well north of Annapolis, Maryland, Big Pink is NOT
      south of St. Anne''s Church. Instead, Big Pink is north of St. Anne''s Church.</think>#
      Is Big Pink, NY located south of St. Anne''s Church (Annapolis, Maryland), MD?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Big Pink is a notable house located in West Saugerties, New York (in the northern
      part of NY state)

      - St. Anne''s Church is located in Annapolis, Maryland (in the mid-Atlantic
      region)


      ## Step 2: Compare their latitudes

      - New York state is generally located north of Maryland

      - West Saugerties is in upstate New York, which is firmly in the northern part
      of the state

      - Annapolis, Maryland is located in the central part of Maryland


      ## Step 3: Make the comparison

      Since New York state is north of Maryland, and West Saugerties (where Big Pink
      is located) is in the northern part of New York, Big Pink is located north of
      St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis, not south of it.

      a house in West Saugerties, New York, where Bob Dylan and The Band recorded
      "The Basement Tapes" in 1967. West Saugerties is in upstate New York, in the
      Hudson Valley region.


      St. Anne''s Church is located in Annapolis, Maryland. Annapolis is the capital
      city of Maryland, located on the Chesapeake Bay.


      Now I need to compare their north-south positions:

      - New York is generally north of Maryland

      - West Saugerties, NY is in upstate New York, which is definitely north of Maryland

      - Annapolis, MD is in the central part of Maryland

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Big Pink is a house located in West Saugerties, New York. It''s famous for
      being where Bob Dylan and The Band recorded "The Basement Tapes" in 1967.

      - St. Anne''s Church is located in Annapolis, Maryland, which is the state capital.

      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)

      - Oregon is located directly north of California on the west coast of the US


      Step 2: Consider more specific locations of the lakes.

      - Lost Creek Lake is in southwestern Oregon (Jackson County)

      - Lake Yosemite is in central California (near Merced in the San Joaquin Valley)


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      Even though Lost Creek Lake is in southern Oregon, it''s still north of central
      California where Lake Yosemite is located. The state boundary between Oregon
      and California puts any location in Oregon north of most of California.

      to determine the relative geographic positions of two lakes:

      1. Lost Creek Lake in Oregon (OR)

      2. Lake Yosemite in California (CA)


      I need to determine if Lost Creek Lake is south of Lake Yosemite.


      First, let''s establish the general geographic relationship between Oregon and
      California:

      - Oregon is directly north of California on the west coast of the United States.

      - Generally, locations in Oregon would be north of locations in California.


      However, since states have irregular shapes, and these lakes could be near the
      border, I need to consider their specific locations:


      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR), likely in the southern part of the state
      since it''s being compared to a California location

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA), possibly in the northern part of the
      state


      Given that Oregon is north of California, the default assumption would be that
      a lake in Oregon would be north of a lake in California. For Lost Creek Lake
      to be south of Lake Yosemite, Lake Yosemite would need to be in far northern
      California and Lost Creek Lake would need to be in far southern Oregon AND there
      would need to be some unusual geographic arrangement.


      Based on my knowledge, Lake Yosemite is actually in central California, near
      Merced (associated with UC Merced), while Lost Creek Lake is indeed in southern
      Oregon. Given this information, Lost Creek Lake would be north of Lake Yosemite,
      not south.</think># Is Lost Creek Lake, OR located south of Lake Yosemite, CA?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two lakes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship

      Oregon is directly north of California on the west coast of the United States.


      ## Step 3: Find the specific locations

      - Lost Creek Lake is in southern Oregon, in Jackson County

      - Lake Yosemite is in central California, near Merced (in the Central Valley)


      ## Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship

      Even though Lost Creek Lake is in southern Oregon, Oregon itself is entirely
      north of central California where Lake Yosemite is located. The Oregon-California
      border runs east-west, with Oregon being north of this border.


      NO - Lost Creek Lake is not south of Lake Yosemite. It is north of it.'

      I need to determine if Lost Creek Lake, OR is located south of Lake Yosemite,
      CA.


      First, let''s establish the general geography:

      - Oregon (OR) is a state located north of California (CA) in the United States.

      - Generally, locations in Oregon tend to be north of locations in California.


      Now, for the specific lakes:

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)


      Since Oregon is north of California, and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon while
      Lake Yosemite is in California, it''s most likely that Lost Creek Lake is north
      of Lake Yosemite, not south of it.


      However, I should be careful about making assumptions based solely on state
      boundaries. It''s possible that Lost Creek Lake could be in southern Oregon
      while Lake Yosemite could be in northern California, which might change the
      north-south relationship.


      But generally speaking, even the southernmost point of Oregon is still north
      of many parts of California, especially central and southern California.</think>#
      Is Lost Creek Lake, OR located south of Lake Yosemite, CA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these lakes are located.

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Examine the geographical relationship between Oregon and California.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - Since Oregon is entirely north of California, any lake in Oregon (including
      Lost Creek Lake) would be north of any lake in California (including Lake Yosemite).

      - Even the southernmost point in Oregon is still north of California.


      Therefore, Lost Creek Lake in Oregon cannot be south of Lake Yosemite in California.

      locations of Lost Creek Lake in Oregon (OR) and Lake Yosemite in California
      (CA) to determine if Lost Creek Lake is south of Lake Yosemite.


      First, I know that Oregon is a state located north of California. In the United
      States, Oregon borders California to the north.


      Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR), which means it''s in a state that is north
      of California.

      Lake Yosemite is in California (CA).


      Since Oregon is north of California, and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon while
      Lake Yosemite is in California, Lost Creek Lake would generally be north of
      Lake Yosemite, not south.


      However, I should consider that specific lakes might be positioned in ways that
      don''t follow the general north-south relationship of the states. For example,
      if Lost Creek Lake is in southern Oregon and Lake Yosemite is in northern California,
      we''d need more specific location data.


      Given that Lake Yosemite is likely named after Yosemite National Park, which
      is in the Sierra Nevada mountains in central/eastern California, and Lost Creek
      Lake is somewhere in Oregon, it''s highly unlikely that Lost Creek Lake would
      be south of Lake Yosemite.</think># Is Lost Creek Lake, OR located south of
      Lake Yosemite, CA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two lakes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of these states

      Oregon is located entirely north of California on the US west coast. The Oregon-California
      border runs east-west, with Oregon above (north of) California.


      ## Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the lakes

      Since Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon and Lake Yosemite is in California, Lost
      Creek Lake must be north of Lake Yosemite, not south of it.


      ## Answer: NO


      Lost Creek Lake, OR is not located south of Lake Yosemite, CA. It is located
      north of it because Oregon is north of California.'

      2. Lake Yosemite, California


      Then I need to compare their locations to determine if Lost Creek Lake is south
      of Lake Yosemite.


      Oregon is a state in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, and it borders
      California to the north. That means Oregon is generally north of California.


      Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, and Lake Yosemite is in California. Based on this
      basic geography, it would be unlikely that Lost Creek Lake (in Oregon) is south
      of Lake Yosemite (in California), since Oregon is north of California.


      However, I should be careful because the specific locations within each state
      matter. It''s possible for something in southern Oregon to be south of something
      in northern California.


      Let me think about more specific locations:

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Jackson County, in southwestern Oregon

      - Lake Yosemite is likely near Yosemite National Park, which is in the Sierra
      Nevada mountains in central/eastern California


      Given these more specific locations, it''s still very unlikely that Lost Creek
      Lake would be south of Lake Yosemite, as the general geography would place Lost

      Step 1: Identify where Lost Creek Lake is located.

      Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR), specifically in Jackson County in the southwestern
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Identify where Lake Yosemite is located.

      Lake Yosemite is in California (CA), near Merced in the central part of the
      state, not far from Yosemite National Park.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Oregon is located entirely north of California on the west coast of the United
      States. Even the southernmost parts of Oregon are generally north of central
      California.


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison.

      Lost Creek Lake in southwestern Oregon would be north of Lake Yosemite in central

      House on the Rock is a tourist attraction in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Wisconsin
      is in the northern part of the Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes.


      Lake Wappapello is a reservoir in southeastern Missouri. Missouri is south of

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - House on the Rock is a tourist attraction located in Spring Green, Wisconsin

      locations of Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Tennessee and Lewis Smith Lake
      in Alabama.


      First, let me think about where Nashville is. Nashville is the capital city
      of Tennessee, located in the northern-central part of the state.


      Lewis Smith Lake (also called Smith Lake) is a reservoir in Alabama. I need
      to determine where in Alabama it is located.


      Alabama is directly south of Tennessee. So if Lewis Smith Lake is in northern
      Alabama, it might be south of Nashville. But if it''s in southern Alabama, then
      it would definitely be south of Nashville, and Nashville would be north of it.


      Let me think about the geography. Nashville is in the northern-central part
      of Tennessee, close to the Tennessee-Kentucky border. Alabama borders Tennessee
      on Tennessee''s southern border.


      Smith Lake is in north-central Alabama, in Walker, Winston, and Cullman counties.
      It''s in the northern part of Alabama, but still south of the Tennessee-Alabama
      border.


      So directionally:

      - Nashville is in northern-central Tennessee

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in northern Alabama

      - Alabama is south of Tennessee


      So Nashville should be north of Lewis Smith Lake, which means Lewis Smith Lake
      is south of Nashville.


      Wait, I need to be careful with the exact question. The question asks if Nashville
      Municipal Auditorium is south of Lewis Smith Lake. Based on my reasoning above,
      Nashville is north of Lewis Smith Lake, not south. So the answer should be NO.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both places
      and their relationship to each other.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville, Tennessee

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Tennessee and Alabama.

      - Tennessee is located directly north of Alabama

      - Nashville is in north-central Tennessee


      Step 3: Locate Lewis Smith Lake more specifically.

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in north-central Alabama (in Walker, Winston, and Cullman
      counties)


      Step 4: Compare the two locations.

      - Since Nashville is in Tennessee (a state north of Alabama), and Lewis Smith
      Lake is in Alabama, Nashville is north of the lake.

      - This means Lewis Smith Lake is south of Nashville, not the other way around.


      NO - Nashville Municipal Auditorium is not south of Lewis Smith Lake. It is

      Let''s think about the geographical locations:


      1. Nashville is the capital city of Tennessee

      3. Nashville is located in the middle-northern part of Tennessee

      4. Lewis Smith Lake (or Smith Lake) is a reservoir in Alabama

      5. I need to determine the relative north-south positioning of these two locations


      Tennessee borders Alabama to the north, so generally speaking, locations in
      Tennessee are north of locations in Alabama. Since Nashville is in Tennessee
      and Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama, there''s a good chance that Nashville is
      north of the lake, not south.


      To be more precise, Nashville is in the north-central part of Tennessee, so
      it''s not at the southern edge of Tennessee close to Alabama. Lewis Smith Lake
      is likely not at the extreme northern edge of Alabama.


      Based on these geographical considerations, Nashville Municipal Auditorium in
      Tennessee is very likely NORTH of Lewis Smith Lake in Alabama, not south of

      So the answer would be NO.</think>To determine if Nashville Municipal Auditorium

      Step 2: Locate Nashville within Tennessee.

      Nashville is located in the north-central part of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Locate Lewis Smith Lake within Alabama.

      Lewis Smith Lake is in north-central Alabama, but still within Alabama''s borders.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Nashville is in Tennessee (the more northern state) and not in the extreme
      southern portion of Tennessee, while Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama (the more
      southern state), Nashville must be north of the lake.


      NO, Nashville Municipal Auditorium is not south of Lewis Smith Lake. It is north

      To answer this question, I need to think about the geographical relationship

      - North Dakota is located north of South Dakota (as their names suggest)

      - Garrison Dam is in North Dakota

      - Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota


      Since North Dakota is north of South Dakota, and Garrison Dam is in North Dakota
      while Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota, Garrison Dam would be located north of
      Big Bend Dam, not south of it.


      So the answer would be NO, Garrison Dam, ND is not located south of Big Bend
      Dam, SD. It''s located north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative positions of these two dams.


      Step 1: Consider the states where the dams are located.

      - Garrison Dam is in North Dakota (ND)

      - Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - North Dakota is located directly north of South Dakota (as their names suggest)


      Step 3: Since Garrison Dam is in North Dakota and Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota,
      the Garrison Dam would generally be north of the Big Bend Dam.


      NO, Garrison Dam, ND is not located south of Big Bend Dam, SD. It is located
      north of it.'

      First, let me identify the states:

      - Garrison Dam is in North Dakota (ND)

      - Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota (SD)


      North Dakota is located north of South Dakota (ND is directly above SD on a

      For dams within these states:

      - Garrison Dam is on the Missouri River in North Dakota

      - Big Bend Dam is on the Missouri River in South Dakota

      (the Missouri, which flows north to south through these states), Garrison Dam

      Step 2: Consider the locations of the dams within their states.

      Garrison Dam is located in North Dakota on the Missouri River.

      Big Bend Dam is located in South Dakota on the Missouri River.


      Step 3: Determine the relative position.

      Since the Missouri River flows from northwest to southeast through these states,
      and North Dakota is north of South Dakota, Garrison Dam (in ND) must be north
      of Big Bend Dam (in SD).


      NO - Garrison Dam, ND is not located south of Big Bend Dam, SD. It is located

      4. However, we need to be careful. It''s possible that Garrison Dam could be
      in the very southern part of North Dakota, and Big Bend Dam could be in the
      very northern part of South Dakota, which might change the answer.


      5. But without specific information about the exact locations of these dams
      within their respective states, we can reasonably conclude that Garrison Dam

      - This is reflected in their names (North vs. South Dakota)


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the dams.

      - Northern regions include the Adirondacks

      - Southern regions include the Hudson Valley and areas closer to New York City


      Given that Stillwater Reservoir is in the Adirondacks (northern NY) and Beacon

      to determine the relative locations of these two reservoirs in New York state.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Stillwater Reservoir, NY.

      Stillwater Reservoir is located in Herkimer County in the Adirondack region
      of northern New York state.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Beacon Reservoir in Dutchess County, NY.

      Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County, which is in the Hudson Valley
      region of southeastern New York state.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      The Adirondack region (where Stillwater Reservoir is) is in the northern part
      of New York state, while Dutchess County (where Beacon Reservoir is) is located
      in the southeastern part of the state, closer to New York City.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these locations.

      Since Stillwater Reservoir is in northern New York and Beacon Reservoir is in
      southeastern New York, Stillwater Reservoir is located NORTH of Beacon Reservoir,
      not south.

      1. Stillwater Reservoir is located in New York state.

      2. Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County, New York.


      I need to find out where these are relative to each other. Let me think about
      the geography of New York state.


      Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack region in northern New York
      state, specifically in Herkimer County.


      Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, which is in the Hudson Valley region
      in southeastern New York state.


      In New York state, locations in the Adirondacks are generally north of locations
      in the Hudson Valley/Dutchess County area.


      So Stillwater Reservoir is located north of Beacon Reservoir, not south of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two New York reservoirs.


      First, let me identify their locations:

      - Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack region in northern New York,
      specifically in Herkimer County.

      - Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County in the Hudson Valley region
      of southeastern New York.


      The Adirondack region is in the northern part of New York state, while Dutchess
      County is significantly further south in the Hudson Valley region.


      Therefore, Stillwater Reservoir is positioned north of Beacon Reservoir, not
      south of it.

      I need to figure out which one is farther south.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is a northern state, located in the northeastern part of
      the US

      - North Carolina (NC) is a southern state, located in the southeastern part
      of the US


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania. This means that
      locations in North Carolina are typically south of locations in Pennsylvania.


      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania, which is the more northern
      state.

      Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina, which is the more southern state.

      - Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Pennsylvania is significantly north of North Carolina on the map

      - Any location in Pennsylvania would generally be north of locations in North
      Carolina


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific water bodies.

      - Since Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in PA (a northern state) and Blewett
      Falls Lake is in NC (a southern state), the PA reservoir must be north of the
      NC lake, not south of it.

      Generally speaking, Washington state is north of California. Washington is one
      of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering Canada, while California
      extends along the west coast south of Oregon (which itself is south of Washington).


      Since Swift Reservoir is in Washington, and Carson Mansion is in California,
      it''s very likely that Swift Reservoir is NORTH of Carson Mansion, not south.


      So the answer would be NO, Swift Reservoir, WA is not located south of Carson

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Swift Reservoir is in Washington state (WA)

      - Carson Mansion is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Washington state is located in the northwestern United States

      - California is located on the west coast, south of Oregon, which is south of
      Washington

      - Washington is significantly north of California


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion about the specific locations.

      be north of Stockton Lake, not south.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative geographical positions of these two lakes.

      States.


      Step 2: Consider the locations of the lakes within their states.

      Saylorville Lake is in central Iowa, near Des Moines.

      Stockton Lake is in southwestern Missouri.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Iowa is entirely north of Missouri, and these lakes are well within their
      respective state boundaries, Saylorville Lake must be north of Stockton Lake.


      NO, Saylorville Lake, IA is NOT located south of Stockton Lake, MO. It is located

      - DeGray Lake is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Barker Reservoir is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Recall geographic knowledge about these states.

      Arkansas is generally north of Texas. Arkansas borders the northern part of

      First, let me recall their locations:


      DeGray Lake is located in Arkansas (AR), which is a state in the south-central
      United States. Arkansas is north of Louisiana and east of Oklahoma and Texas.


      Barker Reservoir is located in Texas (TX), which is south of Arkansas and Oklahoma.

      DeGray Lake is located in southwestern Arkansas, in the foothills of the Ouachita
      Mountains.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Barker Reservoir, TX.

      Barker Reservoir is located on the western edge of Houston in southeastern Texas.

      Harold Washington Cultural Center is in Illinois (IL). Illinois is also in the
      northern United States, but generally south of Michigan.

      The Holy Family Orphanage is likely in Marquette, Michigan, which is in the

      The Harold Washington Cultural Center is in Chicago, Illinois, which is in the

      relative geographic positions of two buildings/locations in the US:

      1. One Commerce Plaza, NY (New York)

      2. Washington Avenue Immigration Station, PA (Pennsylvania)


      I need to determine if One Commerce Plaza in NY is located south of the Washington
      Avenue Immigration Station in PA.


      First, let''s determine where these locations are:


      One Commerce Plaza is likely in New York state (NY). It''s probably in either
      New York City or Albany, as these are major cities with commercial centers.


      Washington Avenue Immigration Station is in Pennsylvania (PA). It might be in
      Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, which are major cities in PA.


      Let''s think about the general geography:

      - New York state is north of Pennsylvania

      - However, the specific locations within each state matter


      Without specific city information, I need to think about the general positioning:

      - If One Commerce Plaza is in Albany (NY state capital), it would be north of
      most of Pennsylvania

      - If One Commerce Plaza is in NYC, it would be east and slightly north of most
      of PA

      - Pennsylvania is generally south of New York state


      Based on the general geography of the US Northeast, New York locations are typically
      north of Pennsylvania locations. Therefore, it''s unlikely that One Commerce
      Plaza (NY) is south of a location in Pennsylvania.


      So my answer would be NO, but let me double-check my geographical understanding
      to be certain.</think># Is One Commerce Plaza, NY located south of Washington
      Avenue Immigration Station, PA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the locations of these two structures
      and their relative positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - One Commerce Plaza is in New York (NY)

      - Washington Avenue Immigration Station is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship

      New York state is positioned north of Pennsylvania in the United States. This
      is a key geographic fact about these two states.


      ## Step 3: Analyze the specific locations

      - While specific buildings within states could have unique relative positions,
      the overall state geography is the determining factor here.

      - Any location in New York would generally be north of locations in Pennsylvania.

      - One Commerce Plaza (regardless of which NY city it''s in) would be positioned
      north of structures in Pennsylvania.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - One Commerce Plaza, NY is not located south of Washington Avenue Immigration
      Station, PA. It would be located north of it, following the general geographic
      relationship between New York and Pennsylvania.'

      States

      - Lake Centennial is in Maryland, which is south of New York


      More specifically:

      New York state is located in the northeastern United States, while Maryland
      is located further south along the eastern seaboard.


      Step 2: Determine the locations within their states.

      Rondout Reservoir is in southeastern New York, in Ulster County.

      New York is entirely north of Maryland. Even the southernmost points of New
      York are generally north of Maryland''s northern border.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Let''s think about where these places are located:


      1. Rondout Reservoir is in New York state (NY).

      2. Lake Centennial is in Maryland (MD).


      Generally speaking, New York is north of Maryland in the United States. New
      York is in the northeastern part of the US, while Maryland is in the mid-Atlantic

      to determine the relative locations of Star Lite Motel in Minnesota (MN) and
      Lewis and Clark Lake in Nebraska (NE).


      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - Minnesota (MN) is a state in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      - Nebraska (NE) is a state south of Minnesota.


      If Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota, and Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska,
      then generally speaking, the motel would be north of the lake, not south of
      it, since Minnesota is north of Nebraska.


      However, I should be careful about making assumptions based just on state locations,
      as specific locations within states could change the north-south relationship.
      Let me think about this more specifically:


      Lewis and Clark Lake is on the Nebraska-South Dakota border, formed by Gavins
      Point Dam on the Missouri River. It would be in the northeastern part of Nebraska.


      For Star Lite Motel in Minnesota, without knowing its exact location, I can
      say that Minnesota is entirely north of Nebraska. Even the southernmost point
      of Minnesota would be north of the northernmost point of Nebraska.


      So if Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota (MN) and Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska
      (NE), then the motel must be north of the lake, not south of it.</think># Reasoning
      Step by Step


      To determine if Star Lite Motel in Minnesota is south of Lewis and Clark Lake
      in Nebraska, I need to analyze the geographic relationship between these two
      locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern United States, while Nebraska (NE)
      is located south of Minnesota.


      Step 2: Analyze Lewis and Clark Lake''s location.

      Lewis and Clark Lake is on the Nebraska-South Dakota border, in the northeastern
      part of Nebraska along the Missouri River.


      Step 3: Consider Star Lite Motel''s location.

      Any location in Minnesota would be north of Nebraska, since Minnesota''s southern
      border is north of Nebraska''s northern border.


      Step 4: Compare the north-south relationship.

      Since Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota, and Minnesota is entirely north of Nebraska,
      the motel must be north of Lewis and Clark Lake, not south of it.

      locations of two places:

      1. Star Lite Motel, MN (Minnesota)

      2. Lewis and Clark Lake, NE (Nebraska)


      I need to figure out if the motel is south of the lake.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of Minnesota (MN) and Nebraska
      (NE). Minnesota is a northern state bordering Canada, while Nebraska is south
      of Minnesota.


      Generally speaking, locations in Minnesota would be north of locations in Nebraska,
      not south. This gives me a preliminary indication that the Star Lite Motel in
      Minnesota would likely NOT be south of Lewis and Clark Lake in Nebraska.


      However, I should be careful because:

      1. Minnesota is east of Nebraska, so there could be some southern parts of Minnesota
      that are still north of northern Nebraska

      2. The exact locations within each state matter


      Since Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE) and the Star Lite Motel is in
      Minnesota (MN), and Minnesota is generally north of Nebraska, it''s very likely
      that the motel is NOT south of the lake, but rather north of it.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these
      two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Minnesota is located north of Nebraska in the United States. Minnesota borders
      Canada to the north, while Nebraska is several states south of the Canadian
      border.


      Step 3: Determine relative positioning.

      Since Minnesota is entirely north of Nebraska, any location in Minnesota (including
      Star Lite Motel) would be north of locations in Nebraska (including Lewis and
      Clark Lake).


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on geographic positioning.

      Since the motel is in a state that is entirely north of the state containing
      the lake, the motel must be north of the lake, not south.


      NO, Star Lite Motel, MN is not located south of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE.'

      1. Star Lite Motel, MN (in Minnesota)

      2. Lewis and Clark Lake, NE (in Nebraska)


      Then I need to determine if the first is south of the second.


      First, let me think about the geography of these states. Minnesota (MN) is a
      northern state bordering Canada. Nebraska (NE) is south of Minnesota. So generally
      speaking, locations in Minnesota tend to be north of locations in Nebraska.


      Lewis and Clark Lake appears to be on the border between Nebraska and South
      Dakota, formed by the Missouri River. The Missouri River forms part of the border
      between these states.


      If Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota, and Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska,
      then it''s very likely that the motel is NORTH of the lake, not south, because
      Minnesota is north of Nebraska.


      So my reasoning leads me to believe that Star Lite Motel, MN is NOT south of
      Lewis and Clark Lake, NE.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine

      Canada.

      - Nebraska (NE) is located south of Minnesota.


      Step 2: Determine the relative north-south positioning.

      - Since Minnesota as a state is entirely north of Nebraska, any location in
      Minnesota (including Star Lite Motel) would be north of locations in Nebraska
      (including Lewis and Clark Lake).

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is located on the Nebraska-South Dakota border, formed
      by the Missouri River.

      - Star Lite Motel in Minnesota would be further north than this lake.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      - If Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota, it must be north of Lewis and Clark Lake
      in Nebraska.

      (Vermont) is located south of Edison Theatre (New York), I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two locations.


      First, I need to think about the general geography of Vermont and New York.
      Vermont is a state in the northeastern United States, and New York is directly
      to the west of Vermont.


      However, New York is a large state that extends quite far north and south. So
      the question is whether this specific location in Vermont (Lake Rescue) is south
      of this specific location in New York (Edison Theatre).


      Without knowing the exact coordinates of these locations, I need to think about
      the general geography. Vermont is entirely east of New York, but can be north
      or south depending on the specific locations.


      Since I don''t have specific coordinate information, I''ll need to reason based
      on general knowledge of these states. Vermont is generally north of most of
      New York, except for the northernmost parts of New York. However, without specific
      location data for Edison Theatre in NY, I cannot definitively answer if Lake
      Rescue in Vermont is south of it.

      these specific locations. Let me be transparent about this uncertainty.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positioning of Lake Rescue in Vermont
      and Edison Theatre in New York.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic relationship between Vermont and New York states.

      Vermont is located east of New York state. However, for north-south positioning,
      I need to be more specific about these particular locations.


      Step 2: Consider Vermont''s position.

      Vermont is generally north of much of New York state, with the entire state
      being further north than New York City and the southern portions of New York.


      Step 3: Examine specific locations.

      Lake Rescue is in southern Vermont, in the town of Ludlow.

      Edison Theatre appears to be in New York City, which is in the southern part
      of New York state.


      Step 4: Compare north-south positions.

      Even southern Vermont locations like Lake Rescue are generally north of New

      Let me think about the general geography of Vermont and New York:

      - Vermont is generally east of New York state

      - Vermont is a smaller state that borders New York

      - In terms of north-south positioning, parts of Vermont are at the same latitude

      To answer this precisely, I would need to know the specific locations of:

      - Lake Rescue in Vermont

      - Edison Theatre in New York


      Without specific coordinates, I can make an educated guess based on general
      geography:

      - Vermont is mostly north of New York City (where many theaters might be located)

      - But there are many parts of upstate New York that are further north than parts
      of Vermont


      Since I don''t have the exact coordinates of these specific locations, I can''t

      Vermont is located east of New York state. However, that doesn''t tell us about
      north-south positioning.


      Step 2: Think about the specific locations.

      Lake Rescue is in Vermont, likely in the central or southern part of the state
      based on where most Vermont lakes are located.


      Step 3: Consider Edison Theatre in NY.

      Without knowing exactly which Edison Theatre this refers to, I need to consider
      possibilities. The most prominent theaters would be in New York City, which
      is in the southern part of New York state.


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      Southern Vermont is generally north of New York City. Even if Lake Rescue is
      in southern Vermont, it would still be north of most of New York City and its
      theaters.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Vermont and New York.

      - Vermont is located east of New York

      - When considering north-south positioning, Vermont is generally at the same

      - Even if Lake Rescue is in southern Vermont, it would still be north of most

      answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Pantages Theatre is in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN)

      - Basilica of St. John is in Des Moines, Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between Minnesota and Iowa

      - Minnesota is located north of Iowa in the United States


      Step 3: Verify the cities'' positions within their states

      - Minneapolis is in the southeastern part of Minnesota

      - Des Moines is in the central part of Iowa

      - Even though Minneapolis is in the southern part of Minnesota, it''s still
      north of Des Moines, Iowa


      Step 4: Make the comparison

      - Since Minnesota is north of Iowa, and Minneapolis (MN) is north of Des Moines
      (IA), the Pantages Theatre must be north of the Basilica of St. John


      NO'

      - Seattle, Washington is located north of Portland, Oregon

      - Washington state is positioned above (north of) Oregon state


      Step 3: Apply this geographical relationship to the specific buildings.

      - Since St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle, and Seattle is north
      of Portland, the cathedral is north of Portland

      - Therefore, St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is north of Aladdin Theater, not
      south of it

      Lake in Pennsylvania is south of R. D. Bailey Lake in West Virginia, I need
      to identify the locations of both lakes.


      1. Youghiogheny River Lake is located in Pennsylvania (PA), specifically in
      the southwestern part of the state on the border with Maryland.


      2. R. D. Bailey Lake is located in West Virginia (WV), specifically in the southern
      part of that state.


      Generally speaking, West Virginia is south of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is
      bordered by West Virginia to its southwest.


      However, I need to be more precise about these specific lakes. Let me recall
      their approximate locations:


      - Youghiogheny River Lake is in the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania, on
      the Youghiogheny River.

      - R. D. Bailey Lake is in southern West Virginia on the Guyandotte River.


      Given West Virginia''s position south of Pennsylvania, and the fact that R.
      D. Bailey Lake is in southern WV while Youghiogheny River Lake is in southern
      PA, it''s most likely that R. D. Bailey Lake is further south than Youghiogheny
      River Lake.</think># Is Youghiogheny River Lake, PA located south of R. D. Bailey

      Let me analyze the geographic locations step by step:


      1) Youghiogheny River Lake is located in southwestern Pennsylvania, near the
      Maryland border.


      2) R. D. Bailey Lake is located in southern West Virginia.


      3) Geographically, Pennsylvania is positioned north of West Virginia in the
      United States.


      4) Even though Youghiogheny River Lake is in the southern part of Pennsylvania,
      it would still be north of most points in West Virginia.


      5) R. D. Bailey Lake, being in southern West Virginia, is positioned well south
      of the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border.


      NO, Youghiogheny River Lake in Pennsylvania is not located south of R. D. Bailey
      Lake in West Virginia. It is located north of it.'

      west-central Arkansas, while Houston (where Miller Outdoor Theatre is) is in
      the southeastern part of Texas.


      Step 4: Determine their relative positions.

      Since Arkansas is north of Texas, and Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas while Miller
      Outdoor Theatre is in Houston, Texas, Nimrod Lake is located NORTH of Miller
      Outdoor Theatre, not south.

      relative geographic locations of two places in the United States: Nimrod Lake
      in Arkansas (AR) and Miller Outdoor Theatre in Texas (TX).


      To determine if Nimrod Lake is located south of Miller Outdoor Theatre, I need
      to compare their latitudes:

      - If Nimrod Lake has a lower latitude than Miller Outdoor Theatre, then it is
      located south

      - If Nimrod Lake has a higher latitude than Miller Outdoor Theatre, then it
      is located north


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Arkansas (AR) is generally north of Texas (TX)

      - Arkansas borders the northeastern part of Texas


      Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas, and Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Texas. Based on
      the general position of these states, it would be more likely that Nimrod Lake
      is north of Miller Outdoor Theatre.


      However, the specific locations matter because:

      - Arkansas doesn''t extend as far south as all of Texas

      - Texas is a large state that extends quite far south

      - Miller Outdoor Theatre could be in northern Texas, while Nimrod Lake could
      be in southern Arkansas


      Let me recall what I know about these specific locations:

      - Nimrod Lake is located in west-central Arkansas

      - Miller Outdoor Theatre is located in Houston, Texas, which is in the southeastern
      part of Texas


      Houston is quite far south in Texas, near the Gulf Coast. West-central Arkansas
      is definitely north of Houston, Texas.


      Therefore, Nimrod Lake in Arkansas is north of Miller Outdoor Theatre in Texas,
      not south.</think># Is Nimrod Lake, AR located south of Miller Outdoor Theatre,
      TX?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations
      by examining their geographic coordinates.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Houston, Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      - Arkansas is generally positioned north of Texas on the map

      - However, I need to consider the specific locations, not just the states


      ## Step 3: Analyze specific locations

      - Nimrod Lake is located in west-central Arkansas

      - Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Houston, which is in southeastern Texas near
      the Gulf Coast

      - Houston is quite far south in Texas, while even the southern parts of Arkansas
      are still north of Houston''s latitude


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Nimrod Lake in west-central Arkansas is positioned north of Houston, Texas
      (where Miller Outdoor Theatre is located), Nimrod Lake is NOT south of Miller
      Outdoor Theatre.

      3) Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Texas (TX). Texas is a state in the south-central
      United States, bordering Mexico.


      4) In terms of the general geography of US states, Arkansas is located to the

      is located south of Black Canyon Lake (Arizona), AZ, I need to find their approximate
      locations and compare their latitudes.


      UCCU Center is in Utah (UT). Utah is a state in the western United States. I
      believe UCCU Center is at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.


      Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ). Arizona is also in the western United
      States, south of Utah.


      Generally speaking, Utah is north of Arizona, since Arizona borders the southern
      boundary of Utah. So locations in Utah tend to be north of locations in Arizona.


      Let me think about their approximate positions:

      - Utah is generally north of Arizona

      - UCCU Center is in Utah, likely in Orem (central-northern Utah)

      - Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona


      Given that Utah is directly north of Arizona in terms of US geography, it''s
      very likely that UCCU Center in Utah is north of Black Canyon Lake in Arizona,
      not south of it.


      So the answer is likely NO, UCCU Center is not south of Black Canyon Lake. It''s
      likely north of it based on the general geographical positions of Utah and Arizona.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - UCCU Center is in Utah (UT), specifically in Orem, Utah.

      - Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Utah and Arizona.

      - Utah is directly north of Arizona in the western United States.

      - The entire state of Utah is generally at a higher latitude (more northern)
      than Arizona.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Since UCCU Center is in Utah, and Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona, the center
      must be north of the lake.

      - For the center to be south of the lake would require it to be at a lower latitude,
      which is not possible given the north-south arrangement of these states.


      NO, UCCU Center is not located south of Black Canyon Lake; it is located north

      of Black Canyon Lake.


      UCCU Center is in Utah (UT). It''s likely in one of Utah''s cities, possibly
      in the Provo/Orem area since many university facilities are there.


      Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ), specifically noted as being in Arizona.


      In general, Utah is north of Arizona in the United States. Utah and Arizona
      share a border, with Utah being directly north of Arizona. This means that locations
      in Utah tend to be north of locations in Arizona.


      Given this general geographic relationship, it would be unusual for a location
      in Utah to be south of a location in Arizona, though it''s not impossible depending
      on the specific locations within each state.


      Without more specific information about the exact coordinates, my reasoning
      based on the general geographic relationship between Utah and Arizona suggests
      that UCCU Center in Utah is likely north of Black Canyon Lake in Arizona, not
      south of it.


      So the answer would be NO, UCCU Center is not south of Black Canyon Lake.</think>To

      Utah is located directly north of Arizona in the United States. They share a
      border, with Utah being the northern neighbor.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific locations.

      Since UCCU Center is in Utah and Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona, the UCCU Center
      would be located north of Black Canyon Lake, not south of it. This follows the

      Let me think about the locations:


      Presidential Towers is in Illinois. While I don''t know the exact city, Illinois
      is generally north of Missouri in the United States.


      The Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is in St. Louis, Missouri, which is located
      in the eastern part of Missouri, along the Mississippi River.


      St. Louis, MO is located south of Illinois. Missouri borders Illinois to the
      south.

      Louis, Missouri, then Presidential Towers would generally be north of the Cathedral,
      not south.


      However, I should be careful because I need to be specific about where in Illinois
      Presidential Towers is located. If it''s in southern Illinois, and the Cathedral
      is in northern Missouri, the answer might be different.


      Presidential Towers is likely in Chicago, which is in northeastern Illinois.
      St. Louis is in eastern Missouri, right at the border with Illinois. Chicago
      is definitely north of St. Louis.

      Step 2: Consider their geographic positions.

      - Illinois is generally north of Missouri

      - St. Louis, MO is situated along the southern border of Illinois, on the western
      bank of the Mississippi River

      - Presidential Towers is most likely in Chicago, which is in the northeastern
      part of Illinois

      Looking at their positions on a map of the United States:

      - Illinois is generally north of Missouri

      - Chicago (where Presidential Towers is likely located) is in the northern part
      of Illinois

      - St. Louis is in the eastern part of Missouri, near the Illinois border

      3. Trinity Dam is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States, south of Washington state.


      4. In general, Washington state is north of California.


      5. So typically, a location in Washington would be north of a location in California.


      6. However, I should be careful because sometimes there can be exceptions depending
      on the exact coordinates.


      7. But in this case, since Lake Merwin is clearly in Washington state and Trinity
      Dam is clearly in California, the general north-south relationship between the

      8. Therefore, Lake Merwin, WA is north of Trinity Dam, CA, not south of it.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two water structures.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these structures are located.

      - Lake Merwin is in Washington state (WA)

      - Trinity Dam is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United
      States

      - California is located along the west coast, south of Washington

      - Washington is entirely north of California


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific structures.

      - Since Lake Merwin is in Washington, and Trinity Dam is in California

      - And Washington is north of California

      - Lake Merwin must be north of Trinity Dam, not south

      2. Trinity Dam in California (CA)


      Specifically, it''s asking if Lake Merwin is located south of Trinity Dam.


      Let me think about the general geography of the western United States:

      - Washington state is in the northwest, bordering Canada

      - California is south of Washington, bordering Mexico at its southern end

      - Generally, Washington is north of California


      Since Lake Merwin is in Washington (WA) and Trinity Dam is in California (CA),
      and Washington is generally north of California, it would be unlikely that Lake
      Merwin is south of Trinity Dam.


      However, I need to be more precise because California is a large state that
      extends quite far north, and the specific locations within each state matter.


      Lake Merwin should be somewhere in Washington state, which is entirely north
      of California.

      Trinity Dam would be somewhere in California, which is entirely south of Washington.


      Therefore, Lake Merwin in Washington would be north of Trinity Dam in California,

      1. We need to determine the location of St. Nicholas Cathedral in Chicago, Illinois.

      2. We need to determine the location of Lake Monroe in Indiana.

      3. We need to compare their latitudes to determine if St. Nicholas Cathedral
      is south of Lake Monroe.


      St. Nicholas Cathedral in Chicago would be located in northern Illinois, since
      Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, on the shores of Lake Michigan.


      Lake Monroe is in Indiana. Indiana is directly east of Illinois. Lake Monroe
      is likely in southern or central Indiana.


      Chicago is quite far north in Illinois, near the Wisconsin border. Indiana''s
      northern border is aligned with northern Illinois, but Lake Monroe is probably
      not at the extreme northern edge of Indiana.


      Based on geography, Chicago is in the northern part of Illinois, while Lake
      Monroe is likely in the central or southern part of Indiana. This would mean
      that St. Nicholas Cathedral in Chicago is north of Lake Monroe in Indiana, not
      south of it.


      But let me double-check my understanding of Indiana''s geography. Lake Monroe
      is a reservoir in south-central Indiana, so it''s definitely in the southern
      half of Indiana. Chicago is much further north, near the northern border of
      Illinois.

      Step 1: Identify the location of St. Nicholas Cathedral in Chicago, Illinois.

      Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois, on the shores of Lake Michigan.
      The city sits in the northern part of the state.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Monroe in Indiana.

      Lake Monroe is a reservoir located in south-central Indiana, near Bloomington.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Illinois and Indiana are adjacent states, with Illinois to the west of Indiana.
      Chicago is in the northern part of Illinois, while Lake Monroe is in the southern
      half of Indiana.


      Step 4: Determine the answer by comparing latitudes.

      Chicago is much further north than south-central Indiana where Lake Monroe is
      located. Therefore, St. Nicholas Cathedral in Chicago would be north of Lake
      Monroe, not south of it.

      South Bend is located in the northern part of Indiana, very close to the Michigan
      border.


      Step 2: Locate Brookville Lake Dam, Indiana.

      Brookville Lake and its dam are located in the southeastern part of Indiana,
      in Franklin County near the Ohio border.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since South Bend is in northern Indiana and Brookville Lake Dam is in southeastern
      Indiana, St. Matthew Cathedral would be north of Brookville Lake Dam, not south
      of it.

      Step 1: Let me identify where South Bend is located in Indiana. South Bend is
      in the northern part of Indiana, near the Michigan border.


      Step 2: Now I need to identify where Brookville Lake Dam is located. Brookville
      Lake is in southeastern Indiana, in Franklin County, near the Ohio border.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positions of these locations. Indiana''s shape
      is roughly rectangular, with the northern border being further north than the
      southern border. South Bend is near the northern border, while Brookville is
      in the southeastern part of the state.


      Since South Bend is in northern Indiana and Brookville Lake Dam is in southeastern

      Indiana''s shape is roughly rectangular. South Bend is very close to Indiana''s
      northern border with Michigan, while Brookville Lake Dam is in the southeastern
      portion of the state, much further south.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since South Bend is in northern Indiana and Brookville Lake Dam is in southeastern
      Indiana, St. Matthew Cathedral (which is in South Bend) is located north of
      Brookville Lake Dam, not south of it.

      First, let me recall the general geography of the states:

      - Kansas (KS) is west of Missouri (MO)

      - Both states are roughly at the same latitude, sharing a border that runs east-west


      Now, I need to think about where these specific lakes are located:


      Smithville Lake is in Missouri (MO). It''s located in Clay County in the northwestern
      part of Missouri, not far from Kansas City.


      Big Hill Lake is in Kansas (KS). It''s located in southeastern Kansas.


      To determine if Smithville Lake is south of Big Hill Lake, I need to compare
      their latitudes.


      Smithville Lake is in northwestern Missouri, which is in the northern part of
      the state.

      Big Hill Lake is in southeastern Kansas, which is in the southern part of that
      state.


      Given that the Kansas-Missouri border runs east-west, and Smithville Lake is
      in the northern part of Missouri while Big Hill Lake is in the southern part
      of Kansas, it''s more likely that Smithville Lake is NORTH of Big Hill Lake,

      Therefore, the answer would be NO, Smithville Lake is not south of Big Hill
      Lake.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Smithville Lake is located in northwestern Missouri, near Kansas City.

      - Big Hill Lake is located in southeastern Kansas.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of Kansas and Missouri.

      - Kansas and Missouri share an east-west border.

      - Kansas is directly west of Missouri.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Northwestern Missouri (where Smithville Lake is) is at a higher latitude than
      southeastern Kansas (where Big Hill Lake is).

      - This means Smithville Lake is actually north of Big Hill Lake, not south.

      Smithville Lake is in Missouri (MO), likely near a place called Smithville.

      Big Hill Lake is in Kansas (KS).


      Missouri is generally east of Kansas, as Kansas and Missouri border each other

      Kansas is west of Missouri, but we need to determine north-south positioning.
      Northwestern Missouri (where Smithville Lake is) is actually north of southeastern
      Kansas (where Big Hill Lake is).

      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN)

      - Lake Icaria is in Iowa (IA)


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of these states. Minnesota

      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      Minnesota is located directly north of Iowa. The entire state of Minnesota is
      north of the Iowa state border.


      Step 3: Since Minneapolis is in Minnesota, and Minnesota is entirely north of

      2. Then I need to determine which one is further north (or south).


      Indiana is generally north of Tennessee. The states border is such that Tennessee
      is south of Indiana. However, I should verify the specific locations within
      these states.


      Griffy Lake is in Indiana, likely in the southern part of the state.


      Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, but I need to determine
      where in Tennessee.


      Without specific coordinates, I can rely on the general geography: Indiana is
      entirely north of Tennessee on the map of the United States. The northernmost
      point of Tennessee is still south of the southernmost point of Indiana.


      So Griffy Lake in Indiana would be north of Arnold Engineering Development Complex

      Arnold Engineering Development Complex, TN?


      Let me work through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: Griffy Lake is in Indiana (IN) and
      Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (TN).


      2) Looking at the geographic relationship between these states: Indiana is located
      entirely north of Tennessee on the US map.


      3) Since Indiana borders Kentucky to its south, and Kentucky borders Tennessee
      to its north, any location in Indiana (including Griffy Lake) would be north
      of any location in Tennessee (including Arnold Engineering Development Complex).


      4) Therefore, Griffy Lake cannot be south of the Arnold Engineering Development
      Complex, but would instead be north of it.

      1. I need to determine the location of Griffy Lake, IN (Indiana)

      2. I need to determine the location of Arnold Engineering Development Complex,
      TN (Tennessee)

      3. Then I need to compare their relative positions (north-south)


      First, let me think about the geography of the US states involved:

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest

      - Tennessee (TN) is located in the Southeast


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Indiana is generally north of Tennessee

      - Tennessee shares its northern border with Kentucky, which in turn shares its
      northern border with Indiana (among other states)


      So generally speaking, locations in Indiana would be north of locations in Tennessee.
      However, I need to consider the specific locations mentioned.


      Griffy Lake is in Indiana, so it would typically be north of a location in Tennessee.

      Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, so it would typically
      be south of a location in Indiana.


      Based on the general geography of US states, Griffy Lake, IN would be NORTH
      of Arnold Engineering Development Complex, TN - not south of it.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      First, I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations based
      on their states.


      1. Griffy Lake is in Indiana (IN)

      2. Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (TN)


      Looking at the geographic positions of these states:

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the Southeast region

      - Indiana is positioned directly north of Kentucky, which is north of Tennessee

      - On a map, Indiana sits at a higher latitude than Tennessee


      Since Indiana is geographically north of Tennessee, and these specific locations
      are not near state borders that might create exceptions, Griffy Lake (IN) would
      be north of Arnold Engineering Development Complex (TN), not south of it.

      2. Arnold Engineering Development Complex, Tennessee (TN)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Griffy Lake is south of the Arnold Engineering
      Development Complex.


      To determine this, I need to know the approximate latitudes of these locations:


      Indiana is generally north of Tennessee in the United States. States in the
      US are roughly arranged with northern states being at higher latitudes than
      southern states. Tennessee is in the southeastern US, while Indiana is in the
      Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Since Indiana is generally north of Tennessee, it would be unusual for a location
      in Indiana to be south of a location in Tennessee. The state border between
      Indiana and Tennessee doesn''t actually touch - Kentucky is between them. The
      general arrangement from north to south would be:

      - Indiana

      - Kentucky

      - Tennessee


      Based on this general knowledge of US geography, Griffy Lake in Indiana would
      most likely be north of the Arnold Engineering Development Complex in Tennessee,
      not south of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of Indiana (IN) and Tennessee (TN).

      Indiana is a Midwestern state located north of Tennessee. Tennessee is a Southern
      state.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic arrangement of these states.

      In the United States, Indiana is entirely north of Tennessee. In fact, Kentucky
      lies between these two states.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Since Griffy Lake is in Indiana, and the Arnold Engineering Development Complex
      is in Tennessee, the lake must be north of the complex - not south.
