      1.  **University of New Hampshire at Manchester** is located in Manchester,
      New Hampshire (NH).

      2.  **Shorter University** is located in Rome, Georgia (GA).

      3.  Now, we need to compare the geographical locations of New Hampshire and
      Georgia.

      4.  New Hampshire is one of the easternmost states in the US, part of New England.

      5.  Georgia is also on the East Coast, but it is south and slightly west of
      New Hampshire.

      6.  Therefore, Manchester, NH is located *east* of Rome, GA.


      So, the question "Is University of New Hampshire at Manchester, NH located west
      of Shorter University, GA?" is asking if something that is east is actually
      west.

      is in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is an East Coast state.

      2.  **Locate Urbana University, OH:** This university is in Urbana, Ohio. Ohio
      is a Midwestern state, located west of Pennsylvania.

      3.  **Compare their relative positions:** Since Pennsylvania is east of Ohio,
      West Chester, PA will be east of Urbana, OH.

      4.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if West Chester University
      is *west* of Urbana University. Since West Chester is *east* of Urbana, the
      answer is no.

      1.  **Identify the location of West Chester University of Pennsylvania, PA:**
      This university is located in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is an
      eastern state in the US.

      2.  **Identify the location of Urbana University, OH:** This university is (or
      was, as it closed in 2020, but for the sake of its historical location) in Urbana,
      Ohio. Ohio is a Midwestern state, located west of Pennsylvania.

      3.  **Compare their east-west positions:** Since Pennsylvania is east of Ohio,
      any location in Pennsylvania (like West Chester) will generally be east of any
      location in Ohio (like Urbana).


      Therefore, West Chester University of Pennsylvania, PA is *east* of Urbana University,
      OH.


      So, the answer to the question "Is West Chester University of Pennsylvania,
      PA located west of Urbana University, OH?" is:
