      U.S., is generally east of Missouri, which is centrally located in the Midwest.


      Therefore, Everglades University in Florida is located east of Southwest Baptist
      University in Missouri.

      east-west positioning. Generally, New York''s longitude is greater than Michigan''s,
      indicating that New York is east of Michigan.


      Based on this reasoning, Clarkson University in New York is located east of
      Cornerstone University in Michigan.

      - Conway, Arkansas, is situated in the central part of the state of Arkansas.

      - Rapid City, South Dakota, is located in the western part of South Dakota.


      By comparing the relative positions of Arkansas and South Dakota on a map, we

      2. **Lee College** is located in Baytown, Texas.


      Now, let''s consider the relative positions of these locations:


      - Georgia is located to the east of Texas in the United States. Specifically,
      Dahlonega, Georgia (UNG) is east of Baytown, Texas (Lee College).


      Therefore, the University of North Georgia is not located west of Lee College.
