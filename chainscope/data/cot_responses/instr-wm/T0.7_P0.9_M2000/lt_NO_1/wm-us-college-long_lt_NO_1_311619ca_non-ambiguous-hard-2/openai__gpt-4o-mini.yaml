      south of Michigan, and since Winter Park, FL is located further south than Grand
      Rapids, MI, it is not positioned to the west.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:

    d1997792-aafe-4928-bdad-ea95d4d89a47: 'To answer the question, let''s first identify

      2. **Davenport University** is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is in
      the midwestern part of the United States.


      Next, we can visualize the relative positions of Florida and Michigan on a map
      of the United States:


      - Florida is located to the south of Michigan.

      - Michigan is located north of Florida.


      Now, to determine if Full Sail University is west of Davenport University, we
      need to consider their east-west positioning:


      - Winter Park, FL (Full Sail University) is located to the southeast of the
      United States.

      - Grand Rapids, MI (Davenport University) is located further north and slightly
      to the west of Winter Park, but still more north than west.


      Considering this geographical information, Full Sail University is not west

    eaa6c7ad-93b4-4dad-b289-aaefb31aab15: 'To determine if Robert Morris University
      in Pennsylvania is located west of Clayton State University in Georgia, we need
      to identify the geographical locations of both institutions.


      1. **Locate Clayton State University, GA**: Clayton State University is situated
      in Morrow, Georgia, which is located in the southeastern part of the United
      States.


      2. **Locate Robert Morris University, PA**: Robert Morris University is located
      in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern part of the United
      States.


      3. **Compare the Longitudes**: Generally, to determine if one location is west
      of another, we can look at their longitudes. Georgia is generally further south,
      while Pennsylvania is further north, but we need to focus on the east-west position.


      4. **Longitude of Clayton State University**: The longitude of Clayton State
      University is approximately -84.3 degrees.


      5. **Longitude of Robert Morris University**: The longitude of Robert Morris
      University is approximately -80.2 degrees.


      6. **Conclusion**: Since -80.2 degrees (Robert Morris University) is numerically
      greater (and thus further east) than -84.3 degrees (Clayton State University),
      Robert Morris University is located east of Clayton State University.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:


      **NO**.'

      2. **Location of California College of the Arts**: CCA has campuses in San Francisco
      and Oakland, California. California is situated south of Washington.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Since EWU is in Washington and CCA is in California,
      we can assess their relative positions. Washington is to the north of California,
      and thus any point in Washington (including EWU) is geographically north of
      California.


      4. **Determining West or East**: When considering whether EWU is west of CCA,
      we note that EWU is in the eastern part of Washington, while CCA is in the western
      part of California. However, "west" typically refers to a point that is further
      west on a longitudinal scale, not just north or south.

      it is north of CCA in California.


      Now, considering the directional relationship:


      - "West" typically refers to a location that is further along the westward longitude
      line relative to another location. Since Washington is north and slightly to
      the west of California, EWU is not west of CCA but rather north of it.

      Next, we need to determine the relative positions of these two locations:


      - Illinois is situated to the north of Texas.

      - Therefore, any location in Illinois (including Lewis University) is north
      of locations in Texas (including Midwestern State University).


      Since Lewis University is in Illinois and Midwestern State University is in
      Texas, Lewis University cannot be west of Midwestern State University because
      it is actually north of it.


      Thus, the answer to the question is:

      part of the Bay Area and Rancho Santiago Community College District is in Orange
      County, Rancho Santiago is located significantly south of CSU East Bay. In terms
      of west-east orientation, the Rancho Santiago area is not west of CSU East Bay,
      but rather south.
