      1. First, I need to locate Georgia Highlands College

      - It''s in Georgia (GA)

      - Georgia Highlands College is located in Rome, GA


      2. Next, I need to locate Jarvis Christian College

      - It''s in Texas (TX)

      - Jarvis Christian College is located in Hawkins, TX


      3. Now I need to compare their relative positions east/west

      - Rome, GA is in the eastern United States

      - Hawkins, TX is in the eastern part of Texas

      - Georgia is clearly east of Texas on a map

      - Therefore, Georgia Highlands College must be east of Jarvis Christian College

      3) Texas is significantly west of Georgia:

      - Even the easternmost parts of Texas are generally west of Georgia

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Georgia is clearly east of Texas


      4. Therefore, since Georgia Highlands College is in Georgia, and Georgia is
      east of Texas (where Jarvis Christian College is located), Georgia Highlands
      College must be east of Jarvis Christian College.

      1) First, let me recall the locations:

      - Henderson State University is in Arkadelphia, Arkansas

      - University of Northern Colorado is in Greeley, Colorado


      2) Looking at their states:

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      - Colorado is in the western United States


      3) Comparing their positions on a map:

      - Arkansas is significantly east of Colorado

      - Therefore, Henderson State (in Arkansas) must be east of University of Northern
      Colorado (in Colorado)


      4) Since Henderson State is EAST of University of Northern Colorado (not west),
