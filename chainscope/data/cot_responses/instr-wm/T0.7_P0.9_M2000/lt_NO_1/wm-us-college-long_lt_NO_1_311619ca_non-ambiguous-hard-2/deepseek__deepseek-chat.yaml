      Louisiana.


      ### Step 2: Determine the Longitudes


      To find out which location is further west, we need to look at the longitudes
      of both places. Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the
      prime meridian (which runs through Greenwich, England). The higher the longitude,
      the further west the location is.


      #### Western College for Women, OH


      Western College for Women is located in Oxford, Ohio. Oxford is a small city
      in southwestern Ohio. The approximate longitude of Oxford, OH is around **-84.7
      degrees**.


      #### University of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA


      The University of Louisiana at Lafayette is located in Lafayette, Louisiana.
      Lafayette is in the southern part of Louisiana. The approximate longitude of
      Lafayette, LA is around **-92.0 degrees**.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes


      Now, let''s compare the two longitudes:


      - Oxford, OH: **-84.7 degrees**

      - Lafayette, LA: **-92.0 degrees**


      In terms of longitude, the more negative number indicates a position further
      west. So, **-92.0 degrees** is west of **-84.7 degrees**.


      ### Step 4: Conclusion


      Since Lafayette, LA (**-92.0 degrees**) has a more negative longitude than Oxford,
      OH (**-84.7 degrees**), Lafayette is further west than Oxford.


      Therefore, **Western College for Women, OH is not located west of University
      of Louisiana at Lafayette, LA**; it is actually to the east.

      \nLet's find the longitudes of both locations.\n\n#### a. \xC9cole libre des\
      \ hautes \xE9tudes, NY\n\nUpon researching, I find that \xC9cole libre des hautes\
      \ \xE9tudes was a French university in exile during World War II, based in New\
      \ York City. New York City is located at approximately **40.7128\xB0 N, 74.0060\xB0\
      \ W**. So, its longitude is **74.0060\xB0 W**.\n\n#### b. Indiana University\
      \ \u2013 Purdue University Fort Wayne, IN\n\nFort Wayne, IN, has a longitude\
      \ of approximately **85.1394\xB0 W**. So, its longitude is **85.1394\xB0 W**.\n\
      \n### Step 4: Comparing the Longitudes\n\nNow, I'll compare the two longitudes\
      \ to see which location is more west:\n\n- **\xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9\
      tudes, NY**: 74.0060\xB0 W\n- **Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University\
      \ Fort Wayne, IN**: 85.1394\xB0 W\n\nA higher longitude value means the location\
      \ is further west. Here, **85.1394\xB0 W** is greater than **74.0060\xB0 W**,\
      \ which means Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Fort Wayne is further\
      \ west than \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes.\n\n### Step 5: Determining\
      \ the Relative Positions\n\nSince Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University\
      \ Fort Wayne has a higher longitude (further west) than \xC9cole libre des hautes\
      \ \xE9tudes, it implies that \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes is **east**\
      \ of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Fort Wayne.\n\n### Step 6:\
      \ Formulating the Answer\n\nThe question asks: *Is \xC9cole libre des hautes\
      \ \xE9tudes, NY located west of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University\
      \ Fort Wayne, IN?*\n\nBased on the longitude comparison:\n\n- **\xC9cole libre\
      \ des hautes \xE9tudes, NY**: 74.0060\xB0 W\n- **Indiana University \u2013 Purdue\
      \ University Fort Wayne, IN**: 85.1394\xB0 W\n\nSince 74.0060\xB0 W is less\
      \ than 85.1394\xB0 W, \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes is **not** west of\
      \ Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Fort Wayne.\n\n### Conclusion\n\
      \nAfter analyzing the longitudes of both locations, it's clear that \xC9cole\
      \ libre des hautes \xE9tudes, NY is east of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue\
      \ University Fort Wayne, IN.\n\n**Final Answer: NO**"

      \ of the University of Louisiana at Monroe in Louisiana.\n\n### Step 1: Identify\
      \ the Locations of Both Universities\n\nFirst, I need to find out where these\
      \ two universities are located.\n\n- **Andrews University, MI**: I know that\
      \ Andrews University is a private university. I recall that it's situated in\
      \ Berrien Springs, Michigan. Berrien Springs is in the southwestern part of\
      \ Michigan, near the Indiana border.\n\n- **University of Louisiana at Monroe,\
      \ LA**: This is a public university located in Monroe, Louisiana. Monroe is\
      \ in the northeastern part of Louisiana, close to the Arkansas border.\n\n###\
      \ Step 2: Determine the Longitudes of Both Locations\n\nTo ascertain which university\
      \ is further west, I need to compare their longitudes. Longitude measures how\
      \ far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude).\n\
      \n- **Berrien Springs, MI**: I'm not entirely sure of the exact longitude, but\
      \ I know that Michigan is in the Eastern Time Zone, which generally covers the\
      \ eastern part of the United States.\n\n- **Monroe, LA**: Louisiana is in the\
      \ Central Time Zone, which is west of the Eastern Time Zone. Specifically, Monroe\
      \ is in the northern part of Louisiana, still within the Central Time Zone.\n\
      \n### Step 3: Compare the Longitudes\n\nSince Michigan is in the Eastern Time\
      \ Zone and Louisiana is in the Central Time Zone, it suggests that Monroe, LA,\
      \ is west of Berrien Springs, MI. However, to be precise, let's look up the\
      \ exact longitudes.\n\n- **Berrien Springs, MI**: Approximately 86.36\xB0 W\n\
      - **Monroe, LA**: Approximately 92.12\xB0 W\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Longitude\
      \ Values\n\nIn terms of longitude:\n\n- A higher negative value (e.g., -92.12\xB0\
      ) indicates a location further west than a lower negative value (e.g., -86.36\xB0\
      ).\n\nSince Monroe, LA, has a longitude of approximately 92.12\xB0 W and Berrien\
      \ Springs, MI, has a longitude of approximately 86.36\xB0 W, Monroe is indeed\
      \ further west.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitude comparison,\

      1. **Locate Purdue University Northwest, IN**: Purdue University Northwest is
      located in Indiana, specifically in the cities of Hammond and Westville. Indiana
      is in the Midwest region of the United States.


      2. **Locate Lamar University, TX**: Lamar University is located in Beaumont,

      the relative positions of the University of Florida (UF) Southwest Recreation
      Center in Florida and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) College
      of Education in Illinois.


      ### Step 1: Locate the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center

      The University of Florida is located in Gainesville, Florida. Gainesville is
      in the northern part of Florida, roughly in the central region of the state.


      ### Step 2: Locate UIUC College of Education

      UIUC is located in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, which is in the central part
      of Illinois.


      ### Step 3: Determine the Relative Positions

      Florida is southeast of Illinois. Therefore, Gainesville, Florida, is southeast
      of Urbana-Champaign, Illinois.


      ### Step 4: Answer the Question

      Since Gainesville, Florida, is southeast of Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, the
      University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center is **not** west of UIUC College
      of Education.
