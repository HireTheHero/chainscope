      \    *   Westfield, MA: ~72.7\xB0 W\n    *   Pittsburgh, PA: ~80.0\xB0 W\n\n\
      5.  **Interpret the comparison:**\n    *   Longitudes closer to 0\xB0 (or the\

      Bay, CA.

      2.  **Find the general areas:** Coleman University was located in San Diego,
      CA. California State University, Monterey Bay is located in Seaside, CA (near
      Monterey).

      3.  **Compare the general areas:** San Diego is in Southern California. Monterey/Seaside
      is in Central California.

      4.  **Determine relative positions:** Southern California is generally south
      of Central California.

      5.  **Consider east/west:** Both locations are on the coast of California. To
      compare their east/west position relative to each other, we primarily look at
      their north/south position. Since San Diego is significantly south of Monterey/Seaside,
      and both are relatively close to the coast, San Diego is geographically south
      and slightly east *relative to* Monterey/Seaside when thinking of the overall
      state map. However, the question asks if Coleman is *west* of Monterey Bay.

      6.  **Visualize or check a map:** If you visualize California, Monterey Bay
      is roughly in the middle of the coast. San Diego is much further south. As you
      go south along the coast, the land generally curves slightly southeast. Therefore,
      San Diego is generally southeast of Monterey Bay.

      7.  **Conclusion:** If San Diego is southeast of Monterey Bay, it cannot be
      west of it.

    52b48b10-3000-41cf-947e-3ca1525f633b: '**Step 1: Determine the location of Coleman
      University, CA.**

      A quick search reveals Coleman University was located in San Diego, California.
      (Note: Coleman University closed in 2018, but we can still determine its former
      location for the purpose of this question).


      **Step 2: Determine the location of California State University, Monterey Bay,
      CA.**

      This is clearly stated as being in Monterey Bay, California.


      **Step 3: Compare the relative locations.**

      San Diego is in Southern California. Monterey Bay is in Central California,
      significantly north of San Diego.


      **Step 4: Determine the east/west relationship.**

      Both locations are on the coast of California. To determine if San Diego (Coleman
      University''s location) is west of Monterey Bay (CSUMB''s location), we need
      to consider their longitudinal positions. While a precise longitudinal comparison
      isn''t strictly necessary for a rough estimate, it''s clear that both are relatively
      close to the coastline. However, considering their north-south positions, San
      Diego is much further south. If you imagine a line running east-west through
      Monterey Bay, San Diego is well to the south of that line.


      More importantly, if you consider the general orientation of California''s coastline,
      Monterey Bay is located at a point where the coast curves inward towards the
      east compared to the coast further south where San Diego is located. Think of
      the shape of California on a map.


      Alternatively, consider a north-south line through Monterey Bay. San Diego is
      located significantly *east* of that line, relative to the coastline. The coastline
      at San Diego is further west than the coastline at Monterey Bay.


      Let''s be more precise with relative positioning. San Diego is located at approximately
      32.7 degrees North latitude. Monterey Bay is located at approximately 36.8 degrees
      North latitude. San Diego is further south. Now let''s consider longitude. San
      Diego is at approximately 117.1 degrees West longitude. Monterey Bay is at approximately
      121.8 degrees West longitude. A lower West longitude means a location is further
      east. Therefore, San Diego is further east than Monterey Bay.


      **Step 5: Formulate the answer based on the comparison.**

      Since San Diego is located further east than Monterey Bay, Coleman University
      (in San Diego) is located east of California State University, Monterey Bay.


      **Step 6: Re-read the question and ensure the answer directly addresses it.**

      The question asks if Coleman University is located *west* of California State
      University, Monterey Bay. Our analysis shows it is located *east*.

    f64b2e9d-9cfd-4202-b73b-715288d00879: "Here's my thinking process to answer the\
      \ question:\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks about the\
      \ relative geographic location of two specific universities: University of Advancing\
      \ Technology (UAT) in Arizona and Concordia University Portland (CUP) in Oregon.\
      \ Specifically, it asks if UAT is *west* of CUP.\n\n2.  **Identify the locations:**\n\
      \    *   University of Advancing Technology (UAT): Located in Tempe, Arizona.\n\
      \    *   Concordia University Portland (CUP): Located in Portland, Oregon. (Note:\
      \ Concordia University Portland closed in 2020, but the question refers to its\
      \ historical location).\n\n3.  **Determine the geographic coordinates or general\
      \ location of each:**\n    *   Tempe, Arizona is in the southwestern United\
      \ States. It's south and east of the Pacific coast.\n    *   Portland, Oregon\
      \ is in the northwestern United States. It's on the Pacific coast (or very near\
      \ it, relative to Tempe).\n\n4.  **Visualize or compare the locations on a map:**\n\
      \    *   Imagine the relative positions of Arizona and Oregon. Oregon is directly\
      \ north of California and Washington. Arizona is east of California and south\
      \ of Utah and Nevada.\n    *   Place Tempe, AZ on the map. It's inland, in the\
      \ desert Southwest.\n    *   Place Portland, OR on the map. It's near the coast,\
      \ in the Pacific Northwest.\n    *   Draw a line straight north/south through\
      \ Portland. Tempe is significantly *east* of that line.\n    *   Alternatively,\
      \ draw a line straight east/west through Tempe. Portland is significantly *north*\
      \ and *west* of that line.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the \"west of\" relationship:**\
      \ The question asks if UAT (Tempe, AZ) is *west* of CUP (Portland, OR). Based\
      \ on the map visualization or comparison of general locations, Tempe, AZ is\
      \ clearly *east* and *south* of Portland, OR. Therefore, Tempe is *not* west\
      \ of Portland.\n\n6.  **Formulate the final answer:** The conclusion based on\
      \ the geographic comparison is that UAT is east of CUP. The question asks if\
      \ UAT is *west* of CUP. Since it is east, the answer to that specific question\
      \ must be no.\n\n7.  **Provide the YES/NO answer:** Based on the reasoning,\
      \ the answer is NO.\n\n**Self-Correction/Refinement:** Double-check the locations.\
      \ Yes, UAT is in Tempe, AZ. Yes, Concordia Portland was in Portland, OR. The\
      \ relative positions are consistent. The question is simple geographic direction.\
      \ The reasoning holds.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation: UAT (Tempe, AZ) is geographically\
      \ located east of CUP (Portland, OR). Therefore, UAT is not located west of\
      \ CUP.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  Identify the first location:\
      \ University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is in Tempe, Arizona.\n2.  Identify\
      \ the second location: Concordia University Portland (CUP) was in Portland,\
      \ Oregon.\n3.  Determine the general geographic position of Tempe, AZ relative\
      \ to Portland, OR. Arizona is a state located to the southeast of Oregon.\n\
      4.  Specifically, looking at a map, Tempe, AZ is significantly east of the longitude\
      \ of Portland, OR.\n5.  The question asks if UAT (Tempe) is *west* of CUP (Portland).\n\
      6.  Since Tempe, AZ is east of Portland, OR, UAT is not west of CUP.\n\nNO"

      \ Petersburg in FL.\n\n2.  **Identify the relevant locations:**\n    *   Bentley\
      \ University: Waltham, Massachusetts (MA)\n    *   University of South Florida\
      \ St. Petersburg: St. Petersburg, Florida (FL)\n\n3.  **Determine the geographic\
      \ direction comparison needed:** The question asks about the *east-west* relationship\
      \ between these two points.\n\n4.  **Determine the relative north-south positions\
      \ (optional but helpful for visualization):** Massachusetts is much further\
      \ north than Florida. This isn't directly needed for an *east-west* comparison,\
      \ but it helps place them on a mental map.\n\n5.  **Determine the relative east-west\
      \ positions:**\n    *   Waltham, MA: Located in eastern Massachusetts, near\
      \ Boston.\n    *   St. Petersburg, FL: Located on the west coast of Florida,\
      \ on a peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n6.  **Visualize or use geographic\

      \    *   St. Petersburg is on the *western* side of Florida.\n    *   Waltham\
      \ (near Boston) is on the *eastern* side of Massachusetts.\n\n7.  **Make the\
      \ comparison:** St. Petersburg is significantly further west than Waltham, MA.\

      \ of that zone relative to the US landmass, while Waltham is on the *eastern\
      \ edge* of that zone. If you draw a line directly south from Waltham, it would\
      \ pass *east* of St. Petersburg. Therefore, St. Petersburg is west of Waltham.\n\
      \n8.  **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:** Since St. Petersburg\
      \ is west of Waltham, Bentley University (in Waltham) is *east* of the University\

    bce5c447-e84d-400a-b84b-7ec469fb02f4: '**Step 1: Determine the location of Bentley
      University, MA.**

      Bentley University is located in Waltham, Massachusetts.


      **Step 2: Determine the location of University of South Florida St. Petersburg,
      FL.**

      University of South Florida St. Petersburg is located in St. Petersburg, Florida.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions of the two locations.**

      Waltham, MA is roughly located at 71.25 degrees West longitude.

      St. Petersburg, FL is roughly located at 82.64 degrees West longitude.


      **Step 4: Determine which location is further west.**

      A higher West longitude value means a location is further west. 82.64 is greater
      than 71.25.


      **Step 5: Answer the question based on the comparison.**

      Since 82.64 (St. Petersburg) is greater than 71.25 (Waltham), University of
      South Florida St. Petersburg is located west of Bentley University.


      **Answer:**


      NO'

      Step 2: Determine the location of Dunwoody College of Technology, MN. Minneapolis,
      Minnesota is in the southeastern part of Minnesota.

      Step 3: Compare the longitudes of the two locations. Ohio is generally east
      of Minnesota.

      Step 4: Specifically, Steubenville, OH is located at approximately 40.35 degrees
      North latitude and 80.63 degrees West longitude. Minneapolis, MN is located
      at approximately 44.98 degrees North latitude and 93.26 degrees West longitude.

      Step 5: A location is west of another if its longitude is further west (a larger
      negative or a smaller positive value, depending on the convention, but in this
      case, both are West longitudes, so a larger absolute value indicates further

      4.  Worcester is located roughly around 42.26 degrees North latitude and 71.79
      degrees West longitude.

      5.  Slippery Rock is located roughly around 41.06 degrees North latitude and
      80.05 degrees West longitude.

      6.  Compare the longitudes. A more negative (or higher absolute value for West)
      longitude means a location is further west.

      7.  -71.79 is greater than -80.05.

      8.  Therefore, Worcester, MA (and College of the Holy Cross) is located east
      of Slippery Rock, PA (and Slippery Rock University).

      9.  The question asks if College of the Holy Cross is *west* of Slippery Rock
      University.

    e8283b10-5406-4079-9f37-af5f32cacc37: "Here's my thought process to answer the\
      \ question:\n\n1.  **Identify the two locations:**\n    *   College of the Holy\
      \ Cross, MA\n    *   Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania, PA\n\n2.  **Determine\
      \ the key geographical relationship being asked:** The question asks about the\
      \ *east/west* relationship between the two points. Specifically, is Holy Cross\
      \ *west* of Slippery Rock?\n\n3.  **Find a way to compare their east/west positions:**\
      \ The most reliable way to compare the east/west position of two locations is\
      \ to look at their longitudes. Longitude lines run north-south, and the values\
      \ increase as you move *west* from the Prime Meridian (0 degrees). So, a *higher*\
      \ negative longitude value (or a lower positive value if using something other\
      \ than degrees West) means the location is further west.\n\n4.  **Find the approximate\
      \ coordinates (especially longitude) for each location:**\n    *   **College\
      \ of the Holy Cross, MA:** A quick search reveals it's located in Worcester,\
      \ MA. Approximate coordinates are around 42.26\xB0 N, 71.81\xB0 W. The key number\
      \ for east/west is 71.81\xB0 W.\n    *   **Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania,\
      \ PA:** A quick search reveals it's located in Slippery Rock, PA. Approximate\
      \ coordinates are around 41.06\xB0 N, 80.05\xB0 W. The key number for east/west\
      \ is 80.05\xB0 W.\n\n5.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *   Holy Cross: 71.81\xB0\
      \ W\n    *   Slippery Rock: 80.05\xB0 W\n\n6.  **Interpret the comparison:**\
      \ A longitude of 80.05\xB0 W is *further west* than a longitude of 71.81\xB0\
      \ W.\n\n7.  **Relate the comparison back to the question:** The question asks\
      \ if Holy Cross (71.81\xB0 W) is *west* of Slippery Rock (80.05\xB0 W). Since\
      \ 71.81\xB0 W is *east* of 80.05\xB0 W, Holy Cross is *east* of Slippery Rock.\n\
      \n8.  **Formulate the final answer:** The answer is the opposite of what the\
      \ question asks.\n\n9.  **Provide the YES/NO answer:** The answer is NO.\n\n\
      **Self-Correction/Double Check:** Imagine a map of the US. Massachusetts is\
      \ on the Atlantic coast. Western Pennsylvania is further inland, closer to Ohio.\
      \ This mental map confirms that Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania,\
      \ and specifically, central MA is east of western PA.\n\nFinal Answer is NO.\n\
      \nHere's the step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  Identify the two locations: College\
      \ of the Holy Cross (in Worcester, MA) and Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania\
      \ (in Slippery Rock, PA).\n2.  The question asks about their relative east/west\
      \ position.\n3.  To determine east/west position accurately, we need to compare\
      \ their longitudes. Locations with a higher West longitude number are further\
      \ west.\n4.  Find the approximate longitude of each location:\n    *   Worcester,\
      \ MA (Holy Cross) is roughly at 71.8\xB0 W longitude.\n    *   Slippery Rock,\
      \ PA is roughly at 80.0\xB0 W longitude.\n5.  Compare the longitudes: 71.8\xB0\
      \ W versus 80.0\xB0 W.\n6.  Since 80.0\xB0 W is a higher number (meaning further\
      \ west) than 71.8\xB0 W, Slippery Rock University is located west of College\
      \ of the Holy Cross.\n7.  The question asks if College of the Holy Cross is\
      \ west of Slippery Rock University.\n8.  Based on the longitude comparison,\
      \ College of the Holy Cross is *east* of Slippery Rock University.\n\nNO"

      Colorado State University Pueblo is in Colorado (CO).

      3. **Visualize or recall the relative positions of the states:** Louisiana is
      in the southern part of the US, generally considered to be in the Gulf Coast
      region. Colorado is in the western part of the US, in the Rocky Mountain region.

      4. **Compare the longitudes:** States further west have a more negative (or
      less positive, depending on the coordinate system) longitude. Colorado is significantly
      to the west of Louisiana.

      5. **Relate state position to university position:** Since Colorado is west
      of Louisiana, a university in Colorado will be west of a university in Louisiana,
      assuming they are not exceptionally close to the state borders and the question
      is about general geographical position.

      6. **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:** McNeese State University
      (LA) is located to the east of Colorado State University Pueblo (CO).


      Therefore, McNeese State University, LA is *not* located west of Colorado State
      University Pueblo, CO.

      \ west of that, so let's estimate its longitude around -88\xB0.\n    *   UTSA\
      \ is located in San Antonio, Texas. San Antonio's longitude is roughly -98.5\xB0\
      .\n\n5.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *   Benedine University (Lisle, IL):\
      \ ~ -88\xB0\n    *   UTSA (San Antonio, TX): ~ -98.5\xB0\n\n6.  **Interpret\
      \ the longitudes:** Longitude values become *more negative* as you move *west*.\n\
      \    *   -98.5 is a smaller (more negative) number than -88.\n    *   Therefore,\
      \ -98.5\xB0 is further west than -88\xB0.\n\n7.  **Formulate the comparison:**\
      \ Since the longitude of UTSA (-98.5\xB0) is further west than the longitude\
      \ of Benedictine University (-88\xB0), Benedictine University is located *east*\
      \ of UTSA.\n\n8.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Benedictine\
      \ University, IL is located *west* of UTSA, TX. Based on the longitude comparison,\
      \ it is located *east*.\n\n9.  **Final Answer Formulation:** State the YES or\
      \ NO clearly based on the conclusion from step 8.\n\nThe answer is NO."

      around 33.95 degrees North latitude and 83.38 degrees West longitude.


      The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More was located in Fort Worth, Texas.
      Fort Worth, TX is in the Central Time Zone and is roughly located around 32.75
      degrees North latitude and 97.33 degrees West longitude.


      To determine if the University of Georgia College of Public Health is located
      west of The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More, we need to compare
      their longitudes. A location further west has a more negative (or larger absolute
      value negative) longitude when using a standard coordinate system where West
      is negative and East is positive, or simply a larger numerical value when using
      a 0-360 degree system where 0 is the prime meridian and values increase eastward.
      In the common -180 to 180 system where West is negative, a more negative number
      is further west. In the 0 to 360 system where 0 is the prime meridian and values
      increase eastward, a larger number is further east. Using the common system
      where West is represented by negative values or values decreasing from 0 on
      the prime meridian towards the west, a smaller numerical value (closer to the
      prime meridian) means further east, and a larger numerical value (further from
      the prime meridian) means further west.


      Athens, GA longitude: -83.38 degrees West

      Fort Worth, TX longitude: -97.33 degrees West


      Comparing the longitudes: -83.38 degrees West is greater than -97.33 degrees
      West. On a number line, -83.38 is to the right of -97.33. Locations further
      to the right on this number line are further east. Locations further to the

    fd975cb1-9751-4bac-9aee-f2d3021cf61d: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate University of Georgia College of Public Health, GA:** This college
      is located in Athens, Georgia.

      2.  **Determine the approximate location of Athens, GA:** Athens, GA is in the
      eastern part of the United States.

      3.  **Locate The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More, TX:** This college
      is located in Houston, Texas.

      4.  **Determine the approximate location of Houston, TX:** Houston, TX is in
      the southern-central part of the United States.

      5.  **Compare the longitudinal positions:** Georgia is significantly east of
      Texas. To be "west" of a location, you need to be further west (closer to the
      Pacific Ocean) on the map. Since Georgia is east of Texas, the University of
      Georgia is *east* of The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More.


      Therefore, the University of Georgia College of Public Health, GA is *not* located
      west of The College of Saints John Fisher & More, TX; it is located east of
      it.


      The answer is NO.'

      \ Needed:** To answer this, I need the approximate geographic locations (specifically,\
      \ longitudes) of two universities:\n    *   Wingate University, NC\n    *  \
      \ Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, MN\n\n3.  **Recall/Look Up Locations:**\n\
      \    *   **Wingate University, NC:** I know North Carolina is on the East Coast\
      \ of the US. Wingate is a town near Charlotte. Charlotte is roughly in the central-western\
      \ part of NC. Longitude will be somewhere around 80-81 degrees West.\n    *\
      \   **Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, MN:** I know Minnesota is in the\
      \ Midwest, north of the central US. Saint Mary's is in Winona, MN, which is\
      \ in the southeastern part of the state, near the Mississippi River. Longitude\
      \ will be significantly further west than NC. Somewhere around 91-92 degrees\
      \ West.\n\n4.  **Compare Longitudes:**\n    *   Wingate University, NC: ~80-81\xB0\
      \ W\n    *   Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, MN: ~91-92\xB0 W\n\n5.  **Understand\
      \ \"West of\":** On a map, locations *further west* have *larger* West longitudes\
      \ (or smaller East longitudes, but the US is in the West hemisphere, so we use\
      \ West longitudes).\n\n6.  **Apply the Comparison:**\n    *   Is 80-81\xB0 W\
      \ located *west of* 91-92\xB0 W?\n    *   No, a longitude of 80-81\xB0 W is\
      \ *east* of a longitude of 91-92\xB0 W.\n    *   Therefore, Wingate University\

      \ is on the East Coast of the US. Its longitude is approximately 80\xB0 West.\n\
      \    *   Step 2: Determine the approximate location (specifically, the longitude)\
      \ of Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, MN. Winona, MN (where Saint Mary's\
      \ is located) is in southeastern Minnesota, which is in the Midwest. Its longitude\
      \ is approximately 91\xB0 West.\n    *   Step 3: Compare the longitudes. Locations\
      \ further west have larger West longitudes. 80\xB0 West is a smaller West longitude\
      \ than 91\xB0 West.\n    *   Step 4: Conclude the relative positions. Since\
      \ 80\xB0 W is east of 91\xB0 W, Wingate University is located east of Saint\
      \ Mary's University of Minnesota.\n\n9.  **Formulate the Final YES/NO Answer:**\
      \ Based on the reasoning, Wingate University is *not* west of Saint Mary's University\

      NO"
    ee3c170a-34d4-4aca-ac1d-22e329c03773: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Lewis University:** Lewis University is in Romeoville, Illinois.

      2.  **Locate Midwestern State University:** Midwestern State University is in
      Wichita Falls, Texas.

      3.  **Determine the general geographical relationship between Illinois and Texas:**
      Illinois is generally north and east of Texas.

      4.  **Determine the general geographical relationship between Romeoville, IL
      and Wichita Falls, TX:** Romeoville is near Chicago. Wichita Falls is in northern
      Texas, closer to Oklahoma.

      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** To be "west" of another location, the longitude
      must be further west (a higher negative number or lower positive number, depending
      on the convention, but essentially further to the left on a map). Illinois is
      significantly east of Texas. Therefore, Romeoville, IL, will have a longitude
      further east than Wichita Falls, TX.


      Since Romeoville, IL has a longitude further east than Wichita Falls, TX, Lewis
      University is located *east* of Midwestern State University.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Lewis University is located west of Midwestern
      State University is no.


      NO'

    3cda4589-6a9f-4774-842f-93a0a9a768a8: 'Step 1: Identify the locations of the two
      colleges.

      Arkansas State University Paragould is in Paragould, Arkansas.

      Williston State College is in Williston, North Dakota.


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of Arkansas and North Dakota.

      Arkansas is a state in the southern United States.

      North Dakota is a state in the upper Midwest/Great Plains region of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Consider the general geographical relationship between these two states.

      North Dakota is significantly further north than Arkansas.

      North Dakota is also generally considered to be west of Arkansas. While Arkansas
      extends further west than the eastern edge of North Dakota, the bulk of North
      Dakota lies to the west of the bulk of Arkansas.


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations within the states.

      Paragould, AR is in the northeastern part of Arkansas.

      Williston, ND is in the northwestern part of North Dakota.


      Step 5: Compare the longitudes of the two locations.

      Paragould, AR is approximately at longitude 90.48 degrees West.

      Williston, ND is approximately at longitude 103.72 degrees West.


      Step 6: A location with a more westerly longitude is further west. Since 103.72
      is a larger number (in the negative direction relative to the Prime Meridian,
      but conventionally compared as absolute values of the negative numbers) than
      90.48, Williston, ND is located further west than Paragould, AR.


      Step 7: The question asks if Arkansas State University Paragould is located
      *west* of Williston State College. Based on the longitude comparison, Paragould
      is east of Williston.

      \ would you reach RSCCD (Santa Ana/Orange)?\n\n6.  **Conclusion based on geography:**\
      \ Traveling directly west from Hayward would take you over the San Francisco\
      \ Bay and towards the Pacific Ocean, away from Southern California. Traveling\
      \ from Hayward towards Santa Ana/Orange requires traveling primarily south.\
      \ Therefore, Santa Ana/Orange is not located west of Hayward. It is located\
      \ significantly south and slightly east of Hayward.\n\nThe answer is therefore\
      \ NO.\n\nNO"
    8ae4e106-4c51-4c80-af19-ee7b53597871: '1.  **Identify the locations:** We need
      to determine the relative positions of Rancho Santiago Community College District,
      CA, and California State University, East Bay, CA.

      2.  **Locate Rancho Santiago Community College District:** This district is
      located in Orange County, California. Key cities within the district include
      Santa Ana and Orange. This is in Southern California.

      3.  **Locate California State University, East Bay:** This university is located
      in Hayward, California. Hayward is in the East Bay region of the San Francisco
      Bay Area, which is in Northern California.

      4.  **Compare the general regions:** Southern California (where RSCCD is) is
      generally south and east of Northern California (where CSU East Bay is).

      5.  **Refine the comparison:** Looking at a map, Orange County is well south
      of the San Francisco Bay Area. Hayward is north of Orange County. Therefore,
      Orange County is located *south* and *east* relative to Hayward.

      6.  **Determine the west/east relationship:** Since Orange County is east of
      the Bay Area, Rancho Santiago Community College District is located *east* of
      California State University, East Bay.

    d7dc509c-44a1-49c2-9ee2-2b573b9de59b: '1.  **Identify the first location:** Rancho
      Santiago Community College District, CA. This district includes colleges like
      Santa Ana College and Santiago Canyon College. These are located in Orange County,
      CA.

      2.  **Identify the second location:** California State University, East Bay,
      CA. This university is located in Hayward, CA, in the East Bay area of the San
      Francisco Bay Area.

      3.  **Determine the general geographic positions:** Orange County is in Southern
      California. The East Bay is in Northern California (specifically, the Bay Area).

      4.  **Compare the locations:** Hayward (CSU East Bay) is significantly north
      of Orange County (Rancho Santiago CCD). When comparing a location in Southern
      California to one in the Bay Area, the Southern California location is generally
      *south* and *east* of the Bay Area location, not west.

      5.  **Consider the question geometry:** The question asks if Rancho Santiago
      (Orange County) is *west* of CSU East Bay (Hayward). Since Orange County is
      south and east of the Bay Area, it cannot be west of it.


      Therefore, based on the relative positions, Rancho Santiago Community College
      District is not located west of California State University, East Bay.
