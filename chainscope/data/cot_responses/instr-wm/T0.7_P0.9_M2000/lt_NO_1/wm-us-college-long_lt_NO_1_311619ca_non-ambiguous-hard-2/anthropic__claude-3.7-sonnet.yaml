      To determine this, I need to identify the locations of both universities and
      compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Locate State University of New York at Oneonta, NY.

      - SUNY Oneonta is located in Oneonta, New York, in the eastern part of the United
      States.

      - New York is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Locate St. Andrews University, NC.

      - St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina.

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, New York is east of North Carolina.

      - The eastern states of the US are arranged with New York being further east
      than North Carolina.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since SUNY Oneonta is in New York (east) and St. Andrews University is in
      North Carolina (west relative to New York), SUNY Oneonta is east of St. Andrews,
      not west.


      NO, State University of New York at Oneonta, NY is not located west of St. Andrews

      - Western College for Women was located in Oxford, Ohio (it''s now part of Miami
      University)

      - University of Louisiana at Lafayette is located in Lafayette, Louisiana


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positioning by comparing their longitudes.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Louisiana is in the southern United States along the Gulf Coast


      Step 3: Compare their general geographic positions.

      - Ohio is significantly east of Louisiana on a US map

      - States like Mississippi and Alabama lie between Louisiana and Ohio


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Western College for Women in Ohio would be EAST of the University of Louisiana
      at Lafayette

      - Despite its name containing "Western," the college is not geographically western
      relative to Louisiana

      University New Orleans, etc., but no institution specifically named "New Orleans
      University."


      Step 2: Since one of the universities doesn''t exist as named, I need to determine
      the geographical relationship between Troy, Alabama and New Orleans, Louisiana.

      - Troy, Alabama is located in the southeastern part of Alabama.

      - New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - Alabama is east of Louisiana on the US map.

      - Specifically, Troy, AL is east of New Orleans, LA.


      Therefore, Troy University is NOT west of New Orleans. It is east of New Orleans.

      Step 2: Determine the general geographic positions of Pennsylvania and Georgia.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - When looking at a US map, Pennsylvania is positioned to the northeast of Georgia

      - However, for east-west positioning specifically, I need to compare their longitudes

      - Pennsylvania is generally positioned to the east of Georgia''s longitude


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations of these universities within their states.

      - Moon Township (Robert Morris) is in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh

      - While Pennsylvania is more northern than Georgia, it is not more western.

      - Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side, while Georgia
      is further inland from the Atlantic.

      - Pennsylvania is positioned to the east or northeast of Georgia, not to the

      like Georgia.

      - Wisconsin is significantly further west than Georgia on a map of the United
      States.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - UMBC is in Baltimore County, Maryland (MD), on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - Dominican University is in Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Maryland is an east coast state, located in the Eastern United States.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest, west of Maryland.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - States in the Midwest (like Illinois) are west of states on the east coast
      (like Maryland).

      - Therefore, Dominican University in Illinois would be west of UMBC in Maryland.


      Step 4: Determine if UMBC is west of Dominican University.

      - Since Dominican University is west of UMBC (not the other way around), UMBC
      cannot be west of Dominican University.


      NO, University of Maryland, Baltimore County is not located west of Dominican
      University, IL. It is located east of it.'

      - Mount Hermon Female Seminary was located in Mississippi (MS).


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Georgia and Mississippi.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Mississippi is located west of Georgia, bordering Alabama which sits between
      them.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - Since Mississippi is entirely west of Georgia, any location in Mississippi
      would be west of any location in Georgia.

      - Therefore, Mount Hermon Female Seminary in Mississippi would be west of Brenau
      University in Georgia.

      - This means Brenau University is NOT west of Mount Hermon Female Seminary,
      but rather east of it.


      NO, Brenau University, GA is not located west of Mount Hermon Female Seminary,
      MS.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is in Colorado Springs, Colorado

      - Los Angeles Recording School is in Los Angeles, California


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Colorado is east of California in the United States

      - Colorado Springs is in central Colorado

      - Los Angeles is on the western coast of California


      Step 3: Compare the approximate longitudes.

      - Los Angeles is very close to the Pacific Ocean on the west coast

      - Colorado Springs is significantly inland, in a state that borders the middle
      of the country

      - Moving from west to east across the US, you would encounter Los Angeles before
      reaching Colorado Springs

      - Arkansas is in the South Central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitude (east-west position).

      - Wisconsin is generally positioned to the northeast of Arkansas

      - While Wisconsin is north of Arkansas, the question specifically asks about
      east-west positioning

      - Wisconsin is actually positioned to the east of Arkansas, not to the west


      Step 4: Verify with geographical knowledge.

      - Wisconsin borders Lake Michigan to its east

      - Arkansas is closer to the center of the continental US

      - Moving from Arkansas to Wisconsin, one would travel northeast, not west


      Therefore, Nicolet Area Technical College in Wisconsin is NOT located west of
      John Brown University in Arkansas. It is located east of it.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Henderson State University is in Arkadelphia, Arkansas

      - University of Northern Colorado is in Greeley, Colorado


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Arkansas and Colorado.

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      - Colorado is in the western/mountain region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Arkansas is generally east of Colorado

      - Colorado sits further west in the continental United States


      Step 4: Therefore, Henderson State University (in Arkansas) would be east of
      the University of Northern Colorado (in Colorado), not west of it.

      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - States on the east coast of the US are generally arranged with northeastern
      states (like NH) being further east than southeastern states (like GA)

      - New Hampshire is one of the easternmost states in the US

      - Georgia is further west than New Hampshire


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      - Since Manchester, NH is in New Hampshire (northeast), and Shorter University
      is in Georgia (southeast), Manchester would be further east, not west.
