    e4c47c54-293b-4adf-80bf-2b5f9575b589: '1. **Find the locations of both universities:**  We
      need to determine the longitude of each university.  West Chester University
      is in Pennsylvania, and Urbana University is in Ohio.


      2. **Compare longitudes:**  Places further west have a *higher* longitude value
      (in the Western Hemisphere). We need to see which university has the higher
      longitude.


      3. **Determine West/East:**  If West Chester University has a higher longitude,
      it''s west of Urbana University. If it has a lower longitude, it''s east.


      West Chester University, PA is approximately at longitude -75.6. Urbana University,
      OH is approximately at longitude -83.7. Since -75.6 is *less negative* (and
      thus greater) than -83.7, West Chester is further east.
