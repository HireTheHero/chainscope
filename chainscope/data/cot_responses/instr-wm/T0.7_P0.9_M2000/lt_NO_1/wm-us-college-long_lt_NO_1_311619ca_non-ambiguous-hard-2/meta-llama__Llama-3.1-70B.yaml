      to consider their longitudinal positions. Vermont is generally east of Indiana
      because, moving from east to west across the United States, one would encounter
      Vermont before reaching Indiana.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Vermont is east of Indiana, the Norwich University,
      VT cannot be west of Huntington University, IN. Therefore, the answer to whether
      Norwich University, VT is located west of Huntington University, IN is **NO**'

      3. **East-West comparison**: To determine if one is west of the other, we need
      to consider their longitudinal positions. Nevada is west of Colorado because,
      moving from east to west across the United States, one would encounter Colorado
      before reaching Nevada.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Nevada is west of Colorado, it means that Roseman

      3. **Compare the locations**: When we look at the map of the United States,
      we can see that Alabama is located east of Louisiana. Therefore, Troy University,
      which is located in Alabama, is east of New Orleans University, which is located
      in Louisiana.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Troy University is located east of New Orleans University,

    251c12be-646c-4326-8ee5-befddb7ce2ad: 'To determine whether Benedictine University,
      IL is located west of the University of Texas at San Antonio, TX, we need to
      consider their geographical locations and the direction of west.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Benedictine University is located in Lisle, Illinois,
      which is in the northern part of the state. The University of Texas at San Antonio
      is located in San Antonio, Texas, which is in the southern part of the state.


      2. **Understand the concept of "west"**: West is a direction that is opposite
      to east. In the United States, the west direction generally refers to the areas
      that are more towards the Pacific Ocean compared to the Atlantic Ocean.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Illinois is generally considered to be in the
      Midwest region of the United States, while Texas is in the South-Central region.
      Given the location of Illinois and Texas, Illinois is generally east of Texas.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Illinois is east of Texas, and Benedictine University
      is in Illinois, it means that Benedictine University is not located west of

      to be in the southeastern region of the United States, while Minnesota is in
      the northern Midwest region.


      3. **Compare locations**: Moving from east to west across the United States,
      you would encounter North Carolina before reaching Minnesota. This means that
      North Carolina is generally east of Minnesota.


      4. **Apply to the question**: Since North Carolina is east of Minnesota, Wingate
      University, NC is east of Saint Mary''s University of Minnesota, MN. Therefore,
      Wingate University, NC is not located west of Saint Mary''s University of Minnesota,
      MN.


      In conclusion, the answer to whether Wingate University, NC is located west

      in the central part of the United States, while Texas is located in the southern
      part of the country.


      3. **East-West comparison**: To determine if one is west of the other, we need
      to consider their longitudinal positions. Lubbock, Texas, is west of Wichita,
      Kansas, because, moving from east to west across the United States, one would
      encounter Wichita before reaching Lubbock.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Lubbock, Texas, is west of Wichita, Kansas, the
      Wichita State University (KS) cannot be west of Lubbock Christian University
      (TX). Therefore, the answer to whether Wichita State University, KS is located
      west of Lubbock Christian University, TX, is **NO**'

      1. **Identify the states**: Montana State University is located in Montana (MT),
      while California South Bay University is located in California (CA).


      2. **Understand the general geographical layout of the United States**: The

      California is also part of the West but is more towards the Pacific Coast.


      3. **Consider the east-west relationship**: Since Montana and California are
      both part of the West, we need to determine which state is more towards the
      east or west within the Western region. Montana is located further east than
      California.

      Coast. Pennsylvania is on the East Coast, while Ohio is in the Midwest.


      3. **Apply to the question**: The question asks if West Chester University of
      Pennsylvania is located west of Urbana University. Given that Pennsylvania is
      east of Ohio, it means West Chester University of Pennsylvania is east of Urbana
      University, not west.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic locations, West Chester University
      of Pennsylvania is not located west of Urbana University.


      The answer is: NO
