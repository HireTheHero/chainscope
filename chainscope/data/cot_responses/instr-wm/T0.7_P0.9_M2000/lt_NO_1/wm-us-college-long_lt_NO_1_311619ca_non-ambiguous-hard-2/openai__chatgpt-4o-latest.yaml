      of Vermont (CCV) in Vermont is located west of Air University in Alabama, we
      need to compare their relative positions on the map of the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Community College of Vermont.

      - Community College of Vermont is located in the state of Vermont, which is
      in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Air University.

      - Air University is located at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama,
      which is in the southeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions.

      - Vermont lies to the northeast of Alabama, which means it is generally farther
      east.

      - Alabama is west of Vermont in terms of longitude.


      Conclusion: Since Vermont (where CCV is located) is east of Alabama (where Air
      University is located), Community College of Vermont is not located west of
      Air University.

      2. **Roseman University of Health Sciences** is located in Henderson, Nevada,

      on the globe.


      **Step 1: Identify the location of Hampton University**

      - Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia.

      - Hampton, VA is located in the eastern part of Virginia, near the Atlantic
      coast.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Bellarmine University**

      **Step 3: Compare their relative positions**

      - Virginia lies to the east of Kentucky geographically.

      - Specifically, Hampton, VA is significantly farther east than Louisville, KY.


      **Step 4: Conclusion**

      - Since Hampton is in Virginia and near the Atlantic coast, and Louisville is
      in Kentucky, which is inland and west of Virginia, Hampton University is **east**

      need to consider the geographic locations (longitudes) of both institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC).

      - UMBC is located in Baltimore County, Maryland.

      - Maryland is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Dominican University, Illinois.

      - Dominican University is located in River Forest, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, west of Maryland.


      Step 3: Compare the general east-west positions.

      - Maryland is farther east than Illinois.

      - Therefore, UMBC is located to the east of Dominican University.


      Final Step: Rephrase the question:

      Is UMBC located west of Dominican University?

      - Since UMBC is east of Dominican University, the answer is NO.

      School of Architecture in Texas, we need to compare their longitudes.


      ### Step 1: Identify the locations

      - **University Center Rochester (UCR)** is in Rochester, Minnesota.

      - **University of Texas at Arlington School of Architecture** is in Arlington,
      Texas.


      ### Step 2: Understand geographical orientation

      Longitude values in the Western Hemisphere (which includes the United States)
      increase as you move westward. So, a location with a higher (more negative)
      longitude is more west.


      ### Step 3: Find approximate longitudes

      - **Rochester, MN** is approximately at **longitude -92.5** degrees.

      - **Arlington, TX** is approximately at **longitude -97.1** degrees.


      ### Step 4: Compare the longitudes

      - **-92.5** (Rochester) is east of **-97.1** (Arlington), since it is a smaller
      magnitude in the western direction.


      ### Final Conclusion:

      Rochester, MN is east of Arlington, TX.

      **Step 1: Identify the location of Purdue University Northwest (PNW)**

      - PNW is located in Hammond, Indiana.

      - The approximate coordinates are: Latitude 41.583, Longitude -87.5


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Lamar University**

      - Lamar University is located in Beaumont, Texas.

      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      - Longitude of PNW: -87.5

      - Longitude of Lamar: -94.13


      Since -94.13 is further west than -87.5 (more negative longitudes indicate further

      or west a location is from the Prime Meridian, with more negative values indicating
      locations further west in the Western Hemisphere.


      **Step 1: Locate Lyndon State College, Vermont**

      - Lyndon State College is located in Lyndonville, Vermont.

      - Vermont is in the northeastern United States.

      - Approximate longitude of Lyndonville, VT: around -72.0 degrees.


      **Step 2: Locate Indiana University of Pennsylvania**

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is also in the eastern U.S., but west of Vermont.

      - Approximate longitude of Indiana, PA: around -79.2 degrees.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      - Lyndonville, VT: ~ -72.0

      - Indiana, PA: ~ -79.2

      - Since -79.2 < -72.0, Indiana, PA is further west than Lyndonville, VT.


      **Conclusion:**

      Lyndon State College is located east of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

      2. Compare their longitudes, since longitude determines east-west positioning.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations**


      - Rancho Santiago Community College District is located in Santa Ana, California.

      - California State University, East Bay is located in Hayward, California.


      **Step 2: Determine the longitudes**


      - Santa Ana, CA (RSCCD) is approximately at longitude **-117.8677**.

      - Hayward, CA (CSUEB) is approximately at longitude **-122.0816**.


      **Step 3: Compare longitudes**


      - A more negative longitude indicates a location further west.

      - -122.0816 (Hayward) is more negative than -117.8677 (Santa Ana), so Hayward
      is further west than Santa Ana.


      **Conclusion:**


      Therefore, Rancho Santiago Community College District is located **east** of
      California State University, East Bay.
