      geographical locations of both colleges.


      1. First, let''s identify the state locations: Georgia Highlands College is
      in Georgia, and Jarvis Christian College is in Texas.

      2. Georgia is generally considered to be in the southeastern United States,

      these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations** of Norwich University (VT) and Huntington University
      (IN).

      2. **Understand the geographical positions** of these locations in terms of
      east-west orientation in the United States.

      3. **Compare their positions** to determine if Norwich University is west of
      Huntington University.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations**

      - Norwich University is located in Northfield, Vermont (VT).

      - Huntington University is located in Huntington, Indiana (IN).


      **Step 2: Understand the geographical positions**

      - Vermont (VT) is in the northeastern part of the United States.

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwestern part of the United States, which is generally
      west of the Northeast but still considered to be in the eastern half of the
      United States when considering the country as a whole.


      **Step 3: Compare their positions**

      - Since Vermont is in the Northeast, and Indiana, while more central, is still
      east of the Mississippi River and not considered "west" in the broader U.S.
      geographical context, we need to consider their specific longitudes.

      - Generally, the Northeast (where VT is located) is east of the Midwest (where
      IN is located).


      Given these considerations, without needing the exact longitudes, we can infer
      that Vermont (Norwich University) is generally east of Indiana (Huntington University)
      because the Northeast is east of the Midwest. Therefore, Norwich University,
      VT, is not west of Huntington University, IN.

      geographical locations of both universities.


      1. **Identify the Location of Lincoln University, PA**: Lincoln University is
      located in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is in the northeastern
      United States.

      here is understanding that "west" refers to the direction. Since Michigan is

      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of Coleman
      University and California State University, Monterey Bay. Coleman University
      is located in San Diego, California, and California State University, Monterey
      Bay is located in Seaside, California, near Monterey.


      2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Next, we determine the geographical
      positions of these universities. San Diego is in the southern part of California,
      while Monterey Bay is in the central part of California''s coastline.


      3. **Compare the locations**: To find out if Coleman University is west of California
      State University, Monterey Bay, we need to understand that "west" refers to
      a direction. Given that both universities are on the west coast of the United
      States, the question essentially asks if Coleman University is farther west
      than California State University, Monterey Bay.


      4. **Apply geographical knowledge**: Both universities are on the Pacific coast,
      with the Pacific Ocean being to their west. The question''s phrasing implies
      a comparison of their longitudinal positions (how far west they are). However,
      since both are coastal and essentially at the western edge of the United States,
      the difference in their "westness" is not about being over the ocean but about
      their relative positions on the map.


      5. **Conclusion**: Considering that Coleman University in San Diego is south
      of Monterey Bay and both are on the coast, the question simplifies to whether
      San Diego (Coleman University) is west of Seaside (Monterey Bay). Since San
      Diego is to the south and slightly east in terms of longitude compared to Monterey
      Bay, it is not west of Monterey Bay but rather southeast.

      1. **Identify the location of Coleman University, CA**: Coleman University is
      located in San Diego, California. San Diego is in the southern part of California,
      near the U.S.-Mexico border.


      2. **Identify the location of California State University, Monterey Bay, CA**:
      California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) is located in Monterey County,
      on the Central Coast of California. This area is north of San Diego but still
      considered to be on the western coast of the United States.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are in California and
      on the west coast, we are comparing their relative positions within the state.
      San Diego, where Coleman University is located, is farther south and also west
      of the location of CSUMB, which is more to the north along the coast.


      Given this information, Coleman University in San Diego is indeed west and slightly
      south of California State University, Monterey Bay. However, the key comparison
      here is "west of," and since both institutions are on the west coast and Coleman
      University is directly west of CSUMB in terms of the state''s geography (considering

      based on their relative east-west positioning.

      \ towards the Pacific Ocean from the perspective of the North American continent.\n\
      \   - Both universities are already on the west coast, so we're comparing their\
      \ relative positions rather than their direction from a central or eastern point\
      \ in the US.\n\n4. **Compare Locations**:\n   - Since both universities are\
      \ on the west coast, we're essentially comparing their longitudinal positions\
      \ (east-west) rather than their latitudinal (north-south) positions.\n   - San\
      \ Diego (Coleman University) is south of Seaside (CSUMB), but the question asks\
      \ if it's west, not south.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that \"west\" refers\
      \ to a direction and both universities are on the coast, the question seems\
      \ to be asking if Coleman University is further west than CSUMB. \n   - Both\
      \ are coastal, so their \"westness\" is comparable in the sense of being on\
      \ the Pacific coast, but since CSUMB is directly on the coast as well, and San\
      \ Diego is also directly on the coast but further south, we're looking at a\
      \ north-south comparison rather than east-west due to the coastal nature of\
      \ both.\n\nHowever, if we consider the literal interpretation of \"located west\
      \ of,\" given that both are on the coast and the question does not account for\
      \ the north-south difference, we must consider if Coleman University is at a\
      \ longitude that is west of CSUMB. Since both are on the Pacific coast, their\
      \ longitudinal difference is what matters, but the question's framing suggests\
      \ a simplification that doesn't fully account for the geography of California's\
      \ coastline.\n\nGiven this, and considering a strict interpretation of \"west\
      \ of\" in geographic terms without considering the north-south aspect which\
      \ is the primary difference between their locations, the question seems to be\
      \ poorly framed for a straightforward yes/no answer without geographic context.\
      \ However, considering the intent might be to understand if one is further west\
      \ in longitude than the other, and acknowledging that both are on the coast\
      \ and thus their \"westness\" is maximized in the context of the US, the critical\
      \ factor is their relative longitudinal positions.\n\nTherefore, considering\
      \ the simplification and focusing strictly on the question's wording without\
      \ overcomplicating with the north-south aspect which is not directly relevant\

      \ is located west of D'Youville University, NY, let's break down the process\
      \ step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: \n   - Stockton University\
      \ is located in New Jersey (NJ).\n   - D'Youville University is located in New\
      \ York (NY).\n\n2. **Understand geographical directions**:\n   - West refers\
      \ to the direction towards the setting sun, which in the context of the United\
      \ States, generally means moving from the eastern seaboard towards the interior\
      \ or the west coast.\n\n3. **Compare the locations geographically**:\n   - New\
      \ Jersey (NJ) is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.\n   -\
      \ New York (NY) is also on the eastern seaboard, north of New Jersey.\n\n4.\
      \ **Determine the relative positions**:\n   - Since both universities are on\
      \ the eastern seaboard, we need to consider their relative north-south positions\
      \ rather than just east-west.\n   - New York (where D'Youville University is\
      \ located) is north of New Jersey (where Stockton University is located).\n\
      \   - Given that New York is north and the question asks about being west, we\
      \ must understand that \"west\" in this context does not apply in the traditional\
      \ sense of moving across the country from east to west. Instead, it's about\
      \ relative positioning on the map.\n   - However, considering the general geography,\
      \ moving west from the eastern seaboard would mean moving inland, but since\
      \ both are on the coast, we're looking at their relative positions north-south\
      \ to infer about east-west positioning in a broad sense.\n\n5. **Conclusion\
      \ based on geographical location**:\n   - Since Stockton University (NJ) is\
      \ south of D'Youville University (NY), and considering the eastern seaboard's\
      \ orientation, Stockton University is not west of D'Youville University in the\
      \ traditional sense of moving westward across the U.S. However, it's essential\
      \ to consider that the question seems to imply a comparison based on their longitudinal\
      \ positions (east-west) rather than latitudinal (north-south). Given the context,\
      \ Stockton University is actually slightly west in terms of longitude compared\
      \ to D'Youville University because New Jersey is west of New York in a longitudinal\
      \ sense when considering their positions on the eastern seaboard.\n\nThe final\

      located west of Samford University, AL, we need to understand the geographical
      locations of both institutions.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Haverford College is located in Pennsylvania
      (PA), and Samford University is located in Alabama (AL).

      2. **Consider general US geography**: Pennsylvania is in the Northeastern United
      States, while Alabama is in the Southeastern United States.

      3. **Determine directional relationship**: Generally, states in the Northeast
      are north and east of states in the Southeast. However, the question specifically
      asks about the westward direction.

      4. **Apply geographical knowledge**: Alabama is south of Pennsylvania but also
      somewhat west, considering the overall layout of the United States. However,
      the difference in latitude (north-south position) is more significant than the
      difference in longitude (east-west position) in this context.

      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Since Alabama is to the southwest of Pennsylvania,
      institutions in Alabama would generally be south and possibly slightly west
      of those in Pennsylvania, depending on their exact longitudes. However, the
      key factor here is the significant difference in latitude, which makes the longitudinal
      (east-west) difference less relevant for a general westward comparison.

      the locations step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Full Sail University is located in Florida (FL),
      and Davenport University is located in Michigan (MI).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Florida is generally considered to be in the
      Southeastern United States, while Michigan is in the Great Lakes region of the
      Northern United States.


      3. **Determine the relative east-west positions**: The United States is laid
      out in a way that the eastern states are generally to the east of the western
      states. Florida is on the eastern seaboard, making it one of the easternmost
      states. Michigan, while not as far east as some states like New York or Massachusetts,
      is still east of many states, particularly those in the Western United States.


      4. **Compare the specific locations**: Since Full Sail University in Florida
      is on the eastern seaboard and Davenport University in Michigan is also in the
      eastern part of the United States (albeit more northward), we need to consider
      their relative positions. Florida is to the south and somewhat east of Michigan.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Florida (where Full Sail University is located)
      is generally east and south of Michigan (where Davenport University is located),
      Full Sail University is not west of Davenport University. Instead, it is more
      to the southeast.

      is also on the East Coast of the United States but is situated south of Virginia.


      Given these locations:

      - Virginia is north of Florida.

      - Both Virginia and Florida are on the East Coast, which means they are east
      of the majority of the United States.


      Considering the question asks if Marymount University, VA is located **west**
      of Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies, FL:

      - Since both institutions are on the East Coast, and Marymount University is
      north of Florida State University, Marymount University cannot be west of Florida
      State University. West would imply it is to the left (or more towards the interior
      of the continent) of Florida on a standard map, which is not the case.


      Therefore, based on geographical positioning, the answer to whether Marymount
      University, VA is located west of Florida State University School of Library
      & Information Studies, FL is **NO**.'

      1. First, we identify the states in which the universities are located: Stratford
      University is in Virginia (VA), and Otterbein University is in Ohio (OH).


      2. Next, we need to understand the general geography of the United States. Virginia

      is located west of University of Louisiana at Monroe, LA, we need to consider
      the geographical locations of both universities.


      1. First, we identify the states in which the universities are located: Andrews
      University is in Michigan (MI), and University of Louisiana at Monroe is in
      Louisiana (LA).

      2. Next, we consider the general geography of the United States. Michigan is
      located in the northern part of the country, in the Midwest region, while Louisiana
      is in the southeastern part of the country, near the Gulf of Mexico.

      3. We then need to determine the relative east-west positions of these states.
      Louisiana is generally east of Michigan because Michigan is part of the Midwest,
      which is west of the southeastern states where Louisiana is located.


      Given this geographical information, we can conclude that Andrews University,
      MI is not west of University of Louisiana at Monroe, LA, but rather, it is north
      and slightly west but more accurately described as northwest or more directly
      north in relation to Louisiana''s position in the southeast.

    657abcf8-6d94-42a0-8ed8-e8026a47d6fb: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Eastern Washington University (EWU) is located
      in Washington state, and California College of the Arts (CCA) is located in
      California.


      2. **Compare geographical locations**: Washington state is located north of
      California.


      3. **Determine east-west orientation**: Since Washington is north of California,
      and considering the general geography of the United States where the west coast
      includes both California and Washington, we need to understand that "west" in
      this context refers to the longitudinal (east-west) positioning rather than
      the state''s north-south positioning.


      4. **Consider the universities'' specific locations within their states**: Eastern
      Washington University, despite being in the eastern part of Washington, is still
      generally west of California when considering the broader geographical context
      of the United States. California College of the Arts is located in California,
      which is to the south of Washington.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Washington state, where Eastern Washington University
      is located, is to the north of California, where California College of the Arts
      is located, and considering the longitudinal aspect (east-west), the question
      essentially asks if a point in Washington (EWU) is west of a point in California
      (CCA). Since both states are on the west coast, with Washington being north
      and California being south, the concept of "west" in this context is somewhat
      misleading. However, considering standard map orientations and geographical
      references, Eastern Washington University would be considered north of California
      College of the Arts, but in terms of longitudinal positioning (east-west), Eastern
      Washington University is not "west" of California College of the Arts in a manner
      that would make geographical sense in this context. The question seems to play
      on the names and geographical intuition. Given the standard understanding of
      US geography, California is on the west coast, and so is Washington, but California
      is directly west of the eastern United States, and Washington is north of California.


      Therefore, considering the question''s intent seems to be about comparing longitudinal
      positions (east-west) rather than the more obvious north-south relationship,
      the correct answer, keeping in mind the geographical realities and the question''s
      phrasing, would be based on understanding that both institutions are on the

      the geographical locations of both Eastern Washington University (EWU) in Washington
      state and California College of the Arts (CCA) in California.


      1. **Identify the states**: Eastern Washington University is located in the
      state of Washington, and California College of the Arts is located in the state
      of California.


      2. **General geographical knowledge**: California is located west of Washington
      state. This is because the United States is often divided into regions, and
      California is part of the Western United States, as is Washington, but California
      is situated to the southwest of Washington.


      3. **Specific locations within the states**: Eastern Washington University,
      as the name suggests, is in the eastern part of Washington state. California
      College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland, both of which
      are in the northern part of California but still west of Eastern Washington
      University due to California''s overall position relative to Washington.


      Given these considerations, Eastern Washington University is east of California
      College of the Arts because Washington state is north of California, and within
      Washington, "Eastern" Washington refers to the part of the state that is farther
      to the east, still not changing the fact that it is east of locations in California.

      \ and Lamar University is located in Texas.\n\n2. **Understand the geography**:\
      \ Indiana is generally considered to be in the eastern part of the United States,\
      \ while Texas is considered to be in the south-central part of the country.\n\
      \n3. **Compare the longitudes**: To determine which university is west of the\
      \ other, we need to compare their longitudes. Generally, as you move west in\
      \ the United States, your longitude increases (from smaller numbers to larger\
      \ numbers when considering negative longitudes for the eastern US).\n\n4. **Specific\
      \ locations**:\n   - Purdue University Northwest is in Hammond, Indiana. Hammond,\
      \ IN has a longitude of approximately -87.5\xB0 W.\n   - Lamar University is\
      \ in Beaumont, Texas. Beaumont, TX has a longitude of approximately -94.1\xB0\
      \ W.\n\n5. **Comparison**: Since -94.1\xB0 W is more negative (or larger in\
      \ absolute value) than -87.5\xB0 W, this means Lamar University is located west\
      \ of Purdue University Northwest.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer to whether\
      \ Purdue University Northwest, IN is located west of Lamar University, TX is:\

    a4b947e3-4605-4798-a837-f191887d23cb: 'To determine if Montana State University
      (MT) is located west of California South Bay University (CA), we need to consider
      the geographical locations of both universities.


      1. First, we need to identify the location of Montana State University. Montana
      State University is located in Bozeman, Montana.


      2. Next, we need to identify the location of California South Bay University.
      However, there is no well-known university by the name of "California South
      Bay University" in California. It''s possible that the question refers to a
      different university, such as California State University, Long Beach or San
      Jose State University, which are both located in the southern part of the San
      Francisco Bay Area, or "South Bay" in the case of San Jose. For the purpose
      of this question, let''s assume California South Bay University refers to a
      university in the South Bay area of California, which would be east of the Pacific
      Ocean and likely near the cities of San Jose or Palo Alto.


      3. Now, we compare the locations. Montana is a state located in the northwestern
      United States, and Bozeman, where Montana State University is located, is east
      of the Pacific Ocean but generally north and slightly east of the California
      South Bay area.


      4. Considering the geography of the United States, the state of Montana is mostly
      east of California, given that California is a western coastal state. However,
      Montana is indeed north of California. The question asks if Montana State University
      is west of California South Bay University. Given that Montana is generally
      east and north of the South Bay area of California, but the specific question
      is about being west, the answer would be based on the longitudinal (east-west)
      position rather than the latitudinal (north-south) position.


      Based on this reasoning, Montana State University (MT) is not west of California
      South Bay University (CA), assuming the latter is in the South Bay area of California.
      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'

      \ north of the Los Angeles metropolitan area.\n\n3. **East-West Orientation**:\n\
      \   - Given that California's coastline runs along the western edge of the state,\

    34f72323-b327-464f-99a1-e4fa2425c9d9: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Rancho Santiago Community College District and California State
      University, East Bay, and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Location of Rancho Santiago Community College District**: This district
      is located in Orange County, California. Specifically, it serves the areas around
      Santa Ana, which is in southern California.


      2. **Location of California State University, East Bay**: This university is
      located in Hayward, California, which is in the San Francisco Bay Area of northern
      California.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Rancho Santiago Community College District is
      in southern California (specifically in Orange County) and California State
      University, East Bay is in the northern part of the state (in the Bay Area),
      we can conclude that Rancho Santiago Community College District is south of
      California State University, East Bay.


      4. **Determining "West"**: The question asks if Rancho Santiago Community College
      District is located west of California State University, East Bay. Since "west"
      refers to the direction towards the setting sun, we need to consider the geographical
      layout of California. The state is longer from north to south than it is from
      east to west, with the Pacific Ocean bordering its western edge.


      Given that California State University, East Bay is in the East Bay area of
      the San Francisco Bay, it is relatively close to the eastern part of the Bay
      Area. Rancho Santiago Community College District, being in southern California,
      would generally be south and slightly west of the Bay Area due to California''s
      coastline and geography.


      However, the critical factor here is the comparison of their east-west positions
      rather than their north-south positions. California State University, East Bay
      is named "East Bay" because it is located on the eastern side of the San Francisco
      Bay, implying that it is more to the east than locations directly on the Pacific
      coast or further west within the state.


      5. **Conclusion**: Considering that Rancho Santiago Community College District
      is in southern California, which places it generally south and somewhat west
      of the northern parts of the state, and acknowledging the naming and geographical
      implications of "East Bay" for California State University, East Bay, we can
      infer that Rancho Santiago Community College District is indeed west of California
      State University, East Bay, given the broader geographical context of California.
