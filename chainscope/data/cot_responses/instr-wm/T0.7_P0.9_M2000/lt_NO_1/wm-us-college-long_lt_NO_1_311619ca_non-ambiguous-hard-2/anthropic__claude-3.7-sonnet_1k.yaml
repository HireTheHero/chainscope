      2. Radford University is in Virginia (VA)


      Now I need to determine their specific locations within their states.


      Marywood University is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern

      Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia, which is in the southwestern
      part of Virginia.


      Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia. But the question asks about east-west
      positioning, not north-south.


      Pennsylvania is generally to the east and north of Virginia. Scranton, PA (where
      Marywood is) is in eastern Pennsylvania. Radford, VA is in western Virginia.


      Given that Pennsylvania is east of Virginia, and Scranton is in eastern PA while
      Radford is in western VA, Marywood University is likely east of Radford University,
      not west.


      So the answer would be NO, Marywood University is not located west of Radford

      Step 2: Determine their geographic coordinates.

      - Scranton, PA is located in northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Radford, VA is located in southwestern Virginia


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally northeast of Virginia

      Let me think about the rough geographic layout of these states. Pennsylvania

      1. Marywood University is in Pennsylvania (PA). Specifically, I believe it''s
      in Scranton, which is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      2. Radford University is in Virginia (VA). Radford is in southwestern Virginia.


      Given that Pennsylvania is generally northeast of Virginia, and Marywood is

      is west of Radford.


      Since Marywood is in northeastern PA, and Radford is in southwestern VA, Marywood
      is likely to be east of Radford, not west of it. Scranton, PA (where Marywood
      is) is quite far east in Pennsylvania, while Radford, VA is in the western part

      northeastern part of the state.

      - Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia, which is in the southwestern
      part of Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and
      Virginia.

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia.

      - Eastern Pennsylvania is northeast of western Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Scranton, PA (where Marywood is located) is in the eastern half of Pennsylvania.

      - Radford, VA is in the western part of Virginia.


      Step 4: Determine their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Scranton is significantly farther east than Radford.

      - Marywood University is therefore east of Radford University, not west.


      NO, Marywood University is not located west of Radford University. It is located

      While Georgia is south of New York, the eastern coastline of the United States
      curves such that northeastern states like New York are generally farther east
      than southeastern states like Georgia.

      Given their states'' positions, Keuka College in NY would be east of Reinhardt
      University in GA, not west of it.

      1. Norwich University in Vermont (VT)

      2. Huntington University in Indiana (IN)


      I need to determine which one is further west.


      First, let''s think about the locations of the states:

      - Vermont (VT) is in the northeastern United States, part of the New England
      region.

      - Indiana (IN) is in the midwestern United States.


      Geographically, Indiana is west of Vermont. The continental United States generally
      runs with the East Coast (including Vermont) on the eastern side and gradually
      moves westward through the Midwest (including Indiana).


      Since Norwich University is in Vermont (eastern US) and Huntington University
      is in Indiana (midwestern US), Norwich University would be EAST of Huntington
      University, not west.


      So, is Norwich University, VT located west of Huntington University, IN?</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two universities based on their states.

      States (New England region).

      - Huntington University is in Indiana (IN), which is in the midwestern United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of these states.

      - Vermont is located on the eastern side of the United States, near the Atlantic
      coast.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest, considerably west of Vermont.


      Step 3: Determine the relative east-west positioning.

      - States in the Midwest (like Indiana) are west of states in New England (like
      Vermont).

      - Therefore, Norwich University in Vermont would be east of Huntington University
      in Indiana, not west of it.

      To answer this question, I need to consider the relative east-west positions
      of Vermont and Indiana in the United States.


      The United States generally has states arranged from west to east as you move
      from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic coast.


      Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in the
      New England region, bordering New York to its west and New Hampshire to its
      east.


      Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwestern United States, significantly west
      of the New England states.


      So generally speaking, Indiana is west of Vermont.


      If Indiana is west of Vermont, then Huntington University in Indiana would be
      west of Norwich University in Vermont.


      Therefore, Norwich University in Vermont is NOT west of Huntington University
      in Indiana. Rather, it''s the opposite - Norwich University is EAST of Huntington
      University.</think>I need to determine the east-west relationship between these

      States (New England region)

      - Huntington University is in Indiana (IN), which is in the Midwestern United
      States


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positions of these states

      - Vermont is on the eastern side of the country, bordering the Canadian province
      of Quebec to the north and New York to the west

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, much further west than Vermont


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions

      - States in the Midwest (like Indiana) are generally west of states in New England
      (like Vermont)

      - Therefore, Huntington University in Indiana would be west of Norwich University

      - Regent University is in Virginia (VA)

      - University of West Florida is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Let me recall the relative positions of these states.

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States, roughly in the mid-Atlantic
      region.

      - Florida is also on the east coast but further south, forming the southeastern
      corner of the contiguous United States.


      Step 3: Let me be more specific about locations.

      - Regent University is in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which is on the eastern
      edge of Virginia, right on the Atlantic coast.

      - University of West Florida is in Pensacola, Florida, which is in the western
      panhandle of Florida, near the border with Alabama and the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 4: Compare longitude (east-west position).

      - Even though Florida is south of Virginia, the western panhandle of Florida
      extends quite far west.

      - Pensacola is located in the far western part of Florida, which is significantly
      further west than Virginia Beach.

      1) Regent University is located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, on the east coast
      of the US.


      2) The University of West Florida is located in Pensacola, Florida, which is
      in Florida''s western panhandle along the Gulf Coast.


      3) Although Virginia is north of Florida, the western Florida panhandle extends
      much further west than Virginia.


      4) Pensacola is actually one of the westernmost cities in Florida, sitting near
      the Florida-Alabama border.


      5) Virginia Beach is on the Atlantic coast, which is considerably east of Pensacola''s
      position.


      6) Looking at their positions on a map, Regent University (Virginia Beach) is

      coast in the eastern part of Virginia.

      - University of West Florida is located in Pensacola, Florida, in the western
      Florida Panhandle near the Alabama border.

      - Virginia is on the East Coast in the Mid-Atlantic region.

      - The Florida Panhandle extends westward along the Gulf Coast.

      - Pensacola is at the far western end of Florida''s Panhandle.


      Step 3: Compare their relative longitudes.

      - Virginia Beach is positioned on the Atlantic Ocean at the eastern edge of
      Virginia.

      - Pensacola is positioned at the western edge of Florida, much farther west
      than Virginia Beach.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      1. First, I need to identify the locations of these two universities.

      2. Stockton University is in New Jersey (NJ)

      3. D''Youville University is in New York (NY)


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to know their specific locations
      within their respective states.


      Stockton University is located in Galloway, New Jersey, which is in the southeastern
      part of New Jersey, near Atlantic City.


      D''Youville University is located in Buffalo, New York, which is in the western
      part of New York state, near the Canadian border.


      Now I need to determine which is further west:

      - Buffalo, NY is in the far western part of New York state

      - Galloway, NJ is in the eastern part of the United States


      Buffalo, NY is actually west of most of New Jersey. Looking at a mental map
      of the US, Buffalo is much further west than Galloway, NJ.


      So Stockton University (in Galloway, NJ) is NOT west of D''Youville University
      (in Buffalo, NY). In fact, it''s the opposite - D''Youville is west of Stockton.</think>To
      determine if Stockton University in NJ is located west of D''Youville University
      in NY, I need to identify their specific locations and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Locate both universities.

      - Stockton University is in Galloway, New Jersey, which is in the southeastern
      part of NJ near Atlantic City.

      - D''Youville University is in Buffalo, New York, which is in the western part
      of NY near the Canadian border.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New Jersey is generally east of New York State, but their shapes and positions
      mean we need to look at the specific cities.

      - Buffalo, NY is in the far western part of New York State.

      - Galloway, NJ is in the eastern coastal region of the United States.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      - Buffalo (where D''Youville is located) is significantly west of Galloway (where
      Stockton is located).

      - In fact, Buffalo is west of most of New Jersey entirely.


      NO, Stockton University is not west of D''Youville University. D''Youville is
      actually west of Stockton.'

      - D''Youville University is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Find more specific locations.

      Stockton University is in Galloway, New Jersey, which is in the southern part
      of the state, near Atlantic City.

      D''Youville University is in Buffalo, New York, which is in the western part
      of New York state.


      Step 3: Consider their positions on a map of the US.

      New Jersey is on the eastern coast of the United States.

      Buffalo, NY is in the far western part of New York state, near the Canadian
      border and Lake Erie.


      Step 4: Compare east-west positions.

      Buffalo, NY (where D''Youville is) is significantly west of anywhere in New
      Jersey, including Galloway (where Stockton is).


      Therefore, Stockton University in NJ is NOT west of D''Youville University in

      Stockton University is in Galloway, NJ, which is in the southern part of New
      Jersey near Atlantic City on the eastern seaboard.


      Step 2: Locate D''Youville University in New York.

      D''Youville University is in Buffalo, NY, which is in the western part of New
      York state near Lake Erie and the Canadian border.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      When looking at a map of the northeastern United States, Buffalo, NY (where
      D''Youville is located) is significantly west of any location in New Jersey,
      including Galloway where Stockton is located.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Buffalo is west of New Jersey, D''Youville University is west of Stockton

      2) Stockton University is located in Galloway Township in southern New Jersey,
      near Atlantic City on the eastern coast of New Jersey.


      3) D''Youville University is located in Buffalo, New York, which is in the far
      western part of New York state, near the Canadian border and Lake Erie.


      4) While New Jersey is generally southeast of New York state, the key is the

      Step 1: Determine the approximate location of Texas A&M University-San Antonio,
      TX

      - It''s in San Antonio, Texas

      - San Antonio is in south-central Texas


      Step 2: Determine the approximate location of New Mexico Highlands University,
      NM

      - This is in New Mexico

      - I need to recall where specifically in New Mexico it is located

      - New Mexico Highlands University is in Las Vegas, NM (not to be confused with
      Las Vegas, Nevada)

      - Las Vegas, NM is in northeastern New Mexico


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions

      - Texas is east of New Mexico in general

      - San Antonio, TX would be east of the New Mexico border

      - Las Vegas, NM is in northeastern New Mexico

      - Therefore, Texas A&M University-San Antonio would be east of New Mexico Highlands
      University


      So the answer would be NO - Texas A&M University-San Antonio is not west of
      New Mexico Highlands University, but rather east of it.</think># Determining
      Relative Geographic Positions


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Locate the universities

      - Texas A&M University-San Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas, in the south-central
      part of Texas

      - New Mexico Highlands University is in Las Vegas, New Mexico, in the northeastern
      part of New Mexico


      ## Step 2: Consider state positions

      - New Mexico is directly west of Texas

      - The entire state of New Mexico sits west of Texas


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - San Antonio is well within Texas, not near the western border

      - Las Vegas, NM is in northeastern New Mexico

      - Even though Las Vegas, NM is in the eastern part of New Mexico, it''s still
      west of any point in Texas


      ## Conclusion

      Since Texas A&M University-San Antonio is in Texas, and New Mexico Highlands
      University is in New Mexico, and New Mexico is west of Texas, Texas A&M University-San
      Antonio must be east (not west) of New Mexico Highlands University.

      Let me think about the relative positions of Texas and New Mexico first. New
      Mexico is located west of Texas. Texas borders New Mexico on New Mexico''s eastern
      side.


      Now for the specific universities:

      - Texas A&M University-San Antonio would be in San Antonio, TX, which is in
      the central-southern part of Texas

      - New Mexico Highlands University is in New Mexico, likely not right at the

      Since New Mexico is entirely west of Texas (except for a small part of western
      Texas that extends westward), and San Antonio is not in that western extension
      of Texas (it''s more central/eastern in Texas), New Mexico Highlands University

      NM).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and New Mexico.

      - New Mexico is located directly west of Texas.

      - Texas shares its western border with New Mexico.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - San Antonio is in south-central Texas, not in the western part of Texas that
      borders New Mexico.

      - Las Vegas, NM (where New Mexico Highlands University is located) is in northeastern
      New Mexico.


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Since New Mexico is west of Texas, and San Antonio is not in the westernmost
      part of Texas, Texas A&M University-San Antonio must be east of New Mexico Highlands

      step by step.


      First, I need to determine the geographic locations of these two universities:


      1. Everglades University is located in Florida (FL)

      2. Southwest Baptist University is located in Missouri (MO)


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. To do this, I should recall
      the relative positions of Florida and Missouri in the United States.


      Florida is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.


      Missouri is located in the central United States, in the Midwest region.


      When comparing east-west positioning (longitude), Missouri is generally west
      of Florida. Florida is much further east than Missouri.


      So if Everglades University is in Florida and Southwest Baptist University is
      in Missouri, then Everglades University would be EAST of Southwest Baptist University,
      not west.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of each university.

      - Everglades University is in Florida (FL)

      - Southwest Baptist University is in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States, extending into the Gulf
      of Mexico

      - Missouri is located in the central United States, in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positioning).

      - Florida is significantly east of Missouri on the US map

      - Missouri is more centrally located and west of Florida


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Since Everglades University is in Florida (eastern) and Southwest Baptist University
      is in Missouri (more western), Everglades University is located EAST of Southwest
      Baptist University, not west of it.

      Everglades University is in Florida (FL). Florida is on the southeastern coast

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Missouri is located in the central United States, significantly west of Florida


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Missouri is clearly west of Florida

      - This means that institutions in Florida would generally be east of institutions

      1. University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is in Arizona (AZ)

      2. Concordia University Portland is in Oregon (OR)


      Now I need to determine which is further west. Let me think about the geographical
      positions of Arizona and Oregon.


      In the US, states on the west coast include Washington, Oregon, and California.
      Arizona is an inland state east of California.


      Oregon is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, but it doesn''t border
      the Pacific Ocean.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Oregon is generally located west of Arizona.
      Portland is in the northwestern part of Oregon, while the University of Advancing
      Technology is likely in Phoenix or another Arizona city.


      So, if Concordia University Portland is in Oregon (which is more westerly) and
      University of Advancing Technology is in Arizona (which is more easterly), then
      UAT is NOT west of Concordia University Portland.</think>I need to determine

      - University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Concordia University Portland is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of Arizona and Oregon.

      - Oregon is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States but is inland, east of California
      and west of New Mexico.


      Step 3: Determine which state is further west.

      - Oregon is further west than Arizona on a map of the United States.

      - Portland, OR is in the western part of Oregon, putting it very close to the
      Pacific coast.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Oregon is west of Arizona, and Portland is in western Oregon, Concordia
      University Portland is west of any location in Arizona, including the University
      of Advancing Technology.

      1. University of Advancing Technology in Arizona (AZ)

      2. Concordia University Portland in Oregon (OR)


      To answer this, I need to know which state is further west, and potentially
      their specific locations within those states.


      Geographic facts:

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Oregon is located in the northwestern United States

      - Generally, Oregon is west of Arizona on the map (Oregon borders the Pacific
      Ocean, while Arizona is inland)


      Let me be more specific about their relative positions:

      - Oregon is directly north and west of Arizona

      - Arizona''s western border is with California and Nevada

      - Oregon''s eastern border is with Idaho


      So based on the states alone, Concordia University Portland (in Oregon) should
      be west of University of Advancing Technology (in Arizona).


      More specifically:

      - Portland is in the northwestern part of Oregon, near the Pacific Ocean

      - I believe the University of Advancing Technology is in the Phoenix metropolitan
      area in Arizona


      So it''s almost certain that Concordia University Portland is further west than

      it''s in Tempe, Arizona.

      2. Concordia University Portland is in Portland, Oregon (OR).


      Now I need to determine which is further west (has a more westerly longitude).


      States on the west coast of the US are generally more westerly than inland states.
      Oregon is on the west coast, while Arizona is inland.


      Oregon is located directly to the west of Arizona on a US map. Oregon borders

      - Arizona is an inland state, east of California and Nevada.

      - Oregon is northwest of Arizona on a map of the United States.

      Nebraska is in the Midwest/Great Plains region, more centrally located but west
      of Kentucky.


      Step 3: In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Nebraska is west of Kentucky.
      Since the colleges are in these respective states, Concordia University in Nebraska

      Next, I need to determine their geographic positions relative to each other:


      3. Kentucky is in the eastern part of the United States, specifically in the
      east-central region

      4. Nebraska is in the central United States, in the Great Plains region

      5. On a U.S. map, Nebraska is positioned to the west of Kentucky


      Since Gateway Community and Technical College is in Kentucky (east) and Concordia
      University is in Nebraska (west), Gateway is located EAST of Concordia, not

      Step 2: Determine the geographical positioning of these states.

      - Kentucky is located in the eastern half of the United States, in the east-central
      region.

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States, in the Great Plains region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a US map, Nebraska is positioned significantly west of Kentucky.

      - Since the colleges are in their respective states, their relative positions
      follow the same pattern.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these positions.

      - Since Nebraska is west of Kentucky, Concordia University in Nebraska is west
      of Gateway Community and Technical College in Kentucky.


      NO - Gateway Community and Technical College in Kentucky is NOT located west

      In the United States:

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the country

      - Kentucky is in the east-central/southeastern part of the country

      - New York is generally east of Kentucky

      - Canton, NY would be in the northern part of New York

      - St. Catharine, KY would be somewhere in Kentucky


      Since New York is east of Kentucky, SUNY Canton is likely east of St. Catharine
      College, not west of it.


      Therefore, SUNY Canton is NOT located west of St. Catharine College. So the
      answer would be NO.</think># Is State University of New York at Canton, NY located

      2. The location of Minnesota State Community and Technical College in Minnesota

      3. Compare their east-west positions to determine if Bethel University is west
      of Minnesota State


      Let me start with understanding the general geography. Tennessee is a state
      in the southeastern United States, while Minnesota is in the northern central
      part of the country. Generally, Tennessee is south and east of Minnesota.


      The question is specifically about the east-west relationship, so I need to
      identify their specific longitudes.


      Bethel University in Tennessee is located in McKenzie, Tennessee, which is in
      the western part of Tennessee.


      Minnesota State Community and Technical College is in Minnesota, which is generally
      west of most of Tennessee. Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Minnesota is quite far west compared to Tennessee.
      Even western Tennessee is likely to be east of most of Minnesota.


      So my reasoning is:

      - Tennessee is generally east of Minnesota

      - Even western Tennessee (where Bethel University is) would likely be east of
      Minnesota

      - Therefore, Bethel University, TN is probably east of Minnesota State Community

      - Bethel University is in McKenzie, Tennessee, which is in the western part
      of Tennessee

      - Minnesota State Community and Technical College is in Minnesota


      ## Step 2: Compare the states geographically

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest

      - On a map of the United States, Minnesota is clearly west of Tennessee


      ## Step 3: Consider longitude (east-west position)

      - Even though Bethel is in western Tennessee, the entire state of Tennessee
      lies east of Minnesota

      - Minnesota extends much further west than any part of Tennessee


      ## Conclusion

      Now, to be more precise about the specific institutions:

      - Bethel University in TN is in McKenzie, Tennessee

      - Minnesota State Community and Technical College (M State) has multiple campuses
      in Minnesota


      Even accounting for specific locations within each state, Tennessee is so much
      further east than Minnesota that any location in Tennessee would be east of
      any location in Minnesota.


      Therefore, Bethel University in Tennessee would be EAST of Minnesota State Community
      and Technical College, not west.</think>I need to determine the geographic locations
      of these two institutions and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each institution is located.

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Minnesota State Community and Technical College is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positioning of these states.

      On a US map, Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest, while Tennessee is in
      the Southeast. Looking at their longitudes, Tennessee is located east of Minnesota.


      Step 3: Even accounting for specific locations within each state, any location
      in Tennessee would be east of any location in Minnesota when comparing their
      positions on an east-west axis.


      Step 4: Since Bethel University (TN) is east of Minnesota State Community and
      Technical College (MN), it cannot be west of it.

      the relative locations of two US colleges:

      1. Bethel University in Tennessee (TN)

      2. Minnesota State Community and Technical College in Minnesota (MN)


      I need to figure out if Bethel University in TN is west of Minnesota State Community
      and Technical College in MN.


      First, let''s think about the states. Tennessee (TN) is in the southeastern
      United States, while Minnesota (MN) is in the northern Midwest (upper Midwest).


      Looking at the US map, Minnesota is clearly west of Tennessee. Minnesota borders
      North Dakota and South Dakota to its west, Iowa to its south, Wisconsin to its
      east, and Canada to its north. Tennessee is much further southeast, bordering
      Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east,
      Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the west, and Missouri
      to the northwest.


      Since Minnesota as a state is west of Tennessee as a state, it''s very likely
      that Minnesota State Community and Technical College in MN is west of Bethel
      University in TN.


      However, I should check if there are any unusual geographic arrangements. For
      instance, if Bethel University is in the far western part of Tennessee and Minnesota
      State Community and Technical College is in the far eastern part of Minnesota,
      there could potentially be an exception.


      But even in that case, given the overall positions of these states, Minnesota''s
      eastern border is still generally west of Tennessee''s western border. Looking
      at the map of the US, Minnesota is entirely north and west of Tennessee.</think>#
      Determining if Bethel University, TN is west of Minnesota State Community and
      Technical College, MN


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positioning
      of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' locations

      - Tennessee (TN) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Minnesota (MN) is located in the upper Midwest/northern United States


      ## Step 2: Compare the states'' geographic positions

      Looking at a US map, Minnesota is positioned significantly northwest of Tennessee.
      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Minnesota is generally west of
      Tennessee.


      ## Step 3: Determine the colleges'' positions

      Even if Bethel University were on the western edge of Tennessee and Minnesota
      State Community and Technical College were on the eastern edge of Minnesota,
      the Minnesota institution would still be west of the Tennessee institution.
      This is because the entire state of Minnesota lies west of Tennessee''s longitude.


      # Answer: NO


      Bethel University in Tennessee is NOT west of Minnesota State Community and
      Technical College in Minnesota. It is east of it.'

      First, let me think about the general geographical position of New York state

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      Step 1: First, let me think about the general geographical positioning of Maryland
      and Alabama states.

      - Maryland is on the east coast of the United States, in the Mid-Atlantic region.

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States, but further inland than Maryland.


      Step 2: In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Maryland is generally located east of Alabama on a map of the United States.

      - This means that locations in Maryland tend to be east of locations in Alabama.


      Step 3: Let''s consider the specific universities:

      - Stevenson University is in Maryland.

      - Selma University is in Alabama.


      Given the general geographical relationship between Maryland and Alabama, it''s
      very likely that Stevenson University (in MD) is located east of Selma University
      (in AL), not west of it.


      Therefore, Stevenson University is likely NOT located west of Selma University.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Stevenson University is located in Maryland (MD), which is on the East Coast
      of the United States.

      - Selma University is located in Alabama (AL), which is in the southeastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Now I''ll compare their longitudes (east-west positions).

      - Maryland is significantly east of Alabama on the U.S. map.

      - Maryland borders the Atlantic Ocean, while Alabama is more inland.


      Step 3: Since Maryland is east of Alabama, Stevenson University (in MD) would
      be east of Selma University (in AL), not west of it.

      Let me think about the geographical locations of these states:

      - Maryland (MD) is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Maryland is further east than Alabama

      - Selma University is in Alabama (AL), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positioning of these states.

      - Maryland is positioned significantly further east than Alabama on the US map.

      - Alabama is located west of Maryland.


      Step 3: Apply this state relationship to the universities.

      1. Maryland (MD) is on the east coast of the United States

      2. Alabama (AL) is in the southeastern United States, but not on the Atlantic
      coast


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Maryland is generally east of Alabama

      - States along the east coast (like Maryland) are generally east of inland states

      So if Stevenson University is in Maryland and Selma University is in Alabama,
      then Stevenson University is likely east of Selma University, not west.


      To be more precise:

      - Stevenson University is in Maryland, likely in the central or eastern part
      of the state

      - Selma University is in Selma, Alabama, which is in the central part of Alabama

      - Maryland is significantly east of Alabama in terms of longitude.

      - The entire state of Maryland is east of the entire state of Alabama.


      Step 3: Consider the specific universities.

      - Stevenson University is in Maryland, so it inherits Maryland''s eastern position.

      - Selma University is in Alabama, so it inherits Alabama''s more western position.

      To solve this, I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these
      two institutions.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - University of Findlay is in Findlay, Ohio

      - Aurora University is in Aurora, Illinois


      Generally speaking, Ohio is east of Illinois in the United States. Ohio borders
      Pennsylvania to the east and Indiana to the west, while Illinois is west of
      Indiana.


      So the general geographic relationship would suggest that a university in Ohio
      would be EAST of a university in Illinois, not west.


      Therefore, University of Findlay in Ohio would be EAST of Aurora University
      in Illinois, not west of it.</think>I need to determine if University of Findlay
      (in Ohio) is west of Aurora University (in Illinois) by considering their geographic
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Illinois is in the Midwest, while Ohio is also in the Midwest but further east.
      On a U.S. map, Illinois is west of Ohio.


      Step 2: Consider the specific cities.

      Findlay is a city in northwestern Ohio.

      Aurora is a city in northeastern Illinois (near Chicago).


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      Even though Findlay is in western Ohio, Illinois as a whole lies west of Ohio.
      Aurora, being in northeastern Illinois, is still west of Findlay, Ohio.


      NO, University of Findlay in Ohio is NOT located west of Aurora University in
      Illinois. It is located east of it.'

      Let me think about the states first:

      - University of Findlay is in Ohio (OH)

      - Aurora University is in Illinois (IL)


      Geographically, Illinois is west of Ohio in the United States. Ohio borders
      Lake Erie to the north and the Ohio River to the south, while Illinois borders
      Lake Michigan to the northeast and the Mississippi River to the west.


      Now, let''s consider the specific cities:

      - Findlay is a city in northwestern Ohio

      - Aurora is a city in northeastern Illinois (a western suburb of Chicago)


      Even though Findlay is in the western part of Ohio, Illinois as a whole is still
      west of Ohio. Aurora being in the eastern part of Illinois might make this closer
      than it first appears, but Illinois is definitely west of Ohio on the map.


      Therefore, University of Findlay in Ohio should be EAST of Aurora University
      in Illinois, not west of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine

      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Findlay is located in northwestern Ohio

      - Aurora is in northeastern Illinois (a western suburb of Chicago)


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Even though Findlay is in the western part of Ohio, and Aurora is in the eastern
      part of Illinois, Illinois as a whole is still west of Ohio geographically.
      The entire state of Ohio lies east of Illinois.

      locations of Western College for Women in Ohio and the University of Louisiana

      First, let me recall the general geographical positions of these states:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Louisiana is in the Deep South/Gulf Coast region


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Ohio is generally east of Louisiana

      - On a map of the US, Ohio is more to the right (east) than Louisiana


      Since Western College for Women is in Ohio, and University of Louisiana at Lafayette
      is in Louisiana, the college in Ohio would be east of the university in Louisiana,
      not west.


      Therefore, despite its name containing "Western," Western College for Women
      in Ohio would be located east of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in
      Louisiana.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the east-west
      relationship between these two institutions based on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these colleges are located.

      - Western College for Women is in Ohio (OH)

      - University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the Deep South/Gulf Coast region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Despite its name containing "Western," Ohio is actually positioned EAST of
      Louisiana on the map of the United States

      - Louisiana is considerably further west than Ohio


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Western College for Women is in Ohio, which is east of Louisiana, it cannot
      be west of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

    c597439c-c775-4e4f-aedd-9ba824b7e929: '<think>This question requires me to compare
      the geographical locations of two institutions: the University of Nebraska at
      Kearney (in Nebraska) and BYU Honors Program (in Utah).


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1. University of Nebraska at Kearney is located in Kearney, Nebraska

      2. BYU (Brigham Young University) Honors Program is located in Provo, Utah

      3. To determine if one is west of the other, I need to consider their longitudinal
      positions


      In the United States, western locations have higher (more negative) longitude
      values than eastern locations. Nebraska is generally east of Utah in the US
      map.


      Nebraska is in the central part of the US, while Utah is further west in the
      Mountain West region. Looking at a mental map of the US, Utah is definitely
      west of Nebraska.


      Therefore, University of Nebraska at Kearney would be EAST of BYU, not west
      of it.</think>To determine if the University of Nebraska at Kearney (NE) is
      located west of BYU Honors Program (UT), I need to examine their geographic
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney is in Kearney, Nebraska

      - BYU (Brigham Young University) Honors Program is in Provo, Utah


      Step 2: Consider their positions on a US map.

      - Nebraska is located in the central Great Plains region of the United States

      - Utah is located in the western Mountain region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - On a US map, Utah is clearly west of Nebraska

      - Moving from Nebraska to Utah, you would travel westward

      - Moving from Utah to Nebraska, you would travel eastward


      Since Utah is west of Nebraska, the University of Nebraska at Kearney must be
      east of BYU, not west of it.


      NO'
    ea2b794b-70ef-4a02-90b8-936bc215ca90: '<think>Alright, I need to determine whether
      the University of Nebraska at Kearney (UNK) is located west of the BYU Honors
      Program.


      Let me break this down:

      1. First, I need to identify where these two institutions are located.

      2. Then, I need to determine which one is further west.


      For University of Nebraska at Kearney:

      - This is in Kearney, Nebraska

      - Nebraska is in the central United States


      For BYU Honors Program:

      - BYU stands for Brigham Young University

      - BYU is located in Provo, Utah

      - Utah is west of Nebraska


      Since we''re looking at longitude (east-west positioning), Utah is further west
      than Nebraska. This means that the University of Nebraska at Kearney is NOT
      west of BYU Honors Program, but east of it.</think># Is University of Nebraska
      at Kearney, NE located west of BYU Honors Program, UT?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two institutions
      based on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney is in Kearney, Nebraska (NE)

      - BYU Honors Program is part of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah (UT)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States

      - Utah is located in the western United States

      - On a map of the US, Utah is clearly west of Nebraska


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - States further west have lower longitudinal values (more negative numbers)

      - Utah is further west (more westerly) than Nebraska


      Therefore, the University of Nebraska at Kearney is NOT west of BYU Honors Program,
      but rather east of it.


      NO'
    fb73beb8-4aa4-47db-a8d1-3bdf55e0f5c9: '<think>Let me think step by step:


      1) I need to determine the locations of two institutions: University of Nebraska
      at Kearney (in Nebraska) and BYU Honors Program (in Utah).


      2) First, University of Nebraska at Kearney is located in Kearney, Nebraska.
      The "NE" in the question confirms it''s in Nebraska.


      3) BYU Honors Program is part of Brigham Young University, located in Provo,
      Utah. The "UT" in the question confirms it''s in Utah.


      4) Now I need to determine which is further west. In the United States, states
      that are more west have lower longitude values (since longitude increases as
      you go east).


      5) Utah is located west of Nebraska. Utah borders Nevada to its west and Colorado
      to its east. Nebraska is east of Colorado. So Utah is definitely west of Nebraska.


      6) Since Kearney, NE is in Nebraska and Provo, UT (where BYU is located) is
      in Utah, BYU would be west of the University of Nebraska at Kearney.


      7) So, is University of Nebraska at Kearney west of BYU? No, it''s the opposite.
      BYU is west of University of Nebraska at Kearney.</think># Reasoning About Geographic
      Locations


      To determine if University of Nebraska at Kearney (NE) is located west of BYU
      Honors Program (UT), I need to compare their geographic locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - University of Nebraska at Kearney is in Nebraska (NE)

      - BYU Honors Program is in Utah (UT)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative positions of the states

      - Utah is located in the western United States

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States

      - On a map of the US, Utah is significantly west of Nebraska


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within the states

      - Kearney is a city in central Nebraska

      - BYU (Brigham Young University) is in Provo, Utah


      ## Step 4: Compare the locations

      Since Utah is west of Nebraska geographically, and these institutions are in
      their respective states, BYU Honors Program in Utah is west of the University
      of Nebraska at Kearney.


      NO (University of Nebraska at Kearney is NOT west of BYU Honors Program - it''s
      the opposite)'

      which one is further west.


      Alcorn State University is in Mississippi (MS), and Ottawa University is in
      Kansas (KS).


      Now I need to recall the rough geographical positions of these states in the
      US:

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the
      Gulf of Mexico

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Kansas is generally west of Mississippi.
      Kansas is in the central part of the country, while Mississippi is in the southeastern
      part.


      So if Alcorn State University is in Mississippi and Ottawa University is in
      Kansas, then Alcorn State University would be east of Ottawa University, not
      west of it.


      Therefore, the answer to "Is Alcorn State University, MS located west of Ottawa

      - Mississippi is in the southeastern United States, along the Gulf Coast

      - Kansas is in the central United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Kansas is significantly west of Mississippi on the US map

      - Therefore, Ottawa University (in Kansas) would be west of Alcorn State University
      (in Mississippi)


      Step 4: Answer the specific question about Alcorn being west of Ottawa.

    f21b7331-9c97-47b1-b833-277a6fc5e448: '<think>To determine whether Alcorn State
      University in Mississippi (MS) is located west of Ottawa University in Kansas
      (KS), I need to find their relative locations on a map of the United States.


      Let me reason through this geographically:


      1. First I need to consider the general locations of Mississippi and Kansas
      within the United States.

      2. Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico.

      3. Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States, in the Great Plains
      region.

      4. Generally speaking, Kansas is west of Mississippi in terms of longitude.


      To be more specific:

      - Alcorn State University is in Lorman, Mississippi

      - Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas


      Since Kansas is generally west of Mississippi, and these universities are in
      their respective states, Ottawa University in Kansas would be west of Alcorn
      State University in Mississippi.


      So Alcorn State University is NOT west of Ottawa University. Rather, it''s the
      opposite - Ottawa University is west of Alcorn State University.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities by examining
      their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Alcorn State University is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Ottawa University is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States, along the Gulf Coast

      - Kansas is located in the central United States, in the Great Plains region


      Step 3: Compare their relative longitudes.

      - Mississippi is significantly east of Kansas on the U.S. map

      - Therefore, Alcorn State University (in Mississippi) would be east of Ottawa
      University (in Kansas)


      Step 4: Determine the answer to the question of whether Alcorn State is west
      of Ottawa University.

      - Since Alcorn State is east of Ottawa University (not west), the answer is:


      NO'

      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, which would suggest
      that Holy Cross is east of Slippery Rock University.


      However, I should be careful about the specific locations within each state.
      Massachusetts is in the northeastern US, while Pennsylvania is south of it but
      still in the eastern part of the US. Pennsylvania extends further west than
      Massachusetts.


      The question asks if Holy Cross (in MA) is west of Slippery Rock (in PA). Based
      on the general geography of these states, Holy Cross would be to the east of
      Slippery Rock, not west.


      So my answer would be NO, College of the Holy Cross is not located west of Slippery
      Rock University.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two colleges.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both schools.

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located south of Massachusetts, but still in the eastern US

      - Pennsylvania extends further west than Massachusetts does


      Step 3: Compare their specific locations on an east-west axis.

      - Worcester, MA is in eastern Massachusetts

      - Slippery Rock, PA is in western Pennsylvania

      - This means that College of the Holy Cross is east of Slippery Rock University,
      not west

      Analysis of College Locations


      To determine if College of the Holy Cross (MA) is west of Slippery Rock University
      (PA), I need to analyze their geographic positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify state locations

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located southwest of Massachusetts


      ## Step 2: Identify specific college locations

      - College of the Holy Cross is in Worcester, Massachusetts (central/eastern
      Massachusetts)

      - Slippery Rock University is in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania (western Pennsylvania)


      ## Step 3: Compare positions

      Massachusetts is entirely east of Pennsylvania on the map. Even considering
      the specific locations within their states, Worcester, MA is significantly east
      of Slippery Rock, PA.

      step.


      First, I need to identify the locations of these two institutions:


      1. Middlesex University, MA - This should be in Massachusetts (MA), since that''s
      the state abbreviation provided.

      2. George Washington University School of Nursing, DC - This is in Washington,
      DC.


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positioning. In the United
      States, Massachusetts is located in the northeastern part of the country, while
      Washington DC is more mid-Atlantic.


      Looking at their relative positions on a map:

      - Massachusetts is north and east of Washington DC

      - Washington DC is south and west of Massachusetts


      Therefore, Middlesex University in Massachusetts would be EAST of George Washington
      University School of Nursing in DC, not west.


      So the answer would be "NO" - Middlesex University, MA is not located west of
      George Washington University School of Nursing, DC. It is located east of it.</think>#
      Is Middlesex University, MA located west of George Washington University School
      of Nursing, DC?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Middlesex University, MA is in Massachusetts

      - George Washington University School of Nursing, DC is in Washington, DC


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Massachusetts and Washington
      DC.

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States

      - Washington DC is in the mid-Atlantic region

      - On a map of the US, Massachusetts is clearly EAST of Washington DC


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Middlesex University is in Massachusetts (east) and George Washington
      University School of Nursing is in DC (west relative to MA), Middlesex University
      is located EAST of George Washington University School of Nursing, not west.


      NO - Middlesex University, MA is not located west of George Washington University
      School of Nursing, DC.'

      MA is located west of George Washington University School of Nursing, DC.


      Let me break down the locations first:

      - Middlesex University, MA - This seems to be in Massachusetts (MA)

      - George Washington University School of Nursing, DC - This is in Washington,
      DC


      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to know their relative positions
      on the US map.


      Washington, DC is located on the east coast of the United States, roughly between
      Virginia and Maryland.


      Massachusetts is a state in the northeastern United States, also on the east
      coast, but north of Washington, DC.


      In the United States, if we''re comparing east-west positions, the general geography
      is:

      - West coast states (like California, Oregon, Washington) are the westernmost

      - Then moving east we have mountain states, midwest states, and finally east
      coast states


      Both Massachusetts and Washington DC are on the east coast, but Massachusetts
      is north of DC, not west of it. In fact, Massachusetts is slightly east of Washington
      DC if we look at their longitudinal positions.


      So Middlesex University in Massachusetts would be northeast of George Washington
      University in DC, not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positioning of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Middlesex University, MA is in Massachusetts

      - George Washington University School of Nursing, DC is in Washington, DC


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions.

      Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States, while Washington DC is also
      on the east coast but further south.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal (east-west) positions.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Massachusetts is actually slightly
      east of Washington DC, not west of it. Massachusetts is positioned more to the
      northeast of DC.


      NO, Middlesex University in Massachusetts is not located west of George Washington
      University School of Nursing in DC. It is located to the northeast.'

      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - On a US map, Nevada is located to the west of Colorado

      - Colorado and Nevada are not adjacent states (Utah sits between them)


      Step 3: Consider if specific locations within these states might change the
      relationship.

      - Even accounting for specific locations within these states, Nevada is entirely
      west of Colorado geographically

      - Any location in Nevada would be west of any location in Colorado


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Adams State University is in Colorado and Roseman University is in Nevada,
      Adams State must be east of Roseman, not west.

      1. Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)

      2. Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV)


      To determine which is more west, I need to think about the relative positions

      - Nevada is located on the western side of the United States

      - Colorado is located to the east of Nevada

      - These states are not adjacent - Utah sits between Nevada and Colorado


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Nevada is west of Colorado on a map, and the universities are in these
      respective states, Adams State University (in Colorado) must be east of Roseman
      University (in Nevada), not west of it.

      - Colorado is located east of Nevada (Nevada borders California on the west,
      while Colorado is further inland)

      - In the US, a lower longitude number means further west, and a higher longitude
      number means further east


      Since Adams State University is in Colorado, and Roseman University is in Nevada,

      First, I need to identify where these states are relative to each other. Colorado
      is located to the east of Nevada on a US map.


      Since Adams State is in Colorado, and Roseman University is in Nevada, generally
      speaking, Adams State would be east of Roseman University.


      However, I should be careful about border areas. Let me consider where specifically
      in their respective states these universities are located:


      Adams State University is in Alamosa, CO, which is in southern Colorado.

      Roseman University has campuses in Henderson, NV (near Las Vegas) and in South
      Jordan, UT.


      Given that Nevada is entirely west of Colorado, even the easternmost part of
      Nevada is still west of the westernmost part of Colorado. Therefore, Roseman
      University in Henderson, NV would be west of Adams State University in Alamosa,
      CO.


      So the answer should be NO, Adams State University is NOT located west of Roseman
      University - it''s actually east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - On a US map, Nevada is located to the west of Colorado

      - The entire state of Colorado is east of Nevada


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Even without knowing the exact cities, the geography of the states determines
      that any location in Colorado would be east of any location in Nevada.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on this geographical relationship.

      - Since Adams State (in Colorado) is east of Roseman University (in Nevada),
      Adams State cannot be west of Roseman University.

      Now, let''s consider the specific universities:


      1. Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)

      2. Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV)


      Since Nevada is generally west of Colorado, it would mean that Roseman University

      Colorado is located in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States.

      Nevada is located even further west, between Colorado and California.


      Step 2: Consider state boundaries.

      Nevada is entirely west of Colorado on a map of the United States.


      Step 3: Apply this to the universities.

      - Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado


      Now, let me think about the general geography of the United States. When considering

      Louisiana is in the southeastern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.
      Colorado is in the western/central part of the United States, in the Rocky Mountain
      region.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Louisiana is generally east of Colorado.

      - States that lie between Colorado and Louisiana (moving east from Colorado)
      include Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas

      - Louisiana is clearly east of Colorado on the map of the United States

      1. Troy University in Alabama (AL)

      2. New Orleans University in Louisiana (LA)


      I need to determine whether Troy University is located west of New Orleans University.


      First, let me think about the general geography. Alabama (AL) is generally east
      of Louisiana (LA) in the United States. However, I should be more specific about
      these particular universities.


      Troy University is located in Troy, Alabama, which is in the southeastern part
      of Alabama.


      I need to consider "New Orleans University" in Louisiana. There isn''t actually
      a university with the exact name "New Orleans University" in Louisiana. There
      are several universities in New Orleans including:

      - University of New Orleans

      - Tulane University

      - Loyola University New Orleans

      - Xavier University of Louisiana

      - Dillard University


      Regardless of which specific university in New Orleans we''re referring to,
      New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana.


      Geographically speaking, New Orleans, Louisiana is west of Troy, Alabama. Louisiana
      is west of Alabama, and that relationship holds for these specific cities as
      well.


      Therefore, Troy University in Alabama is NOT west of any university in New Orleans,
      Louisiana. Instead, Troy University is EAST of New Orleans.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Troy University is located in Troy, Alabama (AL)

      - For "New Orleans University" in Louisiana (LA), I''ll consider universities
      in New Orleans (like University of New Orleans, Tulane, etc.)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the states.

      - Alabama is located east of Louisiana in the United States


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Troy is in southeastern Alabama

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Since Alabama is east of Louisiana, and Troy and New Orleans maintain this
      same directional relationship, Troy University is located EAST of New Orleans,
      not west.

      - Virginia (VA) is on the east coast of the US, in the mid-Atlantic region

      - Florida (FL) is also on the east coast, but further south


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      the east coast are more eastern than those in the midwest.


      Virginia (VA) is on the east coast of the United States, while Ohio (OH) is
      in the midwest, situated more inland from the east coast.


      Geographically, Ohio is west of Virginia. This means that institutions in Virginia

      northern part of the United States, in the Midwest region.


      University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Monroe, Louisiana. Louisiana is in the
      southern part of the United States, along the Gulf of Mexico.


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider their positions along

      Michigan is in the eastern half of the US but is relatively western compared
      to the eastern seaboard states.


      Louisiana is in the south-central region of the US.


      Generally speaking, Michigan is north of Louisiana, but the question is about
      east-west positioning.


      Michigan''s western border touches Lake Michigan, while Louisiana''s western
      border touches Texas.


      If I recall US geography correctly, Michigan would be more easterly than Louisiana.
      Louisiana is closer to Texas and the central meridian of the continental US,
      while Michigan is closer to the Great Lakes and the northeastern states.

      2. University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Monroe, Louisiana (LA).


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider their approximate longitudes:


      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States, bordering the Great
      Lakes.

      - Louisiana is in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      Looking at a map of the United States, Michigan is situated in the eastern half

      First, I need to determine the locations of both universities:


      1. Madonna University is in Michigan (MI)

      2. Texas Southern University is in Texas (TX)


      Now I need to think about the geographic positions of these states. Michigan
      is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States, while Texas is in
      the southern part of the country.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Michigan is in the eastern half of the United States

      - Texas is also in the southern central part of the United States


      Looking at their positions on a mental map of the US, Michigan is clearly to
      the east of Texas. So, if Madonna University is in Michigan and Texas Southern
      University is in Texas, then Madonna University would be east (not west) of
      Texas Southern University.</think>To determine if Madonna University in Michigan
      is west of Texas Southern University in Texas, I need to compare their geographic
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Madonna University is located in Livonia, Michigan (MI)

      - Texas Southern University is located in Houston, Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Michigan and Texas within the United
      States.

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the north-central/northeastern part
      of the United States

      - Texas is in the south-central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west).

      - Michigan is positioned significantly east of Texas on the U.S. map

      - Houston, TX is further west than any part of Michigan


      Since Madonna University (in Michigan) is located east of Texas Southern University
      (in Texas), not west of it, the answer is:


      NO'

      University, MI is located west of Texas Southern University, TX. Let me reason
      about this step by step based on geography.


      First, I need to consider the locations:

      - Madonna University is in Michigan (MI)

      - Texas Southern University is in Texas (TX)


      To determine which is more western, I need to think about the relative east-west
      positions of Michigan and Texas in the United States.


      Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States, bordering the Great
      Lakes, particularly Lake Michigan. It''s roughly in the north-central part of
      the country.


      Texas is in the south-central part of the United States. Texas extends quite
      far west in the country.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Texas is generally west of Michigan.
      Michigan is further east than Texas.


      Since Madonna University is in Michigan and Texas Southern University is in
      Texas, it follows that Madonna University would be EAST of Texas Southern University,
      not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities by examining their states'' locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Madonna University is in Michigan (MI)

      - Texas Southern University is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States, near the Great
      Lakes

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Michigan is positioned significantly east of Texas on the US map

      - Texas extends much further west than any part of Michigan


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the states'' positions.

      Since Madonna University is in Michigan (an eastern state relative to Texas),
      and Texas Southern University is in Texas (a western state relative to Michigan),
      Madonna University must be east of Texas Southern University, not west of it.

      1. The question is asking about the relative east-west positions of two universities:
      Midland University in Nebraska (NE) and Oklahoma Panhandle State University
      in Oklahoma (OK).


      2. I need to determine which one is located further west.


      3. Midland University is in Nebraska (NE). Nebraska is a state in the central
      United States, generally north of Oklahoma.


      4. Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in Oklahoma (OK), specifically in
      the Oklahoma Panhandle, which is the narrow western extension of Oklahoma that
      extends westward.


      5. The Oklahoma Panhandle is the westernmost part of Oklahoma, bordering the
      Texas Panhandle to the south, New Mexico to the west, and Colorado to the northwest.


      6. Nebraska is generally east of the Oklahoma Panhandle. While Nebraska does
      extend fairly far west, the Oklahoma Panhandle reaches quite far west.


      Let me verify the exact locations:

      - Midland University is located in Fremont, Nebraska, which is in the eastern
      part of the state

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma, which
      is in the Oklahoma Panhandle (the westernmost part of Oklahoma)

      Let me think about this geographically:


      1) Midland University is located in Fremont, Nebraska, which is in the eastern
      part of Nebraska.


      2) Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma, which
      is in the Oklahoma Panhandle - the narrow westernmost strip of Oklahoma.

      4) Fremont, Nebraska is in eastern Nebraska and is significantly east of the

      2. Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma (OK),
      which is in the Oklahoma panhandle region


      Now, I need to think about the relative east-west positions of these locations.
      The longitude (east-west position) is what matters here - lower longitude numbers
      indicate more western locations in the US.


      Nebraska is generally north of Oklahoma. The Oklahoma panhandle is the narrow
      western extension of Oklahoma that stretches toward the west. Given that it''s
      called the "panhandle," it''s at the far western edge of Oklahoma.


      Without exact coordinates, I can reason that the Oklahoma panhandle is likely
      farther west than most of Nebraska. Fremont, where Midland University is located,
      is in eastern Nebraska, not far from Omaha, which is on the eastern border with
      Iowa.


      Given this reasoning, Midland University in eastern Nebraska would be EAST of
      Oklahoma Panhandle State University, not west of it.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Midland University is located in Fremont, Nebraska (NE)

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma (OK),
      in the Oklahoma panhandle region


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these locations.

      - Fremont, Nebraska is in the eastern part of Nebraska, not far from the Missouri
      River and the Iowa border

      - The Oklahoma panhandle is the westernmost extension of Oklahoma, bordering
      the Texas panhandle, New Mexico, and Colorado


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positions).

      - Eastern Nebraska is considerably east of the Oklahoma panhandle

      - The Oklahoma panhandle extends much farther west than where Midland University
      is located


      Therefore, Midland University is NOT located west of Oklahoma Panhandle State
      University, but rather east of it.

      First, let me think about the general geography of Nebraska (NE) and Oklahoma
      (OK), particularly the Oklahoma Panhandle:


      1. Nebraska is located north of Oklahoma.

      2. The Oklahoma Panhandle is the westernmost part of Oklahoma, extending as
      a narrow strip to the west.

      3. Oklahoma Panhandle State University would be located in this western strip
      of Oklahoma.


      Now, to determine which is further west, I need to consider the longitude of

      Midland University is in Fremont, Nebraska, which is in the eastern part of
      Nebraska.

      Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in Goodwell, Oklahoma, which is in the

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is located inland, to the east of California

      To determine if Stony Brook is west of Baldwin Wallace, I need to know their
      geographical locations.


      New York is on the east coast of the United States, while Ohio is in the Midwest
      region. Generally speaking, New York is east of Ohio.


      More specifically:

      - Stony Brook is located on Long Island in New York, which is on the eastern
      seaboard

      - Baldwin Wallace University is in Berea, Ohio, which is in the Midwest


      Looking at the relative positions on a US map, Ohio is west of New York, and
      accordingly, Baldwin Wallace University would be west of Stony Brook University.


      So if I''m asked if Stony Brook (NY) is west of Baldwin Wallace (OH), the answer
      would be NO. It''s the other way around - Stony Brook is EAST of Baldwin Wallace.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the east-west relationship between

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Stony Brook University School of Medicine is in New York (NY)

      - Baldwin Wallace University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, which is west of New York


      Step 3: More specifically, Stony Brook is on Long Island in New York, which
      is quite far east, while Baldwin Wallace is in Berea, Ohio, which is considerably
      west of New York.


      Step 4: On a west-to-east orientation of the US map, Ohio is west of New York,
      so Baldwin Wallace University is west of Stony Brook University School of Medicine,
      not the other way around.


      NO, Stony Brook University School of Medicine is not located west of Baldwin

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region, west of New York but east of states like Illinois


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within these states.

      - Stony Brook is on Long Island, in the eastern part of New York

      - Baldwin Wallace University is in Berea, Ohio, in the northeastern part of
      Ohio


      Step 4: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Even though Stony Brook is in eastern NY and Baldwin Wallace is in northeastern
      OH, the entire state of New York is generally east of Ohio


      Therefore, Stony Brook University School of Medicine (NY) is east of Baldwin

      - Mary Allen Seminary is located in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Ohio and Texas within the United
      States.

      - Ohio is in the eastern/midwestern part of the United States

      - Texas is in the southern/southwestern part of the United States

      - Ohio is positioned significantly east of Texas

      - The entire state of Ohio lies east of Texas


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on relative positions.

      Since Ohio is east of Texas, Walsh University (in Ohio) must be east of Mary
      Allen Seminary (in Texas), not west of it.

      To answer this, I need to know the relative east-west positions of these schools:


      1. Thomas Jefferson University is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the eastern
      part of the United States.

      2. Lincoln College is in Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest, generally west
      of Pennsylvania.

      from east to west in this region would go:

      - Pennsylvania (east)

      - Ohio

      - Indiana

      - Illinois (further west)

      relationship between these two universities based on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both schools.

      - Thomas Jefferson University is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the eastern United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region

      - On a map of the US, Pennsylvania is significantly east of Illinois


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - Since Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, any institution in Pennsylvania would
      be east (not west) of an institution in Illinois

      - Thomas Jefferson University (PA) is therefore east of Lincoln College (IL)

      - The reverse statement (that Thomas Jefferson University is west of Lincoln
      College) would be false

      Governors State University (GSU) is in Illinois (IL). Illinois is in the Midwest
      region of the United States. More specifically, GSU is in University Park, Illinois,

      The question is asking if Governors State University is located west of Clary
      Sage College.


      To determine this, I need to know the relative east-west positions of Illinois
      and Oklahoma in the United States.


      In the US, states are generally arranged with:

      - East Coast states on the right (eastern side)

      - West Coast states on the left (western side)


      Illinois is in the Midwest region, while Oklahoma is in the South Central region.

      - Illinois is roughly in the middle-east part of the country

      - Oklahoma is in the middle-west part of the country


      Oklahoma is generally west of Illinois. Since Governors State University is

      Therefore, the answer is NO, Governors State University is not located west
      of Clary Sage College. It''s the opposite - Governors State University is east
      of Clary Sage College.</think># Is Governors State University, IL located west
      of Clary Sage College, OK?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two institutions based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Governors State University is in Illinois (IL)

      - Clary Sage College is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between Illinois and Oklahoma.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the South Central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a US map, Illinois is positioned to the east of Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is further west than Illinois


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Governors State University is in Illinois (which is east of Oklahoma),
      and Clary Sage College is in Oklahoma (which is west of Illinois), Governors
      State University is NOT west of Clary Sage College. It is actually east of it.

      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Governors State University is in Illinois (IL)

      - Clary Sage College is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Now, I need to think about the geographical positions of these states:

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region, roughly in the middle-eastern part of the

      - Oklahoma is west of the Mississippi River


      Since Oklahoma is west of Illinois, and the colleges are in these respective
      states, Clary Sage College (in Oklahoma) would be west of Governors State University
      (in Illinois), not the other way around.

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Illinois and Oklahoma.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region, in the eastern half of the United
      States

      - Oklahoma is located in the South Central region, more toward the western half
      of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Illinois is east of the Mississippi River

      - Oklahoma is west of the Mississippi River

      - On a map of the United States, Oklahoma is clearly west of Illinois


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific universities.

      Since Governors State University is in Illinois and Clary Sage College is in
      Oklahoma, and Illinois is east of Oklahoma, Governors State University must
      be east of Clary Sage College, not west.

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, west of New York


      Specifically, if I visualize a map:

    80692f32-59cb-4f20-9097-af4ca71d59e0: '<think>This question asks me to determine
      if East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania (in PA) is located west of Robert
      Morris University Illinois (in IL).


      To answer this, I need to think about the relative locations of Pennsylvania
      and Illinois in the United States.


      Pennsylvania is on the eastern side of the United States, while Illinois is
      in the Midwest.


      Specifically:

      - Pennsylvania is bordered by New York to the north, New Jersey to the east,
      Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest,
      and Ohio to the west.

      - Illinois is bordered by Wisconsin to the north, Iowa and Missouri to the west,
      Kentucky to the south, and Indiana to the east.


      Looking at the geographical positions, Illinois is clearly west of Pennsylvania
      on a map of the United States.


      East Stroudsburg is in eastern Pennsylvania (the name "East" in it is actually
      meaningful - it''s in the eastern part of the state). Robert Morris University
      Illinois is in Illinois, which is entirely west of Pennsylvania.


      So if East Stroudsburg University is in eastern Pennsylvania, and Robert Morris
      University is in Illinois, then East Stroudsburg University is east of Robert
      Morris University Illinois, not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative
      locations of these two universities by examining their states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the states involved.

      - East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is located in the
      eastern United States.

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (IL), which is located in
      the Midwest.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positioning of these states.

      - On a U.S. map, Illinois is clearly west of Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic coast region, while Illinois is much further
      inland toward the center of the country.


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - East Stroudsburg is actually in eastern Pennsylvania (near the New Jersey
      border).

      - Robert Morris University Illinois would be somewhere in Illinois, but regardless
      of its specific location in IL, the entire state of Illinois is west of Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, East Stroudsburg University (PA) is EAST of Robert Morris University
      Illinois (IL), not west of it.


      NO'

      University of Pennsylvania (PA) is located west of Robert Morris University
      Illinois (IL), I need to know the relative geographic positions of these two
      locations.


      Step 1: Let me identify where East Stroudsburg University is located. East Stroudsburg
      is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the eastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Robert Morris University Illinois is located.
      Based on the name, it''s in Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest region of
      the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions. In the United States, Illinois
      is generally west of Pennsylvania. Illinois is in the Midwest while Pennsylvania
      is on the East Coast.


      Since Illinois is west of Pennsylvania, East Stroudsburg University (in PA)
      would be EAST of Robert Morris University (in IL), not west of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is located in the
      eastern United States.

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (IL), which is located in
      the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions on an east-west axis.

      - Pennsylvania is significantly east of Illinois on the U.S. map.

      - The state of Illinois sits much further west than Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion about their relative positions.

      - Since Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, East Stroudsburg University (in PA)
      must be east of Robert Morris University Illinois (in IL).

      - This means East Stroudsburg University is NOT west of Robert Morris University
      Illinois.


      NO'

      General knowledge about US geography tells me:

      - Pennsylvania is on the eastern side of the United States

      - Illinois is in the midwest, west of Pennsylvania


      Since East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania, and Robert Morris University
      is in Illinois, and Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, then East Stroudsburg
      University would be east of Robert Morris University, not west.


      To confirm: East Stroudsburg, PA is in eastern Pennsylvania near the New Jersey
      border. Illinois is several states to the west of Pennsylvania. So East Stroudsburg
      University is definitely east of any location in Illinois.</think>To answer
      whether East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania is located west of Robert
      Morris University Illinois, I need to consider the geographical positions of
      Pennsylvania and Illinois.


      Step 1: Locate the states on a mental map of the US.

      Pennsylvania is on the eastern side of the United States, while Illinois is
      in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship between these states.

      Illinois is clearly west of Pennsylvania. The entire state of Pennsylvania lies
      east of Illinois.


      Step 3: Consider the specific universities.

      East Stroudsburg University is located in eastern Pennsylvania (near the New
      Jersey border), while Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (likely
      in or near Chicago).


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, East Stroudsburg University must be
      east of Robert Morris University Illinois, not west of it.

      to determine the geographical locations of Ohio State University, Lima Campus,
      OH and Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, NE, and compare their east-west positions.


      First, let me establish where these places are:


      Ohio State University, Lima Campus is in Lima, Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the eastern
      part of the Midwest region of the United States.


      Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is in Bellevue, Nebraska (NE). Nebraska is in the
      central part of the United States, west of Ohio.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, states generally go (from east to west):

      - Ohio

      - Indiana

      - Illinois

      - Iowa/Missouri

      - Nebraska

      - ...and so on toward the west coast


      So Nebraska is definitely west of Ohio. This means that Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue,
      NE would be west of Ohio State University, Lima Campus, OH.


      Therefore, Ohio State University, Lima Campus is NOT west of Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue.
      It''s east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Ohio State University, Lima Campus is in Ohio (OH)

      - Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is in Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United States,
      while Nebraska is in the central Great Plains region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Nebraska is clearly west of Ohio.
      Between these states are Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa/Missouri.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Since Lima, Ohio is in Ohio, and Bellevue, Nebraska is in Nebraska, the same
      relationship applies to these specific locations.


      NO. Ohio State University, Lima Campus is NOT located west of Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue.

      It''s asking whether the Ohio location is west of the Nebraska location.


      Let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest, bordering Pennsylvania

      - Nebraska is in the central part of the US, much further west than Ohio


      In terms of US geography, Nebraska is clearly west of Ohio. So any location
      in Ohio would generally be east of any location in Nebraska, not west.


      Lima, Ohio would be in western Ohio, but even western Ohio is far east of Nebraska.

      Bellevue, Nebraska is likely in eastern Nebraska (near Omaha), but even eastern
      Nebraska is still west of any part of Ohio.


      So the Ohio State University Lima Campus (in Ohio) would be EAST of Nebraska
      Medicine-Bellevue (in Nebraska), not west of it.</think>To answer this question,

      Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region, while Nebraska is
      in the central United States. On a map of the United States, Nebraska is clearly
      west of Ohio.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      Lima is in western Ohio, and Bellevue is in eastern Nebraska (near Omaha). However,
      even the westernmost part of Ohio is still east of the easternmost part of Nebraska.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Ohio is entirely east of Nebraska, Ohio State University''s Lima Campus
      must be east of any location in Nebraska, including Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue.


      NO, Ohio State University, Lima Campus is not located west of Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue.

      1. Eastern Washington University (EWU) in Washington state (WA)

      2. California College of the Arts (CCA) in California (CA)


      Then I need to determine which one is further west.


      Let''s reason through this geographically:


      - Washington state is located on the northwest coast of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States, south of Washington


      Generally speaking, Washington is north of California, but they''re both on
      the west coast. However, that doesn''t tell us about the specific locations
      of these institutions within their states.


      Eastern Washington University, as the name suggests, is likely in the eastern
      part of Washington state. Washington''s eastern region is inland, away from
      the Pacific coast.


      California College of the Arts is in California, but I need to know its specific
      location within California to make the comparison.


      From my knowledge, California College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco
      and Oakland, which are in the western part of California, right on the Pacific
      coast.


      Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington, which is indeed in the
      eastern part of Washington state, near Spokane.


      Given these locations:

      - Eastern Washington University is in eastern Washington (inland)

      - California College of the Arts is in western California (coastal)


      Since both Washington and California are on the west coast, with Washington
      being north of California, but EWU is in the eastern part of Washington while

      - Eastern Washington University (EWU) is located in Cheney, Washington, in the
      eastern part of Washington state

      - California College of the Arts (CCA) has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland,
      California, on the western coast of California


      ## Step 2: Compare their longitudinal positions

      - Even though Washington state is north of California, EWU is in the eastern
      part of Washington (inland, near Spokane)

      - CCA is on the Pacific coast in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is the western
      edge of California


      ## Step 3: Draw a conclusion

      - The western coast of California (where CCA is located) is farther west than
      eastern Washington (where EWU is located)

      - Therefore, EWU is east of CCA, not west of it

      of the Arts, I need to know their approximate geographic locations.


      Eastern Washington University is located in eastern Washington state, as the
      name suggests. Washington state is on the west coast of the United States, bordering

      Pacific Ocean.


      In general, Washington state is north of California. But west-east positioning
      depends on specific locations within these states.


      The key insight here is that while Washington is north of California, for one
      institution to be west of another, we need to compare their longitudes, not
      their north-south positions.

      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - Washington state is north of California.

      - However, the question is about east-west positioning (longitude), not north-south.

      - California College of the Arts, located in the San Francisco Bay Area, is
      closer to the Pacific coast.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - The west coast of the United States runs northwest to southeast.

      - This means coastal California (where CCA is located) is generally west of
      eastern Washington (where EWU is located).


      NO, Eastern Washington University is NOT located west of California College

      west of California College of the Arts.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Washington state is located on the west coast of the US, north of Oregon and
      California

      - California is also on the west coast, south of Oregon and Washington


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Washington state is generally not west of California - they''re both on the
      western edge of the US, with Washington being to the north

      - Most of Washington is either directly north of California or slightly east,
      not west


      Now for the specific schools:

      - Eastern Washington University, as the name suggests, is in the eastern part
      of Washington state

      - California College of the Arts is in California, but I need to consider where
      in California


      Even without knowing the exact location of California College of the Arts, I

      Let me think about the geographic locations of these two institutions:


      1) Eastern Washington University (EWU) is located in Cheney, Washington, in
      the eastern part of Washington state, as its name suggests.


      2) California College of the Arts (CCA) has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland,
      California, which are on the western coast of California.


      3) Geographically, Washington state is north of California, not west of it.
      Both states border the Pacific Ocean on their western edges.


      4) Since EWU is in the eastern part of Washington, and CCA is on the western

      GA is west of Mount Hermon Female Seminary, MS


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Brenau University is in Georgia (GA)

      - Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in Mississippi (MS)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      On a U.S. map, Mississippi is positioned to the west of Georgia. Mississippi
      is along the Mississippi River, while Georgia is on the Atlantic coast.


      ## Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the institutions

      Since Mississippi is west of Georgia, and these institutions are in their respective
      states, Mount Hermon Female Seminary (in Mississippi) would be west of Brenau
      University (in Georgia) - not the other way around.


      ## NO


      Brenau University in Georgia is NOT located west of Mount Hermon Female Seminary
      in Mississippi. It is located east of it.'

      need to find the locations of both institutions and compare their geographic
      coordinates, particularly their longitudes (since west/east relationships are
      determined by longitude).


      Let me find information about both institutions:


      1. Brenau University is located in Gainesville, Georgia.

      2. I need to find information about Mount Hermon Female Seminary in Mississippi.


      I''m not immediately familiar with Mount Hermon Female Seminary in Mississippi.
      It might be a historical institution that no longer exists under that name,
      or it might have been renamed.


      Let me consider what I know about US geography more generally. Georgia is located
      to the east of Mississippi in the United States. Georgia borders the Atlantic
      Ocean on the east, while Mississippi is further west, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico and the Mississippi River.


      Since Brenau University is in Georgia and Mount Hermon Female Seminary is (or
      was) in Mississippi, and Georgia is east of Mississippi, Brenau University would
      be EAST of Mount Hermon Female Seminary, not west.


      So the answer should be NO, Brenau University, GA is not located west of Mount
      Hermon Female Seminary, MS.</think># Determining the East-West Relationship
      between Two Schools


      I need to determine whether Brenau University in Georgia is located west of
      Mount Hermon Female Seminary in Mississippi.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Brenau University is in Georgia (GA)

      - Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in Mississippi (MS)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states

      Looking at a US map, Mississippi is located directly west of Alabama, and Alabama
      is directly west of Georgia. This means that Mississippi is west of Georgia.


      ## Step 3: Apply this relationship to the schools

      Since Brenau University is in Georgia, and Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in
      Mississippi, and Mississippi is west of Georgia, then Brenau University must
      be EAST of Mount Hermon Female Seminary (not west).


      NO, Brenau University is not located west of Mount Hermon Female Seminary.'

      the relative geographic locations of two institutions:

      1. Brenau University in Georgia (GA)

      2. Mount Hermon Female Seminary in Mississippi (MS)


      I need to figure out which one is located further west.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Mississippi (MS) is also in the southeastern US, but is further west than
      Georgia


      In general, Mississippi is west of Georgia on the US map. Georgia borders the
      Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side, while Mississippi borders the Mississippi
      River on its western side, with Alabama in between them.


      Since Brenau University is in Georgia, and Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in
      Mississippi, and Mississippi is west of Georgia, that means Mount Hermon Female
      Seminary would be west of Brenau University.


      Therefore, Brenau University is NOT west of Mount Hermon Female Seminary. It''s
      actually east of it.</think># Determining the Relative Locations


      To answer this question, I need to determine the east-west positioning of these
      two institutions based on their states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Brenau University is in Georgia (GA)

      - Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in Mississippi (MS)


      ## Step 2: Compare the states'' geographic positions

      When looking at a US map, Georgia is positioned in the southeastern United States,
      bordering the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side. Mississippi is also in the
      southeastern US, but is positioned further west than Georgia, with Alabama located
      between them.


      ## Step 3: Determine the relative positioning

      Since Mississippi is west of Georgia on the US map, and the institutions are
      in these respective states, Mount Hermon Female Seminary would be west of Brenau
      University (not the other way around).

      - Clarkson University is located in Potsdam, New York

      - Cornerstone University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan


      Step 2: Now I need to determine which is further west. In the United States,

      First, let me identify their locations:

      - Clarkson University is in New York state (NY)

      - Cornerstone University is in Michigan state (MI)


      To determine which is further west, I need to think about the general geography
      of these states:


      New York is in the northeastern part of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, west of New York.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Michigan is generally west of New York. Even
      the easternmost parts of Michigan would typically be west of most parts of New
      York.


      Therefore, Clarkson University in NY would be east of Cornerstone University
      in MI, not west of it.</think>To determine if Clarkson University in NY is located
      west of Cornerstone University in MI, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Clarkson University is in Potsdam, New York

      - Cornerstone University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of New York and Michigan.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Michigan is generally west of New York state

      - Even the easternmost parts of Michigan are typically west of the western parts
      of New York


      Step 4: Conclusion based on state positions.

      Since Clarkson University is in New York, and Cornerstone University is in Michigan,
      and Michigan is west of New York, Clarkson cannot be west of Cornerstone.

      1. University of Georgia College of Public Health is in Georgia (GA), which

      2. The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas (TX), which is

      roughly arranged with Pacific coast states like California, Oregon, and Washington
      on the western edge, and Atlantic coast states like Maine, New York, and Florida
      on the eastern edge. Georgia is one of these eastern states on the Atlantic
      coast, while Texas is more central and extends toward the west.

      I need to determine whether the University of Georgia College of Public Health
      (in Georgia) is located west of The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - University of Georgia College of Public Health is in Georgia (GA)

      - The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, extending toward the
      west

      - On a US map, Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas


      ## Step 3: Make the comparison

      Since Georgia is east of Texas, the University of Georgia College of Public
      Health must be east of The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More, not
      west of it.

      To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.
      Things that are "west" have a higher longitude number (when using the standard
      where west longitudes are negative numbers).


      Let me think about the general geographic positions:

      - Georgia (GA) is a state on the eastern side of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is a state in the south-central United States, bordering Mexico


      In terms of east-west positioning on a US map:

      - Georgia is definitely east of Texas

      - Texas is west of Georgia


      So a college in Georgia would generally be east of a college in Texas, which
      means a college in Texas would be west of a college in Georgia.

      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning of these states on the US map.

      - Georgia is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas

      - Texas is positioned to the west of Georgia

      Faulkner University (in Alabama), I need to determine which one is further west
      than the other.


      Let me think about the general locations:

      - Winston-Salem State University is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (NC)

      - Faulkner University is in Montgomery, Alabama (AL)


      In terms of US geography, Alabama is generally west of North Carolina. Alabama
      is in the southeastern United States, while North Carolina is on the eastern
      seaboard. When looking at a map of the United States, Alabama is positioned
      to the west of North Carolina.


      Montgomery, AL (where Faulkner University is located) should be west of Winston-Salem,
      NC (where Winston-Salem State University is located).


      Therefore, Winston-Salem State University is NOT west of Faulkner University.
      Instead, Faulkner University is west of Winston-Salem State University.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Winston-Salem State University is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (NC)

      - Faulkner University is in Montgomery, Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Alabama
      is located in the southeastern region, but further inland and to the west of
      North Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Alabama is positioned west of North Carolina on a U.S. map. Therefore, Montgomery,
      AL (where Faulkner University is located) is west of Winston-Salem, NC (where
      Winston-Salem State University is located).


      NO. Winston-Salem State University is not located west of Faulkner University.
      It''s the opposite - Faulkner University is west of Winston-Salem State University.'

      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, North Carolina is located on the
      Atlantic coast in the southeast.

      - Alabama is also in the southeast, but it''s further west than North Carolina.


      Step 3: Determine east-west relationship.

      - North Carolina is east of Alabama on the map.

      - Therefore, Winston-Salem (in NC) is east of Montgomery (in AL).

      - If Winston-Salem is east of Montgomery, then it cannot be west of it.

      to determine the relative geographic positions of the University of Colorado
      at Colorado Springs, CO and Los Angeles Recording School, CA.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) is in Colorado Springs,
      Colorado

      - Los Angeles Recording School is in Los Angeles, California


      In the United States, Colorado is east of California. On a map of the US, California
      is on the west coast, while Colorado is more inland and to the east of California.


      Since Los Angeles is in California (west) and Colorado Springs is in Colorado
      (east), the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs must be located east
      of Los Angeles Recording School, not west of it.


      So the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine if the University of Colorado
      at Colorado Springs (UCCS) is west of the Los Angeles Recording School.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is in Colorado Springs, Colorado

      - Los Angeles Recording School is in Los Angeles, California


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Colorado is inland, to the east of California


      Step 3: Since Colorado is east of California, Colorado Springs must be east
      of Los Angeles.


      Step 4: For something to be "west" of something else, it would need to be further
      toward the west coast.


      Since the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is located east (not west)
      of Los Angeles Recording School, the answer is:


      NO'

      To determine which is more west, I need to know their relative longitudes. In
      the US, places further west have higher (more negative) longitude values.


      Generally speaking, Colorado is east of California. California is on the west
      coast of the United States, while Colorado is in the Rocky Mountain region,
      further inland.


      Los Angeles, CA is on the west coast of the United States, while Colorado Springs,

      Looking at the geographic positions of these states:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Colorado is in the Rocky Mountain region, east of California


      In terms of longitude:

      - Los Angeles, CA is further west (closer to the Pacific Ocean)

      - Colorado Springs, CO is further east (inland)


      Therefore, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is located EAST of the
      Los Angeles Recording School, not west of it.

      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - Oklahoma is generally north of Texas

      - But the question is asking about east-west positioning


      Let me think about where these specific institutions are located:

      1. Oklahoma Baptist University (OBU) is in Shawnee, Oklahoma, which is in central
      Oklahoma, a bit east of Oklahoma City

      2. Midland College is in Midland, Texas, which is in west Texas


      Looking at the general geography of the US:

      - West Texas is further west than most of Oklahoma

      - Midland specifically is in the western part of Texas, which would place it
      further west than central Oklahoma where OBU is located


      So if Oklahoma Baptist University is in central Oklahoma, and Midland College

      College, not west of it.

      - Oklahoma Baptist University (OBU) is located in Shawnee, Oklahoma, which is
      in central Oklahoma, slightly east of Oklahoma City.

      - Midland College is located in Midland, Texas, which is in western Texas.


      Step 2: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Western Texas extends further west than most of Oklahoma.

      - Midland is positioned in the western portion of Texas, placing it considerably
      westward on the map.

      - Shawnee, Oklahoma is in the central-eastern part of Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Make the east-west comparison.

      - Midland, Texas is further west than Shawnee, Oklahoma.

      - Therefore, Oklahoma Baptist University is positioned EAST of Midland College,
      not west of it.

      in North Carolina is west of Saint Mary''s University of Minnesota, I need to
      identify the approximate longitudes of both universities.


      Wingate University is in Wingate, North Carolina, which is in the eastern part
      of the United States. North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast.


      Saint Mary''s University of Minnesota is in Winona, Minnesota, which is in the
      upper Midwest of the United States. Minnesota borders Canada and is significantly
      west of North Carolina.


      In the United States, locations further west have higher longitude numbers.
      Minnesota is generally west of North Carolina. This means that Saint Mary''s
      University in Minnesota should be west of Wingate University in North Carolina.


      So the answer should be NO - Wingate University is NOT west of Saint Mary''s
      University of Minnesota. Rather, it''s the opposite - Saint Mary''s University
      of Minnesota is west of Wingate University.


      Actually, I made a mistake in my reasoning. In geographic coordinates, western
      longitudes in the United States are expressed as negative numbers, and the further
      west you go, the more negative (or greater in absolute value) the longitude
      becomes. So let me correct myself:


      Wingate University (NC) is in the eastern part of the US.

      Saint Mary''s University (MN) is in the midwest, which is west of the eastern
      US.


      So Saint Mary''s University is west of Wingate University, not the other way
      around.</think># Is Wingate University, NC located west of Saint Mary''s University
      of Minnesota, MN?


      Let me think through this step by step by considering the geographic locations
      of both universities.


      1) Wingate University is located in Wingate, North Carolina, which is in the
      southeastern United States.


      2) Saint Mary''s University of Minnesota is located in Winona, Minnesota, which
      is in the upper Midwest region of the United States.


      3) When looking at a map of the United States, Minnesota is significantly west
      of North Carolina. The state of Minnesota sits roughly in the middle of the
      continent, while North Carolina is much closer to the Atlantic coast.


      4) Since Minnesota is west of North Carolina, Saint Mary''s University (in Minnesota)
      must be west of Wingate University (in North Carolina).


      5) Therefore, Wingate University is NOT west of Saint Mary''s University - it''s
      actually east of it.

      \ (MN), which is in the Upper Midwest region\n\n## Step 2: Compare their longitudes\n\

      \ is roughly between 89\xB0 W and 97\xB0 W longitude\n\n## Step 3: Analyze east-west\

      \ would encounter North Carolina before Minnesota\n- Minnesota is clearly west\
      \ of North Carolina on a US map\n\nSince Wingate University is in North Carolina\
      \ (an eastern state) and Saint Mary's University is in Minnesota (a midwestern\
      \ state that is west of North Carolina), Wingate University cannot be west of\
      \ Saint Mary's University.\n\nNO"

      to determine the geographical locations of Wittenberg University in Ohio and
      Mitchell Technical College in South Dakota, and then compare their east-west
      positions.


      First, let me think about where these states are located:

      - Ohio (OH) is in the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United States

      - South Dakota (SD) is in the upper Midwest/Great Plains region, significantly
      west of Ohio


      Since these are in different states, I should consider the general east-west
      positioning of these states:

      - Ohio is much further east than South Dakota

      - On a map of the US, South Dakota would be to the west of Ohio


      Given that Wittenberg University is in Ohio and Mitchell Technical College is
      in South Dakota, it''s very likely that Wittenberg University is east of Mitchell
      Technical College, not west of it.


      To be more specific:

      - Wittenberg University is in Springfield, Ohio

      - Mitchell Technical College is in Mitchell, South Dakota


      Since Ohio is east of South Dakota, Wittenberg University would be east of Mitchell
      Technical College, not west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - Wittenberg University is located in Springfield, Ohio (OH)

      - Mitchell Technical College is located in Mitchell, South Dakota (SD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Ohio and South Dakota.

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United States

      - South Dakota is in the upper Midwest/Great Plains region, significantly further
      west than Ohio


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - On a US map, South Dakota is clearly west of Ohio

      - Therefore, any location in Ohio would generally be east of any location in
      South Dakota


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the specific colleges.

      - Since Wittenberg University is in Ohio, and Mitchell Technical College is
      in South Dakota, Wittenberg University is east (not west) of Mitchell Technical
      College


      NO'

      First, let me identify where each college is located:

      - Wittenberg University is in Ohio (OH)

      - Mitchell Technical College is in South Dakota (SD)


      Now I need to think about the geographic locations of Ohio and South Dakota
      in the United States:

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest region, bordering Pennsylvania
      to the east

      - South Dakota is in the northern Great Plains region, much further west than
      Ohio


      When looking at a US map, South Dakota is clearly west of Ohio. States between
      Ohio and South Dakota include Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota/Nebraska
      (depending on which part).


      So if Mitchell Technical College is in South Dakota, and Wittenberg University
      is in Ohio, then Mitchell Technical College must be west of Wittenberg University.


      The question asks if Wittenberg University is west of Mitchell Technical College,
      which is the opposite of what I determined.</think>To answer this question,

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest region

      - South Dakota is in the northern Great Plains region, significantly further
      west


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - On a US map, South Dakota is clearly west of Ohio

      - There are several states between them (like Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and either
      Minnesota or Nebraska)


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Mitchell Technical College.


      First, let me recall the general locations of these states:

      - Ohio (OH) is in the eastern part of the Midwest region, bordering Pennsylvania
      to the east

      - South Dakota (SD) is in the northern Great Plains region, much further west

      In the United States, longitude decreases as you move from east to west (with
      the East Coast having higher longitude values than the West Coast).


      Since South Dakota is significantly west of Ohio, any location in South Dakota
      would generally be west of any location in Ohio.

      - South Dakota is located in the northern Great Plains region, much further
      west


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions on a US map.

      - States get progressively more western as you move from Ohio toward South Dakota

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania to the east and Indiana to the west

      - South Dakota is several states west of Ohio (you would need to cross Indiana,
      Illinois, Iowa/Missouri, and Nebraska/Minnesota to get from Ohio to South Dakota)


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      - Since South Dakota is substantially west of Ohio, Mitchell Technical College
      must be west of Wittenberg University, not the other way around


      NO, Wittenberg University in Ohio is not located west of Mitchell Technical

      Texas at Tyler (in Texas).


      To determine this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of these
      institutions. Let''s think about the general geographical layout of these states:


      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast.

      Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Texas. This means that locations in Georgia
      would typically be east of locations in Texas, not west.


      Specifically:

      - Altamaha Technical College is in Georgia

      - University of Texas at Tyler is in Texas


      Given the general positions of these states, Altamaha Technical College (in
      GA) would be east of the University of Texas at Tyler (in TX), not west of it.</think>#

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, extending toward the
      west


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned to the east
      of Texas

      - Any location in Georgia would generally be east (not west) of locations in
      Texas

      First, I need to consider the general geographical locations:

      - Georgia (GA) is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Texas (TX) is a state in the south-central United States


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Texas on a US map. The entire state of
      Georgia is situated to the east of Texas.


      Since Altamaha Technical College is in Georgia, and the University of Texas
      at Tyler is in Texas, it''s very likely that Altamaha Technical College is east
      of the University of Texas at Tyler, not west.


      Let me be even more specific:

      - Tyler, TX is in east Texas

      - Altamaha Technical College is somewhere in Georgia


      Even though Tyler is in the eastern part of Texas, Georgia is still entirely
      east of Texas. So Altamaha Technical College would be east of the University
      of Texas at Tyler.


      Therefore, Altamaha Technical College, GA is NOT located west of University

      - Altamaha Technical College is in Georgia (GA)

      - University of Texas at Tyler is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - On a map of the US, Georgia is positioned entirely to the east of Texas


      Step 3: Even though Tyler is in eastern Texas, any location in Georgia (including
      Altamaha Technical College) would still be east of Tyler, Texas.


      Therefore, Altamaha Technical College is NOT west of the University of Texas
      at Tyler, but rather east of it.

      Charleston, SC is located on the east coast of the United States, in South Carolina
      which is an eastern seaboard state.


      Central State University is in Ohio, which is in the Midwest region of the United
      States.


      When considering east-west positioning in the United States:

      - Eastern states like South Carolina are generally east of midwestern states
      like Ohio

      - Ohio is west of South Carolina


      Since College of Charleston is in South Carolina (an eastern state) and Central
      State University is in Ohio (a midwestern state that''s west of South Carolina),
      College of Charleston would be EAST of Central State University, not west.

      OH.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of South Carolina and Ohio within
      the United States.

      - South Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region, but still relatively eastern in the country


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - South Carolina is located along the Atlantic Ocean

      - Ohio is inland, but positioned west of South Carolina


      Step 4: Since College of Charleston is in South Carolina (an eastern state)
      and Central State University is in Ohio (which is west of South Carolina), College
      of Charleston would be EAST of Central State University, not west.

      to determine the geographical locations of Lewis University in Illinois and
      Midwestern State University of Texas in Texas, and then compare their east-west
      positioning.


      First, let''s identify their locations:


      1. Lewis University is in Illinois (IL). Specifically, it''s located in Romeoville,
      Illinois, which is in the northeastern part of Illinois, near Chicago.


      2. Midwestern State University of Texas is in Texas (TX). It''s located in Wichita
      Falls, Texas, which is in north-central Texas near the Oklahoma border.


      Now, to determine which is further west, I need to consider their relative positions
      on a map of the United States:


      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the US, and is generally east of Texas.

      - Texas is in the south-central/southwestern part of the US, west of Illinois.


      Given that Lewis University is in Illinois (an eastern state compared to Texas)
      and Midwestern State University is in Texas (a western state compared to Illinois),
      Lewis University would be EAST of Midwestern State University, not west.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Lewis University is NOT located west of Midwestern
      State University of Texas.</think>I need to determine the east-west relationship

      Lewis University is located in Romeoville, Illinois, which is in the northeastern
      part of Illinois, near Chicago.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Midwestern State University of Texas, TX.

      Midwestern State University is located in Wichita Falls, Texas, which is in
      north-central Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas is in the
      south-central region. On a map of the United States, Texas is positioned west
      of Illinois.


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Since Lewis University is in Illinois (east) and Midwestern State University
      is in Texas (west), Lewis University is east of Midwestern State University,
      not west of it.

      The question is whether UNH-Manchester is west of Shorter University.


      To figure this out, I need to know where these places are located on the US
      map and compare their longitudes.


      Manchester, New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States, specifically
      in New England.

      Georgia is in the southeastern United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude), New Hampshire is typically quite
      far east on the US map, close to the Atlantic coast. Georgia is also in the
      eastern part of the US, but generally would be more western than New Hampshire.


      So my initial thought is that UNH-Manchester would be EAST of Shorter University
      in Georgia, not west. But let me reason a bit more carefully.


      In the US, states generally become more western as you move from right to left

      - University of New Hampshire at Manchester is located in Manchester, New Hampshire

      - Shorter University is located in Rome, Georgia


      Step 2: Understand US geography.

      - New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States (New England region)

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions.

      - New Hampshire is on the East Coast, very far to the east

      - Georgia is also in the eastern part of the US, but positioned more toward
      the central part of the eastern seaboard

      - States in New England (like New Hampshire) are generally further east than
      southern states like Georgia


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on relative longitude.

      if Purdue University Northwest is west of Lamar University


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Locate Purdue University Northwest

      Purdue University Northwest is located in northwest Indiana (IN), with campuses
      in Hammond and Westville. Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States.


      ## Step 2: Locate Lamar University

      Lamar University is located in Beaumont, Texas (TX), which is in the eastern
      part of Texas near the Louisiana border.


      ## Step 3: Compare their longitudes

      Texas is generally west of Indiana in the United States. Even eastern Texas
      (where Beaumont is located) is west of western Indiana. Northwest Indiana is
      significantly east of eastern Texas.


      Therefore, Purdue University Northwest is EAST of Lamar University, not west.

      The two universities mentioned are:

      1. University of Missouri-St. Louis (UMSL) in Missouri (MO)

      2. Regis University in Colorado (CO)


      To answer this, I need to know which state is further west - Missouri or Colorado.


      The United States, when viewed on a map, has Missouri located in the Midwest
      region, while Colorado is located in the Mountain West region. Colorado is definitely
      west of Missouri on the map of the United States.


      Since University of Missouri-St. Louis is in Missouri (MO), and Regis University
      is in Colorado (CO), and Colorado is west of Missouri, that means Regis University
      is west of University of Missouri-St. Louis.


      So, is University of Missouri-St. Louis, MO located west of Regis University,
      CO?

      No, it''s the opposite. University of Missouri-St. Louis is EAST of Regis University.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of

      - University of Missouri-St. Louis is in Missouri (MO)

      - Regis University is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Colorado is located in the western United States (Mountain West region), while
      Missouri is in the Midwest region, significantly east of Colorado.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      St. Louis is on the eastern side of Missouri (on the Illinois border), making
      it even further east relative to Colorado. Denver (where Regis University is
      located) is on the eastern side of Colorado, but Colorado as a whole is still
      much further west than Missouri.


      NO, University of Missouri-St. Louis is NOT located west of Regis University.
      It is located east of Regis University.'

      University of Missouri-St. Louis (UMSL) is located in St. Louis, Missouri.

      Regis University is located in Denver, Colorado.


      Now I need to determine which state is more western. Looking at a US map:

      - Missouri is in the Midwest region

      - Colorado is in the Mountain West region


      Colorado is clearly west of Missouri on a map of the United States. Denver,
      CO is further west than St. Louis, MO.


      So if Regis University is in Denver, Colorado, and University of Missouri-St.
      Louis is in St. Louis, Missouri, then Regis University is west of University
      of Missouri-St. Louis.


      The question asks if University of Missouri-St. Louis is west of Regis University,
      which would be the opposite of what I determined. So the answer is NO.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations of these two

      - University of Missouri-St. Louis is located in St. Louis, Missouri.

      - Regis University is located in Denver, Colorado.


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these locations.

      - St. Louis, Missouri is in the eastern part of Missouri, near the Illinois
      border.

      - Denver, Colorado is in the central part of Colorado, near the Rocky Mountains.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      - Missouri is located east of Colorado in the United States.

      - St. Louis is in the eastern part of Missouri, while Denver is in Colorado,
      which is entirely west of Missouri.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Colorado is west of Missouri, Regis University (in Denver, CO) is west
      of the University of Missouri-St. Louis (in St. Louis, MO), not the other way
      around.

      To solve this, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of Georgia
      (GA) and Texas (TX) in the United States.


      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast.

      Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Georgia is east of Texas. The entire state

      1. Montana State University is located in Bozeman, Montana, which is in the
      western United States but east of California.


      2. California South Bay University would be located in California''s South Bay

      Since California is on the west coast of the United States and Montana is inland
      (east of California), Montana State University cannot be west of any university
      in California.

      Step 1: Let me identify where these states are located geographically in the
      US.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.

      - Montana is an inland state, located to the northeast of California.


      Step 2: Consider their relative east-west positions.

      - California is the westernmost continental state in the US.

      - Montana is east of California.


      Step 3: Since Montana State University is in Montana, and California South Bay
      University is in California, their relative positions follow their states''
      positions.


      NO - Montana State University is not west of California South Bay University.
      It is east of it.'

      to compare their geographical locations, particularly their longitudes.


      First, let me identify where each university is located:


      - Southern Connecticut State University is in New Haven, Connecticut, which
      is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Miami University Middletown is in Middletown, Ohio, which is in the Midwest
      region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Connecticut is east of Ohio on the map of the United States.
      The East Coast (where Connecticut is) is east of the Midwest region (where Ohio
      is). So that means Southern Connecticut State University would be east of Miami
      University Middletown, not west of it.


      To be considered "west" of something, you need to have a higher longitude value
      (if using negative numbers for west longitudes, as is standard in the Western
      Hemisphere, you would have a lower/more negative number).

      - Southern Connecticut State University is in Connecticut (CT), on the East
      Coast

      - Miami University Middletown is in Ohio (OH), in the Midwest


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship

      Connecticut is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States,
      while Ohio is located in the midwestern United States. When looking at a US
      map, Connecticut is clearly positioned to the east of Ohio.


      ## Step 3: Determine the directional relationship

      Since Connecticut is east of Ohio, Southern Connecticut State University would
      be east of (not west of) Miami University Middletown.

      West Chester University is in West Chester, Pennsylvania, which is in the southeastern
      part of Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia.


      Urbana University is in Urbana, Ohio. Ohio is generally west of Pennsylvania.


      Since Pennsylvania is east of Ohio on the map of the United States, and West
      Chester is in eastern Pennsylvania (near Philadelphia), while Urbana is somewhere

      in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania near Philadelphia.


      2) Urbana University is located in Urbana, Ohio.


      3) Geographically, Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania on the U.S. map.


      4) Since West Chester is in eastern Pennsylvania (near Philadelphia) and Urbana

    c8c983a6-ef99-4b9b-899d-bac2799a0abd: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to:

      1. Determine the location of Wayne State University School of Social Work in
      Michigan

      2. Determine the location of Drury University in Missouri

      3. Compare their east-west positions to determine which is further west


      Let me reason through this:


      Wayne State University is located in Detroit, Michigan. Detroit is in the eastern
      part of Michigan.


      Drury University is located in Springfield, Missouri. Springfield is in the
      southwestern part of Missouri.


      Now I need to determine which is further west. The United States generally follows
      this geographic pattern:

      - The east coast states are furthest east

      - The central states are in the middle

      - The west coast states are furthest west


      Michigan is in the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region, while Missouri is more
      centrally located in the US. Missouri is generally west of Michigan.


      So if Wayne State is in Michigan (east) and Drury is in Missouri (more central/west),
      then Wayne State would be EAST of Drury University, not west.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Locate Wayne State University School of Social Work.

      Wayne State University is located in Detroit, Michigan, which is in the eastern
      part of Michigan.


      Step 2: Locate Drury University.

      Drury University is in Springfield, Missouri, which is in the southwestern part
      of Missouri.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region in the eastern half of the United
      States, while Missouri is further west in the central United States.


      Step 4: Determine their relative positions.

      When comparing their longitudes, Missouri is west of Michigan. Therefore, Wayne
      State (in Detroit, MI) would be east of Drury University (in Springfield, MO),
      not west.
