      1. First, I''ll locate Georgia Highlands College, GA:

      - Georgia Highlands College is located in northwest Georgia, primarily in cities
      like Rome and Carrollton.

      - This means it is in the western part of Georgia.


      2. Next, I''ll locate Jarvis Christian College, TX:

      - Jarvis Christian College is located in Hawkins, Texas, which is in the eastern
      part of Texas.


      3. Now, I''ll compare their geographical positions:

      - Georgia is east of Texas

      - Georgia Highlands College is in western Georgia

      - Jarvis Christian College is in eastern Texas


      4. Comparing their relative positions:

      - Western Georgia is further east than eastern Texas

      - So Georgia Highlands College is NOT west of Jarvis Christian College


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

    cfd7abaa-39d1-4a70-a0d0-fadb2142f13d: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Full Sail University

      - Full Sail University is located in Winter Park, Florida

      - Winter Park is near Orlando, in central Florida


      2. Next, I''ll locate Davenport University

      - Davenport University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan

      - Grand Rapids is in western Michigan


      3. Consider their geographical positions

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan is located in the midwestern United States


      4. Compare their relative positions

      - Florida is east of Michigan

      - Therefore, Full Sail University (in Florida) is east of Davenport University
      (in Michigan)


      5. The question asks: "Is Full Sail University, FL located west of Davenport
      University, MI?"

      - Since Full Sail is east of Davenport, it is NOT west of Davenport

      1. First, I''ll locate University of New Hampshire at Manchester, NH:

      - This is in Manchester, New Hampshire

      - New Hampshire is in the northeastern part of the United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate Shorter University, GA:

      - This is in Rome, Georgia

      - Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - New Hampshire is north and east of Georgia

      - This means that a point in New Hampshire would be located northeast of a point
      in Georgia


      4. The question specifically asks if the University of New Hampshire at Manchester
      is west of Shorter University:

      - Since New Hampshire is east of Georgia, the University of New Hampshire at
      Manchester is NOT west of Shorter University
