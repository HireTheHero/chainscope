      2. Then, I''ll locate Stillwater Reservoir in New York (NY)

      Step 1: Star Lite Motel location

      - This is in Minnesota, likely in a specific county or town


      Step 2: Stillwater Reservoir location

      - This is in New York state, likely in the Adirondack region


      Step 3: Relative positioning

      - Minnesota is west of New York

      - These locations are in different states, quite far apart

      - To be "south of" would mean the Star Lite Motel is geographically below (south
      of) the Stillwater Reservoir


      Given the geographical locations of these two points, the Star Lite Motel in

      - New York State is in the northeastern part of the United States


      2. Next, locate Oologah Lake in Oklahoma

      - This is in northeastern Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central part of the United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - New York is much further north and east compared to Oklahoma

      - Any point in New York will be north of a point in Oklahoma


      4. Specifically for Astor Theatre and Oologah Lake

      - The Astor Theatre is definitively north of Oologah Lake


      5. The question asks: "Is Astor Theatre located south of Oologah Lake?"

      - Based on the geographical reasoning above, this is false


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Barker Meadow Reservoir in Colorado

      2. Then, I''ll locate Navajo Lake in New Mexico

      3. Then I''ll compare their relative positions


      Step 1: Barker Meadow Reservoir is located in Boulder County, Colorado, in the
      northern part of the state.


      Step 2: Navajo Lake is located in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado
      border.


      Step 3: Comparing their positions:

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is in north-central Colorado

      - Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico, which is actually further south
      than Barker Meadow Reservoir


      Therefore, Barker Meadow Reservoir is NOT located south of Navajo Lake.

      1. First, I''ll locate Allen Theatre in Ohio

      2. Then, I''ll locate Lexington Reservoir in California

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Allen Theatre location

      - Allen Theatre is likely in Ohio

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the United States


      Step 2: Lexington Reservoir location

      - Lexington Reservoir is in California

      - California is located on the western coast of the United States


      Step 3: Geographic comparison

      - Ohio is east of California

      - This means any point in Ohio would be east of any point in California

      - "South" would require the Ohio location to be below the California location

      - But since Ohio is entirely east of California, it cannot be "south" in this
      context


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      Step 1: Allen Theatre location

      - Allen Theatre is in Ohio

      - Ohio is located in the northeastern part of the United States


      Step 2: Lexington Reservoir location

      - Lexington Reservoir is in California

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States


      Step 3: Geographical comparison

      - Ohio is east of California

      - This means any point in Ohio would be north of a point in California at the
      same longitude


      Therefore, Allen Theatre, OH is NOT located south of Lexington Reservoir, CA.

      2. Then, I''ll locate Lexington Reservoir in California

      3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: Allen Theatre location

      - Allen Theatre is likely in Ohio, but I don''t have precise coordinates


      Step 2: Lexington Reservoir location

      - Lexington Reservoir is located in California, near Los Gatos in Santa Clara
      County


      Step 3: Relative positioning

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the United States

      - California is located in the western part of the United States

      - Ohio is east of California

      - Therefore, any location in Ohio would be east of, not south of, a location

      Conclusion: NO, Allen Theatre, OH is NOT located south of Lexington Reservoir,
      CA.

      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Hells Canyon Dam is west of 257 Central Park West

      - More specifically, it is in the northwestern US, while 257 Central Park West
      is in the northeastern US

      - To be "south of" something, the location would need to be below it on a map


      4. Conclusion:

      - Hells Canyon Dam is actually west of, not south of, 257 Central Park West


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      Step 1: Twitchell Reservoir is located in San Luis Obispo County, California,
      which is in the central/coastal part of California.


      Step 2: Parker Canyon Lake is located in Cochise County, southeastern Arizona,
      near the Mexican border.


      Step 3: Comparing their locations:

      - Twitchell Reservoir is in central California

      - Parker Canyon Lake is in southeastern Arizona

      - California is west of Arizona

      - When looking at a map, Twitchell Reservoir would be northwest of Parker Canyon
      Lake


      Therefore, Twitchell Reservoir is NOT south of Parker Canyon Lake.


      Answer: NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Twitchell Reservoir in California

      2. Then, I''ll locate Parker Canyon Lake in Arizona

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Twitchell Reservoir is located in San Luis Obispo County, California,
      in the central/coastal part of the state.


      Step 2: Parker Canyon Lake is located in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, in the

      Step 3: Comparing their positions:

      - Twitchell Reservoir is in central California

      - Parker Canyon Lake is in southeastern Arizona

      - These locations are in different states and quite far apart


      By comparing their geographic positions, Twitchell Reservoir is NOT south of
      Parker Canyon Lake. In fact, it is located to the west and northwest of Parker
      Canyon Lake.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

    aa388a8a-91b2-45dc-979b-57a3e3e60f8e: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Lewis and Clark Lake, NE:

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is located in Nebraska, near the border with South Dakota

      - It is in the northeastern part of Nebraska


      2. Next, locate One Madison, NY:

      - One Madison is located in New York state

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Nebraska is west of New York

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is in the western part of the US

      - One Madison is in the eastern part of the US


      4. Determine their north-south relationship:

      - Nebraska is generally south of New York

      - Lewis and Clark Lake would be south of One Madison


      5. Conclusion:

      Based on the geographical positions, Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is indeed located
      south of One Madison, NY.
