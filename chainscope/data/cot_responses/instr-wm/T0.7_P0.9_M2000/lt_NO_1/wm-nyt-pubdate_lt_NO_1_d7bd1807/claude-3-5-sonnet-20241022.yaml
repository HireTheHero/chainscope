      - "Despite Convictions, Brazil Corruption Case Drags On" was published on February

      - Therefore, the Brazil corruption article was published earlier than the Chinese
      official article

      - Since we determined the Brazil article came first, the Chinese official article
      was NOT published earlier


      NO'
