      2. Identify the location of South Georgia Technical College in Georgia.

      3. Compare the longitudinal coordinates of the two locations to determine which
      one is further west.


      First, Southeastern Christian College is located in Winchester, Kentucky. Winchester
      is in central Kentucky.


      Second, South Georgia Technical College is located in Americus, Georgia. Americus
      is in southwestern Georgia.


      Now, looking at the relative positions:


      - Winchester, KY, is located at approximately 84 degrees west longitude.

      - Americus, GA, is located at approximately 84 degrees west longitude as well.


      Since both locations have approximately the same longitude, Southeastern Christian
      College in Kentucky and South Georgia Technical College in Georgia are roughly
      aligned vertically. However, since Kentucky is north of Georgia, this question
      might be more about latitude than longitude. But strictly in terms of east-west
      positioning (longitude), they are roughly the same.

      campuses throughout the state. For the sake of this question, let''s choose
      a central and well-known campus, such as California State University, Los Angeles
      (CSU LA), which is located in Los Angeles, California.


      Now, we compare the locations:


      - Pasadena is located to the northeast of downtown Los Angeles.


      - Los Angeles, where CSU LA is located, is south of Pasadena.


      Given these locations, Art Center College of Design in Pasadena is actually
      located to the northeast of CSU LA in Los Angeles.


      Therefore, Art Center College of Design is not west of California State University,
      Los Angeles.

      3. Compare the longitudes of Pleasanton and Monterey: Pleasanton is located
      in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is generally east of Monterey.


      By comparing these locations, we can conclude that Pleasanton (and thus Tri-Valley
      University) is east of Monterey.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Tri-Valley University is not located west of the
      Naval Postgraduate School.'

      2. **Widener University** has multiple campuses, but its main campus is in Chester,
      Pennsylvania. However, Widener University also has a campus in Wilmington, Delaware.


      Since both universities have locations in Delaware, we should compare the Delaware
      locations:


      - **Delaware State University** is in Dover, which is centrally located in Delaware.

      - **Widener University''s Delaware Campus** is in Wilmington, which is in the
      northern part of Delaware.


      3. Now, consider the relative positions: Wilmington is north of Dover. To determine
      east or west, we can look at their longitudinal positions.


      - Wilmington is slightly to the east of Dover.


      Therefore, based on their relative positions, Delaware State University in Dover
      is actually west of Widener University''s campus in Wilmington.

      Seattle, WA.


      2. **City University of Seattle**: This university is located at 521 Wall St,

      Now, let''s compare their locations:


      - Antioch University Seattle is situated on 3rd Ave, which is generally west
      of Wall St in the street grid of downtown Seattle. The numbering of avenues
      in Seattle increases as you move eastward, which means lower numbered avenues
      (like 3rd Ave) are to the west of higher numbered streets (like Wall St).


      Based on this analysis, Antioch University Seattle is indeed located west of
      City University of Seattle.

      1. **City of Hope Graduate School of Biological Sciences** is located in Duarte,
      California. Duarte is in Los Angeles County, which is in Southern California.


      2. **Apollos University** is an online university based in Great Falls, Montana,

      address for accreditation purposes. However, for geographical comparisons, we
      consider the general area of the institution''s operations or registration in
      California.


      3. Given the nature of Apollos University as an online institution, if we consider
      a possible administrative location in California, it would likely be in a major
      city area, possibly in the northern part of the state, like San Francisco or
      Sacramento (though specific details might be necessary for a precise comparison).


      Based on typical assumptions about location registration:


      - Duarte, where City of Hope is located, is in the southern part of the state.

      - If Apollos University is administratively associated with a location in Northern
      California, then it would be east of Duarte.

      1. **Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education**: This school is part of the
      City College of New York (CCNY), located in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood
      in Upper Manhattan, New York City.


      2. **The Rockefeller University**: This university is situated on the Upper
      East Side of Manhattan, along the East River.


      Now, let''s consider the general layout of Manhattan:


      - The island of Manhattan is oriented in a north-south direction, with the Hudson
      River to the west and the East River to the east.

      - The Upper East Side, where Rockefeller University is located, is east of Central
      Park.

      - Hamilton Heights, where the Sophie Davis School is located, is to the northwest
      of Central Park.


      Given these locations, the Sophie Davis School (Hamilton Heights) is indeed

      - Wayne, NJ is in the northern part of the state.

      - Lakewood, NJ is in the central part of the state, more towards the eastern
      side.


      By looking at a map or considering the general layout of New Jersey:


      - Wayne is north of Lakewood.
