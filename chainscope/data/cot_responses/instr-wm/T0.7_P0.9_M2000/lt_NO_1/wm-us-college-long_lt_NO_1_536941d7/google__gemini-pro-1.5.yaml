      and Saint Joseph''s University.


      2. **Compare the longitudes:** West corresponds to a lower longitude value.  Therefore,
      if the longitude of University of the Sciences is less than the longitude of
      Saint Joseph''s University, then it is west.

      2. **Determine if they have distinct locations on campus:** Since both colleges
      are part of the same university and located in the same city, the question of
      one being "west" of the other implies they occupy different physical spaces
      on campus.


      3. **Research relative locations (if possible):** A campus map or online search
      could confirm their relative positions. However, without specific building information,
      precise directional relationships are difficult to determine.  It''s possible
      one college occupies several buildings, some of which might be west of some
      of the buildings of the other college.


      4. **Consider the ambiguity:** The question lacks the precision needed for a
      definitive answer.  "West" is relative.  One building of the Agricultural Sciences
      college could be west of one building of the Engineering college, while another
      building of the Agricultural Sciences college could be east of a different Engineering
      building.


      Since the question likely intends a general directional relationship and we
      can''t definitively determine that *all* buildings of one college are west of
      *all* buildings of the other, the safest answer is:

      Logistics University is in Fort Lee, Virginia. Cordoba University is apparently
      a fictitious entity. A search reveals no such accredited university in Virginia
      or elsewhere.


      2. **Determine if Cordoba University even exists:** Since Cordoba University
      doesn''t exist, the question of its location relative to Army Logistics University
      is moot.


      3. **Conclusion:** The question cannot be answered meaningfully.  However, if
      the question were about a real location named Cordoba in Virginia, then it would
      be possible to determine the relative location.


      **Answer:**  It''s impossible to answer YES/NO because the premise of the question
      (the existence and location of Cordoba University, VA) is false.

      would be further south.

      2. **Locate California Coast University (CCU):** CCU is located in Santa Ana,
      California.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Since both are in Santa Ana, the question
      of one being "west" of the other is more nuanced. They are essentially in the
      same city.  While specific campus locations within Santa Ana might make one
      slightly west of the other, generally, they are considered to be in the same
      area.


      4. **Consider the intent of the question:** The question likely intends to ask
      if RSCCD is significantly west of CCU.


      NO.

      4. **Analyze locations:** Michigan Avenue is further west than Sheridan Road,
      and the lower the numbered address on a North/South oriented Street like Michigan
      Ave, the more North the location.  So 3241 S Michigan Ave is further North than
      a much higher number and therefore further South location further East like

      2. **Compare longitudes:**  Since the question asks about "west," I need to
      focus on longitude.  A location further west will have a *lower* longitude value
      (further west of the prime meridian).


      3. **Determine which university has the lower longitude:** After finding their
      locations, I''ll compare their longitudes to see which one is lower.


      4. **Answer the question:** If Alliant International University has a lower
      longitude than John Paul the Great Catholic University, the answer is YES. Otherwise,
      the answer is NO.



      Alliant International University has several campuses, but its main campus is
      in San Diego. John Paul the Great Catholic University is in Escondido, CA.  San
      Diego is west of Escondido.

      2. **Determine the general east-west orientation within Manhattan:**  Manhattan
      is a long, narrow island oriented north-south.  Therefore, "west" in Manhattan
      generally means closer to the Hudson River, and "east" means closer to the East

      Kansas.


      2. **Determine the general east/west relationship:** Nebraska is directly north
      of Kansas.  Therefore, for Midland to be west of Kansas State, Fremont would
      need to be significantly west within Nebraska.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within their respective states:** Fremont
      is in eastern Nebraska. Manhattan is in northeastern Kansas.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since Fremont is in *eastern* Nebraska and Manhattan is in
      *northeastern* Kansas, Fremont is east, not west, of Manhattan.

      and Kansas State University:** Midland University is in Fremont, Nebraska. Kansas
      State University is in Manhattan, Kansas.


      2. **Determine the general east-west relationship between Nebraska and Kansas:**
      Nebraska is directly north of Kansas.  Fremont, Nebraska, however, is in eastern
      Nebraska, while Manhattan, Kansas is more central in its state.


      3. **Consider the longitude:**  Since Nebraska is north of Kansas, longitude
      is the key factor in determining east vs. west.  A location further west will
      have a higher longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere).


      4. **Visualize or look up a map:** A quick map check confirms Fremont, NE is
      east of Manhattan, KS.

    713d0652-969e-424d-bee4-179a9d91bb35: '1. **Find the locations of the two universities:**  We
      need to determine the general longitude of Midland University in Nebraska and
      Kansas State University in Kansas.


      2. **Compare their longitudes:**  Whichever university is further west will
      have a higher longitude value (since longitude increases as you go west).


      3. **Determine if Midland University is west of Kansas State University:** If
      Midland University''s longitude is greater than Kansas State University''s,
      then it is west.


      Midland University is in Fremont, Nebraska. Kansas State University is in Manhattan,
      Kansas. Nebraska is generally west of Kansas.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      We need to determine if Fremont, NE has a higher longitude than Manhattan, KS.  (Although
      a map is the easiest way to visualize this, we are reasoning without one.) Since
      Fremont is further east, it likely has a *lower* longitude.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since Fremont is east of Manhattan, Midland University is
      *east* of Kansas State University.
