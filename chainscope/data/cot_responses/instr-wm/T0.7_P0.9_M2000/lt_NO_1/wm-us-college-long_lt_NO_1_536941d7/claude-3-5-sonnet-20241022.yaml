      1) First, let me recall the locations of both universities in Philadelphia:

      - University of the Sciences (now part of Saint Joseph''s) is located in West
      Philadelphia at 600 S. 43rd Street

      - Saint Joseph''s University''s main campus is located at 5600 City Avenue


      2) Looking at a map of Philadelphia:

      - University of the Sciences is around 43rd Street

      - Saint Joseph''s is near City Line Avenue (around 54th Street)


      3) In Philadelphia, street numbers increase as you go west

      - Therefore, since Saint Joseph''s is at a higher street number (around 54th),
      it is further west than University of the Sciences (at 43rd)


      NO - University of the Sciences is not located west of Saint Joseph''s University.

      locations within Springfield:

      - Missouri State University is located at 901 S National Ave

      - Drury University is located at 900 N Benton Ave

      east of Benton Avenue where Drury is located), Missouri State is actually east
      of Drury, not west.

      1. First, I need to locate these colleges:

      - Southeastern Christian College is in Kentucky (KY)

      - South Georgia Technical College is in Georgia (GA)


      2. In terms of US geography:

      - Kentucky is west of Georgia

      - Any location in Kentucky will be west of any location in Georgia, since the
      states don''t overlap longitudinally

      1. First, I need to locate both universities:

      - Pfeiffer University is in Misenheimer, North Carolina

      - Florida National University is in Hialeah, Florida


      2. Looking at their general locations:

      - North Carolina is north of Florida

      - Hialeah, FL is in the Miami area, in southeastern Florida

      - Misenheimer, NC is in central North Carolina


      3. Comparing east-west positions:

      - Miami area (where Florida National is) is quite far east, near the Atlantic
      coast

      - Misenheimer, NC is in central North Carolina, but still relatively close to
      the east coast

      1. First, let me check the location of City of Hope Graduate School of Biological
      Sciences

      - It is located in Duarte, California

      - Duarte is in Los Angeles County, in Southern California


      2. Now, let me check the location of Apollos University

      - Apollos University is located in Huntington Beach, California

      - Huntington Beach is also in Southern California, in Orange County


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Duarte is further inland/east

      - Huntington Beach is closer to the Pacific coast/west

      - Therefore, City of Hope Graduate School (Duarte) is actually EAST of Apollos
      University (Huntington Beach)

      While Wayne is somewhat western in its region, Lakewood is further east, making
      William Paterson University indeed west of Georgian Court University.
