      is located west of Washington State University Spokane, WA, let''s break down
      the question step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Gonzaga University is located in Spokane, Washington
      (WA). Washington State University Spokane is also located in Spokane, Washington
      (WA).


      2. **Consider the geographical context**: Both universities are in the same
      city, Spokane, which is in the eastern part of Washington state.


      3. **Understand the question**: The question is asking if Gonzaga University
      is located west of Washington State University Spokane. In other words, is Gonzaga
      University located to the left (west) of Washington State University Spokane
      on a map?


      4. **Analyze the geographical relationship**: Since both universities are in
      the same city, Spokane, they are relatively close to each other geographically.
      However, we need to determine if Gonzaga University is indeed located to the
      west of Washington State University Spokane.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to
      determine if Gonzaga University is located west of Washington State University
      Spokane without additional information about the specific locations of the two
      universities within Spokane. The question lacks the necessary details to provide
      a clear YES or NO answer.


      Therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{UNKNOWN}$

      1. **Identify the locations**: Texas Woman''s University (TWU) is located in
      Denton, Texas, while Arlington Baptist College (ABC) is located in Arlington,
      Texas.


      2. **Understand the geographical relationship**: Denton and Arlington are both
      cities in Texas, but they are not directly north-south or east-west of each
      other. Denton is located north of Arlington.


      3. **Consider the specific question**: The question is whether TWU is located
      west of ABC.


      4. **Determine the direction**: Since Denton is north of Arlington, and we are
      considering the west direction, TWU is not directly west of ABC. Instead, it
      is north of ABC.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical relationship between Denton and
      Arlington, Texas Woman''s University is not located west of Arlington Baptist
      College.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Lincoln Christian University is located in Lincoln,
      Illinois, while Lincoln College is also located in Lincoln, Illinois.


      2. **Understand the geographic terms**: "West of" refers to the direction, meaning
      that if one location is west of another, it is situated to the left when looking
      at a map.


      3. **Consider the specific locations**: Both universities are located in the
      same city, which means they are very close to each other. However, being in

      other.


      4. **Research the specific locations**: Lincoln Christian University is located
      at 100 Campus View Drive, Lincoln, IL 62656. Lincoln College is located at 300
      Keokuk Street, Lincoln, IL 62656.


      5. **Compare the locations on a map**: Looking at a map of Lincoln, Illinois,
      we can see that Lincoln Christian University is located to the east of Lincoln

      Jamestown, ND is located west of Southwestern Oklahoma State University, OK,
      we need to consider the geographical locations of both universities:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The University of Jamestown is located in Jamestown,
      North Dakota (ND), and Southwestern Oklahoma State University is located in
      Weatherford, Oklahoma (OK).


      2. **Consider the general geographic positions**: North Dakota is located in
      the northern central part of the United States, while Oklahoma is situated in
      the southern central part.


      3. **Determine the relative east-west positions**: When comparing locations
      from east to west in the United States, states or locations that are towards
      the Atlantic coast are considered more to the east, and those towards the Pacific
      coast are considered more to the west.


      4. **Apply the geographic positions to the question**: Given that North Dakota
      is further north than Oklahoma, it is also generally further west. This is because
      the United States'' east-west axis is angled slightly, with the northern states
      being more to the west compared to the southern states.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic positions and the angled
      east-west axis of the United States, the University of Jamestown, ND is indeed
      located west of Southwestern Oklahoma State University, OK.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **YES**'

      while South University is also located in Georgia, but its main campus is in
      Savannah as well.


      2. **Understand the concept of "west"**: In this context, "west" refers to the

      \ the city is generally considered to be in the eastern part of the country.\n\
      \n3. **Determine the specific locations within New York City**: \n   - Sophie\
      \ Davis School of Biomedical Education is part of the City College of New York,\
      \ which is located in the northern part of Manhattan, specifically in Hamilton\
      \ Heights.\n   - The Rockefeller University is located on the Upper East Side\
      \ of Manhattan, near the East River.\n\n4. **Compare the locations**: \n   -\
      \ Both institutions are in Manhattan, which is a narrow island, so it's unlikely\
      \ for one to be significantly west of the other.\n   - The Upper East Side,\
      \ where The Rockefeller University is located, is slightly north of Hamilton\
      \ Heights, where Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education is located.\n\n\
      5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Given the above information, Sophie Davis School of\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Hampton University is located in Virginia (VA),
      and Millersville University of Pennsylvania is located in Pennsylvania (PA).


      2. **Determine the general geographic positions**: Virginia is generally located
      to the south and west of Pennsylvania.


      3. **Consider the specific question about being west**: To be west of Millersville
      University of Pennsylvania, Hampton University would need to be to the left
      (or west) of it on a map.


      4. **Apply the geographic positions to the question**: Since Virginia is to
      the south and west of Pennsylvania, it is possible that Hampton University could
      be west of Millersville University of Pennsylvania.


      5. **Consider the specific locations within each state**: Hampton University
      is located in Hampton, Virginia, which is in the eastern part of the state.
      Millersville University of Pennsylvania is located in Millersville, Pennsylvania,

      \n2. **Consider the geographical context**:\n   - New York City is situated\
      \ on the east coast of the United States.\n   - The term \"west\" implies a\
      \ direction on a map or compass, and in this case, we are interested in whether\
      \ one location is to the west of another.\n\n3. **Evaluate the relative positions**:\n\
      \   - Both institutions are in the same city, so there is no significant difference\
      \ in their east-west positions. They are both in New York City, which is on\
      \ the east coast of the United States.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that\
      \ both institutions are in the same city and on the east coast, New York University\
      \ Graduate School of Arts and Science, NY is not located west of \xC9cole libre\
