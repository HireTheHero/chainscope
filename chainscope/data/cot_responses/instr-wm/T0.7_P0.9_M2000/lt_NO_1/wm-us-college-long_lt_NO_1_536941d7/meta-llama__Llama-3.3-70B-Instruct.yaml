      PA is located west of Saint Joseph''s University, PA, let''s first establish
      the locations of both universities.


      1. **Identify the location of University of the Sciences, PA**: University of
      the Sciences is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Specifically, its address
      is 600 South 43rd Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104.


      2. **Identify the location of Saint Joseph''s University, PA**: Saint Joseph''s
      University is also located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with its main campus
      at 5600 City Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19131.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Both universities are in Philadelphia, but we
      need to determine their relative positions to each other, specifically if University
      of the Sciences is west of Saint Joseph''s University.


      4. **Determine the directional relationship**: In Philadelphia, City Avenue
      (where Saint Joseph''s University is located) is generally northwest of the
      area where University of the Sciences is located (around 43rd Street and Woodland
      Avenue). However, the question is about being "west" of Saint Joseph''s University.
      Given the layout of Philadelphia and without precise longitude and latitude
      comparisons, we can generally consider that moving west from Saint Joseph''s
      University (on City Avenue) would involve moving in a direction away from the
      center of the city and towards the western parts of Philadelphia or beyond.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the addresses, University of the Sciences (600 S 43rd
      St, Philadelphia, PA 19104) and Saint Joseph''s University (5600 City Ave, Philadelphia,
      PA 19131), and considering the general layout of Philadelphia, University of
      the Sciences is actually southeast of Saint Joseph''s University, not west.
      This is because City Avenue, where Saint Joseph''s is located, is positioned
      more to the northwest relative to the location of University of the Sciences.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where both universities
      are located. University of the Sciences is located in Philadelphia, PA. Saint
      Joseph''s University is also located in Philadelphia, PA.


      2. **Understand the geography of Philadelphia**: Philadelphia is a city in the
      southeastern part of Pennsylvania. Knowing the general layout of the city can
      help in understanding the relative positions of landmarks within it.


      3. **Determine the specific locations within Philadelphia**: University of the
      Sciences is situated in the West Philadelphia area. Saint Joseph''s University
      is located in the Overbrook and Lower Merion areas of Philadelphia, which are
      west of the central part of the city but can be considered relatively close
      to the western edge of the city limits.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Given that both universities are in Philadelphia,
      the question essentially asks us to compare their locations within the city.
      West Philadelphia, where University of the Sciences is located, is indeed to
      the west of the central part of the city. Saint Joseph''s University, being
      in the Overbrook and Lower Merion areas, is also on the western side of Philadelphia,
      but more specifically, it is situated further west compared to the University
      of the Sciences.


      Based on these steps, considering the relative positions within Philadelphia:


      - University of the Sciences is in West Philadelphia.

      - Saint Joseph''s University is in the Overbrook and Lower Merion areas, which
      are west of the central city but also west of West Philadelphia.

      Joseph''s University is also located in Philadelphia, PA.


      2. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both universities are in Philadelphia,
      we need to determine their relative positions within the city. University of
      the Sciences is situated in the West Philadelphia area. Saint Joseph''s University
      is located in the Overbrook and Wynnefield neighborhoods of West Philadelphia,
      but more towards the city line with Lower Merion Township.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that both universities are in West Philadelphia
      but Saint Joseph''s is closer to the city line with Lower Merion Township (which
      is west of Philadelphia), we need to consider which one is more to the west.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since University of the Sciences is in West Philadelphia
      and Saint Joseph''s University, while also in West Philadelphia, is closer to
      the western edge of the city, we must determine if University of the Sciences
      is west of Saint Joseph''s based on their exact addresses or general locations
      within West Philadelphia.


      Given the general information, both universities are in the same general area
      of West Philadelphia, but without exact addresses, it''s a bit challenging.
      However, considering typical understandings of "west" in the context of Philadelphia
      neighborhoods, if one institution is not significantly farther west than the
      other within the city limits, the question may hinge on precise locations.


      Assuming University of the Sciences (43rd and Woodland) and Saint Joseph''s
      University (54th and City Line) are our points of reference, Saint Joseph''s
      is actually actually closer to the western edge of Philadelphia, making University
      of the Sciences not west of Saint Joseph''s University but rather both being
      in West Philadelphia with Saint Joseph''s being closer to the western city limit.

      Philadelphia but generally considered part of the western suburbs or the area
      just west of the city center.


      3. **Analyze Directional Relationship**: To say one location is west of another,
      it must be to the west on a map. Given that both institutions are in or near
      Philadelphia, with University of the Sciences in West Philadelphia and Saint
      Joseph''s University to the west of the city center but more accurately described
      as being in a northwest direction relative to the city''s center, we must consider
      their exact positions relative to each other.


      4. **Conclusion**: Considering University of the Sciences is in West Philadelphia,
      and Saint Joseph''s University, while more to the west of the city center, is
      actually positioned in a way that could be considered northwest or west of central
      Philadelphia but not directly west of West Philadelphia, the question hinges
      on precise geographic interpretation. However, given typical understandings
      of "west of," if Saint Joseph''s is considered in the broader area to the west
      of the city center and University of the Sciences is in West Philadelphia, we
      must look at their exact addresses for a definitive answer.


      Given the exact locations:

      - University of the Sciences: 600 S 43rd St, Philadelphia, PA 19104

      - Saint Joseph''s University: 5600 City Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19131


      Saint Joseph''s University is actually northwest of University of the Sciences,
      considering City Avenue (US-1) runs northwest out of the city. However, the
      question asks if University of the Sciences is west of Saint Joseph''s, which
      simplifies to determining if University of the Sciences is to the west of Saint

    a9d60885-59bc-4864-b796-f9eba3e70455: 'To determine if Gonzaga University in Washington
      state is located west of Washington State University Spokane, we need to consider
      the geographical locations of both institutions.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Gonzaga University is located in Spokane, Washington.
      Washington State University also has a campus in Spokane, known as WSU Spokane.


      2. **Compare locations**: Since both institutions are in Spokane, we need to
      understand that Spokane is a city located in the eastern part of Washington
      state.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that both Gonzaga University
      and WSU Spokane are in the same city (Spokane), the question essentially asks
      if one part of Spokane is west of another part of the same city.


      4. **Geographical context of Spokane**: Spokane is not a vast city that spans
      across significant portions of the state, so the difference in location between
      two points within the city (like Gonzaga and WSU Spokane) would be relatively
      small and more dependent on the specific addresses rather than a broad east-west
      distinction.


      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Since both universities are in Spokane,
      and without exact addresses or a detailed map, we can infer that the question
      might be trying to trick based on the fact that both are in the eastern part
      of Washington state. However, given that Gonzaga University and WSU Spokane
      are both located within the city of Spokane, the concept of one being "west"
      of the other in a statewide context becomes less relevant. But, to directly
      answer the question based on typical geographical interpretations, we''d need
      to look at the specific locations within Spokane.


      6. **Final consideration**: If we consider the typical layout and the fact that
      these are two separate entities within the same city, without precise locations,
      the question seems to be testing understanding of the relative positions within
      a city rather than across the state. Gonzaga University is indeed located in
      a part of Spokane, and so is WSU Spokane. The exact addresses are: Gonzaga University
      is at 502 E Boone Ave, Spokane, WA 99258, and WSU Spokane is at 412 E Spokane
      Falls Blvd, Spokane, WA 99202. Given these addresses, Gonzaga University is
      slightly east of WSU Spokane, considering the general direction of the avenues
      and boulevards in Spokane.


      Given the above steps and understanding that both universities are in the same
      city but considering the usual implications of such a question and the fact
      that Gonzaga is not west of WSU Spokane based on their addresses, the answer

      suggests they are likely on the same campus or very close to each other. Purdue
      University is located in West Lafayette, Indiana.


      2. **Campus Layout**: Purdue University has a large campus with various colleges
      and schools. The specific locations of the College of Agriculture and the College

      3. **Relative Positions**: Without specific building locations, we consider
      that both colleges are likely housed in facilities designed for their specific
      needs, but their exact positions relative to each other (east-west) depend on
      the campus map.


      4. **Campus Map Reference**: A typical campus map would show the layout of different
      colleges and buildings. However, without access to a real-time or specific Purdue
      University campus map in this response, we rely on general knowledge.


      Given the general nature of the question and assuming both colleges are on the
      Purdue University campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, it''s reasonable to deduce
      that determining their exact east-west relationship would typically require
      a campus map. However, since both colleges are part of the same university and
      likely located on or very near the same campus, the difference in their locations
      would be relatively minor in terms of cardinal directions like east and west.


      But, considering the structure of Purdue University, the College of Agriculture

      moment, we rely on general knowledge that within a university campus, colleges
      or schools might be distributed across different buildings or areas, but they
      are typically not far from each other.


      4. **Determining Direction**: To say one college is west of another, there needs
      to be a notable difference in their geographical positions on the campus. However,
      given that both are part of the same university and likely situated on the same
      campus, any difference in their locations would be minor and more related to

      2. **Understand Campus Layout**: Typically, different colleges within a university
      are located on the same campus or in very close proximity. Purdue University''s
      main campus is in West Lafayette, IN.


      3. **Consider Geographic Directions**: To determine if one college is located
      west of another, we need to know their relative positions on the campus map.
      However, without specific details on the exact buildings or locations of the
      College of Agriculture and the College of Health and Human Sciences, we must
      consider the general layout of Purdue University.


      4. **Research or Knowledge of Purdue University Campus**: Given that both colleges
      are part of Purdue University and likely located on the main campus in West
      Lafayette, IN, the question becomes whether one is positioned west of the other.
      This requires either knowledge of the campus layout or research into the specific
      locations of these colleges.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without specific information
      on the relative locations of these two colleges on the Purdue University campus,
      one might assume they are relatively close, given they are part of the same
      university. However, the exact direction (west) cannot be determined without
      more detailed information about their locations on campus.


      Given the above steps and considering that both colleges are likely located
      on the Purdue University campus in West Lafayette, IN, and without specific
      information on their exact locations relative to each other, the question essentially
      asks for a comparison that might not significantly differ in terms of overall
      campus location, as both are situated within the same university grounds.


      However, to provide a definitive YES or NO answer based on the question''s requirement
      for a clear yes or no response and acknowledging the lack of detailed spatial
      information about the exact locations of these colleges relative to each other,
      one must consider the nature of university campuses and the potential proximity
      of different colleges.

      To answer this question, let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Both Purdue University College of Agriculture
      and Purdue University College of Health and Human Sciences are part of Purdue
      University, which is located in West Lafayette, Indiana.


      2. **Understand the Question**: The question asks if the College of Agriculture
      is located west of the College of Health and Human Sciences within Purdue University.


      3. **Consider Campus Layout**: Purdue University is a large campus with various
      colleges and departments. Without specific details on the exact locations of
      these colleges, one might assume they could be in different parts of the campus.


      4. **Research or Knowledge**: Knowing that both colleges are part of Purdue
      University and without specific information on their relative locations within
      the campus, it''s reasonable to consider that they could be close to each other
      or in the same general area, given the compact nature of many university campuses.


      5. **Conclusion**: However, without specific information on the exact location
      of each college within the Purdue University campus, it''s not possible to definitively
      say one is west of the other based on general knowledge. But, considering they
      are on the same campus, the difference in location would likely be a matter
      of buildings or blocks rather than significant geographical distances.


      Given the campus context, it''s reasonable to assume both colleges are relatively
      close, but without exact building locations, the question seems to imply a need
      for specific directional knowledge that isn''t provided. However, considering
      typical campus layouts and the fact that these are specific colleges within
      the same university, they are likely not significantly far from each other in
      terms of cardinal directions like "west."


      **Answer**: Since both colleges are on the Purdue University campus in West
      Lafayette, Indiana, and without more specific information about their locations
      relative to each other, the question seems to be testing understanding of the
      campus layout rather than broader geographic knowledge. Given this context,
      and considering the campus of Purdue University is not vast enough for cardinal
      directions to be significantly meaningful at this scale, the question might
      seem to lean towards a "no" due to the implication that within a campus setting,
      such specific directional relationships might not be as relevant or easily defined
      without more detailed spatial information.

      1. **Location of UPMC Shadyside School of Nursing, PA**: Pennsylvania is a state

      However, when considering the east-west axis specifically, Pennsylvania is west
      of the easternmost parts of South Carolina but generally north. The critical
      aspect here is whether Pennsylvania (where UPMC Shadyside School of Nursing
      is located) is west of South Carolina (where American College of the Building

      west of parts of South Carolina, depending on the specific locations within
      the states. However, since South Carolina stretches further to the east than
      Pennsylvania does to the west in a broad geographical sense, and considering

      1. **Identify the locations**: Southern Methodist University (SMU) is located
      in University Park, Texas, which is a suburb of Dallas. Meadows School of the
      Arts is also located within SMU, indicating they are in the same general area.


      2. **Determine the relationship between SMU and Meadows School of the Arts**:
      Since Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU, they are essentially in the
      same location, with Meadows being a component of the university rather than
      a separate entity located elsewhere.


      3. **Consider the geographical implications**: Given that Meadows School of
      the Arts is part of SMU and not a separate institution located in a different
      part of Texas, the question of whether SMU is located west of Meadows School
      of the Arts, TX, becomes a matter of whether the university is west of a part
      of itself.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU, and not
      a separate location, the question essentially asks if SMU is west of itself,
      which does not make geographical sense in this context. However, if we interpret
      the question as asking about the relative positions of two entities that are
      essentially in the same location, the concept of "west of" does not apply in
      a meaningful way because they are not separate points of reference.


      Given the information and the context provided, the answer to whether Southern
      Methodist University, TX, is located west of Meadows School of the Arts, TX,
      would be **NO**, because Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU, and thus,
      they are not separate entities that can have a directional relationship in the

      Texas.


      3. **Relative Location**: Since Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU
      and located on its campus, it is not possible for SMU to be located west (or
      any other direction) of Meadows School of the Arts in the context of comparing
      two separate entities. They are essentially in the same location, with Meadows

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Notre
      Dame of Maryland University and Coppin State University. Notre Dame of Maryland
      University is located in Baltimore, Maryland. Coppin State University is also
      located in Baltimore, Maryland.


      2. **Determine the relative locations**: Since both universities are in Baltimore,
      we need to understand their relative positions within the city. Knowing the
      exact addresses can help: Notre Dame of Maryland University is located at 4701
      North Charles Street, and Coppin State University is at 2500 West North Avenue.


      3. **Analyze the directional relationship**: Given their locations, we analyze
      if one is west of the other. "West" refers to the direction. Coppin State University,
      being on West North Avenue, suggests it is more to the west compared to Notre
      Dame of Maryland University on North Charles Street, considering typical grid
      patterns in cities where "West" in an address indicates a location west of a
      central point or other reference points.


      Based on this analysis, considering the general layout of Baltimore and the
      fact that both institutions are within the city but with Coppin State University
      having "West" in its address, it indicates Coppin State University is indeed
      west of Notre Dame of Maryland University.

      the locations of Texas Woman''s University (TWU) and Arlington Baptist College
      (ABC) in relation to each other, specifically in terms of their geographical
      positioning within Texas.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the cities where these
      institutions are primarily located. Texas Woman''s University has campuses in
      Denton, Dallas, and Houston, but its main campus is in Denton, Texas. Arlington
      Baptist College is located in Arlington, Texas.


      2. **Geographical Relationship**: Next, we consider the geographical relationship
      between Denton (TWU''s main location) and Arlington (ABC''s location). Both
      cities are located in the north-central part of Texas.


      3. **Determine Direction**: To determine if TWU is located west of ABC, we need
      to understand the directional relationship between Denton and Arlington. Denton
      is generally northwest of Arlington.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since northwest includes a western component, we can conclude
      that Texas Woman''s University, with its main campus in Denton, is indeed located
      west (and slightly north) of Arlington Baptist College in Arlington.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Texas Woman''s University is located

      both institutions are in the same city, which is in the central part of Illinois.


      4. **Compare locations**: Since both institutions are in Lincoln, Illinois,
      we need to determine if one is west of the other within the city or if their
      locations are so close that the distinction is negligible for this question.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both institutions are in the same city (Lincoln,
      Illinois) in the central part of the state, the question of one being "west"
      of the other in a broader geographic sense (like comparing cities or regions
      within Illinois) becomes less relevant. However, without exact addresses or
      campus locations within Lincoln, the question might seem to hinge on precise
      geographical positioning within the city. But for the purpose of this question
      and considering typical interpretations of "west of" in a state or regional
      context, the fact that they share the same city suggests a nuanced answer might
      be necessary. Yet, the question seeks a binary response.


      Given the shared city and the implication of the question, a straightforward
      geographical comparison based on the city level suggests they are not distinctly
      separated by cardinal directions in a way that would clearly place one west
      of the other in a manner significant for statewide or regional comparisons.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Lincoln Christian University, IL is located
      west of Lincoln College, IL, considering the need for a binary response and
      the shared city of both institutions, would lean towards a "NO" due to their
      proximity within the same city, acknowledging the question''s simplicity might
      not fully capture the nuances of their exact locations within Lincoln, IL.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of Missouri
      State University (MSU) and Drury University. Both universities are located in
      Missouri.


      2. **Specific locations**: Missouri State University is located in Springfield,
      Missouri. Drury University is also located in Springfield, Missouri.


      3. **Compare locations**: Since both universities are in the same city (Springfield,
      MO), we need to consider their exact positions relative to each other.


      4. **Determine direction**: Without exact addresses or a map, we can''t precisely
      determine which one is west of the other just by knowing they are in the same
      city. However, since they are in the same city, the difference in their locations
      would typically be small, and one being significantly west of the other is unlikely
      unless one is on the western edge of Springfield and the other on the eastern
      edge.


      However, given that both universities are in Springfield and without specific
      directional information:

      - If MSU is located even slightly west of Drury University, the answer would
      be YES.

      - If Drury University is west of MSU or they are not significantly different
      in their east-west positioning, the answer would be NO.


      Given the information available and considering typical university setups within
      a city, it''s reasonable to check their actual locations. However, without specific
      addresses or a detailed map, we rely on general knowledge. Missouri State University
      and Drury University are both in Springfield, MO, but their exact relative positions
      (east-west) aren''t specified here.


      For a definitive answer, I would need to know their exact locations or relative
      positions. However, based on the premise that they are both in Springfield and
      assuming one might be slightly west of the other without more detailed information:


      The final answer is: YES'

      State University is located in Springfield, Missouri, and Drury University is
      also located in Springfield, Missouri.


      2. **Compare locations**: Since both universities are in the same city (Springfield,
      MO), we need to consider their exact positions within the city to determine
      if one is west of the other.


      3. **Determine directional relationship**: Without specific addresses or a map,
      we cannot directly determine the exact directional relationship (east-west)
      between the two universities based solely on their city location. However, knowing
      that they are in the same city suggests that the difference in their locations
      might be relatively small, potentially not significant enough to definitively
      say one is west of the other without more precise information.


      4. **Conclusion based on available information**: Given that both universities
      are in Springfield, MO, and without more detailed location information (such
      as exact street addresses or a map showing their relative positions), it''s
      not possible to definitively conclude their directional relationship (east-west)
      based solely on the information provided.


      However, considering the context of the question and the need for a YES/NO answer,
      and acknowledging that a more precise determination requires additional geographical
      data, we can proceed with the understanding that the question implies a comparison
      of their general locations within the state or city.


      Given this, and considering typical geographical layouts and the fact that both
      are in Springfield, it might be reasonable to infer that if there''s a noticeable
      difference in their locations, it could be based on their positions within the
      city. But, crucially, both universities being in Springfield means they are
      very close, and any west-east distinction would be minor and dependent on precise
      locations within the city.


      Since the question specifically asks for a YES/NO answer and considering that
      Missouri State University and Drury University are both located in Springfield,
      Missouri, which suggests their locations are relatively close and potentially
      not distinctly different in a west-east directional sense without more specific
      information, the answer to whether Missouri State University is located west
      of Drury University would likely be based on precise geographical data not provided.


      But to follow the instruction for a clear YES/NO answer, and considering the
      lack of detailed geographical information provided, a definitive answer cannot
      be accurately given without potentially misleading. Thus, the reasoning leads
      to a point where an accurate YES/NO determination requires more specific location
      details than provided.


      However, the format requires a choice, so based on the need to select an answer
      and acknowledging the information given does not fully support a definitive

    4154e4e7-dfc1-41d9-a48b-585249c31fc5: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to know the locations of University of
      Illinois at Chicago College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (UIC CLAS) and DePaul
      University.


      2. **UIC CLAS Location**: The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is located
      in Chicago, Illinois. Specifically, it is situated near the downtown area, close
      to the Loop.


      3. **DePaul University Location**: DePaul University is also located in Chicago,
      Illinois. It has several campuses, but its main campus is in the Lincoln Park
      neighborhood, which is north of the downtown area.


      4. **Relative Locations**: To determine if UIC CLAS is west of DePaul University,
      we need to understand the layout of Chicago. Chicago''s downtown area, where
      UIC is located, is generally southeast of the Lincoln Park neighborhood, where
      DePaul''s main campus is situated.


      5. **Cardinal Directions in Chicago**: Chicago''s grid system is aligned with
      the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west), making it relatively straightforward
      to determine directions. The downtown area and the location of UIC are east
      and slightly south of DePaul University''s Lincoln Park campus.


      Based on these steps, considering the general geography of Chicago and the locations
      of these institutions, UIC CLAS is not west of DePaul University; it is more
      to the east or southeast.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      universities. Wilkes University has a location in Mesa, AZ. Northcentral University
      is also based in Arizona, but we need to confirm its exact location to compare.


      2. **Northcentral University Location**: Upon research, Northcentral University
      is based in San Diego, CA, but it has a presence or affiliation in Arizona,
      likely through online programs or a specific campus. However, its primary campus
      is in California, and for the sake of comparison, if we consider its Arizona
      presence, we''d still need to know the city. Assuming it''s in a city like Phoenix
      or Mesa for the sake of argument, we proceed with caution as this detail significantly
      impacts our answer.


      3. **Geographical Comparison**: Mesa, AZ, is a city located just east of Phoenix,
      AZ. If Northcentral University has a presence in Phoenix, AZ, or another location
      to the east of Mesa, then Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ, would not be west of

      location of Northcentral University is in California, and assuming any Arizona
      presence is likely in major cities like Phoenix, the comparison hinges on these

      Arizona operations, we can''t definitively say. However, considering typical
      geographical layouts and assuming Northcentral''s presence is in or around Phoenix
      (which is a common location for such universities and is east of Mesa in the

    8910ba33-2aee-4d16-85e4-b6460ed53b36: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ, and Northcentral University, AZ,
      and then compare their geographical positions.


      1. **Identify the location of Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ**: Wilkes University
      has a location in Mesa, Arizona. This means it is situated in the eastern part
      of the Phoenix metropolitan area.


      2. **Identify the location of Northcentral University, AZ**: Northcentral University
      is based in San Diego, California, but it has an enrollment services office
      or other presence in Arizona. However, the primary location of Northcentral
      University is in California, not Arizona. For the purpose of this question,
      we''ll consider its Arizona presence, but the key detail here is that its main
      campus is not in Arizona, which might imply its Arizona office or services could
      be anywhere in the state.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Wilkes University has a specific location
      in Mesa, AZ, and assuming Northcentral University''s presence in Arizona could
      be anywhere (since its main campus is in California), we must consider the general
      geography of Arizona. Mesa, AZ, is located in the southeastern part of the state,
      near Phoenix.


      4. **Determine if Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ, is west of Northcentral University,
      AZ**: Without a specific location for Northcentral University''s Arizona presence,
      it''s challenging to definitively say. However, considering that Mesa is in
      the eastern part of the Phoenix area, for Wilkes University to be west of Northcentral
      University''s Arizona location, Northcentral University''s Arizona presence
      would need to be east of Mesa.


      Given these steps and without a precise location for Northcentral University''s
      Arizona operations, we can make an educated guess based on typical geographical
      assumptions. However, since Northcentral University''s primary operations are
      in California and the question pertains to their Arizona presence, which could
      theoretically be anywhere, we should approach this with caution.


      But, considering the main question and simplifying our approach based on what''s
      typically known about these institutions and their locations:

      \ about the state as a whole. But given the context, we are comparing within\
      \ Arizona or considering the primary location of these institutions in relation\

      \ a physical campus in Mesa, Arizona, and considering Northcentral University's\
      \ primary campus is actually in California, if we were to consider a hypothetical\
      \ or specific location for Northcentral in Arizona for comparison, we'd have\

      \   - Given that Northcentral University is primarily based in California and\
      \ does not have a known physical campus in Arizona, the question seems to imply\
      \ a comparison that might not directly apply since one institution (Wilkes)\
      \ has a clear Arizona location, and the other (Northcentral) does not.\n\n3.\

      \ United States. \n   - Mesa, Arizona, where Wilkes University is located, is\
      \ in the eastern part of the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n   - Without a specific\
      \ Arizona location for Northcentral University, but knowing its primary campus\
      \ is in California (which is west of Arizona), the question seems to ask for\
      \ a comparison that assumes both are in Arizona, which might not be directly\

      \ However, if we're strictly comparing within Arizona or assuming both have\

    cd40a714-5af8-456c-bae5-b31c053b34bc: 'To determine if Wilkes University, Mesa,
      AZ is located west of Northcentral University, AZ, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      universities. Wilkes University has a location in Mesa, Arizona. Northcentral
      University is also based in Arizona, specifically in San Diego... no, that''s
      incorrect. Northcentral University is actually based in San Diego, California,
      but it has an online presence and can be considered to have a location in Arizona
      for the sake of this comparison due to its online programs being accessible
      from anywhere, including Arizona. However, for physical locations, we need to
      consider that Northcentral University is primarily known for its online programs
      and its main office is in California, not Arizona. But since the question implies
      a comparison within Arizona, let''s correct the approach: Northcentral University,
      for this context, should be considered as not having a physical campus in Arizona
      but being accessible online. Given this confusion, the question might be aiming
      at comparing the locations based on the cities mentioned or implied.


      2. **Correct Understanding of Locations**: Given the initial misunderstanding,
      let''s correct the approach. Wilkes University has a campus in Mesa, Arizona.
      The question mentions Northcentral University, AZ, which might be misleading
      because Northcentral University is primarily recognized for its online presence
      and is headquartered in California, not Arizona. However, for the sake of argument,
      if we consider "Northcentral University, AZ" as implying a presence or consideration
      within Arizona (even though it''s an online university), the question becomes
      about comparing the geographical locations within Arizona or related to these
      universities.


      3. **Geographical Comparison**: Since Wilkes University is in Mesa, AZ, and
      if we were to compare it to any location that could be associated with Northcentral
      University within Arizona (acknowledging the primary issue here is that Northcentral
      University doesn''t have a physical location in Arizona), the comparison becomes
      about the relative positions of these locations within Arizona or their general
      geographical area.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Assumptions**: Given the confusion and the need to
      make an assumption for the sake of answering, if we consider Wilkes University
      in Mesa and assume a comparison is being made based on locations that can be
      associated with Arizona (despite the primary location of Northcentral University
      being outside Arizona), determining "west" would depend on the specific locations
      within Arizona or the general area these universities serve or are associated
      with. However, since Northcentral University does not have a physical presence
      in Arizona but is considered here for its online accessibility, the geographical
      comparison in terms of "west" becomes less straightforward without a specific
      Arizona location for Northcentral.


      5. **Final Consideration**: Given the information and the aim to provide a clear
      YES or NO answer, it seems there was an initial misunderstanding in the approach.
      The critical point missed is acknowledging that Wilkes University has a physical
      location in Mesa, Arizona, while Northcentral University is primarily an online
      institution without a physical campus in Arizona. If comparing based on the
      assumption of accessibility or presence in Arizona, the question''s premise
      might be flawed due to the nature of Northcentral University''s operations.
      However, since Wilkes University is in Mesa, and without a clear physical location
      for Northcentral University in Arizona to compare directly, the question''s
      basis for geographical comparison ("west of") becomes challenging without further
      specifics.


      Given these considerations and aiming for clarity, the answer to whether Wilkes
      University, Mesa, AZ is located west of Northcentral University, AZ, considering
      the complexities and the online nature of Northcentral University, would be
      challenging to definitively answer without a clear physical location for Northcentral
      in Arizona. However, since the task requires a YES or NO answer:

      they are likely located on or very near the university''s campus in Lubbock,
      Texas.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if one is west of the other, we would
      ideally need a map of the Texas Tech University campus or specific addresses

      and likely on the same campus, the question simplifies to understanding the
      layout of the campus.


      4. **Campus Layout**: Without specific information on the campus layout or the
      exact locations of these colleges relative to each other, one might assume that
      because they are in the same university, their locations are not significantly

      6. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and typical university layouts,
      we can''t accurately determine the relative east-west positions of these two
      colleges without specific campus maps or layouts. However, since the question
      demands a YES or NO answer and implies a need for a definitive geographical
      relationship, we must consider if there''s an implied understanding or common
      knowledge about Texas Tech University''s campus layout that we''re missing.


      Given the constraints and aiming to adhere strictly to the format requested
      for the answer, and acknowledging that both colleges are indeed located within
      the same university but lacking the specific detail needed to accurately determine
      their relative positions without assuming or looking up the exact campus map:


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'
    adb30db5-1113-4f34-8b1a-4fc723bfdc10: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand that both the Texas
      Tech University College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources and the
      Whitacre College of Engineering are part of Texas Tech University.


      2. **Same University, Different Colleges**: Since both colleges are part of
      the same university, they are likely located on or near the same campus, which
      is in Lubbock, Texas.


      3. **Campus Layout**: Without specific details on the exact layout of the Texas
      Tech University campus, we can infer that since both colleges are part of the
      same university, their locations relative to each other (east-west) would depend
      on the campus map.


      4. **General Knowledge about Texas Tech**: Texas Tech University''s main campus
      is in Lubbock, Texas. The university''s layout and the specific locations of
      its colleges can vary, but typically, colleges within a university are not separated
      by large distances, as they are often part of the same or adjacent campuses.


      5. **Relative Positions**: Without a detailed map or specific information about
      the relative positions of these colleges, it''s challenging to determine their
      exact locations relative to each other (i.e., which one is west of the other).
      However, given that they are both in Lubbock and part of Texas Tech, the question
      essentially asks for a comparison of their locations within a relatively small
      geographic area.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Since both colleges are located
      within the Texas Tech University system and presumably on or very near the main
      campus in Lubbock, Texas, and without specific information on their relative
      east-west positioning, the question seems to test knowledge of the campus layout
      rather than broader geographic knowledge.


      Given these considerations and the fact that we''re comparing locations within
      the same university campus, the answer would depend on the specific layout of
      Texas Tech University''s campus. However, since the question requires a YES
      or NO answer without providing or allowing for the consultation of a campus
      map, and considering that both colleges are in the same city and part of the
      same university, making an accurate determination based solely on the information
      given is not feasible.


      But, to follow the instruction for a YES or NO answer, and considering the lack
      of specific information about their relative positions:


      YES'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to understand that both the Texas
      Tech University College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources and the
      Whitacre College of Engineering are part of Texas Tech University.


      2. **Same University**: Since both colleges are part of Texas Tech University,
      they are located on or very near the same campus, which is in Lubbock, Texas.


      3. **Relative Location**: The question asks if the College of Agricultural Sciences
      & Natural Resources is located west of the Whitacre College of Engineering.
      This requires specific knowledge of the campus layout or an understanding that
      both colleges, being part of the same university, would likely be in close proximity
      to each other.


      4. **Campus Layout**: Without specific details on the layout of Texas Tech University''s
      campus, one might assume that different colleges within the university could
      be located in various directions relative to each other. However, given that
      both are integral parts of the same university, they are likely to be relatively
      close.


      5. **Conclusion**: The critical piece of information needed to answer this question
      accurately is the specific layout of Texas Tech University''s campus, particularly
      the relative positions of the College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources
      and the Whitacre College of Engineering. Without this information, one cannot
      definitively say which is west of the other based solely on the fact that they
      are both part of Texas Tech University.


      However, considering typical campus layouts and the fact that specific building
      locations can vary, if we are to make an educated guess without the exact campus
      map, we might consider that both colleges, being part of the same institution,
      would be relatively close, possibly even adjacent or within walking distance
      of each other. But, the question specifically asks for a YES or NO answer regarding
      their relative positions, which implies a need for precise knowledge of their
      locations.


      Given the information that both are part of Texas Tech University and without
      specific details on their relative positioning on the campus, the most accurate
      approach to answering this question would involve checking a campus map or contacting
      the university directly for precise location information.


      But since I need to give a YES or NO answer, and considering that both colleges
      are on the same campus and thus likely close to each other, but without the
      exact layout:

      To determine if the Texas Tech University College of Agricultural Sciences &
      Natural Resources is located west of the Whitacre College of Engineering, we
      need to understand the geographical layout of the Texas Tech University campus.


      1. **Identify the location of both colleges**: Both the College of Agricultural
      Sciences & Natural Resources and the Whitacre College of Engineering are part
      of Texas Tech University, which is located in Lubbock, Texas.


      2. **Campus Layout**: Texas Tech University''s campus is laid out with various
      colleges and buildings spread across it. Without specific detailed maps, it''s
      generally known that the university has a large campus area with different colleges
      and facilities distributed in a way that optimizes student and faculty access.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To answer the question accurately, we would need
      to know the exact locations of both colleges on the campus. However, given that
      both are part of Texas Tech University, they are relatively close to each other,
      being within the same university.


      4. **General Knowledge**: Texas Tech University''s campus is not typically described
      in terms of which specific colleges are west or east of others without a map.
      However, considering that the university''s layout might not be strictly divided
      into east-west segments for its colleges, the question seems to aim at a very
      specific piece of information.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without a detailed map or specific information about the
      relative positions of the College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources
      and the Whitacre College of Engineering, it''s challenging to provide a definitive
      answer based solely on general knowledge. However, given that both are on the
      same campus and considering typical campus layouts, it''s possible to infer
      their relative positions might not be vastly different in terms of cardinal
      directions due to the campus''s relatively contained area.


      Given the specific nature of the question and assuming a direct answer is required
      without access to detailed maps or specific campus layouts, a definitive answer
      might rely on specific knowledge of Texas Tech University''s campus layout.

      \ States but is located to the south of Kentucky.\n\n3. **Determine the relative\
      \ positions**:\n   - Since Kentucky is north of Georgia, any location in Kentucky\
      \ is going to be north of any location in Georgia, given the states' positions\
      \ relative to each other.\n   - The question of being \"west\" is about longitudinal\
      \ position (east-west orientation), but the primary difference in location between\
      \ these two colleges is their latitudinal position (north-south orientation)\
      \ due to the state locations.\n\n4. **Consider east-west positioning**:\n  \
      \ - Georgia and Kentucky are relatively close in terms of longitudinal (east-west)\
      \ positioning within the eastern United States. However, without exact coordinates,\
      \ we consider their general positions:\n     - Kentucky spans from approximately\
      \ 82\xB0W to 89\xB0W longitude.\n     - Georgia spans from approximately 81\xB0\
      W to 85\xB0W longitude.\n   - This means that parts of Kentucky are indeed west\
      \ of parts of Georgia, but the question is about the specific locations of these\
      \ colleges.\n\n5. **Conclusion based on general knowledge**:\n   - Given that\
      \ Southeastern Christian College is in Kentucky and South Georgia Technical\
      \ College is in Georgia, and considering the general geography, it's plausible\
      \ that Southeastern Christian College could be west of South Georgia Technical\
      \ College, depending on their exact locations within their respective states.\n\
      \nHowever, without precise locations or considering that the question is about\
      \ a comparison that requires specific geographical knowledge (and acknowledging\
      \ that my previous steps might have oversimplified the geographical nuances),\
      \ let's directly address the query with the information typically available:\n\
      \nGiven the general geography and without specific longitudes for these colleges,\
      \ the direct answer based on typical geographical understanding would lean towards\
      \ considering the relative positions of Kentucky and Georgia. But, since the\
      \ exact longitudes of these colleges are not provided, and considering that\
      \ Kentucky is generally north of Georgia but can be west of parts of Georgia\
      \ depending on the specific location, the most straightforward answer without\
      \ overcomplicating would be based on a general understanding that might not\
      \ fully apply to the specific colleges' locations.\n\nTherefore, considering\
      \ the need for a simple YES or NO and the potential for overlap in their longitudinal\
      \ positions, the answer would depend on the specific locations of these colleges.\
      \ However, given the information and the nature of the question, the direct\
      \ response to whether Southeastern Christian College, KY is located west of\
      \ South Georgia Technical College, GA, would typically be answered based on\
      \ the understanding that parts of Kentucky can indeed be west of parts of Georgia,\
      \ but without exact coordinates, this becomes a question of specific geographical\
      \ details.\n\nSo, the answer, based on the typical expectation and simplification\
      \ for such a question, would be: **YES**."

      \n3. **Apply Geographic Relationships to Specific Locations**:\n   - Since Southeastern\

      \ is a long, narrow state with its northernmost part being north of its southernmost\
      \ part, and its westernmost edge being the Pacific Ocean.\n   - Pasadena, where\
      \ Art Center College of Design is located, is in Los Angeles County, which is\
      \ in Southern California, relatively close to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n3. **CSU\
      \ Campuses**:\n   - There are 23 CSU campuses, spread out across the state.\

      \ western location within California, any CSU campus east of Pasadena would\
      \ make the statement true. However, given that many CSU campuses are also located\
      \ in coastal or near-coastal areas (like San Diego State University, CSU Long\
      \ Beach, CSU Los Angeles, etc.), the key is whether there's a CSU campus that\

    01446ce2-e521-475c-b461-4cc4836f81c4: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the locations of the University of Michigan School of Public Health and the
      University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, both of which are part of the University
      of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Both schools are located within the University
      of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor. The University of Michigan School of Public
      Health and the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy are both situated
      in close proximity to each other on the university''s campus.


      2. **Determine the relative positions**: Without specific addresses or a detailed
      map of the campus, we can''t definitively say which one is west of the other
      based solely on their names or general knowledge. However, given that both are
      part of the University of Michigan, they are likely in the same general area
      of Ann Arbor.


      3. **Consider campus layout**: University campuses often have their buildings
      and schools laid out in a manner that groups similar departments or colleges
      together. However, without specific information on the layout of the University
      of Michigan''s campus regarding these two schools, we cannot accurately determine
      their relative east-west positions.


      4. **Conclusion based on available information**: Since both the School of Public
      Health and the College of Pharmacy are located within the University of Michigan
      in Ann Arbor, and without more detailed information on their exact locations
      relative to each other, the question essentially asks for a comparison that
      requires specific geographic or campus map information to answer accurately.


      Given the information typically available, it''s reasonable to assume that both
      institutions are relatively close to each other within the campus. However,
      to provide a definitive YES or NO answer to whether the University of Michigan
      School of Public Health is located west of the University of Michigan College
      of Pharmacy, we would need more specific details about their locations on the
      campus.


      Since the question demands a YES or NO answer and considering that both schools
      are on the same campus but the exact relative positions are not provided, I
      must proceed with the assumption that a definitive answer requires specific
      knowledge of the campus layout which is not detailed here.


      Therefore, based on the steps of reasoning and without specific information
      to accurately determine the relative east-west positions of these two schools
      on the University of Michigan campus, the most informed answer I can provide,
      given the constraints, is:

    5c54f62d-710f-4150-ab48-2d72c70cd712: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the University of Michigan School of Public Health and the University of Michigan
      College of Pharmacy. Both institutions are part of the University of Michigan,
      which has its main campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan.


      2. **Same Campus**: Given that both schools are part of the University of Michigan,
      the next step is to determine if they are located on the same campus. The University
      of Michigan''s main campus in Ann Arbor is where both the School of Public Health
      and the College of Pharmacy are situated.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Since both institutions are on the same campus, we
      need to find out their relative positions. The University of Michigan School
      of Public Health is located in the Crossroads area of the campus, while the
      College of Pharmacy is situated near the center of the campus but more towards
      the north.


      4. **Directional Analysis**: Ann Arbor, being a city in the eastern part of
      the United States, means that geographical directions (north, south, east, west)
      can be used to describe locations within the city and the campus. To determine
      if the School of Public Health is west of the College of Pharmacy, we need to
      understand the layout of the campus.


      5. **Campus Layout**: The University of Michigan''s campus in Ann Arbor is laid
      out with the majority of its buildings and facilities concentrated in a relatively
      small area. Without specific building addresses or a detailed map, it''s challenging
      to provide an exact directional relationship between the two schools. However,
      considering the general layout and the fact that most of the university''s facilities
      are relatively close to each other, the difference in their locations might
      not be significantly far apart in terms of cardinal directions.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of precise information about the exact locations
      of the University of Michigan School of Public Health and the University of
      Michigan College of Pharmacy within the campus and without access to a detailed
      campus map, it''s challenging to definitively say which one is west of the other

      Marylhurst University was located in Marylhurst, Oregon. Oregon College of Oriental

      Given that Marylhurst is a city located just south of Portland, both institutions
      are relatively close to each other within the same general area of the Portland
      metropolitan region.


      However, to determine if Marylhurst University is west of Oregon College of

      area. Portland is situated near the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia
      rivers, and its metropolitan area extends in all directions, including south
      towards Marylhurst.


      Marylhurst, being south of Portland and not particularly known for being significantly
      west in the broader context of Oregon geography, suggests that its location
      relative to Portland (and thus the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine) is more
      southerly than westerly.


      Given this, without precise longitude coordinates, we can make an educated guess
      based on the general areas where these institutions are located. Marylhurst
      University, being in a suburb south of Portland, is likely not west of the Oregon
      College of Oriental Medicine but rather south.

      - **Marylhurst University** was located in Marylhurst, Oregon. It''s essential
      to note that Marylhurst University ceased operations in 2018, but its location
      is what matters for this question.

      - **Oregon College of Oriental Medicine** is located in Portland, Oregon.


      Given these locations:


      - Marylhurst, Oregon, where Marylhurst University was, is south of Portland,
      Oregon, where Oregon College of Oriental Medicine is located.

      - Since Portland is generally considered to be in the northern part of the Willamette
      Valley, and Marylhurst is south of Portland, the question of being "west" involves
      considering their longitudinal positions rather than just their latitudinal
      positions.


      However, in the context of Oregon geography, being "west" typically refers to
      locations closer to the Pacific Ocean (the western edge of Oregon) compared
      to locations more inland (eastward). Both institutions are relatively close
      to each other in the broader scheme of Oregon geography, but since Marylhurst
      is not significantly west in longitude compared to Portland (if at all), and
      considering the question''s framing, we must think about their relative positions.


      Given that Marylhurst University is not notably west of Portland (and considering
      the nuances of how "west" might be interpreted in this context), the answer
      leans towards Marylhurst University not being west of Oregon College of Oriental

      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand that both the Florida
      State University College of Social Sciences and the Florida State University
      School of Library & Information Studies are part of Florida State University
      (FSU), which is located in Tallahassee, Florida.


      2. **Campus Layout**: FSU has a single main campus in Tallahassee. Both the
      College of Social Sciences and the School of Library & Information Studies are
      housed within this campus.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Since both entities are part of the same university
      and located on the same campus, their specific buildings or departments might
      be in different parts of the campus. However, without exact building locations,
      we can''t definitively say one is west of the other based on their departmental
      names alone.


      4. **Geographical Reference**: The question asks if the College of Social Sciences
      is located west of the School of Library & Information Studies. Given that both
      are on the same campus and without specific building locations, we cannot determine
      their relative east-west positions without more detailed information.

      However, considering the question demands a YES or NO answer and given the context
      that both are on the same campus and there''s no provided information to suggest
      they are in separate locations outside of the campus, the most straightforward
      answer based on the lack of specific directional information would lean towards

      of Social Sciences and the School of Library & Information Studies are part
      of Florida State University (FSU).


      2. **Campus Layout**: Florida State University has a main campus in Tallahassee,
      Florida. Most of its colleges and schools, including the College of Social Sciences
      and the School of Library & Information Studies, are located on or near this
      main campus.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Since both entities are part of FSU and likely located
      on or very near the main campus in Tallahassee, their relative positions (east/west)
      would depend on the specific buildings or areas they occupy within the campus.


      4. **Assumption Based on Naming**: Without specific building names or exact
      locations, one might assume that these entities could be in close proximity,
      given they are both part of the same university. However, the question of whether
      one is west of the other cannot be directly inferred without exact locations.


      5. **General Knowledge of FSU Campus**: The FSU campus is not vast in the east-west
      direction compared to its north-south spread. However, without the exact locations
      of these schools within the campus, determining their relative east-west positions
      is speculative.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Given the lack of specific
      information about the exact locations of the College of Social Sciences and
      the School of Library & Information Studies within the FSU campus, and considering
      that both are likely situated on or near the main campus in Tallahassee, it''s
      not possible to definitively conclude their relative east-west positions based
      solely on the information provided.


      However, the question asks for a YES or NO answer, suggesting a need to make
      a decision based on typical scenarios or further research that might not be
      directly provided here. Given that both are likely on the same campus and without
      specific details on their locations, one might typically not assume a significant
      east-west separation. But, acknowledging the specificity of the question and
      the potential for these departments to be housed in different buildings across
      the campus, the answer leans towards the possibility based on typical campus
      layouts and the understanding that "west of" implies a specific directional
      relationship that might not be universally applicable given the context.

      the location of two entities within Florida State University (FSU) in Tallahassee,
      Florida: the College of Social Sciences and the School of Library & Information
      Studies.


      1. **Understanding Locations**: Typically, universities have their colleges
      and schools located on or near their main campus, especially if they are part
      of the same university system. This implies that both entities are likely located
      within or very close to the FSU main campus in Tallahassee.


      2. **Specific Locations**: Without specific details on the exact buildings or
      areas where these entities are located, we can make an educated guess based
      on typical university layouts. Many universities group similar colleges or schools
      together for logistical and collaborative purposes. However, the exact location
      (east, west, north, south) can depend on various factors including the history
      of the university, the age of the buildings, and the layout of the campus.


      3. **Campus Layout**: FSU''s main campus is situated in Tallahassee, and its
      layout could influence how different colleges and schools are positioned. However,
      without specific information on the relative locations of the College of Social
      Sciences and the School of Library & Information Studies, we cannot accurately
      determine their positions relative to each other (east, west, etc.).


      4. **Assumption Based on Typical University Setup**: Given that both are part
      of the same university and likely located on the main campus, the possibility
      that one is significantly west of the other depends on the specific geography
      of the campus. If the campus is compact, the difference in location might be
      minimal. If the campus is spread out, there could be a noticeable difference
      in location.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without explicit information on the exact locations of these
      two entities within the FSU campus, we cannot definitively say whether the College
      of Social Sciences is located west of the School of Library & Information Studies.
      However, given the context of the question and typical university layouts, it
      seems unlikely that there would be a significant enough difference for a definitive
      "yes" without more specific location details.


      Given the steps and the need for specific geographical information about the
      campus layout that is not provided, the most prudent answer based on the information
      given and typical university setups would lean towards a scenario where such
      a specific spatial relationship might not be universally known or might depend
      on the interpretation of "west" in the context of the campus map. However, the
      question seems to imply a need for a binary choice without the provision of
      detailed campus maps or location specifics.


      Therefore, based on the logic that both institutions are likely part of the
      same campus and without specific details to the contrary, the answer would be
      **NO**, but this answer is given with the caveat that it''s based on a lack
      of detailed geographical information about the relative positions of these entities

      College of Social Sciences, FL is located west of Florida State University School
      of Library & Information Studies, FL, let''s analyze the situation step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand that both institutions
      are part of Florida State University (FSU), which simplifies our task since
      they are likely located on or near the same campus.


      2. **Campus Layout**: FSU''s main campus is located in Tallahassee, Florida.
      Typically, universities organize their colleges and schools in specific areas
      or buildings on campus, but without a detailed campus map, we can''t know the
      exact layout.


      3. **Assumption Based on Naming**: The question implies a distinction between
      the locations of the College of Social Sciences and the School of Library &
      Information Studies. However, without specific details on their exact locations
      within the FSU campus, we must consider the general geographical orientation
      of the campus.


      4. **Geographical Orientation**: Tallahassee, where FSU is located, is in the
      eastern part of the Florida Panhandle. The campus itself does not span across
      the state, so we are looking at a relatively small area.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both entities are part of FSU and likely located
      on the same campus in Tallahassee, the question of one being west of the other
      depends on their specific locations within the campus. However, since the question
      does not provide specific building locations or a campus map, and considering
      the context that these are two schools within the same university, it''s reasonable
      to infer that the question might be testing understanding of relative campus
      geography rather than statewide geography.


      6. **Final Consideration**: Without explicit information on the relative positions
      of these schools within the campus or a detailed map, the most straightforward
      assumption based on typical campus layouts would suggest that they could be
      in close proximity, potentially in the same general area of the campus, rather
      than one being decidedly west of the other in a broader geographical sense.


      Given the above considerations and the lack of specific details to definitively
      answer the question based on exact locations within the campus, the most informed
      response would have to be based on the assumption that the question is asking
      for a general geographical relationship that might not apply within the confines

      least on the same campus.


      4. **Directional Consideration**: The question asks if the College of Social
      Sciences is located west of the School of Library & Information Studies. Given
      that both are likely on the same campus, the directional difference (if any)
      would be minimal and based on the specific layout of the FSU campus in Tallahassee.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since both departments are part of the same university and

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of California
      South Bay University and Apple University. California South Bay University is
      not a well-known or prominent university, and a quick search does not yield
      a recognized institution by this name in California or elsewhere. Apple University,
      on the other hand, is not a traditional university but rather an internal training
      program for Apple Inc. employees. It is located at Apple''s headquarters in
      Cupertino, California.


      2. **Determine the geographical location of Cupertino, CA**: Cupertino, California,
      where Apple University is based, is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which
      is on the western coast of the United States.


      3. **Consider the term "South Bay"**: The term "South Bay" refers to the southern
      portion of the San Francisco Bay Area. This area includes cities like San Jose,
      Santa Clara, and parts of Silicon Valley. Given that California South Bay University
      is mentioned, if it were a real institution, it would likely be located in this
      South Bay region, which is also on the western coast of the United States but
      slightly south of Cupertino.


      4. **West of Apple University**: To be located "west" of Apple University (in
      Cupertino), a location would need to be in the Pacific Ocean or on the western
      side of the San Francisco Bay relative to Cupertino. However, both the potential
      location of California South Bay University (if it existed in the South Bay
      area) and Apple University are on the same western coast of the United States,
      with Cupertino being more directly on the western shore of the San Francisco
      Bay.


      Given these steps, if California South Bay University were a real institution
      in the South Bay area, it would likely be south (or slightly southeast) of Cupertino,
      not west. However, since California South Bay University does not appear to
      be a recognized institution, the premise of comparing its location to Apple
      University''s involves a hypothetical scenario. For the sake of answering the
      question based on geographical reasoning and assuming both entities are in the
      locations implied by their names, California South Bay University would not
      be west of Apple University but rather south or southeast of it.


      Therefore, the answer to whether California South Bay University, CA is located
      west of Apple University, CA, considering the hypothetical scenario and geographical
      logic, is: **NO**.'

    93c44fa8-5bf4-448a-b6b0-bd64b15f69e6: 'To answer this question, we''ll break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of California
      South Bay University and Apple University. California South Bay University is
      not a well-known or recognized university in the traditional sense, and it''s
      possible it might not exist or be a very small, private institution. Apple University,
      on the other hand, is not a traditional university but rather an internal training
      program for Apple Inc. employees, located at Apple''s headquarters in Cupertino,
      California.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Since Apple University is associated with Apple''s
      headquarters in Cupertino, we can place it in the context of California''s geography.
      Cupertino is located in the western part of the United States, specifically
      in the San Francisco Bay Area of California.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if California South Bay University is
      west of Apple University, we need to know the location of California South Bay
      University. Assuming it exists and is located somewhere in the South Bay area
      of California (which includes cities like San Jose, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale),
      it would still be within the same general region as Cupertino, where Apple University
      is based.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both are in the same general area (the San Francisco
      Bay Area), determining which is west of the other depends on their exact locations
      within this area. Cupertino, where Apple University is, is more towards the
      northwest part of the Bay Area. The "South Bay" refers to the southern part
      of the San Francisco Bay Area, which includes areas southeast of San Francisco.
      Therefore, a location in the "South Bay" could potentially be southeast or south
      of Cupertino, not necessarily west.


      Considering the steps and the geographical layout, without an exact location
      for California South Bay University but knowing it would be in the "South Bay"
      area, it''s unlikely to be west of Apple University in Cupertino, given the
      directional relationships within the Bay Area. However, the question''s framing
      assumes both entities exist in a traditional sense and can be directly compared
      geographically, which might not be the case.


      Given the likely misinterpretation or lack of clarity around "California South
      Bay University" and considering Apple University''s known association with Cupertino,

      \ the locations of both California South Bay University and Apple University\

      \ South Bay University**: This university is not a widely recognized institution\
      \ in the context of well-known universities in California. However, the \"South\
      \ Bay\" refers to a region in the San Francisco Bay Area, which includes cities\
      \ like San Jose, Santa Clara, and parts of Silicon Valley. If we consider a\
      \ university with a similar name or location, it would be in the southern part\
      \ of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n   - **Apple University**: Apple University\
      \ is not a traditional university but rather an internal training program for\
      \ Apple Inc. employees. It's located at Apple Park, the headquarters of Apple\
      \ Inc., in Cupertino, California, which is also in the San Francisco Bay Area,\
      \ specifically in the South Bay region.\n\n2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**:\n\
      \   - Given that both entities are in the South Bay area of the San Francisco\
      \ Bay, we need to understand that \"west\" in this context refers to a direction\
      \ relative to the Bay.\n   - Cupertino, where Apple University is located, is\

      \ Cruz Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.\n   - Without a precise location for\
      \ California South Bay University, but assuming it's somewhere in the South\
      \ Bay area, it could potentially be east, west, or in a similar longitude to\
      \ Cupertino, depending on its exact location.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without\

      the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Kate
      Gleason College of Engineering and Alfred University. Kate Gleason College of
      Engineering is part of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Rochester,
      New York. Alfred University is located in Alfred, New York.


      2. **Determine geographical positions**: Next, we determine the geographical
      positions of these two locations. Rochester, NY, is generally northwest of Alfred,
      NY, considering the overall geography of New York State.


      3. **Assess the direction "west of"**: The question asks if Kate Gleason College
      of Engineering (in Rochester, NY) is located west of Alfred University (in Alfred,
      NY). Given that Rochester is more to the northwest of Alfred, but also considering
      that "west of" implies a direct western direction, we need to consider if the
      northwest position qualifies as being west in a broad geographical sense.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that northwest can be considered as generally "west"
      in a broad sense, especially when not strictly defining "west" as directly due
      west (270 degrees on a compass), we can infer that Kate Gleason College of Engineering
      is indeed west (and slightly north) of Alfred University.

      (Patten University) but essentially on the same east-west line in terms of the
      bay''s geography, the determining factor is not their north-south positioning
      but rather any slight difference in their longitudinal positions. However, given
      the context of the question, it seems to imply a comparison based on their general
      locations rather than precise longitudinal coordinates. Oakland is not west
      of Vallejo in a significant geographic sense that would apply to this question.

      a few steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to understand the locations of
      both Army Logistics University and Cordoba University. However, to proceed,
      we need to acknowledge that the question might contain inaccuracies or assumptions
      about the names and locations of these institutions.


      2. **Army Logistics University**: Upon research, it appears that there might
      not be a widely recognized institution by the name "Army Logistics University"
      in Virginia (VA) or elsewhere in the United States that is directly associated
      with the public''s common knowledge. The U.S. Army does have institutions related
      to logistics, such as the Army Logistics University (ALU) located at Fort Lee,
      Virginia. This institution is involved in training army personnel in logistics.


      3. **Cordoba University**: There seems to be limited information available on
      a "Cordoba University" in Virginia. It''s possible that the institution is not
      well-known, is a fictional representation, or there might be a mix-up with the
      name. Without clear information on Cordoba University''s location in Virginia,
      it''s challenging to proceed with a geographical comparison.


      4. **Geographical Comparison**: Assuming ALU is indeed at Fort Lee, Virginia,
      and without the exact location of Cordoba University in Virginia, a direct comparison
      cannot be accurately made. However, since both institutions are supposedly in
      Virginia, we would typically look at their specific locations within the state
      to determine which is west of the other.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Given the lack of clear, publicly
      available information on Cordoba University in Virginia and the assumption that
      Army Logistics University refers to an institution like the one at Fort Lee,
      Virginia, we cannot make a definitive geographical comparison without more specific
      details about Cordoba University''s location.

      break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, I need to identify the locations of both Army
      Logistics University and Cordoba University in Virginia.


      2. **Army Logistics University**: Upon research, it appears that the Army Logistics
      University (ALU) is located in Fort Lee, Virginia. Fort Lee is situated in Prince
      George County, Virginia.


      3. **Cordoba University**: However, I couldn''t find any information on a "Cordoba

      4. **Geographical Comparison**: Without the exact location of Cordoba University,
      it''s challenging to determine its position relative to Army Logistics University
      in Fort Lee, Virginia. However, since I couldn''t verify the existence of Cordoba
      University, I must consider the possibility that it doesn''t exist as a recognized

      Sonnencroft is mentioned in relation to West Virginia (WV), and Touro College
      South is mentioned in relation to Florida (FL).


      2. **Geographical Positioning**: West Virginia is a state located in the eastern
      United States, while Florida is also in the eastern United States but further
      to the southeast.


      3. **Comparison**: To determine if Sonnencroft, WV is west of Touro College

      by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Sonnencroft,
      WV, and Touro College South, FL. Sonnencroft is in West Virginia, and Touro
      College South is in Florida.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: West Virginia is generally considered
      to be in the eastern part of the United States, though it can be classified
      under different regions (Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, or even Southeast in some
      broader definitions). Florida, on the other hand, is located in the southeastern
      part of the United States.


      3. **Compare Geographic Positions**: Given that both locations are in the eastern
      United States, we need to consider their relative positions. West Virginia is
      north and somewhat west of Florida. However, when considering the term "west"
      in a broad geographical context across the United States, West Virginia would
      still be considered east of many parts of the country, including the Midwest
      and the Western states.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Geography**: The key question is whether Sonnencroft,
      WV, is west of Touro College South, FL. Since West Virginia is north and slightly
      west of Florida in the context of the eastern United States, but still generally
      east, the question hinges on the interpretation of "west of." However, in a
      direct geographical comparison within the context of the eastern United States,
      West Virginia is indeed west of Florida when considering their longitudinal
      positions (West Virginia is at a higher longitude than Florida).

      \ It's possible it might be a lesser-known, new, or incorrectly named institution.\
      \ Without precise details, it's challenging to determine its exact location.\n\
      \n- **South University**: South University has multiple campuses, but one of\
      \ its locations is in Savannah, Georgia. Savannah is on the eastern coast of\
      \ Georgia, near the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nWithout the exact location of Ralston\
      \ College, it's difficult to make a direct comparison. However, considering\
      \ Savannah (where South University is located) is on the eastern edge of Georgia,\
      \ any location west of Savannah would indeed be west of South University.\n\n\
      Given the lack of specific information on Ralston College's location in Georgia\

      geography of the area. Boston and Cambridge are adjacent cities, with Cambridge
      located just across the Charles River from Boston.


      3. **Determine the direction**: To say one location is west of another, it must
      be situated in the direction that the sun sets, relative to the other location.
      Given that both cities are close to each other and part of the larger Boston
      metropolitan area, the difference in their locations is not about being vastly
      far apart in terms of east-west orientation but rather about their precise positioning
      relative to each other.


      4. **Specific locations of MIT and Wentworth**: MIT is located in Cambridge,
      which is directly across the Charles River from Boston, where Wentworth Institute
      of Technology is situated. Cambridge (where MIT is) is generally north and slightly
      east of the Boston area where Wentworth is located, considering the Boston area''s
      layout and the path of the Charles River.


      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given the close proximity and the specific
      locations within the Boston metropolitan area, MIT (in Cambridge) is not west
      of Wentworth Institute of Technology (in Boston). Instead, it''s more accurate
      to describe MIT as being north (and slightly east, depending on the specific
      reference points within each city) of Wentworth Institute of Technology.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      the locations of Delaware State University and Widener University in Delaware.


      1. **Delaware State University (DSU)** is located in Dover, Delaware. Dover
      is the capital city of Delaware and is situated relatively in the central part
      of the state.


      2. **Widener University** has a campus in Wilmington, Delaware, among other
      locations. Wilmington is located in the northern part of Delaware, near the
      Pennsylvania border.


      Given these locations:

      - Dover (Delaware State University) is south of Wilmington (Widener University).

      - In terms of geographical directions within a state, moving from north to south
      means moving from areas that are more to the west (in the context of Delaware''s
      shape and orientation) to areas that might be slightly more to the east due
      to the state''s elongated shape from north to south. However, the primary concern
      here is the east-west orientation relative to each other.


      Considering Delaware''s geography and the relative positions of Dover and Wilmington:

      - Wilmington is to the north and slightly to the west of Dover due to Delaware''s
      shape, which means Dover (Delaware State University) is southeast of Wilmington
      (Widener University).


      So, considering if Delaware State University is west of Widener University:

      - The answer is **NO**, because Delaware State University in Dover is actually
      southeast (and thus east) of Widener University in Wilmington.'

      the locations of Delaware State University (DSU) and Widener University in relation
      to each other, specifically in terms of their geographical positions within
      Delaware.


      1. **Identify the location of Delaware State University (DSU):** DSU is located
      in Dover, Delaware. Dover is the capital city of Delaware and is situated in
      the central part of the state, somewhat towards the southern end but more centrally
      located in terms of east-west positioning.


      2. **Identify the location of Widener University:** Widener University has its
      main campus located in Chester, Pennsylvania, but it also has a campus in Wilmington,
      Delaware. Since the question specifies "DE" for both universities, we''re considering
      the Widener University campus in Wilmington, Delaware. Wilmington is located
      in the northern part of Delaware, near the border with Pennsylvania.


      3. **Determine the relative east-west positions:** Delaware is a relatively
      small state with a straightforward north-south orientation along the Delaware
      River and Bay. Dover (DSU''s location) is more centrally located in the state,
      while Wilmington (Widener University''s Delaware location) is towards the northern
      part of the state but still east of Dover due to the state''s geography. Delaware''s
      width from east to west is not as significant as its length from north to south,
      but generally, moving from Dover to Wilmington, one would be moving north and
      slightly east due to the state''s shape.


      Considering the above steps, to determine if Delaware State University is west
      of Widener University, we acknowledge that while both are in Delaware, their
      east-west positioning relative to each other is not as relevant as their north-south
      positioning due to the state''s narrow width. However, given that Dover (DSU)
      is generally southwest of Wilmington (Widener University in DE), and considering
      the state''s geography, DSU would indeed be west of Widener University in a
      broad geographical sense, especially when simplifying the state''s layout for
      this comparison.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Delaware State University is located west of
      Widener University in Delaware is: **YES**.'

      2. **Determine the geographical positions relative to each other**: Dover, where
      DSU is located, is south of Wilmington, where Widener University''s Delaware
      campus is situated.


      3. **Consider east-west orientation**: Delaware is a relatively narrow state
      from east to west, but in the context of the United States, it is generally
      considered to be on the eastern side. However, when comparing two points within
      the state, we''re looking at a much smaller scale. Wilmington is closer to the
      eastern edge of the state, and Dover, while still on the eastern seaboard, is
      somewhat south and slightly west of Wilmington but not significantly so in the

      absolute east-west positions in the country.

      east-west orientation.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Delaware State University is located in Dover,
      Delaware. Widener University has a campus in Wilmington, Delaware, but it''s
      essential to note that Widener University is primarily known for its location
      in Chester, Pennsylvania. However, since the question specifies the Delaware
      location, we focus on Wilmington, DE.


      2. **Understand Delaware''s geography**: Delaware is a small state with a generally
      north-south orientation along the Delaware River and Bay. Wilmington is in the
      northern part of the state, relatively close to the Pennsylvania border, while
      Dover is more centrally located but still south of Wilmington.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Dover (Delaware State University) is
      south of Wilmington (Widener University), and considering Delaware''s geography,
      Dover is generally east or southeast of Wilmington, not west. Delaware''s width
      from east to west is relatively narrow, so the primary directional distinction
      in this context is north-south rather than east-west. However, since the question
      asks about being west, we must consider the relative east-west positioning.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geography and the relative positions of Dover
      and Wilmington, Delaware State University in Dover is not west of Widener University
      in Wilmington. Instead, it is more accurately described as being south or southeast,
      but since the question specifically asks about being west, the answer to whether
      Delaware State University is located west of Widener University is NO.'

      both Antioch University Seattle and City University of Seattle. This involves
      finding their addresses or geographic coordinates.


      2. **Compare Geographic Positions**: Once we have the locations, we compare

      (east-west positioning) since the question is about which one is west of the

      3. **Determine Direction**: Knowing that west is the direction towards decreasing
      longitude (in the context of the Northern Hemisphere and the standard map orientation),

      comparing their longitudes.


      Given the general knowledge that both universities are in Seattle, WA, and without

      have real-time access to new information or specific geographic coordinates
      for these universities as of my last update, I''ll rely on general knowledge:


      - Antioch University Seattle is generally known to be located in the downtown
      area of Seattle.

      - City University of Seattle also has a presence in the Seattle area, but without
      specific details on its exact location relative to Antioch, the comparison requires
      actual geographic data.


      Assuming hypothetical access to their locations for the sake of argument:

      - If Antioch University Seattle has a lower longitude than City University of
      Seattle, it would be west.

      - Conversely, if it has a higher longitude, it would be east.


      Without the exact coordinates or a detailed map to reference in real-time, I
      must rely on the understanding that the question seeks a comparison based on
      geographic principles. Given that both institutions are within Seattle and without
      specific addresses to compare, the question implies a need for geographic analysis

      Therefore, based on the need for specific geographic data to accurately answer

      2. **General geography**: North Carolina is located north of Florida. Both states
      are on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      3. **East-West orientation**: Since both universities are in states that are
      directly north and south of each other on the eastern seaboard, the question
      of one being "west" of the other involves considering their longitudinal positions
      rather than their latitudinal (north-south) positions.

      4. **Specific locations**: Without needing the exact longitude, we can reason
      that for Pfeiffer University to be west of Florida National University, it would
      have to be significantly west in North Carolina to be at a longitude that is
      west of any part of Florida. However, North Carolina and Florida are adjacent

    ad448939-2f71-4c60-8470-1167929b6bb7: 'To determine if Pfeiffer University, NC
      is located west of Florida National University, FL, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the location of Pfeiffer University, NC**: Pfeiffer University
      is located in North Carolina. North Carolina is a state on the eastern coast
      of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Florida National University, FL**: Florida National
      University is located in Florida. Florida is also a state on the eastern coast
      of the United States but is situated south of North Carolina.


      3. **Compare the geographical positions**: Since both universities are on the
      eastern coast, we need to consider their longitudinal (east-west) positions
      relative to each other. North Carolina and Florida are relatively close in longitude,
      as they are both eastern states. However, to be west of Florida National University,
      Pfeiffer University would need to be at a lower longitude, meaning it would
      have to be located to the west of Florida on a map.


      4. **Conclusion**: Considering that North Carolina is north of Florida and not
      significantly different in longitude (east-west positioning), and knowing that
      Florida extends further east than any part of North Carolina does, Pfeiffer
      University, NC cannot be west of Florida National University, FL. Both states
      are on the eastern seaboard, with Florida being more to the south and slightly
      more to the east due to its peninsula shape extending into the Atlantic Ocean.


      Given these steps, the answer is: **NO**'
    e5d24053-479f-43b9-adb2-12633d2d4810: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the geographical locations of Pfeiffer University in North Carolina (NC) and
      Florida National University in Florida (FL), and then compare their positions
      relative to each other, specifically in terms of east-west orientation.


      1. **Identify the location of Pfeiffer University, NC**: Pfeiffer University
      is located in Misenheimer, North Carolina. North Carolina is a state on the
      east coast of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Florida National University, FL**: Florida National
      University is located in Hialeah, Florida. Florida is also a state on the east
      coast of the United States, situated to the south of North Carolina.


      3. **Compare the east-west orientation**: Since both universities are located
      on the east coast, their primary geographical distinction in this context is
      their north-south positioning rather than east-west. However, considering the
      overall geography, North Carolina is north of Florida. The question, though,
      is about whether Pfeiffer University is west of Florida National University.


      4. **Analyzing the geographical layout**: The United States'' east coast runs
      roughly north-south. Given that both North Carolina and Florida are coastal
      states along this axis, their east-west positioning relative to each other is
      not significantly different; the distinction is more about their north-south
      alignment. However, since Florida extends westward into the Gulf of Mexico more
      than North Carolina does (due to its larger peninsula), parts of Florida could
      be considered west of parts of North Carolina, depending on the specific locations
      within the states.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Pfeiffer University is in North Carolina and Florida
      National University is in Florida, and considering the general geography of
      the region, we can conclude that Pfeiffer University is not west of Florida
      National University. Florida National University, being in a state that is generally
      south and slightly west (in terms of its broader geographical extent into the
      Gulf of Mexico) of North Carolina, means that Pfeiffer University would generally
      be northeast of Florida National University, not west.

      Illinois College of Optometry is located in Chicago, Illinois, specifically
      on the south side of the city.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since both institutions are in Chicago, we need
      to understand the city''s layout. Chicago is laid out in a grid pattern with
      the downtown area (The Loop) as a reference point. The north side of Chicago,
      where Loyola University''s main campus is located, is generally east of and
      north of the south side, where ICO is situated.


      4. **Determine the directional relationship**: Given that ICO is on the south
      side and Loyola University Chicago is on the north side, ICO is south of Loyola.
      However, we need to consider if it''s also west. Chicago''s grid system means
      that moving from north to south, you''re essentially moving in a straight line
      down, not west or east unless you specifically move in those directions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since ICO is on the south side of Chicago and Loyola University
      Chicago is on the north side, and considering Chicago''s layout, ICO is not
      west of Loyola University Chicago but rather south of it.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      Heart, MA is located west of Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology,
      MA, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      institutions. Newton College of the Sacred Heart is in Newton, Massachusetts.
      The Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology is also in Massachusetts,
      specifically in Newton as well, but now it''s known as William James College
      after a name change.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Since both institutions are in Newton,
      Massachusetts, their locations are relatively close to each other. However,
      to answer the question, we need to establish their exact positions relative
      to each other in terms of cardinal directions (east, west, north, south).


      3. **Compare Locations**: Without specific addresses, we can''t determine the
      exact direction one is from the other based solely on the information given.
      However, since both are in Newton, and assuming the question refers to their
      historical or current locations within Newton, we must consider if there''s
      any information that suggests one is distinctly west of the other.


      Given that Newton College of the Sacred Heart and the Massachusetts School of
      Professional Psychology (now William James College) are both located in Newton,
      Massachusetts, and without specific addresses or a detailed map showing their
      relative positions, it''s challenging to definitively state one is west of the
      other based solely on their city location. However, considering typical scenarios
      where colleges might be situated within a city, if one were to assume or research
      that one institution is on the western part of Newton and the other on the eastern
      part, then a determination could be made.


      But, since both institutions are known to be in Newton and given the renaming
      and possible relocations or campus changes over time, without exact current
      or historical addresses, the most straightforward answer based on the information
      provided and general knowledge would lean towards a simplification. The question
      essentially asks for a comparison that typically requires more specific geographic
      data than provided.


      Given this, and acknowledging the need for a YES or NO answer without further
      geographic detail, the response must be based on the understanding that both
      colleges are in the same city, which suggests their locations are not significantly
      distant in terms of cardinal directions like east and west, as would be the
      case with locations in different parts of the state or country.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Newton College of the Sacred Heart, MA is located
      west of Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology, MA, without specific
      addresses or a map, would generally be **NO**, considering the lack of detailed

      institutions. Newton College of the Sacred Heart is located in Newton, Massachusetts.
      The Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology (MSPP) is also located in
      Newton, Massachusetts.


      2. **Compare Locations**: Since both institutions are located in the same city
      (Newton, Massachusetts), their east-west positioning relative to each other
      depends on their specific addresses within Newton.


      3. **Determine East-West Positioning**: Without specific addresses, we can consider
      the general layout of Newton, Massachusetts. Newton is a city located just west
      of Boston. However, the east-west positioning within the city itself is what
      matters for this comparison.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Given that both institutions are
      in Newton and without precise addresses or a detailed map showing their exact
      locations relative to each other, it''s not directly possible to determine their

      Given the constraints of the question and assuming a need to make an educated
      guess based on typical city layouts and the fact that both are in the same city,
      it might seem like a detailed comparison is needed. However, since we''re comparing
      two locations within the same city and the question doesn''t provide specific
      addresses or relative positions, we must consider if there''s an implied assumption
      or typical knowledge that could guide the answer.


      The final step is acknowledging that without specific location details or a
      map, we cannot accurately determine the east-west relationship between the two
      institutions based solely on the information given. However, the question format
      suggests an expectation of a definitive answer, which implies we might need
      to rely on external knowledge or assumptions not provided in the question itself.


      Given these considerations and the fact that we cannot accurately determine

      \ Geographic Relationship**: Since both institutions are in Newton, Massachusetts,\
      \ we need to understand their specific locations within Newton to determine\
      \ their geographic relationship.\n\n3. **Newton, MA Geography**: Newton is a\
      \ city located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and it is situated about\
      \ 11 miles west of downtown Boston. However, to answer the question, we need\
      \ to consider the relative positions of these two institutions within Newton\
      \ or their previous locations if applicable.\n\n4. **Institutional Locations**:\
      \ \n    - Newton College of the Sacred Heart: It's essential to note that Newton\
      \ College of the Sacred Heart merged with Boston College in 1973, and its campus\
      \ became part of Boston College's campus. \n    - Massachusetts School of Professional\
      \ Psychology (now William James College): This institution is indeed located\
      \ in Newton, Massachusetts.\n\n5. **Comparison**: Without the exact addresses\
      \ or considering the merger and name changes, the critical point is whether\
      \ one is west of the other within Newton or not. Given that both are in Newton\
      \ and without specific details on their exact locations relative to each other,\
      \ we might initially think this is a challenge. However, considering the merger\
      \ of Newton College of the Sacred Heart with Boston College and the location\
      \ of William James College, the question essentially asks us to compare their\
      \ locations within Newton or as they relate to the broader Massachusetts geography.\n\
      \n6. **Conclusion**: Since both institutions are based in Newton, Massachusetts,\
      \ and without precise information on their relative east-west positioning within\
      \ the city, one might assume it's a complex question. However, the question\
      \ simplifies when recognizing that Newton College of the Sacred Heart is now\
      \ part of Boston College, and its original location would be what's relevant.\
      \ Given William James College's presence in Newton and without specific details\
      \ suggesting otherwise, the question's premise seems to hinge on the understanding\
      \ of these institutions' historical and current locations.\n\nGiven these considerations,\
      \ without explicit information on their relative positions or acknowledging\
      \ that both are in the same city (Newton), making a definitive statement about\
      \ one being west of the other requires more specific geographic data than provided.\
      \ However, in the context of providing a YES or NO answer as requested and considering\
      \ the complexity of the question might imply a need for more detailed location\
      \ analysis, the straightforward answer based on the information given and typical\

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both

      for Politics. The International Residential College is a part of the University
      of Virginia, located in Charlottesville, Virginia. The University of Virginia
      Center for Politics is also located in Charlottesville, Virginia.


      2. **Determine Spatial Relationship**: Next, we need to determine if one is
      located west of the other. Charlottesville is a relatively small city, and both
      institutions are part of the University of Virginia, suggesting they are close
      to each other. However, without specific addresses or a map, we can''t directly
      determine their spatial relationship based solely on their names.


      3. **General Knowledge Application**: The University of Virginia''s main campus,
      where both institutions are likely located, is situated in Charlottesville.
      The International Residential College, being a residential college, would likely
      be located within or near the main campus area. The Center for Politics, while
      also on campus, might not have a specific "west" location without more context.

      part of the University of Virginia and likely located on or near the main campus
      in Charlottesville, without specific directional information (e.g., exact addresses
      or a campus map), it''s challenging to definitively say one is west of the other.

      layout of university campuses, one might infer that if the International Residential

    3e28c508-6b6e-4323-8465-03149e23f88c: 'To determine if the International Residential
      College (IRC) at the University of Virginia is located west of the University
      of Virginia Center for Politics, we need to consider the geographical layout
      of the University of Virginia''s campus and the specific locations of these
      entities.


      1. **Identify Locations**: The International Residential College (IRC) is a
      residential college at the University of Virginia, and the Center for Politics
      is also located on or near the UVA campus.


      2. **Understand Campus Layout**: The University of Virginia''s campus is laid
      out with various schools, colleges, and facilities spread across different areas.
      However, without specific details on the exact locations of the IRC and the
      Center for Politics, we must consider general knowledge about UVA''s campus
      layout.


      3. **General Campus Geography**: The University of Virginia is situated in Charlottesville,
      Virginia. The main campus is generally laid out with the historic Lawn and the
      Rotunda at its center. Other facilities and residential areas are spread out
      around this central area.


      4. **Location of IRC and Center for Politics**: The IRC is located on the western
      part of the grounds, near the intersection of McCormick Road and Alderman Road,
      if we consider its placement within the larger context of UVA''s residential
      colleges. The Center for Politics is situated near the intersection of McCormick
      Road and Emmet Street, which places it somewhat central to the academic area
      of the campus but not as far west as some residential areas.


      5. **Comparative Location**: Given the general locations, the IRC is indeed
      situated more to the west compared to many central academic buildings on campus.
      The Center for Politics, being closer to the central academic area, would likely
      be east of the IRC if the IRC is on the western part of the campus.


      Based on the step-by-step reasoning and considering the general layout of the
      University of Virginia''s campus, it seems likely that the International Residential
      College is located west of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.


      **YES**'
    72d6e738-ca29-419f-a675-dfe25425671d: 'To answer this question, I will follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, I need to identify the locations of both the
      International Residential College (IRC) and the University of Virginia Center
      for Politics (UVA Center for Politics).


      2. **International Residential College (IRC)**: The IRC is a residential college
      at the University of Virginia. Given its association with the University of
      Virginia, it is reasonable to assume that it is located on or near the university''s
      campus in Charlottesville, Virginia.


      3. **University of Virginia Center for Politics**: This center is also located
      at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. It is focused on
      promoting civic engagement and understanding of politics. Its location on the
      university''s campus means it is also in Charlottesville.


      4. **Determine Direction**: Since both locations are associated with the University
      of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, the question essentially asks if one
      part of the university is west of another part.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both the International Residential College and
      the University of Virginia Center for Politics are on the University of Virginia
      campus, and without specific directional information relative to each other,
      one might initially think this question requires more specific location data.
      However, considering typical campus layouts and the fact that both are part
      of the University of Virginia, if we had to make an educated guess based on
      standard directional queries, we''d recognize that the question''s premise assumes
      a comparative analysis of their locations.


      6. **Final Consideration**: The University of Virginia''s campus is not enormous,
      and both entities are part of it. Without exact addresses or a detailed campus
      map showing their relative positions, the question seems to test understanding
      of directional relationships within a confined area. The IRC is known to be
      located on the university''s grounds, and so is the Center for Politics. The
      exact directional relationship (west) would depend on their specific locations
      on campus.


      Given these considerations and the nature of the question, which seeks a straightforward
      YES or NO answer without providing specific locations or a map, the most reasonable
      approach is to consider the general layout of the University of Virginia and
      the typical proximity of its constituent parts. However, the question''s phrasing
      implies a need for geographic specificity that isn''t provided.


      Therefore, based on general reasoning and without specific details on the relative
      locations of these two entities within the University of Virginia, the answer
      could lean towards a simplification or a requirement for more detailed information.
      But, acknowledging the constraints of the question and the format requested
      for the answer:

      the geographical locations of Bemidji State University (BSU) in Minnesota and
      Northwest Missouri State University (NWMSU) in Missouri and then compare their
      positions relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of Bemidji State University (BSU), MN**: Bemidji
      State University is located in Bemidji, Minnesota. Minnesota is in the northern
      United States, considered part of both the Midwest and the Western United States,

      Northwest Missouri State University is located in Maryville, Missouri. Missouri
      is located in the Midwestern United States. The "Northwest" in its name indicates
      it is in the northwestern part of Missouri.


      3. **Compare the geographical locations**: To determine if BSU is west of NWMSU,
      we need to consider their relative positions. Minnesota is north of Missouri.
      Bemidji, being in northern Minnesota, is relatively far north. Maryville, Missouri,

      in Minnesota (MN) is located west of Northwest Missouri State University in
      Missouri (MO), let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the general location of each state**: Minnesota is located in
      the northern United States, in the Midwest region, and is part of the states
      considered to be in the "North" in a broader geographic context. Missouri is
      also in the Midwest but is situated more to the southeast of Minnesota.


      2. **Consider the directional relationship between states**: Generally, moving
      from Minnesota to Missouri, you would be moving southeast. This implies that
      Missouri is east and somewhat south of Minnesota.


      3. **Understand the terminology of directional names**: The name "Northwest"
      Missouri State University indicates it is in the northwest part of Missouri.
      Similarly, Bemidji State University being in Minnesota gives us a general northern
      location relative to Missouri.


      4. **Apply geographic knowledge**: Knowing that Minnesota is north and somewhat
      west of Missouri due to the country''s layout, a university in the northwest
      part of Missouri would still be east of a university in northern Minnesota,
      considering the overall geography of the region.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the northern location of Minnesota and the southeastward
      direction one would travel to get to Missouri, Bemidji State University in Minnesota
      would indeed be west of Northwest Missouri State University in Missouri, considering
      the broader geographic context.

      1. **Identify the states**: Eastern Mennonite University is in Virginia (VA),
      and D''Youville University is in New York (NY).

      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Virginia is generally located to the
      south of New York.

      3. **East-West orientation**: Since Virginia is to the south and not directly
      west of New York, we must consider their relative east-west positions. New York
      is east of Virginia because, in general, as you move from New York towards Virginia,
      you are moving southwest.

      4. **Conclusion**: Given that New York is east of Virginia, a location in Virginia
      (Eastern Mennonite University) would be west of a location in New York (D''Youville
      University).

    519a50d2-de88-498c-a704-35114365d0e4: 'To determine if the State University of
      New York at Purchase, NY is located west of Mildred Elley, NY, we need to follow
      a few steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      institutions. The State University of New York at Purchase (SUNY Purchase) is
      located in Purchase, New York. Mildred Elley is also located in New York, but
      it has multiple campuses. For the purpose of this comparison, we''ll assume
      the relevant location is its Albany campus, as it''s a well-known location for
      Mildred Elley.


      2. **Geographical Positioning**: Next, we determine their geographical positions
      relative to each other. Purchase, NY, where SUNY Purchase is located, is in
      Westchester County, which is just north of New York City. Albany, where the
      Mildred Elley campus in question is presumed to be, is the capital city of New
      York and is located further north, closer to the center of the state.


      3. **East-West Orientation**: New York State is oriented such that the eastern
      part of the state borders the Hudson River and the Atlantic Ocean, while the
      western part borders the Great Lakes and Pennsylvania. Given this, locations
      that are more towards the western side of the state would be closer to the Great
      Lakes or Pennsylvania, while locations towards the eastern side would be closer
      to the Atlantic Ocean.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: Purchase, NY (SUNY Purchase) is relatively east
      compared to Albany (Mildred Elley), considering Albany is more central and slightly
      west of the eastern seaboard part of New York where Purchase is located.


      Based on this reasoning, since Purchase, NY (where SUNY Purchase is located)
      is east of Albany, NY (where Mildred Elley is presumed to be), the State University
      of New York at Purchase, NY is not located west of Mildred Elley, NY.

      2. **Location of SUNY Purchase**: SUNY Purchase is located in Purchase, New
      York. This is in Westchester County, which is part of the New York metropolitan
      area, not far from New York City.


      3. **Location of Mildred Elley**: Mildred Elley has campuses in New York, specifically
      in Albany. Albany is the capital of New York State and is located further north
      and west of the New York City metropolitan area.


      4. **Compare the locations**: To determine if SUNY Purchase is west of Mildred
      Elley, we need to compare their geographical positions. Albany, where Mildred
      Elley is located, is generally northwest of the New York City area, which includes
      Westchester County where SUNY Purchase is situated.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Albany (Mildred Elley''s location) is northwest
      of the Westchester County area (SUNY Purchase''s location), SUNY Purchase is
      actually southeast or east of Albany, not west.

      \ of Ohio, especially the area around Columbus where ODU is located, might indeed\
      \ be directly west of at least some portions of Kentucky due to the long shared\
      \ border between the states.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination with geographic\
      \ specifics (noting this is more an exercise in approximation without exact\
      \ geographic coordinates provided in the question):\n\n- Columbus, Ohio (and\
      \ thus ODU), is more generally northwest or roughly west-northwest of Kentucky\
      \ rather than straightforwardly west.\n\nBut simplistically speaking, as Kentucky\
      \ is relatively east of much of Ohio in general geographic discussions, we have\
      \ to look closely at these cities' specific positioning relative to their shared\
      \ state borders.\n\n**Columbus (Ohio) Long: -82.9988, Lat: 39.9612.  \nGrayson\
      \ (Kentucky) Long: -82.9437, Lat: 38.3345.**\n\nGiven the precise longitude\
      \ and understanding the US maps' orientation where moving west reduces the longitude\
      \ coordinate (considering we are strictly in the western hemisphere), since\
      \ -82.9988 is indeed west (a smaller, more negative longitude) of -82.9437,\
      \ a straightforward geographical answer can be arrived at based on longitude\
      \ values.\n\n\n**Answer:** YES"

      campuses in California, but one of its main locations is in San Diego. John
      Paul the Great Catholic University is also located in San Diego, California.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are in San Diego, their
      locations are relatively close to each other. However, to determine if one is

      that is west of the other''s location, then it would be considered west.


      However, given that both universities are in the same city (San Diego) and without
      specific addresses to compare, the question seems to simplify to a comparison
      within the same general area. For the sake of providing an answer based on typical

      down into the necessary steps:


      1. **Identify the locations** of both Drake University College of Pharmacy and
      Health Sciences and Des Moines University in Iowa.

      2. **Determine the geographical relationship** between these two locations,
      specifically whether Drake University is located west of Des Moines University.


      **Step 1: Identify Locations**


      - **Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences** is located in
      Des Moines, Iowa. Specifically, Drake University''s main campus is situated
      in the heart of Des Moines.

      - **Des Moines University** is also located in Des Moines, Iowa, but to determine
      the geographical relationship, we need more specific information about their
      exact locations within the city.


      **Step 2: Determine Geographical Relationship**


      Given that both institutions are in Des Moines, Iowa, to determine if Drake
      University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is west of Des Moines University,
      we need to know their exact addresses or relative positions within the city.


      - **Drake University''s** address is 2507 University Avenue, Des Moines, IA
      50311.

      - **Des Moines University''s** address is 3200 Grand Avenue, Des Moines, IA
      50312.


      Without precise geographical coordinates or a detailed map, we can consider
      the general layout of Des Moines. However, given the addresses, we can infer
      their relative positions. University Avenue and Grand Avenue are both significant
      streets in Des Moines, but to determine which is west, we would typically look
      at a map. Generally, in U.S. cities, avenues and streets are laid out in a grid
      pattern, with numbering increasing as you move away from the city center or
      a significant landmark.


      **Conclusion**


      Given the lack of specific geographical data in this reasoning process and relying
      on typical city grid layouts, we cannot definitively conclude the exact relationship
      without a map. However, considering typical grid patterns, if Grand Avenue is
      considered more central or eastern, and University Avenue extends further west,
      then Drake could potentially be west of Des Moines University. But without a
      map or more detailed information about Des Moines'' layout, this conclusion
      is speculative.


      **Answer**


      Based on the speculative nature of the conclusion and the need for precise geographical
      information to accurately determine the relationship, the most informed answer
      would typically require checking a map. However, for the sake of providing an
      answer based on the information given:

      \ Without exact longitude or a detailed map showing both locations' precise\
      \ positions relative to each other on an east-west axis, we can't definitively\
      \ conclude their relative east-west positions solely based on their addresses.\
      \ However, considering typical grid layouts and assuming Grand Avenue and University\
      \ Avenue run parallel to each other (as is common in grid systems), if Drake\
      \ University and Des Moines University were directly compared on these avenues\
      \ without additional geographical context, we couldn't conclusively say one\
      \ is west of the other based solely on the information given. \n\nHowever, since\
      \ both are in Des Moines and on avenues that likely run parallel, to give a\

      \nGiven the constraint of the question and assuming we're looking for a straightforward\

      1. **Identify the location of Jackson State University (JSU), MS**: Jackson
      State University is located in Jackson, Mississippi. Mississippi is generally
      considered to be in the southeastern part of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences,

      3. **Determine the relative geographical positions**: To determine if JSU is
      west of Saint Louis University, we need to understand the geographical layout.
      St. Louis, Missouri, is farther north and slightly east of Jackson, Mississippi.
      Considering the general west-to-east line, Jackson, MS, is southeast of St.
      Louis, MO, but since St. Louis is significantly north and only slightly east,
      we must consider the west-east axis primarily.


      4. **Conclusion based on geographical analysis**: Given that Jackson, MS, is
      generally southeast of St. Louis, MO, but considering the question asks if it''s
      west, we need to focus on the west-east axis. Jackson, MS, is actually east
      of St. Louis, MO, when considering the direct line from west to east across

      \   - Texas is generally southwest of Oklahoma.\n   - Within these states, Huntsville,\

      \ the west-east position but understanding that \"west of\" in this context\
      \ refers to the longitude. However, given that Sam Houston State University\
      \ and Rogers State University are almost at the same longitude, the question\
      \ simplifies to understanding which one is actually to the west if we consider\
      \ their positions as a whole.\n\nGiven the coordinates, Sam Houston State University\
      \ (Huntsville, TX) is not significantly west of Rogers State University (Claremore,\
      \ OK) in terms of longitude; they are almost on the same longitudinal line.\
      \ However, considering the essence of the question, which asks if SHSU is west\
      \ of RSU, and given the minimal difference in longitude (with RSU being at a\
      \ slightly higher longitude, thus technically more west), the question may seem\
      \ to hinge on a precise interpretation of geographical data.\n\nHowever, given\
      \ the spirit of the question and understanding that both universities are nearly\
      \ on the same longitudinal line (with RSU being slightly west), the most straightforward\
      \ interpretation based on the premise provided would lean towards considering\
      \ their relative positions in a broader geographical context, which might suggest\
      \ a \"no\" due to the complexities of interpreting \"west of\" in this specific\
      \ scenario without considering the latitudinal difference as a primary factor.\n\

    33f373ba-0284-4433-9dd1-30d190599331: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Strayer
      University in Washington, D.C., and Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington,
      D.C.


      2. **Strayer University Location**: Strayer University has multiple campuses,
      but when referring to its location in Washington, D.C., it''s essential to note
      that it might not be a traditional campus but rather an administrative or educational
      center. However, without a specific address, we consider its general presence
      in the District of Columbia.


      3. **Corcoran College of Art and Design Location**: The Corcoran College of
      Art and Design is located near the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Specifically,
      its address is 500 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20006. This puts it in the northwest
      part of the city.


      4. **Comparing Locations**: To determine if Strayer University is west of Corcoran
      College of Art and Design, we need to understand the layout of Washington, D.C.
      The city is divided into quadrants (NW, NE, SW, SE), with the U.S. Capitol building
      as the central point. Locations in the NW quadrant are generally considered
      to be on the west side of the city when compared to locations in the NE, SW,
      or SE quadrants that are more to the east or south.


      5. **Strayer University''s Exact Location**: Without the exact address of Strayer
      University in D.C., we cannot definitively say its location relative to Corcoran
      College of Art and Design. However, for the purpose of this exercise, if we
      consider Strayer University to be generally located within the District of Columbia,
      we would need to know its specific quadrant or address to make a direct comparison.


      6. **Assumption for Answering**: Assuming Strayer University has a presence
      in a location that could be either in the northwest, northeast, southwest, or
      southeast part of Washington, D.C., and given Corcoran College of Art and Design
      is in the northwest, Strayer University would need to be in the northwest part
      of the city or further west to be considered west of Corcoran College of Art
      and Design.


      7. **Conclusion**: Without the exact location of Strayer University, D.C., it''s
      challenging to definitively answer the question. However, if we are to make
      an educated guess based on typical locations within the city and assuming Strayer
      University could be located in various parts of the city, the question becomes
      a matter of the specific locations of these institutions.


      Given the complexity and the need for specific addresses to accurately determine
      their relative locations, and considering the general nature of the question,
      the most straightforward approach to provide a YES or NO answer would be to
      consider if it''s generally possible for Strayer University to be west of Corcoran
      College of Art and Design based on the city''s layout. However, without exact
      addresses, any answer involves some level of uncertainty.


      Therefore, based on the general information and the layout of Washington, D.C.,
      the answer to whether Strayer University, D.C., is located west of Corcoran
      College of Art and Design, D.C., could be "YES" if Strayer University is located
      in a part of the city that is west of Corcoran''s location. But since we don''t
      have the exact locations, this is speculative.


      The final answer is: YES'

      \ near the George Washington University campus before its closure and integration\
      \ into GWU. For the purpose of this exercise, let's consider its general location\
      \ as being in the heart of Washington, D.C., near the National Mall.\n\n3. **Strayer\
      \ University Location**: Strayer University has multiple campuses, but when\

      \ is west of Corcoran College of Art and Design, we compare their addresses.\n\
      \   - The address for Strayer University (1133 15th St NW) and Corcoran College\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both Strayer
      University in Washington, D.C., and Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington,
      D.C.


      2. **Strayer University Location**: Strayer University has multiple locations,
      but its main campus or a significant presence in Washington, D.C., is what we''re
      interested in. Without the exact address, we know it''s in the District of Columbia.


      3. **Corcoran College of Art and Design Location**: The Corcoran College of
      Art and Design is located in Washington, D.C., and it''s known to be part of
      the George Washington University. Its location is near the National Mall, specifically
      at 500 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20006.


      4. **Understanding "West Of"**: To say one location is west of another means
      it is situated in the direction west from the other location. In the context
      of Washington, D.C., this involves understanding the city''s grid and layout.


      5. **Washington, D.C. Grid**: Washington, D.C. is laid out in a grid pattern
      with avenues and streets. Locations west in the city would generally be towards
      the higher numbered streets going westward from the center of the city or the

      are spread out across the city, but knowing that Corcoran is near the National
      Mall gives us a central reference point.


      7. **Making an Informed Guess**: Given that Corcoran College of Art and Design
      is located near the National Mall, which is somewhat central in Washington,
      D.C., a location "west of" Corcoran would imply an area further west in the
      city. Without specific addresses for Strayer University''s D.C. location, we
      must consider if Strayer''s presence in D.C. is generally westward of the central
      area where Corcoran is situated.


      8. **Conclusion**: Without exact addresses or more detailed geographical information
      about Strayer University''s location in D.C. relative to Corcoran College of

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Strayer
      University in DC and Corcoran College of Art and Design in DC.


      2. **Strayer University, DC Location**: Strayer University has multiple locations,
      but when referring to its DC location, we are generally talking about its campus
      within Washington, D.C. However, specific addresses can vary as institutions
      can have multiple campuses or buildings. For the sake of this question, we''ll
      need a general understanding of its placement within the city.


      3. **Corcoran College of Art and Design, DC Location**: The Corcoran College
      of Art and Design is located in Washington, D.C., and it has been part of the
      George Washington University since 2014. Its main building is historically situated
      near the White House, specifically at 500 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20006.


      4. **Determining Geographic Location**: To determine if Strayer University is

      with the US Capitol building as a central reference point. The city''s quadrants
      (NE, NW, SE, SW) are divided by the Capitol, with the National Mall running
      through the center.


      5. **Comparing Locations**: Without a specific address for Strayer University''s
      DC campus, we can''t make a precise comparison. However, knowing that the Corcoran
      College of Art and Design is in the NW quadrant (near the White House), for
      Strayer University to be west of it, it would need to be either in the same
      NW quadrant but further west or in a location that is generally considered west
      of the Corcoran''s location.


      6. **Making an Informed Guess**: Given the lack of specific information about
      Strayer University''s exact location in DC and considering the layout of Washington,
      D.C., it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer without more precise
      data. However, if we consider typical locations and the fact that many universities
      have campuses in various parts of the city, we might lean towards a general
      assumption based on common locations for universities.


      Since I don''t have the exact addresses of Strayer University''s DC campus(es)
      at the moment, I''ll have to give a cautious answer based on the steps of reasoning
      provided. However, given the nature of the question, which requires a yes or
      no answer, and acknowledging the potential for Strayer University to have a
      campus in a location that could be considered west of Corcoran College of Art
      and Design, the answer could lean towards a possibility. But, without the exact
      location, this is speculative.


      Given the constraints and aiming for a direct answer as requested:

    424117f2-99dc-476a-9039-57d2f6743eac: 'To answer this question, let''s first understand
      the locations involved.


      1. **Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, NY**: This school is part
      of the City College of New York (CCNY) and is located in Manhattan, New York
      City. Specifically, the City College of New York, where Sophie Davis is based,
      is situated in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan.


      2. **The Rockefeller University, NY**: This university is also located in Manhattan,
      New York City. It is situated on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.


      Given these locations:


      - Manhattan is divided into several neighborhoods, with the Upper East Side
      generally considered to be east of Central Park and the area around Harlem considered
      to be further north and somewhat west (though still on the east side of the
      Hudson River) of the Upper East Side.


      - The term "west" in this context refers to geographic positioning relative
      to each other in Manhattan. Since both institutions are on the east side of
      Manhattan, we''re comparing their relative positions within this area.


      - The Rockefeller University, being on the Upper East Side, is generally east
      or more eastern in Manhattan compared to the area around City College (where
      Sophie Davis is located), which, while still on the east side, is positioned
      more to the west relative to the Upper East Side in the context of Manhattan''s
      layout.

      down the steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Hampton University is located in Virginia (VA),
      and Millersville University of Pennsylvania is located in Pennsylvania (PA).


      2. **General Geography**: Generally, Virginia is located south of Pennsylvania.
      However, to determine if it is west, we need to consider their specific locations
      relative to each other.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia, which
      is near the eastern coast of the United States. Millersville University of Pennsylvania
      is in Millersville, Pennsylvania, which is also on the eastern side of the United
      States but further north than Hampton, VA.


      4. **East-West Alignment**: Since both universities are on the eastern side
      of the United States, we need to look at their longitudinal positions (east-west
      positioning). Virginia is generally east of Pennsylvania because it is directly
      south and slightly east due to the curvature of the U.S. eastern coastline.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Hampton University, VA is located more to the
      east and slightly south of Millersville University of Pennsylvania, PA, it cannot
      be west of Millersville University of Pennsylvania.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the locations of William
      Paterson University (WPU) and Georgian Court University (GCU) in New Jersey.


      2. **William Paterson University Location**: William Paterson University is
      located in Wayne, New Jersey.


      3. **Georgian Court University Location**: Georgian Court University is located
      in Lakewood, New Jersey.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if WPU is west of GCU, we need to understand
      the geographical layout of New Jersey. Generally, New Jersey can be divided
      into regions, but for simplicity, knowing the general directions (north, south,
      east, west) and major geographical features or cities can help.


      5. **New Jersey Geography**: Lakewood (GCU''s location) is in Ocean County,
      which is in the eastern part of the state, closer to the Atlantic coast. Wayne
      (WPU''s location) is in Passaic County, which is more to the north and slightly
      west compared to the eastern coastal areas like Lakewood.


      6. **Determine Direction**: Given that Lakewood is more to the east (closer
      to the coast) and Wayne is more to the northwest in the state, we can infer
      that William Paterson University is indeed west (and slightly north) of Georgian
      Court University.

    429b5152-3563-49d6-99b3-f83271133ab1: 'To answer this question, let''s first identify
      the locations of both William Paterson University and Georgian Court University
      in New Jersey.


      1. **William Paterson University** is located in Wayne, New Jersey.

      2. **Georgian Court University** is located in Lakewood, New Jersey.


      Next, we need to understand the geographical layout of New Jersey to determine
      what "west" means in this context. New Jersey is a relatively small state, but
      it does have a distinct geography with the Delaware River forming its western
      border.


      - **Wayne, NJ**, where William Paterson University is located, is in Passaic
      County, which is in the northern part of New Jersey.

      - **Lakewood, NJ**, where Georgian Court University is located, is in Ocean
      County, which is also in the northern part of New Jersey but further south than
      Wayne.


      To determine if William Paterson University is west of Georgian Court University,
      we need to compare their relative positions:


      - **Georgian Court University (Lakewood, NJ)** is generally southeast of **William
      Paterson University (Wayne, NJ)** because Lakewood is closer to the Atlantic
      coast, and Wayne is more inland.


      Given these geographical positions:

      - West in New Jersey would refer to moving towards the Delaware River from the
      Atlantic coast.

      - Since William Paterson University is more inland (and in a more northern part
      of the state) compared to Georgian Court University, it is indeed more to the
      west.


      Therefore, considering the geography and the relative positions of the two universities:


      The answer is: **YES**'

      College of Health and Human Services is located west of Eastern Michigan University,
      let''s break down the question:


      1. **Identify the Main Location**: Eastern Michigan University (EMU) is the
      main institution in question. It is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


      2. **Understanding the Component in Question**: The College of Health and Human
      Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University. Colleges or schools within
      a university are typically located on or near the main campus of the university,
      unless specified otherwise.


      3. **Assessing Geographic Location**: Without specific information indicating
      that the College of Health and Human Services is located at a significant distance
      from the main EMU campus, it is reasonable to assume that it is situated on
      or very near the main campus, given common university structures.


      4. **Relative Positioning**: The question asks if the College of Health and
      Human Services is located west of Eastern Michigan University. Given that both
      are part of the same institution and assuming the college is not in a drastically
      different location, determining if one is west of the other would require precise
      geographic information. However, typically, a college within a university does
      not have a separate location that would place it in a different directional
      quadrant relative to the main university campus unless explicitly stated.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Since the College of Health
      and Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University and not explicitly
      stated to be in a different location, it is logical to conclude that it is not
      significantly west of the main university campus. Thus, without additional information
      indicating a separate location, the assumption would lean towards them being
      in the same general area.


      Based on these steps and without specific information to the contrary, the most
      reasonable answer would be **NO**, as the College of Health and Human Services
      is likely located on or very near the main Eastern Michigan University campus,
      rather than being distinctly west of it.'

      \ considering the historical context, the \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes\
      \ was indeed located in New York City during World War II. It was founded by\
      \ French expatriates and had its offices and classes in various locations in\
      \ Manhattan.\n\n4. **Comparing locations**:\n   - Without the exact current\
      \ address of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes (as it may have evolved or\
      \ ceased to exist under this name in New York City), we can consider a general\
      \ comparison based on historical data. The \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes\
      \ was active in Manhattan during WWII, but its precise location(s) during that\
      \ time are not specified in the question.\n\n5. **Assuming a historical context\

      \ information on \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes and assuming it refers\
      \ to its historical presence in NYC, we can consider that both institutions\
      \ were located in Manhattan, New York City.\n\n6. **East-West comparison in\
      \ Manhattan**:\n   - Manhattan's grid system runs with avenues generally going\
      \ north-south and streets east-west. Without exact addresses, determining if\
      \ one is west of the other requires knowing their relative positions on this\
      \ grid.\n\n7. **Conclusion based on available data**:\n   - Given that both\
      \ institutions are or were located in Manhattan and without precise addresses\
      \ for a direct comparison, a definitive answer would typically require more\
      \ specific location data. However, considering the question asks for a yes or\
      \ no answer and given the general nature of the question, we must proceed with\
      \ the assumption that the question implies a comparison based on known or historical\
      \ locations.\n\n8. **Final step**:\n   - Since both institutions are in Manhattan\
      \ and without precise locations to compare, the question seems to test general\
      \ knowledge of their relative positions. However, without specific addresses\
      \ or a clear indication of their historical or current proximity, one must consider\
      \ the general layout of Manhattan and any available historical data on these\
      \ institutions.\n\nGiven the steps and the necessity to provide a YES or NO\
      \ answer without further detailed location information, the answer would lean\
      \ towards the fact that both institutions are located in the same general area\
      \ (Manhattan, New York City), but the precise east-west relationship cannot\
      \ be determined without exact addresses.\n\nHowever, considering the nature\
      \ of the question and the requirement for a YES or NO answer, and acknowledging\
      \ that NYU's main campus (including the Graduate School of Arts and Science)\
      \ is generally located in the Greenwich Village area of Manhattan, and without\
      \ a specific, current location for \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes but knowing\
      \ it was also in Manhattan, a definitive geographical comparison is challenging.\n\
      \nTherefore, based on the information provided and the steps considered, and\
      \ recognizing the limitations in determining the exact relationship without\
      \ precise locations, the answer would have to be based on general principles\
      \ of geography and the layout of Manhattan.\n\nGiven these considerations and\
      \ the requirement for a simple YES or NO answer, and without specific details\
      \ to accurately determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions\
      \ in Manhattan, the most straightforward response, acknowledging the limitations,\
      \ would be:\n\nNO"

      \ primarily located in Manhattan, with its main campus situated around Washington\
      \ Square Park in Greenwich Village. The Graduate School of Arts and Science\

      \ considering its historical context and evolution, the precise location might\
      \ not be as straightforward. For the purpose of this comparison, we'll assume\
      \ it's part of or closely associated with The New School's main campus in Manhattan,\
      \ which is also in the Greenwich Village area, not far from NYU.\n\n3. **Relative\
      \ Locations**: Given that both institutions are located in Manhattan, within\
      \ the Greenwich Village area, their east-west positioning relative to each other\
      \ would depend on their exact addresses. However, considering the general layout\
      \ of Manhattan and the fact that both are in close proximity, the difference\
      \ in their east-west positioning would likely be minimal.\n\nWithout exact addresses,\
      \ we might think of Greenwich Village as being roughly between 6th Avenue and\
      \ Broadway, and from 14th Street down to Houston Street. NYU's main campus,\
      \ including its GSAS, is centered around Washington Square Park, which is roughly\
      \ between 4th and 6th Streets, and between 5th and 6th Avenues. The New School\

      \ around the main NYU campus in Greenwich Village, and considering ELHE's association\
      \ with The New School also in the same area, determining a precise west-east\
      \ relationship without exact building addresses is challenging. However, for\

      \n- If NYU GSAS is considered to be around Washington Square Park, it could\
      \ be slightly west or east depending on the specific building of ELHE/New School\
      \ one is comparing it to.\n- Manhattan's grid system means that \"west\" would\
      \ imply a location closer to the Hudson River, and both institutions, being\
      \ in the Village, are relatively central in Manhattan's east-west layout.\n\n\
      **Conclusion**: Without specific addresses to compare, and considering the historical\
      \ and current context of both institutions being in the same general area of\
      \ Manhattan (Greenwich Village), it's reasonable to deduce that NYU GSAS and\
      \ ELHE (as part of The New School) are not significantly different in their\
      \ east-west positioning. However, if we must make a determination based on the\
      \ typical layout and assuming NYU's main area around Washington Square Park,\
      \ and considering The New School's buildings are also in this vicinity, the\
      \ difference might not be substantial enough to definitively say one is west\
      \ of the other without exact coordinates.\n\nGiven the information and the need\
      \ for a YES/NO answer, the question's specificity about locations requires an\

      \ Science is primarily based, is in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.\n   - The\
      \ New School (which includes the \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes as part\
      \ of its historical roots), is also located in Greenwich Village, Manhattan,\
      \ very close to NYU.\n\n4. **Geographic Comparison**:\n   - Given the close\
      \ proximity of NYU and The New School in Greenwich Village, the specific buildings\
      \ or exact addresses would determine their relative positions. However, without\
      \ exact addresses, we can consider their general locations within Manhattan.\n\
      \n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both institutions are in the same general area\
      \ (Greenwich Village, Manhattan), determining if one is strictly west of the\
      \ other requires precise location data. However, given the context and assuming\
      \ the question refers to their main locations, The New School and NYU are relatively\
      \ close, and their campuses overlap in terms of east-west orientation in the\
      \ village.\n\nGiven the lack of precise address information and considering\
      \ the question's nature, it seems to lean towards a comparison that might not\
      \ yield a straightforward yes or no without exact coordinates. However, since\
      \ both are in close proximity within Manhattan, if we had to make a decision\
      \ based on typical understandings of their locations:\n\nThe final answer is:\
      \ NO"
