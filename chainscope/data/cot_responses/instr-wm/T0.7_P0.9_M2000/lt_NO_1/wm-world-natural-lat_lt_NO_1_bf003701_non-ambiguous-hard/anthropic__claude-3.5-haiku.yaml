      1. First, Lake Omodeo is located in Italy, specifically on the island of Sardinia.


      2. Sardinia is in the Mediterranean Sea, west of the Italian mainland.


      3. The Bali Strait is located between the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali.


      4. These locations are very far apart - Lake Omodeo is in Europe, while the
      Bali Strait is in Southeast Asia.


      5. Since the locations are in completely different parts of the world, we need
      to determine their relative positions.


      6. Looking at a world map, Lake Omodeo is north of the Bali Strait, not south.

      - Inks Lake is located in Texas, United States

      - It is situated in the central part of Texas


      3. Compare their geographical locations:

      - Coast Mountains are in western Canada

      - Inks Lake is in central Texas

      - These locations are very far apart, in different countries and regions


      4. Determine the relative north-south positioning:

    cad99089-3063-4207-ba78-3bc34cc63a72: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to identify the locations of Lake Jasybay and Vembanad.


      2. Vembanad is a well-known lake located in Kerala, India.


      3. I do not have definitive information about the precise location of Lake Jasybay.


      4. Without being certain of Lake Jasybay''s specific geographic coordinates,
      I cannot confidently state whether it is north or south of Vembanad.


      5. When I lack certainty about a geographic fact, the responsible approach is
      to admit that I do not know.
