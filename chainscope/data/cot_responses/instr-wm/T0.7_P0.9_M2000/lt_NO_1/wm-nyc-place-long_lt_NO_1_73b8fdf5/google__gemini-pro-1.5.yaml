      Blvd, Jamaica, NY.  (Other locations exist but are further away, making them
      less likely to be the intended target of comparison in the question.)


      Since both are on Merrick Blvd, the lower street number (132-07) is west of
      the higher street number (137-01). Therefore, CHURCH OF PENTECOST MERRICK BLVD
      is east of LAUGH & LEARN ACADEMY.

      Now, using a search engine:


      Church of Pentecost, Merrick Blvd, Queens is located at 144-16 Merrick Blvd,
      Jamaica, NY 11434.


      Laugh & Learn Academy, Queens appears to have multiple locations.  I''ll need

      the question refers to the Rosedale location at 241-10 Merrick Blvd, Rosedale,
      NY 11422 (the most commonly listed), this location is further east along Merrick
      Blvd.


      Since 144-16 comes before 241-10 on Merrick Blvd, and Merrick Blvd runs roughly
      east-west, the Church of Pentecost is west of Laugh & Learn Academy.

      2. **Compare their longitude:** Once I have their locations, I need to focus
      on their East-West positions, which is determined by longitude.  A location
      further west will have a lower longitude value.


      3. **Determine West/East:** If PS 49 Willis Ave has a lower longitude than Sedgwick
      Houses Building 5, it is west of it.


      Using a mapping tool, I find:


      * PS 49 Willis Ave is at approximately -73.921 longitude.

      * Sedgwick Houses Building 5 is at approximately -73.916 longitude.


      Since -73.921 is less than -73.916, PS 49 Willis Ave is west of Sedgwick Houses
      Building 5.

      CARE SERVICES in Brooklyn.

      2. **Compare their longitudes:**  West corresponds to a smaller longitude value.
      So I need to find the longitude of each location and compare them.  If the longitude
      of BFFY PETE MCGUINESS SENIOR CTR is smaller than the longitude of BROOKLYN
      COLLEGE CHILD CARE SERVICES, then it is west.

      3. **West implies direction:** The question asks if the Bronx location is *west*
      of the Queens location.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since Queens is generally east of the Bronx, a location in
      the Bronx is highly unlikely to be west of a location in Queens.

      3. **Specific location nuance:** While most of the Bronx is west of Queens,  a
      small part of the Bronx extends slightly east of a small portion of Queens.  We
      need to consider this.  The gas station''s location being near LaGuardia Airport
      (LGA) suggests it''s in western Queens.

      is in western Queens, it is highly probable the school is west of the gas station.

      2. **General NYC geography:** The Bronx is generally north of and west of Queens.  Specifically,
      traveling from Queens to the Bronx usually involves heading north and west.


      3. **Specific location nuance:** While the Bronx is generally west of Queens,
      the phrase "Grand Central Parkway WB" indicates westbound travel.  This means
      the gas station is on the westbound side of the Grand Central Parkway, likely
      close to the western edge of Queens, potentially near the border with the Bronx.


      4. **Proximity doesn''t change borough:** Even if the gas station is close to
      the Bronx border, it''s still *in* Queens.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since the Bronx is generally west of Queens, the Rainbow
      School for Child Development is likely west of the gas station, even if the
      gas station is on the western edge of Queens.

      2. **General NYC Geography:**  Queens is generally east of the Bronx.  Traveling
      from the Bronx to Queens typically involves going east.


      3. **Specific Location Nuance (LGA):**  While Queens is generally east of the
      Bronx, LaGuardia Airport (LGA) is situated on the western edge of Queens, very
      close to the Bronx.  This makes the question trickier.


      4. **Westbound (WB) Implication:** The "WB" after the gas station name indicates
      "Westbound," meaning the gas station serves traffic heading west. This suggests
      it''s likely on a road on the western edge of Queens, possibly near the Bronx
      border.


      5. **Conclusion:** Given LGA''s location and the westbound indicator, it''s
      plausible that the gas station is very close to or even slightly west of the
      Bronx border.

      3. **Specific location nuance:** While most of the Bronx is west of Queens,  "Grand
      Central Parkway WB NR LGA" suggests this gas station is very close to LaGuardia
      Airport. LaGuardia is on the western edge of Queens, very close to the Bronx.

      location data.  It''s *possible* the school is west of the gas station, but
      not certain.  Therefore, I cannot give a YES or NO answer with confidence.

      need to determine the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of both
      Brilla Charter School Pax and Marble Hill Houses Building 5.


      2. **Compare the longitudes:**  Longitude determines east/west position.  A
      location further west will have a *smaller* longitude value.


      3. **Determine the answer:** If the longitude of Brilla Charter School Pax is
      smaller than the longitude of Marble Hill Houses Building 5, the answer is YES.
      Otherwise, the answer is NO.


      Using a mapping tool, I find the following approximate locations:

      * **MARBLE HILL HOUSES BUILDING 5:** -73.9097, 40.8773


      Since -73.9288 is smaller than -73.9097, Brilla Charter School Pax is west of
      Marble Hill Houses Building 5.

      3. **Determine relative positions:** Manhattan Beach is on the southern coast
      of Brooklyn, while Bedford-Stuyvesant is more inland and north.  Therefore,
      Kingsborough is generally southeast of Macon Library. "West" would imply Kingsborough
      is to the left of Macon Library.

      Using a map (e.g., Google Maps), I can find that Kingsborough Community College
      is in Manhattan Beach, a neighborhood on the southern shore of Brooklyn, while
      Macon Library is in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a more central Brooklyn neighborhood.  Manhattan
      Beach is significantly west of Bedford-Stuyvesant.

      the geographic locations of Kingsboro Community College Physical Education building
      and Macon Library in Brooklyn.

      2. **Compare longitude:**  Once I have their locations, I need to specifically
      compare their longitudinal coordinates (east-west position).  The location further
      west will have a *lower* longitude value.

      3. **Determine west/east:** If Kingsboro CC Physical Education has a lower longitude
      than Macon Library, it is west of the library.


      Using a mapping tool (like Google Maps or similar):


      Kingsboro CC Physical Education is at approximately -73.935 (longitude)

      Macon Library is at approximately -73.923 (longitude)


      Since -73.935 is *less than* -73.923, Kingsboro CC Physical Education is west
      of Macon Library.

      2. **Consider relative positions:**  A guard shack is typically located at the

      be to the west of the more internal structures like a garage.

      * Facing History School''s address is 51 W 16th Street, New York, NY 10011.


      35th Street is further north than 16th Street.  West 35th Street is further
      west than West 16th street.  Streets run parallel North/South, so the larger
      house number on an avenue indicates a location further East (or West if the
      address is West of 5th Avenue, which these are).


      Therefore, The Andrews Homeless Shelter on West 35th street is west of Facing
      History School on West 16th street.

      Pier 107 is also on the West Side but far uptown.


      4. **Compare West Side locations:**  Lincoln Square is generally considered
      to be in the mid-60s/70s streets area of Manhattan''s West Side. Pier 107 is
      much further north. Anything on the same side of Manhattan further downtown
      (like Lincoln Square) will be south of a more uptown location (like Pier 107.)  On
      a map, south corresponds to being geographically further *east* along the angled
      shoreline of Manhattan Island.

      HOUSES BUILDING 7 and SMITH HOUSES BUILDING 6.  These are likely part of a larger
      complex.

      2. **Assume logical numbering:** Building numbers within a complex typically
      follow a logical order, either ascending or sometimes following a pattern related
      to their physical layout.

      3. **Consider the question:** "Is Building 7 *west* of Building 6?" This implies
      a directional relationship.  If building numbers increase from east to west,
      then 7 being greater than 6 would indicate it''s further west.

      4. **No information contradicts the likely numbering system:**  We have no information
      suggesting an unusual numbering system.


      Therefore, it''s highly probable that building 7 is west of building 6.

      as you move eastward or westward within a complex.

      3. **Assumption:**  Assuming building numbers in the Smith Houses increase from
      west to east, a higher building number would be further east.

      2. **Building Numbering Logic:**  Building numbers in most developments follow
      a logical order.  Usually, ascending numbers correspond to a directional progression.


      3. **West/East Orientation:** Given that the Smith Houses are situated along
      a relatively north-south running street (FDR Drive), it''s likely the buildings
      increase numerically from west to east or vice-versa.

      NY

      * **Academy for Personal Leadership and Excellence:** Located at 965 Olmstead

      the locations of St. Margaret''s Episcopal Church, Bronx, and the Academy for
      Personal Leadership and Excellence, Bronx.

      2. **Determine Longitude:** Once I have the locations, I need to compare their
      longitudinal coordinates.  Places further west have a lower longitude value.

      3. **Compare:** If St. Margaret''s has a lower longitude than the Academy for
      Personal Leadership and Excellence, then it is west of it.


      Using online search tools, I find:


      * **St. Margaret''s Episcopal Church, Bronx:** Located near the intersection
      of Cross Bronx Expressway and Lafayette Ave.

      * **Academy for Personal Leadership and Excellence, Bronx:** Located on Southern
      Blvd.


      Southern Boulevard is further east than the intersection of the Cross Bronx
      Expressway and Lafayette Avenue. Therefore, St. Margaret''s is west of the Academy.

      need to determine the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of St.
      Margaret''s Episcopal Church and the Academy for Personal Leadership and Excellence,
      both in the Bronx.


      2. **Compare the longitudes:**  Longitude measures east-west position.  A location
      further west will have a *lower* longitude value.


      3. **Determine west/east relationship:** If St. Margaret''s has a lower longitude
      than the Academy, then it is west of the Academy.


      Using online search engines, I find the approximate locations:


      * **St. Margaret''s Episcopal Church:**  Near the intersection of Crosby Ave
      and Olmstead Ave in the Soundview section of the Bronx.


      * **Academy for Personal Leadership and Excellence:** Near the intersection
      of Southern Blvd and E 172nd St in the Crotona Park East section of the Bronx.


      Crosby/Olmstead is considerably east of Southern Blvd/E 172nd St. Therefore,
      St. Margaret''s is *east* of the Academy.

      * St. Margaret''s Episcopal Church is at approximately -73.8925

      * Academy for Personal Leadership and Excellence is at approximately -73.9125


      Since -73.8925 is *greater* than -73.9125, St. Margaret''s is *east* of the

      Transverse Road and 66th Street, likely in Central Park.


      2. **Locate Ansche Chesed Synagogue:** Ansche Chesed Synagogue is located on
      West End Avenue in the 100s, specifically the Upper West Side.

    1e944692-fdfb-44bf-b662-459e24228f57: '1. **Identify the locations:**  We need
      to figure out where both places are. "ANSCHE CHESED SYNAGOGUE" is a known synagogue
      in Manhattan. "TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66" is obfuscated, but likely refers
      to a Transverse road west of a Police Path, opposite (OPP) 66th street.  Transverse
      roads in Manhattan are typically numbered, and run East-West.


      2. **Decipher the second location:** Given the Manhattan context, "TRNVS 1WB"
      almost certainly means Transverse Road 1 West Bound.  "OV PD PTH" likely means
      "over the police path", suggesting a bridge or overpass. "OPP 66" means opposite
      66th Street.  Putting it together, the second location is at or near the intersection
      of Transverse Road 1 and a path/road crossing over a police path, around 66th
      street.  Transverse Road 1 runs through Central Park.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Ansche Chesed Synagogue is on West End
      Avenue in the 100s (specifically the Upper West Side).  Central Park''s Transverse
      roads are much further south, in the 60s and 70s.  Therefore, the synagogue
      is north of the second location.


      4. **West/East consideration:**  The question asks if the synagogue is *west*
      of the second location. Although the synagogue is further north, the Upper West
      Side is also geographically west of Central Park.

      2. **Identify Pedro Path:** There doesn''t appear to be a "Pedro Path" in Manhattan.
      This is likely a further obfuscation or a mistake.  However, the "OPP 66" combined
      with "Transverse" suggests Transverse Road, and the only numbered transverse
      roads near a place name that sounds like "Pedro" are near Peter Cooper Road.  Transverse
      Road 1 West of Peter Cooper Road would be in the vicinity of Stuyvesant Town/Peter
      Cooper Village.

      2. **Locate Ansche Chesed Synagogue:** Ansche Chesed Synagogue is in Manhattan,

      the second location is inside and further south.  West 100th street is west

      north.

      2. **Identify the specific location in Central Park:** Transverse roads in Central
      Park are numbered from south to north.  Transverse 1 is the southernmost transverse
      road. "West of the pedestrian path opposite 66" suggests a location on the west

      This looks like a cryptic way of writing "TRANSVERSE 1W OF PED PATH OPP 66".  "Ped
      Path" likely refers to a pedestrian path, and "Opp 66" likely means opposite

      This looks like a deliberately obfuscated address.  "OPP 66" likely means "opposite
      66" referring to a street number. "TRNVS" likely refers to "TRANSVERSE" which
      are numbered streets across Central Park.  "1WB" likely means "1 West Bound"
      indicating the direction of traffic. "PD PTH" probably means "PARK DRIVE PATH".  So,
      this is likely somewhere on Transverse Road 1 near 66th street and the Park
      Drive path in Central Park. Transverse Road 1 West Bound is typically referred
      to as West 66th Street.
