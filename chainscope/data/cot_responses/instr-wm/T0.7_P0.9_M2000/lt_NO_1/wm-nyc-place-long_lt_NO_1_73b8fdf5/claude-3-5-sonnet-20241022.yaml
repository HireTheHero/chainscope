      2) Looking at NYC geography:

      - The Bronx is the northernmost borough

      - Queens is located to the east of Manhattan and the Bronx

      - The East River separates Queens from the Bronx


      3) Specifically:

      - Jamaica is located in southeastern Queens

      - Maritime College is located at the southeastern tip of the Bronx (Throgs Neck
      area)


      4) Therefore:

      - Jamaica Evening High School M would be southeast of Maritime College Reinhart
      Field

      is:

      - East of 1st Avenue

      - Around 20th Street


      3) Central Park Tots Playground would be:

      - Within Central Park

      - Between 5th and 8th Avenues


      4) Since Peter Cooper Village is east of 1st Avenue, and Central Park is between
      5th and 8th Avenues:

      - Peter Cooper Village is EAST of Central Park

      - Therefore it cannot be west of anything in Central Park

      1. Let me first locate both places:

      - HIGH SCHOOL FOR HEALTH CAREERS AND SCIENCES is in Washington Heights, Manhattan

      - YANKEE STADIUM is in the South Bronx


      2. Washington Heights is located along the western edge of Upper Manhattan,
      near the Hudson River.


      3. Yankee Stadium is located in the western part of the South Bronx, but not
      directly on the Hudson River.


      4. When comparing these two locations:

      - Washington Heights is further west, closer to the Hudson River

      - Yankee Stadium is more towards the center/west of the Bronx, but east of Washington
      Heights


      Therefore: YES, HIGH SCHOOL FOR HEALTH CAREERS AND SCIENCES is located west
      of YANKEE STADIUM.'

      2) Basic NYC geography:

      - The Bronx is the northernmost borough

      - Brooklyn is located in the southern part of NYC

      - When looking at a map, Brooklyn is east of Manhattan and south of the Bronx


      3) Considering east-west positioning:

      - Brooklyn and the Bronx are roughly aligned on an east-west axis

      - Both boroughs are on the east side of Manhattan

      - Neither is significantly more east or west than the other


      4) Therefore, since both locations are on the eastern side of NYC and are roughly
      aligned east-west, FDNY RAC UNIT 2 in Brooklyn would not be west of LIBERTAD

      2. Next, let me locate BRAVO VOLUNTEER AMBULANCE SERVICE:

      - Bravo Volunteer Ambulance is located in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn

      - It''s around 2285 65th Street


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Bay Ridge is located in southwest Brooklyn

      - Bensonhurst is located in south-central Brooklyn

      - Bay Ridge is west of Bensonhurst


      4. Therefore, since Alpine Cinemas is in Bay Ridge (western) and Bravo Ambulance
      is in Bensonhurst (more eastern), Alpine Cinemas is indeed west of Bravo Ambulance.

      3) Comparing their positions:

      - 5th Avenue is closer to the New York Harbor/waterfront

      3) Even though Greenpoint is one of the westernmost neighborhoods of Brooklyn
      (being along the East River), any location in Manhattan would still be west
      of it because Manhattan is entirely west of Brooklyn, separated by the East
      River.


      4) Therefore, since Manhattan Country School is in Manhattan, it must be west
      of Greenpoint Reformed Church.
