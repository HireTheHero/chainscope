      Next, we compare the longitudinal coordinates of these two locations, as longitude
      determines the east-west positioning on the map. Without precise geographic
      coordinates, we can make a general assessment based on the street addresses:


      - Grove Street is in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn.

      - Bergen Street is in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.


      Bushwick (where Grove Street is located) is generally situated to the north
      and somewhat east of Crown Heights (where Bergen Street is located). However,
      in terms of specific east-west positioning, Bushwick is typically considered
      slightly more east compared to Crown Heights.

      the relative locations of Rangel Houses Building 4 and Bethel Church of Christ
      in Manhattan.


      1. **Identify the location of Rangel Houses Building 4**: The Rangel Houses,
      also known as the Rangel Houses or Rangel Houses Complex, is located in the
      Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. It is a public housing development managed
      by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA).


      2. **Identify the location of Bethel Church of Christ**: Bethel Church of Christ
      is also located in Harlem, Manhattan. The specific address or exact location
      within Harlem would be useful to determine its precise position.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: With the information that both locations
      are in Harlem, we would need to find their specific addresses or geographical
      coordinates to accurately determine their relative positions. Generally, Harlem
      is a fairly large neighborhood, so knowing street intersections or specific
      addresses is crucial.


      Without exact addresses or more precise geographical data for both Rangel Houses
      Building 4 and Bethel Church of Christ, it is difficult to determine which is
      west of the other. However, if we assume typical positioning based on general
      known locations, we can make an educated guess.


      Based on typical map layouts and the general east-west streets in Harlem, if
      Rangel Houses Building 4 is located on a street numbered lower than that of
      Bethel Church of Christ, it would be considered to be west, assuming we are
      following the general east-west orientation of the streets in Manhattan.


      However, without specific address data:

      - If Rangel Houses Building 4 is located on a street or avenue that runs parallel
      and to the west of Bethel Church of Christ, then it would be west of the church.


      For an accurate and definitive answer, specific addresses or map data would
      be necessary. Given the lack of specific location data provided:


      **NO**, we cannot definitively say Rangel Houses Building 4 is west of Bethel
      Church of Christ without more specific information.'

      follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Location of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1**: FDNY Rescue Collapse
      1 is located at 530 W 43rd St, New York, NY 10036. This is in the Hell''s Kitchen

      Community Center is located at 224 W 28th St, New York, NY 10001. This is in
      the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.


      3. **Compare the Longitudinal Positions**: Both addresses are on the west side
      of Manhattan, but we need to compare their street numbers to determine which
      is further west. The first part of the street address (the number before "W")
      indicates the position relative to the avenue grid. A higher number typically
      indicates a location further west.


      4. **Determine West-East Order**: Since 530 W 43rd St (FDNY Rescue Collapse
      1) has a higher street number than 224 W 28th St (Straus Houses Community Center),
      we can conclude that FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 is further west.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Both the GUARD SHACK and the GARAGE are part
      of Fort Wadsworth, which is located on the northeastern shore of Staten Island.

      - **5th Avenue** and **7th Avenue** are parallel streets in Brooklyn. In New

      1. **Lincolnton Post Office:** There is no post office by the name of "Lincolnton
      Post Office" in Manhattan. Assuming this is a reference to a location that might
      be near Lincoln Square or Lincoln Center, which are located on the Upper West
      Side of Manhattan.


      2. **Pier 107 CVII:** Pier 107 would typically refer to a pier along the Hudson

      Office in Manhattan is located west of Pier 107 CVII in Manhattan, we need to
      consider the locations of both places:


      1. **Identify the location of Lincolnton Post Office**: The Lincolnton Post
      Office is a specific post office facility in Manhattan. However, there is no
      widely recognized post office by this exact name in Manhattan. It might be a
      specific branch or have a different commonly used name.


      2. **Identify the location of Pier 107 CVII**: Piers in Manhattan are typically
      numbered along the Hudson River on the west side or along the East River on
      the east side. Pier 107 CVII would suggest a location along the East River,
      given the numbering and the presence of piers like Pier 107 in that area.


      3. **Determine relative positions**: If Pier 107 is indeed along the East River,
      then any location in Manhattan that is further west would be closer to the Hudson
      River side.


      Without precise, commonly known information about the Lincolnton Post Office,
      making a definitive determination is challenging. However, assuming the Lincolnton
      Post Office is a typical post office in Manhattan''s central or west side area

      the East River.
