      2. Brighton Beach is in the southeastern part of Brooklyn, near the ocean.


      3. Pratt Playground is located in Clinton Hill, which is in north-central Brooklyn.


      4. Hebrew Alliance (assuming this refers to a community center or synagogue)
      is likely located in the Brighton Beach area, which is in southern Brooklyn.


      5. Since Pratt Playground is north of Brighton Beach, and Hebrew Alliance is
      likely in or near Brighton Beach, this means Pratt Playground is west of the
      Hebrew Alliance location.


      6. The question is asking: Is Hebrew Alliance west of Pratt Playground?


      7. From the reasoning above, the answer is NO - Pratt Playground is actually

      - The Pakistan Consulate is located at 12 E 65th Street in Manhattan


      2. Next, I''ll understand the reference point: 14 Street/Canarsie Tube

      3. Compare the locations

      - The Pakistan Consulate at 12 E 65th Street is located in the Upper East Side

      - This location is much further north and east compared to 14 Street

      - 65th Street is well above (north of) 14 Street


      4. Determine west/east positioning

      - 12 E 65th Street is east of 5th Avenue

      - This means it is east of 14 Street, not west


      5. Answer the specific question: Is the Pakistan Consulate west of 14 Street?

      - No, it is east of 14 Street

      Step 2: Since JHS 227 is in Brooklyn and FIT is in Manhattan, and Brooklyn is
      east of Manhattan, the JHS 227 is located EAST of the FIT center.


      Step 3: The question asks if the JHS 227 is west of the FIT center. Since it
      is actually east, not west, the answer is:


      NO'

      orientation.


      3. I''ll mentally map out the Fort Wadsworth area and their potential locations.


      4. Without specific GPS coordinates, I''ll rely on typical spatial relationships
      at military sites.


      5. A "guard shack" is typically positioned near an entrance or access point,
      often at the perimeter or entrance of a facility.


      6. A "garage" would typically be located within the interior of a facility.


      7. In military installations, guard shacks are often strategically placed to
      control access, which could mean they might be positioned at the western or
      eastern edge of a facility.


      8. However, without definitive information about the exact layout of this specific
      Fort Wadsworth site, I cannot confidently state the precise relative positions.


      9. Given the lack of precise location information, I cannot definitively answer
      whether the Guard Shack is west of the Garage.


      Therefore, I cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer. More specific location
      information would be needed to determine this with certainty.'

      1. First, I''ll need to understand the location of Fort Wadsworth on Staten
      Island.


      2. Fort Wadsworth is located on the northeastern shore of Staten Island, near
      the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.


      3. Within this location, I need to determine the relative positions of the Guard
      Shack and the Garage.


      4. Without a precise map in front of me, I''ll need to rely on general spatial
      reasoning.


      5. Typically, a guard shack would be positioned near the entrance or perimeter
      of a facility, while a garage would be located inside or near the facility.


      6. In most military or guard facilities, the guard shack would be positioned
      at the entrance, which is often at the western or front side of the facility.


      7. Therefore, it''s most likely that the Guard Shack is located west of the
      Garage.


      Based on this reasoning:


      YES, the FT WADSWORTH GUARD SHACK, Staten Island is located west of FT WADSWORTH
      GARAGE, Staten Island.'

      5. However, if we were to strictly interpret the geographical relationship between
