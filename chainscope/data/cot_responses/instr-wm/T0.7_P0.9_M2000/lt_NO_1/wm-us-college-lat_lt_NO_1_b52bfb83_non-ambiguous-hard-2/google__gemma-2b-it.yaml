      The question is about the location of Mildred Elley, NY, relative to Widener
      University, DE. We are looking for information about the geographical position
      of Mildred Elley.


      **Step 1:** Find the coordinates of Widener University.


      According to the website, the latitude and longitude of Widener University are:


      * Latitude: 41.201206

      * Longitude: -74.883203


      **Step 2:** Find the coordinates of Mildred Elley, NY.


      According to the website, the coordinates of Mildred Elley are:


      * Latitude: 41.248388

      * Longitude: -74.034534


      **Step 3:** Determine the distance between the two locations.


      Using a distance measurement tool, we can calculate the distance between the
      two locations:


      * Distance = |41.201206 - 41.248388| = 0.047182

      * Distance = |-74.883203 - (-74.034534)| = 0.043669


      Therefore, the distance between Mildred Elley, NY, and Widener University, DE,
      is approximately 0.05 miles.


      Based on the calculated distance, it is clear that Mildred Elley, NY is located
