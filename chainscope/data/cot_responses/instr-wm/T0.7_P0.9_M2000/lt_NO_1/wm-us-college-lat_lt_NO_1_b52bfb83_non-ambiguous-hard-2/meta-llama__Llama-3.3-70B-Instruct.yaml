      OK is located south of Tarleton State University, TX, we need to consider the
      geographical locations of both universities.


      1. First, we need to identify the state locations: Oklahoma City University
      is in Oklahoma, and Tarleton State University is in Texas.

      2. Next, we consider the general geography of the United States. Oklahoma is
      located north of Texas.

      3. Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, any location in Oklahoma would generally
      be north of any location in Texas, assuming we''re comparing locations within
      the continental United States and not considering extreme western or eastern
      parts of these states that might slightly overlap in latitude due to their shapes.


      Given these steps, Oklahoma City University, being in Oklahoma, would be north
      of Tarleton State University in Texas. Therefore, it is not south of Tarleton
      State University.


      The answer is: NO'

      4. **Conclusion based on geographical positions**: Since Georgia Military College
      is in Georgia, which is south (and east) of Colorado, where Western Colorado
      University is located, we can conclude that Western Colorado University is not
      south of Georgia Military College. Instead, Georgia Military College is south
      of Western Colorado University.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Western Colorado University, CO located
      south of Georgia Military College, GA?" is: **NO**.'

      1. **California State University, Fresno (CA)**: This university is located
      in Fresno, California. Fresno is in the central valley of California, relatively
      in the middle of the state but slightly towards the south.


      2. **Northcentral University (AZ)**: This is an online university with its headquarters
      in San Diego, California, but it was initially based in Arizona. Given its original
      association with Arizona and for the sake of this comparison, considering it
      as being associated with the southern part of the United States, specifically
      the southwest, is crucial. However, the key detail here is that it''s now headquartered
      in San Diego, California, which is in the southern part of California.


      Given these locations:

      - Fresno, California (CSU, Fresno) is in central California.

      - San Diego, California (Northcentral University''s current headquarters) is
      in southern California.


      Since southern California (where Northcentral University is headquartered) is
      south of central California (where California State University, Fresno is located),
      we can conclude that California State University, Fresno is indeed located north

      down:


      1. **Identify the locations**: University of Northern Iowa is in Iowa, and William
      Jessup University is in California.

      2. **Understand the geography**: Iowa is a state located in the Midwestern United
      States, whereas California is on the West Coast.

      3. **Compare latitudes**: Generally, as you move south in the United States,
      the latitude decreases. Iowa has a higher latitude than California because it
      is situated more to the north.

      4. **Conclusion based on geography**: Since Iowa is more north than California,
      any institution in Iowa would typically be north of institutions in California,
      not south.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether the University of Northern Iowa,

      2. **Identify the location of Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX**:
      However, Texas Tech University does not have a campus in Fredericksburg, TX.
      Texas Tech University is primarily located in Lubbock, Texas, but it does have

      main or well-known satellite campuses. It''s possible there might be a confusion
      with another institution or a satellite campus of another university.


      3. **Determine the general geographical location of both**: Alabama, where Selma
      University is located, is generally southeast of Texas, where the main campus
      of Texas Tech University is located (in Lubbock). However, the specific mention
      of Fredericksburg, TX, introduces confusion because it''s not a known location
      for Texas Tech University. Fredericksburg is south of Lubbock but considering
      the context, we should focus on the general comparison between Alabama and Texas.


      4. **Compare their geographical positions**: Since Alabama is east and slightly
      southeast of Texas, and considering the northern part of Texas (where Lubbock

      \ at Fredericksburg, Texas, and then compare their geographical positions.\n\
      \n1. **Location of Selma University, AL**: Selma University is located in Selma,\
      \ Alabama. Alabama is a state in the southeastern United States.\n\n2. **Location\
      \ of Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX**: However, there seems to\
      \ be a mistake in the question. Texas Tech University is primarily located in\
      \ Lubbock, Texas, not Fredericksburg. Fredericksburg is a city in Texas, but\
      \ it is not the location of the main campus of Texas Tech University. For the\
      \ sake of this question, let's consider the intent might have been to compare\
      \ locations within Texas and Alabama, so we'll consider the general location\
      \ of Texas, as the specific point (Fredericksburg) doesn't directly relate to\
      \ Texas Tech's main campus.\n\n3. **Comparing Locations**: \n   - Alabama is\
      \ generally southeast of Texas. \n   - Fredericksburg, Texas, is in the central\
      \ part of the state, but when comparing any part of Alabama to any part of Texas,\
      \ Alabama is to the east and somewhat southeast of Texas.\n\nGiven this information,\
      \ we can conclude that Selma University in Alabama is indeed east and somewhat\
      \ southeast of Texas. Since \"south\" in a broad geographical sense can sometimes\
      \ be used to describe a direction that encompasses southeast, the question's\
      \ intent seems to be about general direction rather than precise cardinal direction.\n\
      \nTherefore, considering the broader interpretation of \"south\" as including\
      \ southeast, the answer would be YES, Selma University, AL, is located south\
      \ (or more precisely, southeast) of Texas, and by extension, would be south\
      \ of any location in Texas, including the intended comparison point. \n\nANSWER:\
      \ YES"
