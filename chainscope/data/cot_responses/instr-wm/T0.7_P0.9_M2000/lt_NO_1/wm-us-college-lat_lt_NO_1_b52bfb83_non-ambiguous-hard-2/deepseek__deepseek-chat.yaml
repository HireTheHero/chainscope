      \ of both institutions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify\
      \ the Locations\n\n**University of Wisconsin\u2013Marinette, WI:**\n- This is\
      \ a branch campus of the University of Wisconsin system located in Marinette,\
      \ Wisconsin.\n- Marinette is a city in the northeastern part of Wisconsin, near\

      \ Step 2: Understand the Geographical Positioning\n\nTo determine if one location\
      \ is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes. Generally, the further\
      \ south a location is, the lower its latitude.\n\n- **Marinette, WI:** Located\

      \ the Locations of Both Institutions\n\n**Averett University, VA:**\n- **Location:**\
      \ Danville, Virginia, USA.\n- **Coordinates:** Approximately 36.5859\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \n**\xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes, NY:**\n- **Location:** New York, New\
      \ York, USA.\n- **Coordinates:** Approximately 40.7128\xB0 N latitude.\n\n###\
      \ Step 2: Understand Latitude and Its Relation to North and South\n\nLatitude\
      \ measures how far north or south a location is from the equator. The higher\
      \ the latitude, the farther north a place is located.\n\n- **Northern Hemisphere:**\
      \ Higher latitude numbers indicate locations further north.\n- **Southern Hemisphere:**\
      \ Higher latitude numbers indicate locations further south.\n\nSince both New\
      \ York and Virginia are in the Northern Hemisphere, we can compare their latitudes\

      \ University, VA:** 36.5859\xB0 N\n- **\xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes,\
      \ NY:** 40.7128\xB0 N\n\n### Step 4: Determine Which Location is Further South\n\
      \nSince latitude increases as you move north, the location with the lower latitude\
      \ number is further south.\n\n- 36.5859\xB0 N (Averett University, VA) is **further\
