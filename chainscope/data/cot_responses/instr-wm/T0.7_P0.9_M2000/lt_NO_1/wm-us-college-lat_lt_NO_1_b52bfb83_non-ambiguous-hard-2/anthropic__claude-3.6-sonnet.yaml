      * After checking, I don''t believe there is a Texas Tech campus in Fredericksburg,

      * Texas Tech''s main campus is in Lubbock, TX


      2) Selma University is a real institution located in Selma, Alabama

      \ let me identify the locations:\n- Elizabeth City State University is in Elizabeth\
      \ City, North Carolina\n- Florida A&M University-FSU College of Engineering\
      \ is in Tallahassee, Florida\n\n2) To determine which is more south, I need\
      \ to compare their latitudes:\n- Elizabeth City, NC is at approximately 36.3\xB0\
      \ N latitude\n- Tallahassee, FL is at approximately 30.4\xB0 N latitude\n\n\
      3) The lower the latitude number in the Northern Hemisphere, the more south\
      \ a location is\n\n4) 30.4\xB0 N (Tallahassee) is less than 36.3\xB0 N (Elizabeth\
      \ City), meaning Tallahassee is more south\n\nTherefore, Elizabeth City State\
      \ University is NOT south of Florida A&M-FSU College of Engineering.\n\nAnswer:\
      \ NO"
