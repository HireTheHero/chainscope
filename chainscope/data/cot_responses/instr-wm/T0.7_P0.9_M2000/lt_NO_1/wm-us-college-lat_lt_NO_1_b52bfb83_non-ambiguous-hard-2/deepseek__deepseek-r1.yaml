      \ think it's in Columbus, the capital of Ohio. Then Claflin University is in\
      \ South Carolina, probably in a city like Orangeburg? I'm not entirely sure,\
      \ but I remember Orangeburg being associated with Claflin. \n\nNext, I need\
      \ to determine the latitudes of both cities because being south or north depends\
      \ on latitude. The lower the latitude, the further south a place is. Let me\
      \ recall: Columbus, Ohio's latitude. I think Ohio is in the Midwest, so its\
      \ latitude is somewhere around 40\xB0N. For example, Columbus, OH is approximately\
      \ 39.9612\xB0 N. \n\nClaflin University in Orangeburg, SC. South Carolina is\

      \ Comparison**: Lower latitude = further south.  \n3. **Conclusion**: Columbus,\

      \ Capital University in Ohio is located south of Claflin University in South\

      \ locations of both universities. Capital University is in Ohio. I think it's\
      \ in Columbus, the state capital, which makes sense given the name. Claflin\
      \ University is in South Carolina. I'm not exactly sure where in SC, but maybe\
      \ Orangeburg? I remember hearing that name in relation to some colleges there.\n\
      \nNext step is to find the latitude of each city. Since the question is about\
      \ being south, latitude is key. The further south (lower latitude) a place is,\
      \ the more southern it is. So if Capital University's city has a lower latitude\
      \ than Claflin's, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nLet me confirm the\
      \ cities. Capital University: Columbus, OH. Claflin University: Orangeburg,\
      \ SC. Now, checking the latitudes. Columbus, Ohio's latitude is approximately\
      \ 39.9612\xB0 N. Orangeburg, SC's latitude is around 33.4968\xB0 N. Wait, 33\
      \ is south of 39, right? So that would mean Claflin University is actually further\
      \ south than Capital University. Therefore, Capital University is north of Claflin,\
      \ not south. \n\nSo the answer should be NO, Capital University, OH is not south\
      \ of Claflin University, SC. Instead, it's the other way around. I think that's\
      \ correct, but let me double-check the coordinates to be sure. Yes, Columbus,\

    275e6cbd-05b2-4e71-aba2-94973fd767f0: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if Capital University in Ohio is located south of Claflin\
      \ University in South Carolina. Hmm, at first glance, that seems a bit counterintuitive\
      \ because South Carolina is generally further south than Ohio. But let me not\
      \ jump to conclusions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the exact locations of\
      \ both universities. Let's start with Capital University. I know that Capital\
      \ University is in Ohio, but where exactly? I think it's in Columbus, the state\
      \ capital. That makes sense because the name \"Capital\" might be a hint. So,\
      \ Columbus, Ohio. Now, what's the latitude of Columbus? I remember that Columbus\
      \ is around 40\xB0N latitude. Let me confirm that. Yeah, Columbus, OH is approximately\
      \ 39.9612\xB0 N, 83.0007\xB0 W.\n\nNext, Claflin University in South Carolina.\
      \ I'm less familiar with its location. Claflin is a historically black university,\
      \ right? I think it's in Orangeburg, South Carolina. Let me check that. Yes,\
      \ Claflin University is located in Orangeburg, SC. Now, what's the latitude\
      \ of Orangeburg? Orangeburg is in the central part of South Carolina. The coordinates\
      \ for Orangeburg are approximately 33.4968\xB0 N, 80.8623\xB0 W. \n\nSo, comparing\
      \ the two latitudes: Columbus, OH is at about 39.96\xB0 N, and Orangeburg, SC\
      \ is around 33.50\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a lower latitude\
      \ means a more southern location. Therefore, Orangeburg, SC (Claflin) is at\
      \ a lower latitude (33.5\xB0 N) compared to Columbus, OH (39.96\xB0 N). That\
      \ means Claflin University is actually further south than Capital University.\
      \ \n\nWait, but the question is asking if Capital University is south of Claflin.\
      \ So, since 33.5\xB0 N is south of 39.96\xB0 N, Capital University in Ohio is\
      \ actually north of Claflin in South Carolina. Therefore, the answer should\
      \ be NO. \n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the coordinates.\
      \ Maybe I confused longitude with latitude? No, the latitude is the north-south\
      \ measurement. So yes, 33.5 is south of 39.96. So Capital University is north,\
      \ not south. Therefore, the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nCapital University\
      \ in Columbus, OH (latitude ~39.96\xB0 N) is located **north** of Claflin University\

      \ step by step. The user wants to know if Ohio Dominican University in Ohio\
      \ is located south of the Whitacre College of Engineering in Texas. Hmm, that's\
      \ interesting because it involves comparing the latitudes of two different states.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the locations of both institutions. Let's\
      \ start with Ohio Dominican University. I know it's in Ohio, but where exactly?\
      \ I think it's in Columbus, the state capital. To confirm, maybe a quick mental\
      \ check: major universities in Ohio include Ohio State in Columbus, but Ohio\
      \ Dominican is a smaller private university. Yes, I believe it's in Columbus,\
      \ Ohio.\n\nNext, the Whitacre College of Engineering. That's part of Texas Tech\
      \ University, right? Texas Tech is in Lubbock, Texas. So the engineering college\
      \ would be there as well. So now I need to compare the latitudes of Columbus,\
      \ Ohio, and Lubbock, Texas.\n\nLatitude is the key here. The further south a\
      \ location is, the lower its latitude (since latitude decreases as you go south\
      \ towards the equator). So if Columbus, OH has a higher latitude than Lubbock,\
      \ TX, then Ohio Dominican would be north of the engineering college, and vice\
      \ versa.\n\nNow, what are the approximate latitudes of these cities? From memory,\
      \ Columbus, Ohio is around 40\xB0N. Let me verify: major cities in Ohio like\
      \ Cleveland are around 41.5\xB0N, Columbus a bit further south. Maybe 40\xB0\
      N is correct. For Lubbock, Texas, which is in the northern part of Texas, but\
      \ Texas itself is a southern state. Lubbock's latitude is about 33.5\xB0N. So\
      \ 33.5\xB0N would be south of 40\xB0N. \n\nTherefore, Columbus, OH at ~40\xB0\
      N is north of Lubbock, TX at ~33.5\xB0N. Since Ohio Dominican is in Columbus,\
      \ OH, and the engineering college is in Lubbock, TX, then Ohio Dominican is\
      \ actually north of the Whitacre College of Engineering. Therefore, the answer\
      \ would be NO, it's not south.\n</think>To determine if Ohio Dominican University\
      \ (OH) is south of Whitacre College of Engineering (TX):  \n1. **Locations**:\
      \  \n   - Ohio Dominican University is in **Columbus, Ohio**.  \n   - Whitacre\
      \ College of Engineering is part of Texas Tech University in **Lubbock, Texas**.\

      N (Lubbock) < 40\xB0N (Columbus), **Lubbock is south of Columbus**.  \n\n**Answer**:\
      \ NO. Ohio Dominican University, OH, is **north** of Whitacre College of Engineering,\

      \ Georgia is a state in the southeastern U.S., and Marietta is a suburb of Atlanta.\
      \ So it's in the northern part of Georgia, near Atlanta.\n\nNow, Texas A&M University\u2013\

      San Antonio is at a lower latitude (more south) than SPSU in Marietta. \n\n\
      Wait, but the question is asking if SPSU is south of Texas A&M\u2013San Antonio.\
      \ Since San Antonio is at 29.4\xB0N and Marietta is at 33.7\xB0N, Marietta is\

      \ latitude is about 43.66\xB0 N. So Portland, ME is at a higher latitude (more\
      \ north) than Arcata, CA. Therefore, since IDSVA is in Maine which is further\
      \ north, Cal Poly Humboldt would be south of IDSVA. So the question is asking\
      \ if IDSVA (ME) is south of Cal Poly Humboldt (CA). But since Maine's latitude\
      \ is higher (more north), that would mean IDSVA is actually north of Cal Poly\

      \ State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. That's in California, right? Humboldt\
      \ County is in the northern part of California, near the Oregon border. The\
      \ university was recently renamed; it used to be called Humboldt State University.\
      \ So its location is in Arcata, CA, which is in Humboldt County. \n\nNext, I\
      \ need to compare their latitudes to see which is further south. Since the question\

      \ south a place is, the lower its latitude. \n\nPortland, Maine's latitude is\
      \ approximately 43.6591\xB0 N. Arcata, California's latitude is around 40.8665\xB0\
      \ N. Wait, 40.8665 is actually a lower latitude than 43.6591. That means Arcata,\
      \ CA (Cal Poly Humboldt) is further south than Portland, ME. Therefore, the\
      \ Institute in Maine is actually north of Cal Poly Humboldt. \n\nSo the answer\
      \ should be NO, because Maine is north of California's Humboldt County. But\
      \ wait, let me double-check the latitudes to be sure. Maybe I mixed up the numbers.\
      \ \n\nLooking again: Portland, ME is at about 43.66\xB0 N. Arcata, CA is around\
      \ 40.87\xB0 N. Yes, 40 is less than 43, so Arcata is further south. Therefore,\

      \  \nThe Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts (IDSVA) is in Portland,\
      \ Maine (~43.66\xB0 N), while California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt,\

      \ Heights is a suburb south of Minneapolis, so perhaps a bit south of that.\
      \ Let's say around 44.88\xB0 N. \n\nWait, that would mean Mendota Heights, MN\
      \ is around 44.88\xB0 N, and Ellensburg, WA is 46.996\xB0 N. If that's the case,\
      \ then Central Washington University (46.996\xB0 N) is actually north of Brown\
      \ College's location (44.88\xB0 N). So the answer would be NO, because 46.996\
      \ is higher than 44.88, meaning Ellensburg is north, not south.\n\nBut wait,\
      \ maybe I mixed up the locations. Let me double-check. Minneapolis is at about\
      \ 44.9778\xB0 N. If Mendota Heights is a southern suburb, maybe it's around\
      \ 44.85\xB0 N. Ellensburg, WA is definitely around 47\xB0 N. So 47\xB0 N vs\

    cd9c8e51-3bb8-4a9c-b496-630f84ff15a2: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ asking whether Central Washington University in Washington State is located\
      \ south of Brown College in Minnesota. I need to figure out the answer step\
      \ by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably confirm the locations of both institutions.\
      \ Let me start with Central Washington University (CWU). I know that Washington\
      \ State is in the Pacific Northwest. CWU's main campus is in Ellensburg, Washington.\
      \ I remember that Ellensburg is somewhere in the central part of the state.\
      \ To get more precise, maybe I can think about its coordinates or compare it\
      \ to other cities. For example, Seattle is in the west of Washington, and Spokane\
      \ is in the east. Ellensburg is between them, so central. Now, latitude-wise,\
      \ what's the approximate latitude of Ellensburg? Maybe around 47 degrees north?\
      \ Because Seattle is around 47.6\xB0N, and Spokane is about 47.66\xB0N. Ellensburg\
      \ is in between, so maybe similar, maybe a bit lower. Let's say roughly 47\xB0\
      N.\n\nNext, Brown College in Minnesota. Wait, there's a Brown College in Minnesota?\
      \ I should check which city. I'm not as familiar with Minnesota colleges. Wait,\
      \ Brown College might refer to a technical or community college. Let me think.\
      \ There was a Brown College in Mendota Heights, Minnesota, but I think it closed.\
      \ Alternatively, maybe it's another institution. Alternatively, maybe the user\
      \ means Brown University, but that's in Rhode Island, which is definitely not\
      \ in Minnesota. Wait, the question specifies Brown College, MN, so it must be\
      \ in Minnesota. Let me try to verify. A quick search in my mind: Brown College\
      \ was a private college in Minnesota that offered programs in design and media.\
      \ It was part of the Minnesota School of Business, which had campuses in Mendota\
      \ Heights and Brooklyn Center. However, I believe Brown College closed around\
      \ 2017. But regardless, for the purpose of location, if it's in Mendota Heights,\
      \ MN, then where is that? Mendota Heights is a suburb south of Saint Paul, Minnesota.\
      \ The coordinates for Mendota Heights are approximately 44.88\xB0N latitude.\
      \ So that's around 44.88\xB0N.\n\nNow, comparing the two latitudes. Central\
      \ Washington University in Ellensburg, WA is around 47\xB0N, and Brown College\
      \ in Mendota Heights, MN is around 44.88\xB0N. Latitude lines run east-west,\
      \ so a higher latitude number means further north. So 47\xB0N is north of 44.88\xB0\
      N. Therefore, Ellensburg (CWU) is north of Mendota Heights (Brown College).\
      \ Therefore, Central Washington University is not south of Brown College; it's\
      \ actually north. Therefore, the answer should be NO.\n\nWait, but wait a second.\
      \ Let me double-check the exact coordinates to be sure. Ellensburg, WA: Checking\
      \ the exact latitude. Ellensburg's coordinates are approximately 46.997\xB0\
      N, 120.547\xB0W. So that's about 47\xB0N. Mendota Heights, MN: 44.88\xB0N, 93.14\xB0\
      W. So yes, 47\xB0N vs. 44.88\xB0N. 47 is higher than 44.88, meaning CWU is further\
      \ north. Therefore, no, CWU is not south of Brown College. The answer is NO.\n\
      </think>NO  \nCentral Washington University (located in Ellensburg, WA, at approximately\
      \ 47\xB0N latitude) is north of Brown College (formerly in Mendota Heights,\
      \ MN, at approximately 44.88\xB0N latitude). Since higher latitude indicates\
      \ a more northerly position, the answer is NO."
    e29e3844-4bae-4769-b701-4798c04518d7: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Central Washington University in Washington State is located south of Brown\
      \ College in Minnesota. Let me start by recalling where these places are.\n\n\
      First, Central Washington University (CWU) is in Washington. I think it's in\
      \ Ellensburg, WA. Let me confirm that. Yeah, a quick check in my memory tells\
      \ me that CWU's main campus is indeed in Ellensburg. Now, where is Ellensburg\
      \ located within Washington? Washington State is in the Pacific Northwest, and\
      \ Ellensburg is in the central part of the state, east of the Cascade Mountains.\
      \ I remember that the city is about halfway between Seattle and Spokane, but\
      \ more to the east. \n\nNow, I need to find the latitude of Ellensburg, WA.\
      \ Latitude is the north-south position. The higher the latitude, the farther\
      \ north a place is. Let me think, Seattle is around 47.6\xB0 N. Since Ellensburg\
      \ is east but still in the central part, maybe similar latitude? Maybe around\
      \ 47\xB0 N? Wait, I might be mixing up cities. Let me try to recall. Alternatively,\
      \ I can think of major cities. For example, Spokane, WA is around 47.65\xB0\
      \ N. Ellensburg is south of Spokane, right? Because if you drive from Seattle\
      \ to Spokane, you go east, but Ellensburg is south of that? Hmm, maybe I should\
      \ check approximate coordinates. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps\
      \ looking up approximate latitude: a quick search in my mind\u2014Ellensburg,\
      \ WA is approximately 46.997\xB0 N latitude. Let's say roughly 47\xB0 N.\n\n\
      Now, Brown College. Wait, there are a few colleges named Brown. But the question\
      \ specifies Brown College, MN, so Minnesota. Let me confirm which Brown College\
      \ in Minnesota. I think Brown College was a for-profit college in Minnesota,\
      \ but it closed around 2017. Its campuses were in Mendota Heights and Brooklyn\
      \ Center, MN. But since it's a college in Minnesota, I need to find its location.\
      \ Let's take Mendota Heights as the location. Mendota Heights is a suburb of\
      \ Saint Paul, so in the Twin Cities area. The latitude of Mendota Heights, MN\
      \ is approximately 44.883\xB0 N. Wait, that's lower than 47\xB0? Wait, no. Wait,\
      \ wait\u2014Minnesota is north of Washington State? Wait, no. Wait, Washington\
      \ State is further north than Minnesota? No, wait, Minnesota is in the upper\
      \ Midwest, while Washington is in the Northwest. But let me think about latitudes.\
      \ For example, the northernmost part of Minnesota is at about 49\xB0 N (since\
      \ the 49th parallel is the US-Canada border), but most of Minnesota is around\
      \ 45\xB0 to 49\xB0 N. The Twin Cities (Minneapolis-Saint Paul) are around 44.95\xB0\
      \ N to 45\xB0 N. So Mendota Heights is around 44.88\xB0 N. Wait, that seems\
      \ lower. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think:\
      \ The 45th parallel is the halfway between the equator and the North Pole. So\
      \ Minneapolis is around 44.98\xB0 N, according to some sources. So Mendota Heights,\
      \ MN is around 44.85\xB0 N. \n\nWait, but Central Washington University is in\
      \ Ellensburg at about 47\xB0 N. So 47\xB0 N is higher latitude than 44.85\xB0\
      \ N. That means Ellensburg is further north than Mendota Heights. Therefore,\
      \ CWU would be north of Brown College in MN. Therefore, the answer would be\
      \ NO, because being south would require a lower latitude. Wait, but wait\u2014\
      I need to confirm the exact coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I got the latitudes\
      \ reversed. Let me double-check. Let's take specific coordinates. \n\nCentral\
      \ Washington University, Ellensburg, WA: Latitude approximately 46.997\xB0 N\
      \ (as per my earlier thought). Brown College in Mendota Heights, MN: Latitude\
      \ 44.8486\xB0 N. Wait, if Ellensburg is at ~47\xB0 N and Mendota Heights at\
      \ ~44.85\xB0 N, then Ellensburg is north of Mendota Heights. Therefore, CWU\
      \ is north of Brown College, MN, so the answer is NO.\n\nBut wait, is Brown\
      \ College in MN located in a different city with a higher latitude? The user\
      \ mentioned Brown College, MN. Let me confirm other possible locations. If there's\
      \ a Brown College in another city in Minnesota, maybe further north? For example,\
      \ if it were in Duluth, MN, which is at about 46.78\xB0 N. But Duluth is in\
      \ northern Minnesota. If Brown College were there, then 46.78\xB0 N compared\
      \ to Ellensburg's ~47\xB0 N, so CWU would be slightly north. But if the college\
      \ is in the Twin Cities area (around 44.9\xB0 N), then CWU is north.\n\nWait,\
      \ but perhaps the user is referring to a different Brown College. Wait, but\
      \ in Minnesota, the main Brown College that comes up in searches is the one\
      \ in Mendota Heights, which closed. So assuming that's the one, then the latitude\
      \ is lower (south) compared to Ellensburg. Therefore, Ellensburg, WA (47\xB0\
      \ N) is north of Mendota Heights, MN (44.85\xB0 N), so CWU is not south of Brown\
      \ College. Therefore, answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if Central Washington\

      \ N, CWU is **north** of Brown College, MN.  \n\n**Answer**: NO"
    f1130afd-691d-4b11-9869-dfb7f1cb35cd: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ The user wants to know if Central Washington University in Washington state\

      \ Now, Ellensburg's coordinates... I'm not exactly sure, but Washington state\
      \ is pretty far north. Maybe around 47 degrees latitude? Let me think. Seattle\
      \ is around 47.6\xB0 N, and Ellensburg is east of Seattle, so possibly similar.\
      \ Maybe 47.2\xB0 N? Not 100% sure, but that's a rough estimate.\n\nNow, Brown\
      \ College. Wait, there are a few Brown Colleges. The one in Minnesota, though.\

      \ a technical college, I think it's now part of another institution. It was\
      \ located in Mendota Heights, MN. Let's go with that. Mendota Heights is near\
      \ Minneapolis-St. Paul. Minneapolis is around 44.98\xB0 N latitude. So Mendota\
      \ Heights would be roughly similar, maybe around 44.9\xB0 N.\n\nSo comparing\
      \ the two: if CWU is around 47.2\xB0 N and Brown College is around 44.9\xB0\
      \ N, then Brown College is actually further south. Wait, no, lower latitude\

      \ Washington University is north of Brown College. Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be NO, CWU is not south of Brown College, MN.\n\nBut let me double-check the\

      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County in Wisconsin is located south\
      \ of Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire. Let me break this down step\
      \ by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably locate both universities on a map. But\
      \ I don't have a map in front of me, so I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge\
      \ and maybe some logical deductions. Let's start with their states. The University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County is in Wisconsin, which is in the Midwest.\
      \ Franklin Pierce University is in New Hampshire, which is in the northeastern\
      \ part of the US.\n\nNow, I need to compare their latitudes to determine which\
      \ is further south. Generally, states in the southern part of the US are lower\
      \ in latitude, meaning they are further south. But Wisconsin and New Hampshire\
      \ are both in the northern half of the country. However, New Hampshire is in\
      \ the Northeast, so maybe it's further north than Wisconsin?\n\nWait, let me\
      \ think. The Midwest states like Wisconsin are to the west but how do they compare\
      \ in latitude to the Northeast? For example, Boston, Massachusetts is around\
      \ 42 degrees north latitude. Madison, Wisconsin is also around 43 degrees north.\
      \ But Marathon County\u2014maybe I should check where exactly that is in Wisconsin.\
      \ Marathon County is in central Wisconsin. Wausau is the main city there, I\
      \ believe. Let me recall: Wausau's latitude is approximately 44.96 degrees north.\
      \ \n\nNow, Franklin Pierce University is in New Hampshire. Let me see where\
      \ exactly. The main campus is in Rindge, NH. What's the latitude of Rindge?\
      \ Rindge, NH is around 42.75 degrees north. Wait, so if Wausau, WI is at about\
      \ 44.96\xB0N and Rindge, NH is at 42.75\xB0N, then Rindge is actually further\
      \ south than Wausau. That would mean Franklin Pierce University is further south\

      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County is north of Franklin Pierce University,\
      \ making the answer NO, it is not located south of Franklin Pierce.\n\nWait,\
      \ let me confirm those coordinates again because I might be mixing up the numbers.\
      \ Maybe I should double-check. I think latitude increases as you go north. So\
      \ a higher number is further north. So 44.96\xB0N is higher than 42.75\xB0N,\

      \ 44.96\xB0N (UWMC) is farther north than 42.75\xB0N (FPU), UWMC is **not**\
      \ south of FPU.  \n\n**Answer:** NO"
    1ed2fecc-404f-4968-988f-8df427ccf00e: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ I should find out where each university is located. University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Marathon County is in Marathon County, Wisconsin. I think Marathon County's\
      \ main city might be Wausau. Then Franklin Pierce University is in New Hampshire.\
      \ Their main campus is in Rindge, NH, I believe.\n\nSo next step is to find\
      \ the latitude of each city. Latitude measures how far north or south a place\

      \ lower latitude than Rindge, NH, then UW\u2013Marathon County is indeed south\

      \ latitudes than the Midwest states like Wisconsin? Wait, no, maybe not. For\
      \ example, Minnesota is further north than Maine. So maybe Wisconsin is actually\
      \ further north than some New England states. Let me think about the approximate\
      \ latitudes.\n\nI remember that the 45th parallel runs through the northern\
      \ US. Wisconsin's northern border is around 46 degrees, but Marathon County\

      \ 44.96\xB0 N, and Rindge is at 42.75\xB0 N. That means Rindge, NH is actually\
      \ further south than Wausau, WI. Therefore, the University of Wisconsin\u2013\

      \ step by step. So, we need to determine if the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Marathon County, WI is located south of Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I should probably figure out where each of these universities is\
      \ located. Let's start with the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County.\
      \ I know that the University of Wisconsin has several campuses across the state.\
      \ Marathon County is in Wisconsin, but where exactly? I think Marathon County's\
      \ main city is Wausau. Let me confirm that. Yes, Marathon County's seat is Wausau,\
      \ so the university is likely in Wausau, WI. \n\nNow, I need the latitude of\
      \ Wausau, WI. I recall that Wisconsin is in the northern part of the US. Let\
      \ me think, cities like Milwaukee are on Lake Michigan, but Wausau is more central.\
      \ Maybe around 44-45 degrees north latitude? Let me check in my mind. For example,\
      \ Madison, WI is around 43 degrees north. Wausau is a bit north of there, so\
      \ maybe around 44.5\xB0N?\n\nNext, Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire.\
      \ Where is that located? I believe Franklin Pierce has a main campus in Rindge,\
      \ NH. Let me verify that. Yes, the main campus is in Rindge, NH. Now, what's\
      \ the latitude of Rindge? New Hampshire is in New England, so it's in the northeastern\
      \ part of the US. For reference, Boston is around 42.36\xB0N. Rindge is in southern\
      \ New Hampshire, so maybe a bit north of Boston but not too far. Let's say around\
      \ 42.8\xB0N or something like that? \n\nWait, if Wausau, WI is at approximately\
      \ 44.5\xB0N and Rindge, NH is at around 42.8\xB0N, then Wausau would actually\
      \ be north of Rindge. That would mean University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon\
      \ County is north of Franklin Pierce University, so the answer would be NO.\
      \ But let me make sure I have the latitudes correct. Maybe I should think of\
      \ specific coordinates. \n\nLooking up (mentally), Wausau, WI's latitude is\
      \ approximately 44.9597\xB0 N. Franklin Pierce in Rindge, NH is approximately\
      \ 42.7857\xB0 N. So yes, Wausau is at a higher latitude (44.96) than Rindge\
      \ (42.79). Since latitude increases as you go north, the one with the higher\
      \ number is further north. Therefore, UW\u2013Marathon County is north of Franklin\
      \ Pierce University. Hence, it's not south, so the answer is NO.\n</think>The\
      \ University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County is located in Wausau, WI, at\

      \ a more northerly location, UW\u2013Marathon County is **north** of Franklin\
      \ Pierce University. \n\n**Answer:** NO."

      \ it's located in Wausau, Wisconsin. Let me confirm that. Yes, a quick check\
      \ in my mind tells me that UW-Marathon County is indeed in Wausau, WI.\n\nNext,\
      \ Franklin Pierce University. I recall that Franklin Pierce is a private university\
      \ in New Hampshire. I think their main campus is in Rindge, NH. Let me make\
      \ sure. Yep, Rindge, New Hampshire is correct.\n\nNow, I need to compare the\
      \ latitudes of Wausau, WI and Rindge, NH to see which is further south. Latitude\
      \ is the north-south position. A higher latitude means further north. So if\
      \ Wausau's latitude is lower than Rindge's, then it's south of it.\n\nWhat's\
      \ the latitude of Wausau, WI? From what I remember, Wausau is roughly around\
      \ 44.96 degrees North. Let me think\u2014cities in Wisconsin like Madison are\
      \ around 43 degrees, but Wausau is a bit north of there. Maybe closer to 45\
      \ degrees. Let me check mentally\u2014maybe 44.96 N is accurate.\n\nAnd Rindge,\
      \ NH. New Hampshire is in the northeastern US. Boston is around 42.36 N. Rindge\
      \ is in the southern part of New Hampshire but maybe a bit north of Boston.\
      \ Wait, actually, Rindge is in the southwest part of NH? No, maybe more central.\

      \ bit higher. Maybe around 42.95 N. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I\
      \ should approximate.\n\nAlternatively, another method: compare the general\
      \ regions. Wisconsin is in the Midwest, and New Hampshire is in New England.\
      \ Generally, the Midwest is at similar or lower latitudes than New England.\
      \ For example, Minneapolis is around 44.98 N, which is similar to Wausau. But\
      \ New Hampshire is further east. However, latitude-wise, parts of New Hampshire\
      \ are actually at a lower latitude than parts of Wisconsin. Wait, maybe not.\
      \ Let me think of specific coordinates.\n\nWait, let me get some approximate\
      \ coordinates: Wausau, WI: 44.9591\xB0 N. Rindge, NH: 42.7510\xB0 N. Wait, no,\
      \ if that's the case, then Rindge would actually be south of Wausau. Wait, that\
      \ can't be right. Wait, maybe I mixed up. Wait, 42 degrees is south of 44 degrees.\
      \ So if Rindge is at 42.75 N and Wausau is at 44.96 N, then Wausau is north\

      \ Let's take another city: Concord, NH is about 43.2 N. Rindge is southwest\
      \ of Concord, so maybe a bit lower latitude. Let's say Rindge is around 42.75\
      \ N. Wausau, WI is at 44.96 N. So yes, 44.96 is north of 42.75. Therefore, UW-Marathon\

      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County is indeed in Wausau, Wisconsin.\n\
      \nNow, Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire. I'm less familiar with that.\
      \ Let me think. Franklin Pierce University is a private university in Rindge,\

      \ I think so. Let me confirm... Yes, according to their website, the main campus\
      \ is in Rindge, NH.\n\nNext, I need to compare the latitudes of Wausau, WI and\
      \ Rindge, NH to see which is further south. Since the question is asking if\
      \ UW\u2013Marathon County is south of Franklin Pierce, I need the latitude of\
      \ Wausau to be lower (south) than that of Rindge.\n\nWhat's the latitude of\
      \ Wausau, Wisconsin? I know Wisconsin is a northern state. Wausau is in central\
      \ Wisconsin. Let me look it up. Wausau's latitude is approximately 44.96\xB0\
      \ N. \n\nAnd Rindge, New Hampshire. New Hampshire is in the New England area,\
      \ so also a northern state. Rindge is in the southern part of New Hampshire,\
      \ but how far north is it? Let me check... Rindge, NH has a latitude of about\
      \ 42.78\xB0 N. Wait, that's lower than Wausau's? Wait, if Rindge is at 42.78\xB0\
      N and Wausau at 44.96\xB0N, then Wausau is actually further north. Because latitude\
      \ increases as you go north. So 44.96 is higher than 42.78, meaning Wausau is\
      \ north of Rindge. Therefore, the University of Wisconsin-Marathon County would\
      \ be north of Franklin Pierce University, not south. \n\nWait, but that seems\
      \ a bit counterintuitive. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the\

      \ generally south of North Dakota. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall:\
      \ New York state's northern border is along the St. Lawrence River and the Canadian\
      \ border, but Long Island is more towards the southern part of the state. So\
      \ Stony Brook's latitude should be lower, meaning it's further south compared\

      \ locations of both universities and compare their latitudes. \n\nFirst, I should\
      \ find the locations of both universities. Let me start with Furman University.\
      \ I know Furman is in South Carolina. From what I remember, it's in Greenville,\
      \ SC. Now, Greenville is in the upstate region of South Carolina, which is the\
      \ northern part of the state. So that's probably pretty far north in SC.\n\n\
      Next, Georgia Southern University's Armstrong Campus. Georgia Southern has multiple\
      \ campuses, right? The Armstrong Campus is in Savannah, Georgia, I think. Savannah\
      \ is a coastal city in Georgia, near the border with South Carolina. So Savannah\
      \ is in the southeastern part of Georgia, close to the coast.\n\nNow, to compare\
      \ their latitudes. If Furman is in Greenville, SC, and the Armstrong Campus\
      \ is in Savannah, GA, I need to check which is further south. Savannah is in\
      \ southern Georgia, near the coast. Greenville, SC, being in the upstate, is\
      \ more towards the northwest part of South Carolina. \n\nWait, but South Carolina\
      \ is south of Georgia? No, that's not right. Georgia is south of South Carolina.\
      \ Wait, no, actually, looking at a map, Georgia is to the south of South Carolina.\
      \ So the state of Georgia is south of South Carolina. But cities within those\
      \ states can vary. For example, the northern part of Georgia (like Atlanta)\
      \ is further north than some parts of South Carolina. But Savannah, GA is in\
      \ the southeast corner of Georgia, right near the coast. Greenville, SC is in\
      \ the northwest part of South Carolina. \n\nSo, let me think about their approximate\
      \ latitudes. Greenville, SC's latitude is around 34.85\xB0 N. Savannah, GA is\
      \ around 32.08\xB0 N. Since latitude decreases as you go south, a lower latitude\
      \ means further south. So 32.08\xB0 N is south of 34.85\xB0 N. Therefore, Savannah,\
      \ GA (Armstrong Campus) is south of Greenville, SC (Furman). \n\nWait, but the\
      \ question is asking if Furman is south of Georgia Southern-Armstrong. So if\
      \ Armstrong is at 32.08\xB0 N and Furman is at 34.85\xB0 N, then Furman is actually\
      \ north of Armstrong. So the answer would be NO, Furman University is not south\
      \ of Georgia Southern's Armstrong Campus. \n\nBut let me double-check the locations\
      \ to be sure. Maybe I mixed up the cities. Furman University is definitely in\
      \ Greenville, SC. Yes. And Georgia Southern Armstrong Campus is in Savannah,\
      \ GA. Yes. Checking the coordinates: Greenville, SC is approximately 34.85\xB0\
      \ N, 82.40\xB0 W. Savannah, GA is approximately 32.08\xB0 N, 81.09\xB0 W. So\
      \ yes, Savannah is at a lower latitude, meaning it's further south. Therefore,\
      \ Furman is north of Armstrong Campus. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \n\
      Furman University in Greenville, SC (latitude ~34.85\xB0 N) is located north\
      \ of Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus in Savannah, GA (latitude\

      \ south of Johnson University in Tennessee. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure\
      \ out the locations of both universities. \n\nStarting with the University of\
      \ Northern Colorado. I know that Colorado is a state in the western US, and\
      \ \"Northern\" in the name suggests it's in the northern part of the state.\
      \ Let me confirm that. The University of Northern Colorado is in Greeley, Colorado.\
      \ Now, where is Greeley exactly? I think it's north of Denver, which is the\
      \ capital. Denver is roughly in the center of Colorado, so Greeley being north\
      \ of Denver would place it in the northern part of the state.\n\nNext, Johnson\
      \ University in Tennessee. Johnson University has a campus in Knoxville, Tennessee,\
      \ I believe. Let me verify that. Yes, Johnson University's main campus is in\
      \ Knoxville, TN. Now, I need to compare the latitudes of these two cities: Greeley,\
      \ CO, and Knoxville, TN. Latitude determines how far north or south a location\
      \ is. The higher the latitude, the farther north it is.\n\nSo, what's the latitude\
      \ of Greeley, Colorado? Let me recall. Denver is at about 39.7\xB0 N. Since\
      \ Greeley is north of Denver, maybe around 40.4\xB0 N. Let me check that. Yes,\
      \ Greeley's latitude is approximately 40.4233\xB0 N. \n\nNow, Knoxville, Tennessee.\
      \ I know that Tennessee is in the southeastern US. Knoxville's latitude is around\
      \ 35.96\xB0 N. So, comparing the two: Greeley at ~40.4\xB0 N and Knoxville at\
      \ ~36.0\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a higher latitude means\
      \ a more northern location. Therefore, Greeley, CO (40.4\xB0 N) is north of\
      \ Knoxville, TN (36.0\xB0 N). \n\nWait, but the question is whether University\
      \ of Northern Colorado is south of Johnson University. If Greeley is at a higher\
      \ latitude (more north) than Knoxville, then it's actually located north, not\
      \ south. Therefore, the answer should be NO. \n\nLet me just double-check the\
      \ coordinates to be sure. Quick search: University of Northern Colorado, Greeley,\
      \ CO: 40.4233\xB0 N, 104.7091\xB0 W. Johnson University, Knoxville, TN: 35.9937\xB0\

      \ around 36.15\xB0N. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 36\xB0N would be like\
      \ the southern part of the US. Let me verify. Tulsa's latitude is actually about\
      \ 36\xB0N? Because Oklahoma City is around 35.5\xB0N, so Tulsa being a bit north\

      N. \n\nSo if Springfield is at 39.9\xB0N and Tulsa is at 36.2\xB0N, then Tulsa\

      \ Wittenberg U is north of OSU-Tulsa. Therefore, the answer would be NO, Wittenberg\
      \ is not south of OSU-Tulsa.\n\nBut wait, maybe I mixed up the latitudes. Let\
      \ me double-check. For example, Columbus, OH is 39.98\xB0N. Springfield, OH\
      \ is a bit west of Columbus, but latitude-wise, probably similar. Tulsa, OK\
      \ is indeed around 36.15\xB0N. So 36\xB0N is south of 39\xB0N. Therefore, Tulsa\
      \ is south of Springfield, OH. So Wittenberg University in Springfield, OH is\
      \ north of OSU-Tulsa. Therefore, the answer is NO.</think>To determine if Wittenberg\
      \ University (Springfield, OH) is south of Oklahoma State University\u2013Tulsa\

      \ **39.92\xB0N**  \n- **Tulsa, OK**: Approximately **36.15\xB0N**  \n\nSince\
      \ lower latitude means farther south, Tulsa (36.15\xB0N) is south of Springfield\
      \ (39.92\xB0N). Thus, Wittenberg University is **north** of Oklahoma State University\u2013\
      Tulsa.  \n\n**ANSWER: NO**"
    89be11f0-50b2-4319-8ad6-a93fa3592684: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. So the question is whether Wittenberg University in Ohio is located south\
      \ of Oklahoma State University\u2013Tulsa in Oklahoma. Hmm, I need to compare\
      \ their latitudes.\n\nFirst, I need to find the locations of both universities.\
      \ Let me start with Wittenberg University in Ohio. I think it's in Springfield,\
      \ Ohio. Now, where is Springfield, Ohio exactly? Let me recall, Ohio is in the\
      \ Midwest, and Springfield is probably in the western part of the state. Maybe\
      \ near Dayton? Because Dayton is a major city in Ohio. If I remember correctly,\
      \ Springfield, OH is about 45 minutes west of Columbus, the state capital. But\
      \ I'm not 100% sure. I should confirm that Wittenberg is indeed in Springfield,\
      \ Ohio. A quick check in my mind tells me yes, Wittenberg University is located\
      \ in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nNext, Oklahoma State University\u2013Tulsa is in\
      \ Tulsa, Oklahoma. So I need to compare the latitude of Springfield, OH and\
      \ Tulsa, OK. The latitude determines how far north or south a place is. The\
      \ higher the latitude, the further north.\n\nSo I need to find the approximate\
      \ latitudes of both cities. Let's start with Tulsa, Oklahoma. I know that Oklahoma\
      \ is in the southern part of the US. Tulsa is in the northeastern part of Oklahoma.\
      \ From memory, major cities in Oklahoma like Oklahoma City and Tulsa have latitudes\
      \ around 36 degrees North. For example, Oklahoma City is around 35.4676\xB0\
      \ N, and Tulsa being a bit more north, maybe around 36.1540\xB0 N. Let me confirm\
      \ that\u2014yes, I think Tulsa's latitude is approximately 36.15\xB0 N.\n\n\
      Now, Springfield, Ohio. Ohio is further north compared to Oklahoma. Let's think\
      \ about the latitude of Ohio. Columbus, Ohio's capital, is around 39.9612\xB0\
      \ N. Since Springfield is west of Columbus, but still in Ohio, its latitude\
      \ should be similar. Let me check\u2014Springfield, OH's coordinates. If I recall\
      \ correctly, Springfield, OH is approximately 39.9242\xB0 N. Wait, that's almost\
      \ 40\xB0 N. So that's higher than Tulsa's latitude of around 36\xB0 N.\n\nWait,\
      \ but if Springfield, OH is at about 39.9\xB0 N and Tulsa, OK is at 36.15\xB0\
      \ N, then Springfield is actually further north. Therefore, Wittenberg University\
      \ in Springfield, OH would be north of Oklahoma State University\u2013Tulsa.\
      \ So the answer would be NO, because a higher latitude means it's further north.\n\
      \nBut let me double-check the exact coordinates to make sure I didn't mix up\
      \ anything. Sometimes cities can be in different parts of the state. For example,\
      \ maybe Wittenberg is in a southern part of Ohio. But Ohio's southern border\
      \ is along the Ohio River, around 38.5\xB0 N. So if Springfield, OH is at 39.9\xB0\
      \ N, that's pretty central in Ohio, not near the southern border. So Tulsa at\
      \ 36\xB0 N is definitely south of that.\n\nTherefore, Wittenberg University\
      \ in Ohio is north of Oklahoma State University\u2013Tulsa. So the answer is\
      \ NO.\n</think>NO  \nWittenberg University is located in Springfield, Ohio,\
      \ at approximately 39.92\xB0 N latitude. Oklahoma State University\u2013Tulsa\
      \ is in Tulsa, Oklahoma, around 36.15\xB0 N latitude. Since higher latitude\
      \ means further north, Wittenberg (39.92\xB0 N) is north of Tulsa (36.15\xB0\
      \ N)."

      \ Ohio is in the northern part of the midwest. Let me visualize a map. Ohio\
      \ is to the east of Indiana, which is east of Illinois. Oklahoma is south of\
      \ Kansas, which is south of Nebraska. So Tulsa, being in Oklahoma, is probably\

      \ latitudes. Springfield, OH: I think the latitude is around 39.93\xB0 N. Tulsa,\
      \ OK's latitude is about 36.13\xB0 N. Wait, if that's the case, then Tulsa is\
      \ actually south of Springfield, OH. Because lower latitude means further south.\
      \ So if Tulsa is at around 36\xB0N and Springfield is at 39\xB0N, then Tulsa\
      \ is south of Springfield. Therefore, Wittenberg University (Springfield, OH)\

      \ Springfield, OH is slightly west of Columbus but probably similar latitude.\
      \ Let me check Springfield, OH's exact coordinates. A quick search in mind (since\
      \ I can't look it up, relying on memory), Springfield, OH's latitude is approximately\
      \ 39.9247\xB0 N. Tulsa, OK is 36.1539\xB0 N. So 36 degrees is lower than 39\

      \ That's part of the Oklahoma State University system, so that's correct.\n\n\
      Next, I need to compare their latitudes to see which is further south. Since\

      \nLet me start with San Marcos, California. Where is that located? San Marcos\

      \ where each university is. Eastern University, PA. I know Pennsylvania is in\
      \ the northeastern U.S., so I'm guessing it's somewhere in that state. Maybe\
      \ near Philadelphia? Let me think. Eastern University's main campus is in St.\
      \ Davids, Pennsylvania. I remember that St. Davids is a suburb of Philadelphia.\
      \ So the coordinates for Eastern University would be around Philly's latitude.\
      \ Philadelphia is roughly at 40\xB0N latitude.\n\nNow, Texas Tech University\
      \ College of Human Sciences is part of Texas Tech in Lubbock, Texas. Lubbock\

      \ latitude would be higher than, say, Austin or San Antonio. Let me check approximate\
      \ coordinates. Lubbock, TX is around 33.5\xB0N latitude. Wait, no, that can't\
      \ be right. Wait, 33.5\xB0N is actually lower, like more southern. Wait, no.\
      \ Wait, I'm confused. Let me think again. Texas is in the southern U.S., but\
      \ Lubbock is in the panhandle area? Or is that Amarillo? Hmm. Let me recall:\
      \ Texas Tech is in Lubbock, which is in West Texas. Let me think of major cities.\
      \ Dallas is around 32.8\xB0N, Houston around 29.7\xB0N. Lubbock is further north.\
      \ Let me look up approximate latitude. Lubbock, TX latitude is approximately\
      \ 33.5776\xB0 N. Wait, that's actually more south than Philadelphia's 40\xB0\
      N. Wait, no. Wait, 33\xB0N is actually further south. Because latitude increases\
      \ as you go north. So Philadelphia at 40\xB0N is much further north than Lubbock\
      \ at 33.5\xB0N. Wait, that can't be. Because Texas is south of Pennsylvania.\
      \ So if Eastern University is in PA (40\xB0N), and Texas Tech in Lubbock is\
      \ at 33.5\xB0N, then PA is north of Texas Tech. Therefore, Eastern University\
      \ would be north of Texas Tech, so the answer is NO. But wait, this seems contradictory\
      \ because Texas is in the south. Wait, maybe I mixed up the coordinates. Let\
      \ me confirm.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The higher the latitude number,\
      \ the further north. So 40\xB0N is north of 33.5\xB0N. So if Eastern University\
      \ in PA is at 40\xB0N, and Texas Tech in Lubbock is at 33.5\xB0N, then Eastern\
      \ U is north, Texas Tech is south. Therefore, Eastern U is NOT south of Texas\
      \ Tech. So the answer is NO. But wait, Texas is a southern state, but Lubbock\
      \ is in the northern part of Texas. So maybe Lubbock is at a higher latitude\
      \ than parts of PA? Wait, no. PA is further north than Texas overall. So even\
      \ the northernmost point in Texas would be south of the southernmost point in\
      \ PA. Wait, is that true? Let me think. For example, the northern border of\
      \ Texas is at 36\xB030'N (the panhandle), whereas Pennsylvania's southern border\
      \ is around 39.7\xB0N. So the northern tip of Texas is around 36.5\xB0N, and\
      \ Pennsylvania's southern border is 39.7\xB0N. Therefore, even the northernmost\
      \ part of Texas is south of the southernmost part of Pennsylvania. So Lubbock,\
      \ TX is at 33.5\xB0N, which is much further south. Therefore, Eastern University\

      \ \n\nStarting with Eastern University in PA. I know Pennsylvania is in the\
      \ northeastern US. Eastern University's main campus is in St. Davids, Pennsylvania.\
      \ I should confirm the exact location. St. Davids is a suburb of Philadelphia,\
      \ right? So Philadelphia is in southeastern Pennsylvania, near the Delaware\
      \ River. Let me check the latitude of St. Davids. Maybe around 40 degrees north?\n\
      \nNow, Texas Tech University College of Human Sciences is part of Texas Tech\
      \ University in Lubbock, Texas. Lubbock is in the northwestern part of Texas.\
      \ What's the latitude there? I think Lubbock is around 33.5 degrees north latitude.\
      \ Wait, Texas is generally south of Pennsylvania, but Lubbock is in the northern\
      \ part of Texas. But Pennsylvania is further north overall. \n\nSo comparing\
      \ the two: St. Davids, PA at around 40\xB0N vs. Lubbock, TX at around 33.5\xB0\
      N. Latitude decreases as you go south. So 33.5\xB0N is south of 40\xB0N. That\

      \ NO, Eastern University is not south of Texas Tech's campus in Lubbock. \n\n\
      Wait, but maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me think: Philadelphia's\
      \ latitude is about 39.95\xB0N, so St. Davids would be similar. Lubbock is indeed\
      \ around 33.5776\xB0N. So 33.5 is definitely south of 40. Therefore, Eastern\

      \ \n\nStarting with Eastern University in Pennsylvania. I know that Pennsylvania\
      \ is in the northeastern part of the US. Eastern University might be in a city\
      \ like St. Davids, which I think is near Philadelphia. Let me confirm that.\
      \ Yes, Eastern University's main campus is in St. Davids, PA. Now, where exactly\

      \ Lubbock is in the northwestern part of Texas. \n\nNow, to determine if one\
      \ is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes. The lower the latitude,\
      \ the further south a location is. Let me recall the approximate latitudes.\
      \ Philadelphia's latitude is around 39.95\xB0 N. Lubbock, TX, is at approximately\
      \ 33.58\xB0 N. Wait, that's interesting. If Eastern University is near Philadelphia,\
      \ which is at about 40\xB0 N, and Texas Tech is at around 33.5\xB0 N, then Lubbock\
      \ is actually further south because 33.5\xB0 is less than 40\xB0. \n\nWait,\
      \ but latitude decreases as you go south. So a lower latitude number means more\
      \ south. So Philadelphia at 40\xB0N is north of Lubbock at ~33.5\xB0N. Therefore,\
      \ Eastern University in PA (assuming it's near Philadelphia) is actually north\

      \ part of PA? Let me check. Eastern University's address is 1300 Eagle Rd, St.\
      \ Davids, PA. St. Davids is a suburb of Philadelphia. The latitude for St. Davids,\
      \ PA, is approximately 40.04\xB0 N. Lubbock, TX, as mentioned, is around 33.58\xB0\
      \ N. So 40.04\xB0N versus 33.58\xB0N. Since 33.58 is lower than 40.04, that\
      \ means Lubbock is south of St. Davids. Therefore, Eastern University (St. Davids,\
      \ PA) is north of Texas Tech in Lubbock, TX. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO\

      \ Strayer University in DC is south of Arkansas State University in Paragould,\
      \ AR. Let me start by recalling some basic geography. \n\nFirst, I know that\
      \ Washington, DC is on the east coast, around the mid-Atlantic region. Arkansas\
      \ is a state in the southern United States. Paragould, AR, where Arkansas State\
      \ University has a campus, is in the northeastern part of Arkansas. Now, Strayer\

      \ latitude is approximately 38.9072\xB0 N. Paragould, AR is in the northern\
      \ part of Arkansas. What's the latitude there? Let me recall. Arkansas as a\
      \ whole is in the southern US, but Paragould is in the northeast corner of the\
      \ state. Maybe its latitude is higher than DC's. For example, Memphis, TN is\
      \ around 35\xB0 N, but that's further south. Wait, no, Memphis is around 35\xB0\
      \ N. Wait, DC is at about 38.9\xB0 N. So if Paragould is in northeastern Arkansas,\
      \ maybe its latitude is higher than that. Let's see, Arkansas's northern border\
      \ is at 36.5\xB0 N. Wait, no, the northern border of Arkansas is actually along\
      \ the 36.5\xB0 N parallel. So Paragould, being in the northeast, might be around\
      \ 36\xB0 N. For example, Jonesboro, AR, which is near Paragould, is about 35.8423\xB0\
      \ N. Wait, that's actually south of 36.5. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the\
      \ state borders. Let me confirm.\n\nThe northern boundary of Arkansas is the\
      \ 36\xB030' N parallel. So Paragould, being in the northeast, is just south\
      \ of the Missouri state line. So Paragould's latitude is probably around 36\xB0\
      \ N. For instance, the exact coordinates of Paragould, AR are 36.0564\xB0 N,\
      \ 90.5033\xB0 W. So latitude is 36.0564\xB0 N. Meanwhile, Washington, DC is\
      \ at 38.9072\xB0 N. \n\nSince latitude increases as you go north, a higher latitude\
      \ means further north. So if Strayer University in DC is at 38.9\xB0 N, and\
      \ Arkansas State University in Paragould is at 36.05\xB0 N, then DC is actually\

      \ States, somewhere in the mid-Atlantic region. Arkansas is a state in the southern\
      \ part of the country, but Paragould is a city in the northeastern corner of\
      \ Arkansas. So, where exactly are these two universities located?\n\nLet me\
      \ get the exact coordinates or at least the approximate latitudes. Latitude\

      \ higher the latitude, the further north a place is.\n\nStrayer University's\
      \ main campus in D.C. is in the capital city. Washington, D.C. has a latitude\
      \ of approximately 38.9072\xB0 N. Now, Arkansas State University in Paragould,\
      \ AR. Let me look up the latitude of Paragould. A quick check shows that Paragould,\
      \ AR has a latitude of around 36.0580\xB0 N. \n\nWait, if Strayer is at 38.9\xB0\
      \ N and Arkansas State is at 36.05\xB0 N, then the university in Paragould is\
      \ actually further south because 36 degrees is less than 38 degrees. That would\
      \ mean Strayer University in D.C. is north of Arkansas State University in Paragould.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be NO, Strayer isn't south of Arkansas State\
      \ University-Paragould; it's the other way around.\n\nBut let me double-check\
      \ to make sure I didn't mix up the coordinates. Maybe I confused latitude and\

      \ Paragould, AR is in the northern part of Arkansas, but still, its latitude\

      \ a more northern region. For example, the southernmost point of Arkansas is\
      \ around 33\xB0 N, but Paragould is at 36\xB0 N. Wait, 36\xB0 N is still further\

      \ From what I remember, Washington, DC's latitude is around 38.9072\xB0 N. Paragould,\
      \ AR's latitude... Hmm, Arkansas is a southern state. Let me think. Arkansas\
      \ is north of Louisiana and east of Texas. Paragould is in the northeastern\
      \ part of Arkansas. Cities in that area might have a latitude similar to, say,\
      \ Memphis, Tennessee, which is around 35.1495\xB0 N. Wait, Memphis is just across\
      \ the Mississippi River from Arkansas. So Paragould, being in northeastern Arkansas,\
      \ might be a bit higher. Let me check approximate coordinates.\n\nLooking up\
      \ Paragould, AR's latitude. Okay, Paragould's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 36.0564\xB0 N, 90.5033\xB0 W. And Washington, DC is 38.9072\xB0 N, 77.0369\xB0\
      \ W. Comparing the latitudes: 38.9\xB0 N vs. 36.05\xB0 N. Since 36.05 is less\

      \ Arkansas. Newport is in the northeastern part of Arkansas, I believe. \n\n\
      Wait, but even if the University of Hartford is in southern Connecticut, Connecticut\
      \ as a whole is north of Arkansas. Arkansas is much further south. So the key\
      \ is to compare the latitudes. The higher the latitude, the further north a\
      \ place is. So if the latitude of Hartford, CT is higher than that of Newport,\
      \ AR, then Hartford is north of Newport, making the answer NO. But if Hartford's\
      \ latitude is lower, then it's south, which would be YES.\n\nBut I need to get\
      \ approximate latitudes. Let's see. Arkansas is a southern state. Newport, Arkansas.\
      \ Let's think about major cities. Newport is near Jonesboro, maybe? Or perhaps\

      \ the latitude of Newport, AR. Maybe around 35-36 degrees north? And Hartford,\
      \ CT. Hartford's latitude is higher, probably around 41-42 degrees north. Because,\
      \ for example, New York City is around 40.7\xB0 N. Hartford is north of NYC,\
      \ right? Wait, actually, no. Wait, Hartford is in central Connecticut. New York\
      \ City is at about 40.7\xB0 N. Connecticut is to the northeast of NYC. So Hartford's\
      \ latitude might be around 41.7\xB0 N. Let's confirm. Quick check: New Haven,\
      \ CT is about 41.3\xB0 N. Hartford is a bit north of that, so maybe 41.76\xB0\
      \ N. So yes, around 41-42\xB0 N.\n\nNow, Newport, AR. Let's see. Little Rock\
      \ is the capital of Arkansas, around 34.7\xB0 N. Newport is northeast of Little\
      \ Rock, so maybe a bit higher latitude. Maybe around 35.5\xB0 N? So if Hartford\

      \ of Newport. Therefore, University of Hartford is not south of Arkansas State\
      \ University-Newport. So the answer should be NO.\n\nWait, but let me double-check\
      \ in case I mixed up the directions. Since the lower the latitude, the further\

      \ is that always true? Could there be a part of Ohio that's further north than\

      \ point of Ohio (\u224841.97\xB0N) is still significantly south of Maine's southernmost\
      \ areas (\u224843.4\xB0N). Since Husson University is in Bangor, ME (\u2248\
      44.8\xB0N) and Franciscan University is in Steubenville, OH (\u224840.35\xB0\
      N), **all of Maine is north of Ohio**. Thus, Husson University cannot be south\
      \ of Franciscan University.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**"

      \ \n\nStarting with Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio. I know that\
      \ Steubenville is in eastern Ohio, near the border with West Virginia. I recall\
      \ that Ohio is in the Midwest, so its latitude is somewhere around 40\xB0N.\
      \ Let me check in my mind... Cities like Columbus, Ohio are around 40\xB0N.\
      \ Steubenville is a bit further east, but still, probably around 40.35\xB0N\
      \ or something like that.\n\nNow, Husson University in Maine. Maine is in the\
      \ northeastern US, known for being pretty far north. The state's southern border\
      \ is around 43\xB0N, but cities further north would be higher. Bangor, where\
      \ Husson's main campus is, I think. Let me remember... Bangor, Maine's latitude.\
      \ From what I know, Bangor is roughly 44.8\xB0N latitude. \n\nSo comparing the\
      \ two: if Franciscan is around 40.35\xB0N and Husson is 44.8\xB0N, then Husson\
      \ would be further north, meaning Franciscan is further south. Therefore, Husson\
      \ University in Maine is north of Franciscan University in Ohio. So the original\
      \ question is asking if Husson is south of Franciscan. Since 44.8 is higher\
      \ than 40.35, the answer would be NO. \n\nWait, let me confirm the exact coordinates\
      \ just to be sure. Steubenville, OH: looking up mentally, the coordinates are\
      \ approximately 40.3697\xB0 N, 80.6334\xB0 W. And Bangor, ME (Husson University's\
      \ location) is around 44.8016\xB0 N, 68.7712\xB0 W. Yes, so 44.8 vs 40.36. Definitely,\

      \ YES or NO, but it's important to go through the reasoning process first.\n\
      \nOkay, first, I need to figure out the locations of both universities. Let's\
      \ start with Franciscan University of Steubenville. Steubenville is in Ohio,\
      \ right? Ohio is in the Midwestern part of the U.S., south of the Great Lakes.\
      \ Now, Steubenville's exact coordinates might help. From what I remember, Steubenville\

      \ in the northeastern part of the U.S., known for being quite far north. The\
      \ university is in Bangor, Maine, I believe. Let me verify that. Yes, Husson's\
      \ main campus is indeed in Bangor. What's the latitude of Bangor, Maine? I think\
      \ Bangor is somewhere around 44.8\xB0 N. For reference, Portland, Maine is about\
      \ 43.66\xB0 N, and Bangor is north of that. So maybe Bangor is around 44.8\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n\nComparing the two latitudes: if Franciscan University is at\
      \ approximately 40.4\xB0 N and Husson is at 44.8\xB0 N, then Husson is actually\
      \ north of Franciscan. Because latitude increases as you go north. So a higher\
      \ latitude means further north. Therefore, if one place has a higher latitude\
      \ than another, it's located to the north. So in this case, since 44.8\xB0 N\
      \ (Husson) is higher than 40.4\xB0 N (Franciscan), Husson University is north\
      \ of Franciscan University. Therefore, the answer should be NO, Husson University\
      \ is not south of Franciscan University; it's actually north of it.\n\nWait,\
      \ but maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me check the latitude\
      \ of Steubenville, Ohio. A quick search shows that Steubenville, OH's latitude\
      \ is approximately 40.3694\xB0 N. And Bangor, ME's latitude is approximately\
      \ 44.8016\xB0 N. Comparing these two, 44.8 is definitely higher than 40.36,\
      \ which confirms that Bangor (Husson) is north of Steubenville (Franciscan).\
      \ Therefore, the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if Husson University, ME\

      \ Bangor, Maine, at approximately **44.8016\xB0 N** latitude.  \n3. Since latitude\
      \ increases as you move north, a higher value means a location is farther north.\

      \ \n\nHoward Payne University is in Brownwood, TX. Where is Brownwood? It's\

      \ Brownwood, TX's latitude is approximately 31.7093\xB0 N. Wait, no, that might\
      \ not be right. Maybe I'm mixing up cities. Let me try to recall. If Austin\

      \ 32.7\xB0N. Los Angeles is about 34.05\xB0N. San Bernardino is east of LA,\
      \ so maybe similar latitude. Yes, San Bernardino is 34.1083\xB0N. Brownwood,\

      \ Brownwood is in central Texas, maybe around 31.7 degrees north latitude. Let\
      \ me confirm that. Yes, Brownwood's coordinates are approximately 31.7093\xB0\

    3f63bfa7-241a-4dd6-ad61-5316b1ba47ce: "<think>Okay, let's figure out whether California\
      \ State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB) is located south of Howard Payne\

      \ University is in Brownwood, Texas. So I need to compare their latitudes because\
      \ the question is about north-south positioning. The further south a place is,\
      \ the lower its latitude.\n\nI remember that latitude lines run horizontally,\
      \ so if CSUSB has a lower latitude than HPU, then it's further south. Let me\
      \ try to recall or estimate the approximate latitudes. \n\nSan Bernardino, CA:\
      \ I think Southern California is around 34 degrees north latitude. Maybe 34\xB0\
      \ N? For example, Los Angeles is about 34\xB0 N, and San Bernardino is inland\
      \ but in the same general area. \n\nBrownwood, TX: Texas is a big state. Central\
      \ Texas, maybe around 31-32\xB0 N? Wait, no. Wait, places like Austin are around\
      \ 30\xB0 N. Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think. Houston is around 29\xB0\
      \ N, Dallas is about 32\xB0 N. Brownwood is in central Texas, maybe north of\
      \ Austin. Let me check: Brownwood, TX. Actually, looking up (without actual\
      \ data), Texas spans from about 26\xB0 N (like Rio Grande Valley) up to around\
      \ 36\xB0 N in the panhandle. Brownwood is in the central part. Let me verify\
      \ approximate coordinates. If I recall, Abilene, TX is about 32\xB0 N. Brownwood\
      \ is southeast of Abilene. So maybe around 31.7\xB0 N? \n\nSo if San Bernardino\

      \ again. Maybe I mixed up. San Bernardino is in Southern California, but latitude-wise,\
      \ what's the actual latitude? For example, San Diego is around 32.7\xB0 N. Los\
      \ Angeles is about 34\xB0 N. San Bernardino is east of LA, so maybe similar\
      \ latitude. Let's say 34.1\xB0 N. \n\nHoward Payne in Brownwood, TX: Let's see,\
      \ Brownwood is in central Texas. Let me think of other cities. For example,\
      \ San Antonio is 29\xB0 N, Austin around 30.25\xB0 N. Brownwood is northwest\
      \ of Austin, maybe around 31.7\xB0 N as I thought. So if CSUSB is at 34.1\xB0\
      \ N and HPU is at 31.7\xB0 N, then HPU is south of CSUSB, which would mean CSUSB\
      \ is north of HPU, making the answer NO. \n\nWait, but the original question\
      \ is: \"Is CSUSB located south of HPU?\" If CSUSB is at 34\xB0 N and HPU is\
      \ 31.7\xB0 N, then no, CSUSB is north. So the answer would be NO. \n\nBut perhaps\
      \ I got the latitude of Brownwood wrong. Let me think again. Maybe Brownwood\
      \ is higher. For example, Lubbock, TX is around 33.5\xB0 N. If Brownwood is\
      \ in central Texas, but further north? Wait no, Lubbock is way up in the panhandle.\
      \ Brownwood is in central TX, not the panhandle. Let me check another way: Dallas\
      \ is 32.8\xB0 N. Brownwood is southwest of Dallas, perhaps around 31.7\xB0 N.\
      \ So if CSUSB is at 34.1\xB0 N, then it's north of HPU. Therefore, the answer\
      \ is NO. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps San Bernardino is further south. If San\
      \ Bernardino's latitude is lower than HPU's, then the answer is YES. But I think\
      \ my initial estimation is that San Bernardino is around 34\xB0 N, which is\
      \ higher (more north) than Howard Payne's around 31.7\xB0 N. So NO. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I have the exact coordinates. Since I can't look it up, but maybe I\
      \ can recall. San Bernardino's coordinates: 34.18\xB0 N, 117.32\xB0 W. Howard\
      \ Payne University: Brownwood, TX is at 31.71\xB0 N, 98.99\xB0 W. So yes, 31.71\

      \ Wait, no, Austin is around 30.25\xB0 N. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, let me think.\
      \ Actually, Dallas is around 32.8\xB0 N. Austin is around 30.3\xB0 N. So Brownwood\

      \ step by step. So, the question is whether California State University, San\
      \ Bernardino (CSUSB) is located south of Howard Payne University (HPU) in Texas.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the locations of both universities. Let's\
      \ start with CSUSB. I know that California State University, San Bernardino\
      \ is in San Bernardino, California. San Bernardino is a city in Southern California,\
      \ inland from Los Angeles. Now, where exactly is that in terms of latitude?\
      \ I think cities in Southern California like San Diego are pretty far south,\
      \ but San Bernardino is more inland. Maybe its latitude is around 34 degrees\
      \ north?\n\nThen there's Howard Payne University in Texas. I'm not as familiar\
      \ with Texas geography. Howard Payne University is in Brownwood, Texas. Where\
      \ is Brownwood? I believe it's in central Texas. Let me recall... Texas is a\

      \ Texas cities like Brownsville are around 25 degrees north. But central Texas,\
      \ maybe around 31 or 32? Wait, Austin is about 30 degrees north. Wait, no, Austin's\
      \ latitude is approximately 30.25\xB0 N. Brownwood is northwest of Austin. Let\
      \ me check mentally: Brownwood, TX. If I think of Texas, moving from Austin\
      \ westward, maybe Brownwood is around 31.7 degrees north? Hmm. Not sure, but\
      \ I need to compare the two.\n\nSo CSUSB in San Bernardino, CA. Let me think:\
      \ San Bernardino's latitude. I know that Los Angeles is around 34 degrees north,\
      \ and San Bernardino is east of LA, so probably similar latitude. Let's say\
      \ approximately 34.1\xB0 N. Then Howard Payne in Brownwood, TX. If Brownwood\

      \ is at 34\xB0 N and Brownwood is at 31.7\xB0 N, then Brownwood would be further\
      \ south. So CSUSB would be north of HPU. But wait, the question is whether CSUSB\
      \ is south of HPU. So if HPU is at a lower latitude (more south), then CSUSB\
      \ would be north of HPU, so the answer would be NO.\n\nBut wait, maybe I have\
      \ the latitudes reversed. Let me try to get more precise. Let me recall specific\
      \ coordinates. San Bernardino, CA: The coordinates are approximately 34.1083\xB0\

      \ N, 98.9911\xB0 W. So San Bernardino is at 34.1083\xB0 N, while Brownwood is\
      \ at 31.7093\xB0 N. Since latitude decreases as you go south, Brownwood is at\
      \ a lower latitude (31.7\xB0 N) compared to San Bernardino's 34.1\xB0 N. Therefore,\
      \ Brownwood, TX (HPU) is further south than San Bernardino, CA (CSUSB). So CSUSB\

      \ latitude (34.1) than HPU (31.7), then CSUSB is actually NORTH of HPU. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be NO, because the question asks if CSUSB is south of HPU.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me confirm the exact coordinates. Sometimes\
      \ universities might not be exactly in the city center. Let me check CSUSB's\
      \ exact location. California State University, San Bernardino's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 34.1817\xB0 N, 117.3232\xB0 W. Yes, so that's around 34.18\xB0\
      \ N. Howard Payne University in Brownwood: according to coordinates, it's 31.7120\xB0\
      \ N, 98.9906\xB0 W. So yes, approximately 31.71\xB0 N. \n\nComparing 34.18\xB0\
      \ N vs. 31.71\xB0 N. The lower the latitude, the further south. Since 31.71\xB0\
      \ N is less than 34.18\xB0 N, Howard Payne University is further south. Therefore,\
      \ CSUSB is north of HPU. So the answer is NO, CSUSB is not south of HPU.\n</think>NO\
      \  \nThe latitude of California State University, San Bernardino (34.18\xB0\
      \ N) is higher than that of Howard Payne University, TX (31.71\xB0 N). Since\
      \ latitude increases northward, CSUSB is located **north** of Howard Payne University,\
      \ not south."
    ba035296-a2c6-4477-82ed-4dcbbdc780bf: "<think>Okay, let me see. I need to figure\
      \ out if California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB), CA is located\
      \ south of Howard Payne University (HPU) in Texas. Hmm, first, I should probably\
      \ find the locations of both universities. \n\nLet me start with CSUSB. The\
      \ name says San Bernardino, California. San Bernardino is a city in Southern\
      \ California. I remember that Southern California is generally in the southern\
      \ part of the state, maybe near Los Angeles. Now, for Howard Payne University,\
      \ that's in Texas. Texas is a big state, so where exactly is HPU located? I\
      \ think Howard Payne is in Brownwood, Texas. Let me confirm that. Yes, a quick\
      \ mental note: Howard Payne University is indeed in Brownwood, TX.\n\nNext step,\
      \ I need to compare the latitudes of both cities because latitude determines\
      \ how north or south a location is. The higher the latitude, the more north\
      \ it is. So if CSUSB's latitude is lower (more south) than HPU's, then the answer\
      \ is YES. \n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes. San Bernardino, CA\u2014\
      I know Los Angeles is around 34 degrees north. San Bernardino is inland, maybe\
      \ a bit north of LA? Wait, actually, San Bernardino is east of LA, but in terms\
      \ of latitude, it might be similar. Let me think. LA is about 34\xB0 N. San\
      \ Bernardino is in San Bernardino County, which is part of the Inland Empire.\
      \ I think its latitude is roughly around 34\xB0 6' N. \n\nNow, Brownwood, Texas.\
      \ Where is that in Texas? Texas's latitude ranges from about 26\xB0 N in the\
      \ south (like Brownsville) to 36\xB0 N in the panhandle. Brownwood is in central\
      \ Texas, I believe. Let me think. Cities like Austin are around 30\xB0 N. Brownwood\
      \ is west of Austin, maybe a bit north. Wait, Brownwood's coordinates: I might\
      \ need to recall or estimate. If Austin is 30.25\xB0 N, maybe Brownwood is a\
      \ bit higher. Let me check mentally. Brownwood is in Brown County, Texas. Looking\
      \ at a map in my mind, central Texas\u2014so maybe around 31.7\xB0 N. Wait,\
      \ I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe 31\xB0 42' N or so. Let me verify\
      \ this approximation. \n\nSo San Bernardino is around 34.1\xB0 N and Brownwood\
      \ is around 31.7\xB0 N. Wait, that would mean that Brownwood is further south,\
      \ so CSUSB is north of HPU. Therefore, the answer would be NO. But wait, maybe\
      \ I mixed up the latitudes. Let me double-check. If San Bernardino is at 34\xB0\
      \ N and Brownwood at 31.7\xB0 N, then San Bernardino is north of Brownwood.\
      \ Therefore, CSUSB is north of HPU, so the answer is NO. But maybe I got the\
      \ coordinates wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe San Bernardino's latitude is lower.\
      \ Let me think again. San Diego is around 32.7\xB0 N. Los Angeles is 34\xB0\
      \ N. San Bernardino is inland from LA, so maybe a bit higher? Because when you\
      \ go inland, sometimes latitude increases. Wait, no, latitude is east-west lines.\
      \ Moving inland east from LA, if you go east, longitude changes, but latitude\
      \ stays roughly similar. So San Bernardino should be around 34\xB0 N. Meanwhile,\
      \ Brownwood, TX, which is in central Texas, perhaps around 31.7\xB0 N. Therefore,\
      \ San Bernardino is north of Brownwood. So CSUSB is not south of HPU. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is NO. \n\nBut wait, maybe Howard Payne University is further north.\
      \ Let me think again. Maybe Brownwood, TX is more north than I thought. For\
      \ example, Dallas is around 32.8\xB0 N. If Brownwood is west of Dallas but in\
      \ central Texas, maybe its latitude is similar or a bit lower. Let me check\
      \ with another approach. The coordinates for San Bernardino, CA are approximately\
      \ 34.1398\xB0 N, 117.2953\xB0 W. Brownwood, TX is approximately 31.7093\xB0\
      \ N, 98.9911\xB0 W. So yes, San Bernardino is at about 34.14\xB0 N, while Brownwood\
      \ is at 31.71\xB0 N. Since 31.71 is less than 34.14, Brownwood is further south.\
      \ Therefore, CSUSB in San Bernardino is north of HPU in Brownwood. Hence, the\
      \ answer is NO.\n</think>NO.  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate\

      \ N.  \n   - Brownwood, TX: ~31.71\xB0 N.  \n\n3. **Compare Latitudes:**  \n\
      \   Since 31.71\xB0 N (Brownwood) is south of 34.14\xB0 N (San Bernardino),\
      \ **CSUSB is north of HPU**.  \n\n**Answer:** NO."
    fcf9b050-2eea-454c-a570-f48c8aa39fe2: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ California State University, San Bernardino, CA is located south of Howard\
      \ Payne University in Texas. Let me start by recalling where each of these universities\
      \ is located.\n\nFirst, Howard Payne University is in Texas. I think it's in\
      \ a town called Brownwood. I remember that Brownwood is in central Texas, maybe\
      \ north of Austin. Then, California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB)\
      \ is in San Bernardino, California. San Bernardino is in Southern California,\
      \ east of Los Angeles. \n\nNow, to compare their latitudes. The further south\
      \ a place is, the lower its latitude. Latitude is measured from the equator,\
      \ so a lower latitude number means it's further south. So I need to find the\
      \ latitude coordinates of both universities and see which one is more south\
      \ (i.e., has a lower latitude number).\n\nLet me check the latitude for Howard\
      \ Payne University in Brownwood, TX. Brownwood's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 31.7\xB0 N latitude. I think San Bernardino, CA is around 34.1\xB0 N. Wait,\
      \ if that's correct, then San Bernardino would actually be north of Brownwood.\
      \ But wait, I thought San Bernardino is in Southern California. Maybe I got\
      \ the coordinates wrong. Let me verify.\n\nLooking up Howard Payne University's\
      \ location: Brownwood, TX. Quick check shows Brownwood's latitude is about 31.7163\xB0\
      \ N. Now, San Bernardino, CA: checking that, the latitude is approximately 34.1083\xB0\
      \ N. So 34.1\xB0 N for San Bernardino versus 31.7\xB0 N for Brownwood. Since\
      \ latitude increases as you go north, 31.7 is south of 34.1. So Howard Payne\
      \ in Texas is at a lower latitude (more south) than CSUSB in California. Therefore,\
      \ CSUSB is actually north of Howard Payne. Wait, but the question is asking\
      \ if CSUSB is south of Howard Payne. So based on the coordinates, no, because\
      \ 34.1 is north of 31.7. So the answer would be NO.\n</think>To determine if\
      \ California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB), CA is south of Howard\

      \ approximately **31.7\xB0 N** latitude.  \n2. **CSUSB** is in San Bernardino,\
      \ CA, with a latitude of roughly **34.1\xB0 N**.  \n3. Since lower latitude\

      \ So, the user wants to know if Oklahoma City University in Oklahoma is located\

      \ university is probably in or near the city. Let me confirm that. Yes, Oklahoma\
      \ City University is indeed located in Oklahoma City, OK. Now, where is Tarleton\
      \ State University? I think it's in Texas. Let me check. Tarleton State is part\
      \ of the Texas A&M University System, and its main campus is in Stephenville,\
      \ Texas. So, Tarleton State University is in Stephenville, TX.\n\nNext step\
      \ is to determine the geographical locations of these two cities. I need their\

      \ then the answer is no.\n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes. Oklahoma\
      \ City is in central Oklahoma. Stephenville, TX is in north-central Texas. Texas\

      \ precise.\n\nLooking up the coordinates: Oklahoma City, OK is at approximately\
      \ 35.4676\xB0 N latitude. Stephenville, TX is around 32.2207\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 32\xB0N would be further south. Wait,\

      \ N. Stephenville, TX's latitude is approximately 32.2207\xB0 N. So 32.22 is\
      \ south of 35.46. Therefore, Stephenville is south of Oklahoma City. Therefore,\

      \ NO, Oklahoma City University is not south of Tarleton State University; it's\
      \ actually north of it.\n\nWait, but this seems counterintuitive because Texas\
      \ is generally south of Oklahoma. However, Stephenville is in northern Texas,\
      \ close to the Oklahoma border. So even though Texas as a state is south of\
      \ Oklahoma, certain parts of Texas (especially the panhandle) are further north\
      \ than parts of Oklahoma. But in this case, Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma,\
      \ and Stephenville is in north-central Texas. Let me check a map. If I look\
      \ at a map, Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma, while Stephenville\
      \ is in north-central Texas, maybe a bit to the southwest of Dallas-Fort Worth.\
      \ So, comparing their latitudes, Oklahoma City is around 35.5\xB0N, and Stephenville\

      yes, Tarleton State is in Stephenville, TX. So now I need to determine the geographical\

      \ to see which is further south.\n\nOklahoma City is the capital of Oklahoma.\
      \ Stephenville is in northern Texas, I believe. Since Oklahoma is north of Texas,\
      \ generally, but both states are large, so maybe parts of Texas are further\

      \ precise.\n\nLooking up the coordinates: Oklahoma City, OK is at approximately\
      \ 35.4676\xB0 N latitude. Stephenville, TX is around 32.2207\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 32\xB0N would be further south. Wait,\
      \ but if Stephenville is at 32.22\xB0N and Oklahoma City is at 35.46\xB0N, then\
      \ Stephenville is actually further south. Wait, that would mean Tarleton State\
      \ in Texas is south of Oklahoma City University. But that contradicts the initial\
      \ thought that Texas is south of Oklahoma, but maybe the specific cities are\
      \ different.\n\nWait, let me double-check those coordinates. Maybe I mixed up\
      \ the numbers. Let me verify. Oklahoma City's latitude is indeed about 35.4676\xB0\
      \ N. Stephenville, TX's latitude is approximately 32.2207\xB0 N. So 32.22 is\
      \ south of 35.46. Therefore, Stephenville is south of Oklahoma City. Therefore,\
      \ Tarleton State University in Stephenville, TX is actually located south of\
      \ Oklahoma City University in Oklahoma. Wait, but the question is asking if\
      \ OKCU is south of Tarleton. So if Tarleton is at 32.22\xB0N and OKCU is at\
      \ 35.46\xB0N, then OKCU is north of Tarleton. Therefore, the answer would be\
      \ NO, Oklahoma City University is not south of Tarleton State University; it's\
      \ actually north of it.\n\nWait, but this seems counterintuitive because Texas\
      \ is generally south of Oklahoma. However, Stephenville is in northern Texas,\
      \ close to the Oklahoma border. So even though Texas as a state is south of\
      \ Oklahoma, certain parts of Texas (especially the panhandle) are further north\
      \ than parts of Oklahoma. But in this case, Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma,\
      \ and Stephenville is in north-central Texas. Let me check a map. If I look\
      \ at a map, Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma, while Stephenville\
      \ is in north-central Texas, maybe a bit to the southwest of Dallas-Fort Worth.\
      \ So, comparing their latitudes, Oklahoma City is around 35.5\xB0N, and Stephenville\
      \ is around 32.2\xB0N. That would mean Stephenville is further south. Therefore,\
      \ Tarleton State is south of Oklahoma City University. Therefore, the answer\
      \ is NO, Oklahoma City University is not south of Tarleton State; it's north\
      \ of it.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure the coordinates are accurate. Let\
      \ me confirm via a reliable source. Checking Oklahoma City's coordinates: according\
      \ to Google Maps, Oklahoma City is at approximately 35.4676\xB0 N, 97.5164\xB0\
      \ W. Stephenville, TX is at 32.2207\xB0 N, 98.2023\xB0 W. Yes, so Stephenville\
      \ is indeed at a lower latitude (32.22 vs 35.46). Therefore, Stephenville is\
      \ south of Oklahoma City. Therefore, Oklahoma City University (OK) is north\
      \ of Tarleton State University (TX). So the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if Oklahoma City University (OK) is south of Tarleton State University (TX):\
      \  \n1. **Locations**:  \n   - Oklahoma City University is in Oklahoma City,\
      \ OK (latitude ~35.4676\xB0 N).  \n   - Tarleton State University is in Stephenville,\
      \ TX (latitude ~32.2207\xB0 N).  \n\n2. **Latitude Comparison**:  \n   - A lower\
      \ latitude means a location is further south.  \n   - Stephenville, TX (32.22\xB0\
      \ N) has a lower latitude than Oklahoma City, OK (35.47\xB0 N).  \n\n**Conclusion**:\
      \ Since Tarleton State University (TX) is located at a lower latitude, it is\
      \ **south** of Oklahoma City University (OK).  \n\n**ANSWER: NO**"
    9c8e3e8c-ea14-4008-9afa-8fa2ed4fb506: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out whether\
      \ Oklahoma City University in Oklahoma is located south of Tarleton State University\
      \ in Texas. Hmm, first I need to know where exactly these two universities are.\
      \ \n\nStarting with Oklahoma City University (OCU), I think it's in Oklahoma\
      \ City, which is the capital of Oklahoma. So I should look up the coordinates\
      \ or at least the general location. Oklahoma City is in the central part of\
      \ Oklahoma. Now, Tarleton State University is in Texas. I believe Tarleton's\
      \ main campus is in Stephenville, Texas. Let me confirm that. Yes, Tarleton\
      \ State's main campus is in Stephenville, TX.\n\nNow I need to compare the latitudes\
      \ of these two cities because latitude determines how far north or south a place\
      \ is. The higher the latitude, the more north it is. So if OCU's latitude is\
      \ lower (more south) than Tarleton's, then the answer is yes.\n\nLet me recall\
      \ approximate latitudes. Oklahoma City is around 35.4676\xB0 N. Stephenville,\
      \ TX is in North Texas. I think Stephenville's latitude is higher. Maybe around\
      \ 32.2\xB0 N? Wait, wait, no. Wait, Stephenville is north of Dallas-Fort Worth.\
      \ Dallas is about 32.8\xB0 N. So Stephenville, being northwest of Dallas, might\
      \ be a bit higher. Let me check that. Actually, looking it up, Stephenville\
      \ is at approximately 32.2207\xB0 N latitude. Wait, that can't be right because\
      \ Dallas is at 32.8\xB0 N, and Stephenville is northwest of there. Maybe I'm\
      \ mixing up. Alternatively, maybe I should look up exact coordinates.\n\nWait,\
      \ perhaps I'm confusing the directions. Let me think. Oklahoma is north of Texas,\
      \ but not all of it. The Texas panhandle is further north than parts of Oklahoma.\
      \ Wait, the Oklahoma-Texas border runs along the Red River. The panhandle of\
      \ Texas is the very northern part, which is above the main body of Oklahoma.\
      \ So cities in the Texas panhandle, like Amarillo, are north of Oklahoma City.\
      \ But Stephenville isn't in the panhandle. Stephenville is in North Central\
      \ Texas, maybe around 32\xB0 N. Wait, but I need exact coordinates.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe using a map. Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma. If I imagine a map,\
      \ Texas is south of Oklahoma, but the panhandle of Texas is a strip that's north\
      \ of the main part of Oklahoma. Wait no, the Oklahoma panhandle is the part\
      \ of Oklahoma that's west of the main body, sticking up between Texas and Kansas.\
      \ Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe state of Oklahoma is shaped\
      \ like a rectangle with a panhandle on the west. The Texas panhandle is the\
      \ northernmost part of Texas, which borders Oklahoma to the north. So cities\
      \ in the Texas panhandle (like Amarillo) are north of most of Oklahoma. But\
      \ Stephenville, where Tarleton is located, is in North Central Texas, not in\
      \ the panhandle. So Stephenville's latitude is probably lower than Oklahoma\
      \ City's. Wait, no\u2014since Texas is south of Oklahoma, except for the panhandle.\
      \ So if a university is in Texas but not in the panhandle, it's likely south\
      \ of Oklahoma. Therefore, Tarleton State in Stephenville, TX would be south\
      \ of Oklahoma City, OK. But wait, that would mean Oklahoma City is north of\
      \ Tarleton. So the question is: Is OCU south of Tarleton? If Tarleton is in\
      \ Texas, but in the northern part, and OCU is in Oklahoma, but maybe Oklahoma\
      \ City is further south than Stephenville. Wait, maybe I have this backwards.\n\
      \nWait, perhaps I should look up the exact coordinates. Let me think. Oklahoma\
      \ City's latitude is approximately 35.4676\xB0 N. Stephenville, TX is at 32.2207\xB0\
      \ N. Wait, that can't be. 32\xB0 N would place Stephenville further south than\
      \ Oklahoma City. Wait, 35\xB0 N is higher latitude (more north) than 32\xB0\
      \ N. So if Oklahoma City is at 35.4676\xB0 N and Stephenville is at 32.2207\xB0\
      \ N, then Stephenville is actually south of Oklahoma City. Therefore, Oklahoma\
      \ City is north of Tarleton State. So the question is asking if OCU is south\
      \ of Tarleton State. The answer would be no. But I need to confirm these coordinates.\n\
      \nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check. Oklahoma City's latitude\
      \ is indeed around 35.4\xB0 N. Stephenville, TX is in Erath County. Looking\
      \ up Tarleton State University's location: their main campus is in Stephenville,\
      \ TX. The coordinates for Stephenville, TX are approximately 32.22\xB0 N, 98.20\xB0\
      \ W. So latitude is about 32.22\xB0 N. Oklahoma City is at 35.46\xB0 N. Since\
      \ 32.22\xB0 N is south of 35.46\xB0 N, that means Stephenville is south of Oklahoma\
      \ City. Therefore, Oklahoma City University is north of Tarleton State University.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is NO, OCU is not south of Tarleton State.\n</think>NO\
      \  \nOklahoma City University, OK (latitude ~35.47\xB0 N) is located north of\
      \ Tarleton State University in Stephenville, TX (latitude ~32.22\xB0 N). Since\
      \ latitude decreases as you move south, Tarleton State is farther south. Thus,\
      \ OCU is not south of Tarleton."
    bb585c5e-fccc-4a78-b295-05def0eec38e: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ Tarleton State is part of the Texas A&M system, and I think their main campus\
      \ is in Stephenville, Texas. So I need to check the geographic coordinates of\

      \ City is the capital of Oklahoma, which is in the central part of the state.\
      \ Texas is south of Oklahoma, but Tarleton State is in Stephenville, TX. Wait,\

      \ Wait, no, wait. Wait, if Stephenville is in Texas, which is south of Oklahoma,\
      \ then its latitude should be lower (more southern) than Oklahoma City. But\
      \ wait, maybe I have the numbers mixed up. Let me verify.\n\nWait, actually,\
      \ Oklahoma is north of Texas. So the northern border of Texas is at about 36\xB0\
      30' N (the panhandle), but most of Texas is south of that. Oklahoma's southern\
      \ border is the Red River, which is around 34\xB0 N. So Oklahoma City is in\
      \ central Oklahoma, which would be around 35.5\xB0 N. Stephenville, TX is in\
      \ north-central Texas. Let me check the exact coordinates.\n\nLooking up Oklahoma\
      \ City, OK: Latitude is approximately 35.4676\xB0 N. Stephenville, TX: Latitude\
      \ is about 32.2207\xB0 N. Wait, that can't be right because 32\xB0 N would be\
      \ much further south. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing Stephenville with another\
      \ city. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, Stephenville, TX is actually located\

      \ Therefore, Oklahoma City is north of Stephenville. So Tarleton State University\
      \ in Stephenville, TX is south of Oklahoma City University. Therefore, the answer\
      \ would be YES, Oklahoma City University is south of Tarleton State? Wait, no.\
      \ Wait, if OCU is at 35.46\xB0 N and Tarleton is at 32.22\xB0 N, then OCU is\
      \ north of Tarleton. So the question is asking if OCU is south of Tarleton.\
      \ That would be NO. Because 35.46 is north of 32.22. So the answer is NO. \n\
      \nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the coordinates. Let me confirm again.\
      \ Stephenville, TX latitude: 32.22\xB0 N. Oklahoma City, OK: 35.46\xB0 N. So\

      \ Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma. So maybe Stephenville is south of Oklahoma\
      \ City? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, let me think about the general\
      \ geography. The Texas-Oklahoma border runs east-west. Oklahoma is north of\
      \ Texas except for the panhandle. But Stephenville is in the northern part of\
      \ Texas, so it's possible that it's at a lower latitude (more south) than Oklahoma\

      \ maybe Oklahoma City is further south than some parts of Texas. For example,\
      \ the Texas panhandle is north of parts of Oklahoma. Wait, no. The Texas panhandle\
      \ is the part that sticks up, but Oklahoma is to the east of that. The border\
      \ between Texas and Oklahoma is along the Red River, which is the southern border\

      \ the answer would be NO, OCU is not south of Tarleton; it's north.\n\nBut I\
      \ should verify the exact coordinates. Let me try to recall approximate latitudes.\

      \ sure, but maybe around 32.2\xB0 N? Wait, that seems too far south. Wait, no.\
      \ Wait, Texas spans from around 25.8\xB0 N at the southern tip to 36.5\xB0 N\
      \ at the northern border. Stephenville is north-central, so maybe around 32.5\xB0\
      \ N? Or higher? Let me check my memory. Maybe I'm confusing with another city.\
      \ Wait, Dallas is around 32.8\xB0 N. Fort Worth is similar. Stephenville is\
      \ west of Dallas-Fort Worth area. So maybe a bit higher latitude. Wait, perhaps\
      \ 32.4\xB0 N? Or maybe higher. Wait, perhaps I should think of the general position.\
      \ Since Oklahoma's southern border is at 33.6\xB0 N, and Texas is south of Oklahoma.\
      \ Wait, no, Texas is south of Oklahoma's southern border. Wait, actually, the\

      \ Let me recall, maybe around 32 degrees north? Wait, no. Let me think: Dallas\
      \ is around 32.8\xB0 N. Stephenville is west of Fort Worth, which is part of\
      \ the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. So maybe Stephenville is a bit west but similar\
      \ latitude. Let me check in my mind. If Dallas is around 32.8\xB0 N, then Stephenville\
      \ might be a bit higher, maybe around 32.2\xB0 N? Wait, no, that can't be. Maybe\
      \ I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps Stephenville is at a higher latitude\
      \ than Oklahoma City. \n\nOklahoma City, OK's latitude is approximately 35.5\xB0\
      \ N. Wait, that's a big difference. So if Stephenville is in Texas at say 32.2\xB0\
      \ N, then Oklahoma City is at 35.5\xB0 N, which would be much further north.\
      \ Therefore, Tarleton State (in Stephenville) would be south of Oklahoma City.\
      \ Wait, but that would mean Oklahoma City is north of Tarleton. So the question\
      \ is asking if Oklahoma City University is south of Tarleton State. If Tarleton\
      \ is in Stephenville at 32.2\xB0 N, and Oklahoma City is at 35.5\xB0 N, then\
      \ Oklahoma City is north of Tarleton. Therefore, the answer would be NO. \n\n\
      But wait, am I remembering the latitudes correctly? Let me double-check. For\
      \ example, Dallas is around 32.8\xB0 N. Fort Worth is similar. Stephenville\
      \ is northwest of Fort Worth. So maybe Stephenville is actually at a higher\
      \ latitude than Dallas. Let me think about the map. If you go northwest from\
      \ Fort Worth, which is about 32.75\xB0 N, heading to Stephenville, which is\
      \ in Erath County. Checking in my mind, Stephenville's latitude is approximately\
      \ 32.22\xB0 N? Or maybe higher? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me consider\
      \ other cities. For example, Waco is around 31.55\xB0 N, Austin around 30.27\xB0\
      \ N. But Stephenville is northwest of Waco. Wait, but if you go northwest from\
      \ Waco, does the latitude increase or decrease? Latitude increases as you go\
      \ north. So moving northwest from Waco (31.55\xB0 N), Stephenville's latitude\
      \ would be higher. So perhaps Stephenville is around 32.4\xB0 N. Let me check\
      \ approximate coordinates. \n\nLooking up (mentally), Stephenville, TX: according\
      \ to my memory, its coordinates are approximately 32.22\xB0 N, 98.20\xB0 W.\
      \ Wait, that would make it around 32.22\xB0 N. But Oklahoma City is at 35.47\xB0\
      \ N. So 35.47 vs 32.22. That would mean Oklahoma City is significantly north\
      \ of Stephenville. Therefore, Oklahoma City University (in OKC) is north of\
      \ Tarleton State (Stephenville, TX). So the answer is NO, Oklahoma City University\
      \ is not south of Tarleton State University.\n</think>To determine if Oklahoma\

      \ is further south than Oklahoma City? Or the other way around?\n\nWait, let\
      \ me think about the general geography. Texas is south of Oklahoma. So the Texas-Oklahoma\
      \ border runs east-west. So the northernmost parts of Texas are along that border,\
      \ and Oklahoma is north of that. So if Tarleton State is in Stephenville, which\
      \ is in northern Texas, then Oklahoma City, being in central Oklahoma, would\
      \ be north of Stephenville. Therefore, OCU would be north of Tarleton, making\
      \ the answer NO. But I need to confirm the exact locations.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I should look up the approximate latitudes. Let me try to remember or\
      \ estimate. Oklahoma City is around 35.5 degrees North latitude. Stephenville,\

      N, and Fort Worth is similar. Stephenville is west of there, maybe around 32.2\xB0\

      \ I should probably find the locations of both universities. New Mexico State\
      \ University Carlsbad is in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Texas A&M University\u2013\
      Kingsville is in Kingsville, Texas. I need to compare their latitudes because\

      \ So, if Carlsbad, NM has a lower latitude than Kingsville, TX, then the answer\
      \ is YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nNow, I need to find the approximate latitudes of\
      \ both cities. Let me recall or look up the coordinates. Carlsbad, NM: I think\
      \ it's in the southeastern part of New Mexico, near the Texas border. Kingsville,\
      \ TX is in southern Texas, closer to the Gulf Coast. From memory, Kingsville\
      \ is pretty far south in Texas. Carlsbad, NM is also in the southern part of\

      \ tip of Texas (like Brownsville) is further south than most of New Mexico.\
      \ But Kingsville isn't the southernmost part of Texas. Let me get more precise.\n\
      \nLooking up the latitude of Carlsbad, NM. Let's say approximately. Carlsbad's\
      \ latitude is around 32.4 degrees North. Kingsville, TX's latitude is about\
      \ 27.5 degrees North. Wait, wait, that can't be right because 27 degrees is\

      \ its latitude is around 27.7 degrees North. Kingsville is just west of Corpus\
      \ Christi, so maybe around 27.5 degrees North. Carlsbad, NM is in southern New\
      \ Mexico, perhaps around 32 degrees North. If that's the case, then Kingsville\
      \ (27.5\xB0N) is further south than Carlsbad (32\xB0N). So Texas A&M\u2013Kingsville\
      \ would be south of NMSU Carlsbad. Therefore, the original question is asking\
      \ if NMSU Carlsbad is south of Texas A&M Kingsville. If Kingsville is at 27.5\xB0\
      N and Carlsbad at 32\xB0N, then Carlsbad is north of Kingsville. So the answer\
      \ would be NO, because 32\xB0N is north of 27.5\xB0N. So NMSU Carlsbad is actually\
      \ north of Texas A&M Kingsville.\n\nWait, but maybe I have the latitudes reversed.\
      \ Let me confirm. Using approximate coordinates:\n\nCarlsbad, NM: Latitude 32.4207\xB0\
      \ N.\n\nKingsville, TX: Latitude 27.5159\xB0 N.\n\nYes, so 27.5 is south of\
      \ 32.4. Therefore, Kingsville is further south. So NMSU Carlsbad is north of\
      \ Texas A&M Kingsville. Therefore, the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nNew Mexico\
      \ State University Carlsbad, NM (latitude ~32.4\xB0N) is located north of Texas\

    9ca45898-7893-444b-90dd-07ca0083e63d: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ New Mexico State University Carlsbad, NM is located south of Texas A&M University\u2013\
      Kingsville, TX. Let's start by recalling where these two universities are. \n\
      \nFirst, New Mexico State University Carlsbad is in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Texas\
      \ A&M\u2013Kingsville is in Kingsville, Texas. To determine which is further\
      \ south, I should compare their latitudes. The one with a lower latitude (more\
      \ south) would be the one located south of the other.\n\nI remember that in\
      \ the US, as you go further south, you get closer to the Mexican border. Both\
      \ New Mexico and Texas share a border with Mexico, so it depends on the specific\
      \ locations of these cities. \n\nLet me think about Carlsbad, NM. I know that\
      \ Carlsbad is in the southeastern part of New Mexico, near the Texas border.\
      \ It's famous for the Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Now, Kingsville, TX is\
      \ in southern Texas, closer to the Gulf Coast. I think Kingsville is pretty\
      \ far south in Texas. \n\nTo get accurate data, I should probably look up the\
      \ latitudes of both cities. But since I don't have access to that right now,\
      \ I'll have to use my general knowledge. Texas A&M-Kingsville is in South Texas,\
      \ maybe around the same latitude as Corpus Christi, which is on the Gulf. Corpus\
      \ Christi is around 27.8 degrees north latitude. Carlsbad, NM, on the other\
      \ hand, is more inland. Let me see, cities like El Paso, TX are at around 31.8\
      \ degrees north. If Carlsbad is in southeastern New Mexico, maybe its latitude\
      \ is around 32 degrees north. That would make it further north than Kingsville.\
      \ \n\nWait, but wait. Kingsville is south of Corpus Christi. Let me check another\
      \ city. For example, Brownsville, TX is at the southern tip of Texas, around\
      \ 25.9 degrees north. Kingsville is north of Brownsville. So if Corpus Christi\
      \ is 27.8, Kingsville might be around 27.5 or so? Wait, actually, I think Kingsville\
      \ is a bit northwest of Corpus Christi. Let me visualize Texas: Corpus is on\
      \ the coast. Kingsville is inland a bit, maybe 40 miles southwest of Corpus.\
      \ So maybe Kingsville is around 27.5 degrees north. \n\nCarlsbad, NM: let's\
      \ see. The approximate latitude for Carlsbad, NM is 32.4 degrees north. If that's\
      \ correct, then Carlsbad would be north of Kingsville, which would be around\
      \ 27.5. Therefore, Texas A&M\u2013Kingsville is further south. So, New Mexico\
      \ State University Carlsbad is not south of Texas A&M\u2013Kingsville. So the\

      \ TX**: Latitude \u2248 27.5\xB0N.  \n\nSince 27.5\xB0N (Kingsville) is farther\
      \ south than 32.4\xB0N (Carlsbad), the answer is **NO**.  \n\nANSWER: NO"
    9d883f60-30dd-4a17-a1d5-2df087649e48: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, we need to determine if New Mexico State University Carlsbad, NM is south\
      \ of Texas A&M University\u2013Kingsville, TX. Hmm, first, I need to find the\
      \ locations of both universities. \n\nStarting with New Mexico State University\
      \ Carlsbad. I know that New Mexico State University has several campuses, and\
      \ Carlsbad is one of them. Carlsbad is a city in southeastern New Mexico. Now,\
      \ Texas A&M University\u2013Kingsville is in Kingsville, Texas. Kingsville is\
      \ in southern Texas, I think. So, the question is about the latitude of these\
      \ two cities.\n\nLatitude is the key here because south means lower latitude.\
      \ So which city is further south: Carlsbad, NM or Kingsville, TX? \n\nWait,\
      \ let me get the approximate coordinates. Carlsbad, NM. Let me recall. Carlsbad\
      \ is in Eddy County. Maybe around 32\xB0N latitude. Kingsville, TX is in Kleberg\
      \ County. I think Kingsville is further south, maybe around 27\xB0N? Wait, Texas'\
      \ southernmost point is the Rio Grande Valley, around 26\xB0N. So Kingsville\
      \ is north of that but still in the southern part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe\
      \ I can think of major cities. For example, Corpus Christi is on the Texas coast,\
      \ and Kingsville is west of Corpus Christi. Corpus Christi is around 27.7\xB0\
      N. So Kingsville might be similar, maybe 27.8\xB0N or so. \n\nCarlsbad, NM:\
      \ I know that the Carlsbad Caverns are a big attraction there. Looking up in\
      \ my mind, the Carlsbad area is around 32\xB0N latitude. For example, the city\
      \ of Carlsbad, NM is at 32\xB025\u2032N. That's higher than Kingsville. So if\
      \ Kingsville is around 27\xB0N, then New Mexico State Carlsbad is north of Texas\
      \ A&M Kingsville. Therefore, the answer would be NO, because Carlsbad, NM is\
      \ north of Kingsville, TX.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure. Maybe I should\
      \ verify approximate coordinates. Let me think: Latitude lines. The southern\
      \ tip of Texas is at about 25\xB050'N. Austin is around 30\xB0N. San Antonio\
      \ is around 29\xB0N. So Kingsville, being south of Corpus Christi (27.7\xB0\
      N), would be around 27.5\xB0N. Carlsbad, NM is at 32.4\xB0N, which is definitely\
      \ higher. Therefore, Texas A&M Kingsville is further south. So the original\
      \ question: Is NMSU Carlsbad south of TAMUK? The answer is NO, because 32.4\xB0\
      N is north of 27.5\xB0N. So the university in Carlsbad, NM is north of the one\
      \ in Kingsville, TX.\n</think>To determine if New Mexico State University Carlsbad\

      \ TX**: Latitude \u2248 27\xB030\u2032N.  \n\nSince 32\xB025\u2032N (Carlsbad)\

      \ Bethel University in Tennessee is located south of the University of Mississippi\
      \ Medical Center School of Dentistry in Mississippi. Let me start by recalling\
      \ where these places are. \n\nFirst, Bethel University in Tennessee. I know\
      \ Tennessee is a state in the southeastern United States. Bethel University\
      \ has a main campus in McKenzie, TN. Wait, I should confirm that. Let me think\u2014\
      yes, I believe Bethel University's main campus is in McKenzie, which is in the\
      \ western part of Tennessee, maybe near the Tennessee River. \n\nThen the University\
      \ of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is in Mississippi. The University\
      \ of Mississippi Medical Center is in Jackson, MS, right? Because UMMC is the\
      \ health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi, and Jackson is the\
      \ capital of Mississippi. So the dental school is in Jackson.\n\nNow, I need\
      \ to compare the latitudes of McKenzie, TN, and Jackson, MS. The further south\
      \ a place is, the lower its latitude (since latitude increases as you go north).\
      \ So if McKenzie is at a lower latitude than Jackson, then Bethel would be south\
      \ of the dental school. But if Jackson is further south, then the answer is\
      \ no.\n\nLet me recall the approximate locations. Mississippi is south of Tennessee,\
      \ generally. But Tennessee's western part, like Memphis, is pretty far south.\
      \ However, McKenzie is in northwest Tennessee. Wait, let me get more precise.\
      \ Tennessee is bordered by Mississippi to the south. So the southern border\
      \ of Tennessee is the northern border of Mississippi. So cities in northern\
      \ Mississippi would be just south of Tennessee. Jackson is in central Mississippi,\
      \ so it's further south within the state. \n\nWait, so Jackson, MS is in the\
      \ central part of Mississippi. McKenzie, TN is in the northwest part of Tennessee.\
      \ Let me think about their coordinates. Maybe I should recall their approximate\
      \ latitudes. \n\nFrom what I remember, Memphis, TN is at around 35 degrees north\

      \ right because Memphis is just across the border from Mississippi. Let me check.\
      \ Actually, Memphis is at approximately 35.1495\xB0 N, and Jackson, MS is at\
      \ about 32.2988\xB0 N. That makes sense because as you go south into Mississippi,\
      \ latitude decreases. So Jackson is south of Memphis. \n\nBut wait, McKenzie,\
      \ TN is northwest of Memphis. Let me get the coordinates for McKenzie. McKenzie\
      \ is in Carroll County, TN. Looking it up in my mind, McKenzie's latitude is\
      \ approximately 36.1320\xB0 N. Jackson, MS is around 32.2988\xB0 N. So 36.132\
      \ vs. 32.2988. Since 32.2988 is lower than 36.132, Jackson is further south.\

      \ with Bethel University in Tennessee. I remember that Tennessee is a state\
      \ in the southeastern United States. Bethel University might not be one of the\
      \ most well-known universities, so I might need to look up its exact location.\
      \ I think Bethel University has a main campus in McKenzie, Tennessee. Let me\
      \ confirm that. Yes, checking the details, Bethel University's main campus is\
      \ indeed in McKenzie, TN. Now, where is McKenzie located within Tennessee? Tennessee\
      \ is a long state stretching from east to west. Cities like Memphis are in the\
      \ southwest, Nashville in the central part, and Knoxville in the east. McKenzie,\
      \ TN\u2014let me think. McKenzie is in the northwestern part of Tennessee, near\
      \ the Kentucky border. Specifically, it's in Carroll County. To get the coordinates,\
      \ maybe it's around 36.1320\xB0 N latitude? \n\nNext, the University of Mississippi\
      \ Medical Center School of Dentistry is in Mississippi. The University of Mississippi\
      \ Medical Center is in Jackson, MS, the capital city. So the dental school is\
      \ part of that medical center. Jackson, MS's coordinates are approximately 32.2988\xB0\
      \ N latitude. \n\nNow, the key here is comparing the latitudes. Since the Earth's\
      \ latitude increases as you go north, a lower latitude means a location is further\
      \ south. So if Bethel University in TN has a higher latitude than the University\
      \ of Mississippi's dental school in Jackson, MS, then Bethel is north of the\
      \ dental school. Conversely, if Bethel's latitude is lower, it's south. \n\n\
      Let me check the exact latitudes. For McKenzie, TN: Latitude is approximately\
      \ 36.1320\xB0 N. For Jackson, MS: 32.2988\xB0 N. Comparing these numbers, 36.1320\xB0\
      \ N is definitely higher than 32.2988\xB0 N. That means McKenzie, TN is north\
      \ of Jackson, MS. Therefore, Bethel University in Tennessee is actually north\
      \ of the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry in Mississippi.\
      \ \n\nWait, but the user is asking if it's located south. Since 36 is higher\
      \ than 32, Bethel is further north. So the answer should be NO. But let me make\
      \ sure I didn't mix up the locations. Sometimes people confuse states. Tennessee\
      \ is to the east of Mississippi, but latitude is the main factor here. McKenzie,\
      \ TN is in the northwest part of Tennessee, which is adjacent to the northern\
      \ part of Mississippi. Jackson is in central Mississippi. But even the northern\
      \ part of Mississippi would have a lower latitude than the southern parts. Wait,\
      \ but latitude lines are horizontal. So, for example, the northernmost point\
      \ of Mississippi would be around 35\xB0 N, but Jackson is at around 32.3\xB0\
      \ N. So McKenzie, TN at 36.1\xB0 N is definitely north of that. \n\nTherefore,\
      \ Bethel University in TN is north of the University of Mississippi Medical\
      \ Center in MS. So the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if Bethel University,\
      \ TN is south of the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry,\
      \ MS:  \n1. **Bethel University** is located in **McKenzie, TN**, at approximately\

      \ N** (Jackson), Bethel University is **not** south of the dental school.  \n\

      \ be in the western part, maybe near Memphis? Wait, Memphis is in the southwest\
      \ corner of Tennessee. But actually, McKenzie is in the northwestern part of\
      \ Tennessee, near the Kentucky border. Let me confirm that. Yeah, McKenzie is\
      \ in Carroll County, Tennessee. Coordinates might help. Let me think\u2014McKenzie's\

      \ of approximately 32.2988\xB0 N. \n\nWait, latitude is the key here. The lower\
      \ the latitude, the further south a location is. So if Bethel University is\
      \ at 36.1328\xB0 N and the dental school is at 32.2988\xB0 N, then 32 is lower\
      \ than 36. That means the dental school in Jackson is actually further south.\

      \ geographical locations of both institutions and compare their latitudes.\n\
      \nFirst, let me find out where Bethel University in Tennessee is. Bethel University\
      \ has a main campus in McKenzie, Tennessee. McKenzie is a city in the northwestern\
      \ part of Tennessee, near the Kentucky border. Now, I should get the coordinates\
      \ for McKenzie, TN. If I recall correctly, McKenzie's latitude is around 36.1320\xB0\
      \ N. I can double-check that, but I think that's accurate.\n\nNext, the University\
      \ of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is in Jackson, Mississippi.\
      \ Jackson is the capital of Mississippi and is located in the central part of\
      \ the state. The latitude for Jackson, MS is approximately 32.2988\xB0 N. \n\
      \nNow, to determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.\
      \ The lower the latitude, the further south a location is. So, if Bethel University's\
      \ latitude is higher than the School of Dentistry's, then Bethel is north of\
      \ it, not south. \n\nLooking at the numbers: Bethel is at 36.1320\xB0 N and\
      \ Jackson is at 32.2988\xB0 N. Since 32.2988 is less than 36.1320, Jackson is\
      \ further south. That means the University of Mississippi Medical Center is\
      \ actually south of Bethel University. Therefore, Bethel University, TN is located\
      \ north of the School of Dentistry in Mississippi, not south. \n\nWait, let\
      \ me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. Latitude increases as you go north.\

    57acc2b2-5762-4ccc-8a2b-a2e491478aa0: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Bethel University in Tennessee is located south of the University of Mississippi\
      \ Medical Center School of Dentistry in Mississippi. Let's start by breaking\
      \ down the problem.\n\nFirst, I should probably find the locations of both institutions.\
      \ Let me recall where these places are. Bethel University in TN\u2014I know\
      \ Tennessee is a state in the southeastern United States. The University of\
      \ Mississippi Medical Center is in Mississippi, which is just south of Tennessee.\
      \ So the School of Dentistry would be part of that medical center in Mississippi.\n\
      \nNow, I need to check the specific cities where each is located. Bethel University\
      \ in Tennessee: I'm not exactly sure, but I think Bethel has multiple campuses.\
      \ Let me think... Ah, Bethel University's main campus is in McKenzie, Tennessee.\
      \ Right, McKenzie, TN. And the University of Mississippi Medical Center\u2014\
      the main campus is in Jackson, Mississippi. So the School of Dentistry would\
      \ be in Jackson, MS.\n\nNext step, find the geographical coordinates of both\
      \ cities to compare their latitudes. Because the question is about being south,\
      \ latitude is key. The further south (lower latitude) a location is, the more\
      \ southern it is.\n\nSo, McKenzie, TN: Let me recall or estimate. Tennessee\
      \ is north of Mississippi, but cities in southern Tennessee might be closer.\
      \ Wait, McKenzie is in the northwestern part of Tennessee. I remember that Memphis\
      \ is in southwest TN, but McKenzie is more northwest. Jackson, MS is the capital\
      \ of Mississippi, located in the central part of the state. So comparing the\
      \ two, which is further south?\n\nAlternatively, maybe look up approximate latitudes.\
      \ Let me try to remember. Memphis, TN is around 35 degrees north latitude. Jackson,\
      \ MS is a bit further south, maybe around 32 degrees north. But wait, McKenzie\
      \ is northwest of Memphis. So McKenzie would be at a higher latitude than Memphis.\
      \ So if Memphis is 35\xB0N, McKenzie might be like 36\xB0N. Jackson, MS is around\
      \ 32.3\xB0N. So then, Bethel University in McKenzie (36\xB0N) would be north\
      \ of Jackson (32.3\xB0N), so the answer would be NO. Because 36 is higher than\
      \ 32.3, meaning McKenzie is north of Jackson. Therefore, Bethel University is\
      \ north of the dental school in Mississippi, so the answer is NO.\n\nWait, but\
      \ I should confirm this. Let me try to get more precise coordinates. If I can't\
      \ remember exactly, maybe use general knowledge. Tennessee's northern border\
      \ is at about 36.5\xB0N, and the southern border is around 35\xB0N. Mississippi's\
      \ northern border is around 35\xB0N, same as Tennessee's southern border. So\
      \ Jackson is in central Mississippi, which is around 32\xB0N. So McKenzie, TN\
      \ being in the northwest part of TN would be around 36\xB0N. Therefore, 36\xB0\
      N vs 32\xB0N. So yes, Bethel University is north of the dental school. Therefore,\

    10779474-b369-475f-bb93-dd73d22d47c5: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Northeast Wisconsin Technical College in Wisconsin is located south of Andrews\
      \ University in Michigan. Let me start by recalling where these two places are\
      \ \n\nFirst, I know that Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (NWTC) is in\
      \ Wisconsin. Wisconsin is a state in the Midwest, right? And Andrews University\
      \ is in Michigan, which is another Midwestern state, to the east of Wisconsin.\
      \ Now, the question is about their relative latitudes\u2014whether NWTC is south\
      \ of Andrews University.\n\nLet me think about their cities. I should probably\
      \ find the specific cities where each institution is located. For Andrews University,\
      \ I believe it's in Berrien Springs, Michigan. As for NWTC, it's located in\
      \ Green Bay, Wisconsin. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm: Yes, Northeast\
      \ Wisconsin Technical College's main campus is in Green Bay, WI. Andrews University\
      \ is indeed in Berrien Springs, MI. \n\nNow I need the coordinates of both cities.\
      \ Latitude is the key here. The one with the lower latitude is farther south.\
      \ So I should look up the latitudes of Green Bay, WI, and Berrien Springs, MI.\
      \ \n\nFrom what I remember, Green Bay is in northeastern Wisconsin. Berrien\
      \ Springs is in the southwestern part of Michigan, near the Indiana border.\
      \ Hmm, Michigan's lower peninsula has a southern area that's quite far south.\
      \ For example, parts of Michigan are actually south of parts of Wisconsin. Let\
      \ me think about the general positions: Wisconsin is to the west of Michigan's\
      \ upper peninsula, but the lower peninsula of Michigan extends southward. \n\
      \nSo, Berrien Springs, MI, being in the southwest of Michigan's lower peninsula,\
      \ might actually be further south than Green Bay, WI. Let me check approximate\
      \ latitudes. Green Bay's latitude is around 44.5 degrees north. Berrien Springs,\
      \ MI, I think, is around 41.9 degrees north. Wait, if that's the case, then\
      \ Berrien Springs is actually south of Green Bay. Wait, but the question is\
      \ asking if NWTC (Green Bay, WI) is south of Andrews University (Berrien Springs,\
      \ MI). If Berrien Springs is at 41.9\xB0N and Green Bay is at 44.5\xB0N, then\
      \ Green Bay is north of Berrien Springs. Therefore, the answer would be NO,\
      \ because a higher latitude means more north. \n\nWait, let me make sure I have\
      \ the coordinates right. Let me recall: The latitude increases as you go north.\
      \ So 44.5\xB0N is higher than 41.9\xB0N, meaning Green Bay is north of Berrien\
      \ Springs. Therefore, Andrews University in Berrien Springs is south of Green\
      \ Bay. So the original question is: Is NWTC (Green Bay) south of Andrews University\
      \ (Berrien Springs)? The answer would be NO, because Green Bay is actually north\
      \ of Berrien Springs. \n\nBut wait, maybe I got the cities mixed up. Let me\
      \ double-check. Andrews University is in Berrien Springs, MI. Yes. And Northeast\
      \ Wisconsin Technical College is in Green Bay, WI. Correct. \n\nSo, the latitude\
      \ of Green Bay: a quick check in my mind\u2014Green Bay is near Lake Michigan's\
      \ western shore. Cities like Milwaukee are at around 43\xB0N, and Green Bay\
      \ is a bit north of that, so maybe 44.5\xB0N is accurate. Berrien Springs, MI,\
      \ on the other hand, is in the southwestern part of Michigan, close to the Indiana\
      \ border. Indiana's northern border is around 41.7\xB0N, so Berrien Springs\
      \ would be just north of that, maybe around 41.9\xB0N. \n\nTherefore, Green\
      \ Bay at 44.5\xB0N is north of Berrien Springs at 41.9\xB0N. So the answer is\
      \ NO, Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is not south of Andrews University.\
      \ It's actually north of it.\n</think>To determine if Northeast Wisconsin Technical\

      \nFirst, I need to figure out where each institution is located. Let's start\
      \ with Northeast Wisconsin Technical College. I know that Wisconsin is a state\
      \ in the Midwest, and \"Northeast\" in the name suggests it's in the northeastern\
      \ part of Wisconsin. I recall that Green Bay is a major city in that area. Maybe\
      \ NWTC is in Green Bay? Let me confirm that. A quick check (if I were to look\
      \ it up) shows that the main campus of NWTC is indeed in Green Bay, WI.\n\n\
      Next, Andrews University. That's in Michigan. I know Michigan has two peninsulas:\
      \ the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula. Andrews University, I think,\
      \ is in the southwest part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Specifically, I believe\
      \ it's in Berrien Springs, MI. Let me verify that. Yes, Andrews University is\
      \ located in Berrien Springs, Michigan.\n\nNow, I need to compare the latitudes\
      \ of Green Bay, WI, and Berrien Springs, MI, to determine which is further south.\
      \ Latitude is the key here because south is determined by lower latitude. \n\
      \nGreen Bay, WI's coordinates are approximately 44.5192\xB0 N, 88.0198\xB0 W.\
      \ Berrien Springs, MI is around 41.9467\xB0 N, 86.3389\xB0 W. \n\nComparing\
      \ the latitudes: 44.5192\xB0 N (Green Bay) vs. 41.9467\xB0 N (Berrien Springs).\
      \ Since 41.9467 is less than 44.5192, Berrien Springs is further south. Therefore,\
      \ Andrews University in Michigan is south of Green Bay, WI. \n\nBut the question\
      \ is whether NWTC (Green Bay, WI) is south of Andrews University (Berrien Springs,\
      \ MI). Since Green Bay is at a higher latitude (more north), the answer would\
      \ be NO. NWTC is actually north of Andrews University.\n</think>NO  \n**Explanation**:\
      \  \n1. **Locations**:  \n   - Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (NWTC)\
      \ is in Green Bay, WI (latitude ~44.5\xB0N).  \n   - Andrews University is in\
      \ Berrien Springs, MI (latitude ~41.9\xB0N).  \n\n2. **Latitude Comparison**:\

      \ Springs, MI (41.9\xB0N) is south of Green Bay, WI (44.5\xB0N).  \n\nThus,\

      \ University might be around 41.9470\xB0 N latitude.\n\nNext, Northeast Wisconsin\
      \ Technical College. The main campus is in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Green Bay is\
      \ in northeastern Wisconsin, along Lake Michigan. The latitude of Green Bay\
      \ is approximately 44.5133\xB0 N. \n\nComparing the two latitudes: Green Bay,\
      \ WI is at around 44.5\xB0 N, and Berrien Springs, MI is around 41.9\xB0 N.\
      \ Since latitude increases as you go north, a higher latitude means a more northern\
      \ location. Therefore, Green Bay (NWTC) is north of Berrien Springs (Andrews\
      \ University). So, Andrews University is actually south of NWTC. Therefore,\
      \ the question is asking if NWTC is south of Andrews University. Wait, no\u2014\
      if Andrews is at 41.9\xB0N and NWTC is at 44.5\xB0N, then NWTC is north of Andrews.\
      \ So the answer would be NO, because the technical college in Wisconsin is actually\
      \ north of the university in Michigan.\n</think>NO  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Locate Andrews University, MI**: It is in Berrien Springs, Michigan,\
      \ near the Indiana border. Latitude \u2248 41.95\xB0N.  \n2. **Locate Northeast\
      \ Wisconsin Technical College (NWTC), WI**: Main campus is in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\
      \ Latitude \u2248 44.51\xB0N.  \n3. **Compare Latitudes**: Since 44.51\xB0N\
      \ (NWTC) is farther north than 41.95\xB0N (Andrews), NWTC is **not** south of\
      \ Andrews University.  \n\n**Answer:** NO"
    f066a355-7f3a-4ef8-aead-a497d77cfc49: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Northeast Wisconsin Technical College in Wisconsin is located south of Andrews\
      \ University in Michigan. Let's start by recalling where these two institutions\
      \ are. \n\nFirst, I know Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (NWTC) is in\
      \ Wisconsin. The name includes \"Northeast,\" so it's probably in the northeastern\
      \ part of the state. Maybe in Green Bay or nearby? I think Green Bay is a major\
      \ city in that region, so NWTC might be there. \n\nAndrews University is in\
      \ Michigan. I believe Andrews University is in Berrien Springs, Michigan. Let\
      \ me check that in my mind. Yes, I recall that Andrews University is located\
      \ in Berrien Springs, MI. \n\nNow, I need to compare the latitudes of these\
      \ two places to determine which is further south. The one with the lower latitude\
      \ is south of the other. \n\nSo, where is Berrien Springs, MI? Berrien County\
      \ is in the southwestern part of Michigan, near the Indiana border. So Berrien\
      \ Springs is in the southwest of Michigan, close to Lake Michigan's eastern\
      \ shore. \n\nGreen Bay, WI, on the other hand, is in northeastern Wisconsin,\
      \ also along Lake Michigan but on the western shore. \n\nLatitude-wise, I think\
      \ that places in southern Michigan are further south than northern Wisconsin.\
      \ For example, the southern border of Michigan is around 41.7 degrees North\
      \ (like the Indiana border), whereas Green Bay, WI, is higher. Let me get approximate\
      \ latitudes.\n\nBerrien Springs, MI: Let me recall. Cities like Benton Harbor\
      \ or St. Joseph, MI, are in that area. Their latitudes are around 42.1 degrees\
      \ North. Wait, no\u2014if they're near the Indiana border, maybe lower. Indiana's\
      \ northern border is at about 41.7\xB0N. So Berrien Springs might be around\
      \ 41.9\xB0N. \n\nGreen Bay, WI: Its latitude is approximately 44.5\xB0N. \n\n\
      Comparing 44.5\xB0N (Green Bay) vs. 41.9\xB0N (Berrien Springs) would mean that\
      \ Berrien Springs is further south. So if NWTC is in Green Bay, then it's north\
      \ of Andrews University. Therefore, the answer would be NO, Northeast Wisconsin\
      \ Technical College is not south of Andrews University; it's actually north.\n\
      \nWait, but I need to confirm the exact locations. Let's see. Northeast Wisconsin\
      \ Technical College's main campus is indeed in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Andrews\
      \ University is in Berrien Springs, MI. \n\nLooking up their coordinates (from\
      \ memory or general knowledge), Green Bay's latitude is around 44.5133\xB0 N,\
      \ and Berrien Springs is approximately 41.9467\xB0 N. So yes, 44.5 is definitely\
      \ north of 41.9. Therefore, NWTC is north of Andrews University. Hence, the\
      \ answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if Northeast Wisconsin Technical College\
      \ (NWTC), WI is south of Andrews University, MI:  \n1. **Locations**:  \n  \
      \ - NWTC's main campus is in Green Bay, WI.  \n   - Andrews University is in\
      \ Berrien Springs, MI.  \n2. **Latitudes**:  \n   - Green Bay, WI: ~44.5\xB0\
      N.  \n   - Berrien Springs, MI: ~41.9\xB0N.  \n3. **Comparison**: Since 44.5\xB0\
      N (Green Bay) is farther north than 41.9\xB0N (Berrien Springs), NWTC is **north**\
      \ of Andrews University.  \n\nANSWER: NO"

      \ GMC. So since WCU has a higher latitude, it's more north. So the answer should\
      \ be NO. Let me just double-check the latitudes to be sure. Yes, 38.54\xB0N\

      \ is around 33.7490\xB0 N. But where exactly is Georgia Military College located?\
      \ I think GMC has its main campus in Milledgeville, GA. Let me confirm that.\
      \ Yes, a quick check in my mind tells me that the main campus is indeed in Milledgeville.\
      \ So, what's the latitude of Milledgeville? I might not remember exactly, but\
      \ since it's in central Georgia, maybe around 33\xB0 N. Let's say approximately\
      \ 33.08\xB0 N. \n\nNow, Western Colorado University (WCU) in Colorado. Colorado\
      \ is a more northern state compared to Georgia. The state's latitude ranges\
      \ from about 37\xB0 N to 41\xB0 N. Western Colorado University is in Gunnison,\
      \ CO. What's the latitude there? Gunnison is in the central part of Colorado,\
      \ but I think it's in the mountains. I recall that Gunnison is at a higher elevation,\
      \ which might not directly affect latitude, but maybe the town's latitude is\
      \ around 38.5\xB0 N. Let me think\u2014if Denver is about 39.7\xB0 N, and Gunnison\

      \ is a part of the university, so it's located there. Now, where is Charlottesville\
      \ in Virginia? Virginia is on the East Coast, and Charlottesville is in the\
      \ central part of the state, maybe a bit to the north. \n\nNow, I need to compare\
      \ the latitudes of Muncie, IN and Charlottesville, VA to see which is further\
      \ south. Latitude determines north-south position. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the farther north. So if Charlottesville has a lower latitude than Muncie,\
      \ then Ball State would be north of UVA Center, meaning UVA is south. Wait,\
      \ no, wait. If a place has a lower latitude, it's further south. So if Muncie's\
      \ latitude is higher than Charlottesville's, then Muncie is north, Charlottesville\
      \ south. So Ball State would be north, so the answer would be NO, Ball State\
      \ is not south of UVA Center.\n\nLet me get approximate latitudes. Muncie, Indiana's\
      \ latitude is around 40.2\xB0 N. Charlottesville, Virginia is approximately\
      \ 38.03\xB0 N. So 40.2\xB0N vs. 38.03\xB0N. Since 38.03 is less than 40.2, Charlottesville\
      \ is further south. Therefore, Muncie (Ball State) is north of Charlottesville\
      \ (UVA Center). Therefore, Ball State is NOT south of UVA Center. So the answer\
      \ is NO.\n</think>To determine if Ball State University, IN is south of the\

      \ I think it's in Muncie, Indiana. The University of Virginia is in Charlottesville,\
      \ Virginia. The Center for Politics is part of UVA, so it's probably in Charlottesville\

      \ how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the farther north\

      \ me check. \n\nMuncie, IN's latitude is approximately 40.1939\xB0 N. Charlottesville,\
      \ VA is about 38.0293\xB0 N. Comparing those, 40.19\xB0 N vs. 38.03\xB0 N. Since\

      \ I'll start with Ball State University. I know it's in Indiana. The main campus\
      \ is in Muncie, Indiana. I'm not exactly sure of the exact coordinates, but\
      \ I think Indiana is in the Midwest, so probably around the central part of\

      \ Virginia is actually further north than I thought. Like, for example, Washington\
      \ D.C. is around the same latitude as parts of Virginia. Let me recall that\
      \ the Mason-Dixon line separates the North and South, and Virginia is below\
      \ that line. But latitude-wise, how far north is Charlottesville compared to\
      \ Muncie?\n\nMaybe I should look up the approximate latitudes. Ball State in\
      \ Muncie, Indiana: I think Muncie's latitude is around 40\xB011' N. Let me check\
      \ that in my mind. Wait, cities like Indianapolis are around 39\xB046' N, so\
      \ maybe Muncie is a bit north of that. Let's say roughly 40\xB0 N. \n\nThen\
      \ Charlottesville, VA. The University of Virginia there. Charlottesville's latitude\
      \ is approximately 38\xB002' N. So that's around 38 degrees north. If that's\
      \ correct, then Charlottesville is at a lower latitude (more south) than Muncie.\
      \ So if Charlottesville is 38\xB0 N and Muncie is 40\xB0 N, then Ball State\
      \ University would be north of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\
      \ Therefore, the answer would be NO, it's not south. \n\nWait, but I need to\
      \ confirm these latitudes. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again.\
      \ For example, Washington D.C. is around 38.9\xB0 N, which is almost 39\xB0\
      \ N. If Charlottesville is in Virginia, maybe a bit southwest of D.C., so maybe\
      \ slightly lower latitude. Let's say Charlottesville is around 38\xB0 N. Muncie,\
      \ Indiana: I think it's in the northern part of Indiana. Indiana's southern\
      \ border is around 38\xB0 N (since the 38th parallel runs through parts of the\
      \ US, like the southern border of Missouri and Kentucky). Wait, Kentucky is\
      \ south of Indiana. Kentucky's northern border is the Ohio River, which is about\
      \ 38.5\xB0 N. So Indiana's southern border is around 38\xB0 N, and Muncie is\
      \ in the northern part of Indiana. So Muncie would be around 40\xB0 N. \n\n\
      That would make Charlottesville at 38\xB0 N and Muncie at 40\xB0 N. So Charlottesville\
      \ is south of Muncie, meaning Ball State is north of UVA's Center for Politics.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if Ball State University\

      \ For example, Oklahoma City is around 35.5\xB0N. Lexington, KY is about 38\xB0\
      N. Wait, but Morehead is in eastern Kentucky. Let me think: Morehead, KY's latitude\

      \ Wait, but maybe I mixed up the cities. Let me double-check mentally. \n\n\
      Wait, Kentucky is generally in the mid-latitudes. Oklahoma is south of Kansas,\

      \ maybe around 34.7\xB0N as I thought. \n\nMeanwhile, Morehead, KY is in eastern\
      \ Kentucky. Let's see: Lexington is around 38\xB0N, and Morehead is northeast\

      \ a bit higher latitude? Or maybe not. Wait, Kentucky's shape is a bit slanted.\
      \ Let me visualize a map. Kentucky is bordered by Virginia to the east, which\
      \ is higher in latitude. Morehead is near the border with West Virginia. Hmm,\
      \ but West Virginia's latitude is similar to Kentucky's. So Morehead's latitude\

      \ in Ada, OK at 34.7\xB0N is significantly further south. That would mean Morehead\

      \ latitudes to see which one is further south.\n\nStarting with Morehead State\
      \ University. I know that Morehead State is in Kentucky. Kentucky is a state\
      \ in the southeastern part of the United States. Morehead City... Wait, no,\
      \ Morehead is the city. Morehead, KY. I should probably get the exact coordinates\
      \ or at least the general region. Kentucky is bordered by states like Tennessee\
      \ to the south, so Morehead is likely in the northern part if it's considered\
      \ part of East Central or not. Wait, actually, Morehead State's official location\
      \ is in Morehead, Rowan County, Kentucky. Let me recall: Kentucky's latitude.\
      \ The approximate latitude of Morehead, KY. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively,\
      \ I can think of major cities. Lexington is in central Kentucky, and Morehead\
      \ is east of Lexington, near the West Virginia border. So perhaps Morehead is\
      \ in the northeastern part of Kentucky? If that's the case, its latitude might\
      \ be higher, meaning further north.\n\nNow, East Central University is in Oklahoma.\
      \ The university is located in Ada, Oklahoma. Ada is in the southern part of\
      \ Oklahoma, I believe. Oklahoma is south of Kansas and north of Texas. So Ada,\
      \ OK would be in the central or southern part. If I can compare the latitudes\
      \ of Morehead, KY and Ada, OK, that would answer the question.\n\nLet me try\
      \ to recall approximate latitudes. For example, Oklahoma City is around 35.5\
      \ degrees North. Ada is probably similar, maybe a bit further south. Morehead,\
      \ KY: Kentucky's latitude ranges from about 36.5\xB0N to 39\xB0N. Lexington,\
      \ KY is around 38\xB0N. If Morehead is east of Lexington, maybe it's around\
      \ the same latitude or slightly north. Wait, no, eastern Kentucky is part of\
      \ the Appalachian region. Let me check mentally: States like West Virginia are\
      \ to the east, and their latitude is similar to Kentucky. West Virginia's northern\
      \ panhandle is around 40\xB0N, but most of it is lower. Maybe Morehead is around\
      \ 38.2\xB0N or so. Ada, OK: If it's in southern Oklahoma, maybe around 34.5\xB0\
      N. If that's the case, then Ada would be south of Morehead, making Morehead\
      \ State University north of East Central University. Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be NO, Morehead State is not south of East Central University.\n\nWait, but\
      \ I should verify. Let me think of another approach. The southern border of\
      \ Kentucky is along the 36.5\xB0N latitude, as the Tennessee border is at 36.5\xB0\
      N. So Morehead, being in Kentucky, would be north of that. Ada, OK: Oklahoma's\
      \ southern border is at 33.6\xB0N (with Texas), so Ada is somewhere in between.\
      \ If Ada is in the southern half of Oklahoma, it's probably around 34.5\xB0\
      N to 35\xB0N. So 34.5\xB0N would be south of 36.5\xB0N. Therefore, Morehead,\
      \ KY at around 38\xB0N would be north of Ada, OK, which is around 34.5\xB0N.\
      \ So Morehead is north, meaning East Central University is further south. Therefore,\

      \ further south. \n\nI don't remember the exact latitudes off the top of my\
      \ head. Let me think... Maybe approximate based on known cities? Wait, Kentucky\
      \ is in the eastern part of the US, and Oklahoma is more in the southern central\
      \ region. But I'm not sure if Kentucky is north or south compared to Oklahoma.\
      \ Like, Oklahoma is below Kansas, right? And Kentucky is south of Ohio, but\
      \ north of Tennessee. Tennessee is south of Kentucky. So Oklahoma's position...\
      \ Let me visualize a map. \n\nKentucky is in the southeastern area, bordering\
      \ Tennessee to the south. Oklahoma is west of Arkansas and north of Texas. So\
      \ maybe Oklahoma is further south than Kentucky? Wait, but Kentucky is not the\
      \ deep south. For instance, Nashville, TN is at about 36 degrees latitude. Oklahoma\
      \ City, OK is around 35.5 degrees, so maybe a bit south. But where exactly are\
      \ the universities located?\n\nMorehead, KY: I think it's in northeastern Kentucky.\
      \ Let me see... If I recall, the approximate latitude for Morehead, KY is around\
      \ 38 degrees north. Ada, OK, where East Central University is, I believe is\
      \ around 34.7 degrees north. So 34.7 is further south than 38. So that would\
      \ mean East Central University is south of Morehead State. Wait, but the question\
      \ is asking if Morehead is south of East Central. So if Morehead is at 38 and\
      \ ECU is at 34.7, then Morehead is north, not south. So the answer would be\
      \ NO. \n\nBut I should verify these coordinates to make sure. Maybe I can recall\
      \ or think of other cities. For example, Oklahoma is generally lower in latitude\
      \ than Kentucky. Like, Oklahoma City is around 35.5 N, and Louisville, KY is\
      \ about 38.2 N. So Oklahoma is definitely south of Kentucky. Therefore, any\
      \ university in Oklahoma (assuming ECU is in the southern part) would be south\
      \ of a Kentucky university. Wait, but Ada is in southeastern Oklahoma. So if\
      \ ECU is in Ada, OK, and Morehead is in KY, then ECU is south of Morehead. Therefore,\
      \ Morehead State is north of East Central, so the answer is NO.\n</think>To\

      \ University in Washington. I know Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest.\
      \ The main campus of Saint Martin's is in Lacey, WA. Let me confirm that. Yes,\
      \ Saint Martin's University is indeed in Lacey, Washington. Now, Lacey's coordinates...\
      \ I think it's near the state capital, Olympia. So, Olympia is in the western\

      \ be around 47 degrees North.\n\nNext, Gannon University in Pennsylvania. Gannon\
      \ is located in Erie, PA. Erie is in the northwestern part of Pennsylvania,\
      \ right on Lake Erie. The latitude for Erie, PA. Let me recall... Erie is at\
      \ about 42 degrees North latitude. Wait, because Pennsylvania is further south\
      \ compared to Washington state. For example, Seattle, WA is around 47.6\xB0\

      \ is in the northwestern part of the US, right? Like, near Seattle. Gannon University\
      \ is in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is more in the northeast, like towards the\
      \ east coast. \n\nNow, I need to compare their latitudes. The further north\
      \ a place is, the higher its latitude. So, if Saint Martin's is in Washington,\
      \ I should check the city it's in. Let me recall... Saint Martin's University\
      \ is in Lacey, Washington. And Gannon University is in Erie, Pennsylvania. \n\
      \nWait, where is Lacey, WA exactly? Lacey is near the state capital, Olympia.\
      \ So, western Washington, close to the Pacific. Erie, PA is in the northwestern\
      \ part of Pennsylvania, on Lake Erie. \n\nNow, to compare their latitudes. Let\
      \ me think about the approximate latitudes. For example, Seattle, WA is around\
      \ 47.6\xB0 N. Erie, PA is around 42.1\xB0 N. But wait, if Saint Martin's is\
      \ in Lacey, which is near Olympia, then Olympia's latitude is about 47.04\xB0\
      \ N. Erie is around 42.1\xB0 N. So, if Lacey is at 47\xB0 N and Erie is at 42\xB0\
      \ N, then Erie is actually further south. That would mean Saint Martin's University\
      \ is north of Gannon. Therefore, the answer would be NO, Saint Martin's is not\
      \ south of Gannon. \n\nWait, but maybe I got the coordinates reversed? Let me\
      \ double-check. Maybe I should look up the exact coordinates. But since I can't\
      \ do that right now, I'll rely on general knowledge. Washington State is definitely\
      \ north of Oregon, and Oregon is north of California. Pennsylvania is further\
      \ east but also lower in latitude compared to Washington. For example, New York\
      \ City is around 40.7\xB0 N, and Erie is north of NYC but still, Pennsylvania's\
      \ northern border is around 42\xB0 N. Washington State's southern border is\
      \ around 45.5\xB0 N, so even the southern part of Washington is north of Erie,\
      \ PA. So Lacey, WA being at around 47\xB0 N is definitely north of Erie's 42\xB0\
      \ N. Therefore, Saint Martin's University is north, so the answer is NO.\n</think>Saint\
      \ Martin's University in Lacey, Washington, is located at approximately **47.04\xB0\

      \nWait, Erie, PA is right on Lake Erie, which is one of the Great Lakes. The\

      \ Martin's is at 47\xB0N, then no, Saint Martin's is north. But maybe I have\
      \ the latitudes wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the numbers. Let me check.\
      \ For example, New York City is around 40.7\xB0N. Erie, PA is further north\

      Next, I need to compare their latitudes to see which is further south. Latitude\

      \ CO. From what I remember, Colorado's latitude ranges. Denver is around 39.7\xB0\
      N. Grand Junction is further west but maybe a similar latitude. Let me think.\
      \ Actually, Grand Junction's latitude is approximately 39.06\xB0N. \n\nSanta\
      \ Barbara, CA's latitude. Santa Barbara is around 34.42\xB0N. So comparing 34.42\xB0\
      N (Santa Barbara) versus 39.06\xB0N (Grand Junction). Since 34.42 is lower than\
      \ 39.06, Santa Barbara is further south. Therefore, Colorado Mesa University\

      \ Pittsburgh, maybe. Wait, actually, Indiana is a borough in Indiana County,\
      \ PA. Looking it up mentally, Indiana, PA's coordinates are approximately 40.62\xB0\
      N latitude. Let me jot that down as around 40.6\xB0N.\n\nNow, moving on to the\
      \ University of North Carolina Wilmington. Wilmington, NC. North Carolina is\
      \ a southern state, so I would expect it to be further south. But where exactly\
      \ is Wilmington? It's on the southeastern coast of NC, near the South Carolina\
      \ border. Let me think about the latitude. For example, Raleigh, NC is around\
      \ 35.8\xB0N. Wilmington is further south and east. So maybe around 34.2\xB0\
      N? Because if you look at the coast, Wilmington is quite far south. Let me verify\

      \ the two latitudes: Indiana University of PA is at ~40.6\xB0N, and UNCW is\
      \ at ~34.2\xB0N. Since latitude decreases as you go south, the lower the latitude,\
      \ the more southerly the location. Therefore, UNCW at 34.2\xB0N is significantly\

      \ So, for example, Phoenix is around 33.45\xB0 N. Flagstaff is higher, around\
      \ 35.1983\xB0 N. Prescott, AZ is at about 34.585\xB0 N. So Prescott Valley would\
      \ be similar to Prescott, maybe around 34.6\xB0 N. \n\nFresno, CA is at 36.7378\xB0\
      \ N. So if Fresno is at ~36.7\xB0 N and Northcentral University is in Prescott\
      \ Valley, AZ at ~34.6\xB0 N, then Fresno is actually north of Prescott Valley.\
      \ Because 36.7 is higher than 34.6. So that would mean California State University,\
      \ Fresno is NORTH of Northcentral University, AZ. Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be NO, it's not south.\n\nBut wait, maybe I got the location of Northcentral\
      \ University wrong. What if it's in Phoenix instead? Phoenix is at 33.45\xB0\
      \ N. Then Fresno at 36.7\xB0 N would still be north. Even if the university\
      \ is in Tucson, which is 32.2\xB0 N, Fresno is still north. So in all cases,\
      \ Fresno, CA is north of any location in Arizona. Wait, is that possible? Because\
      \ Arizona is south of California. Let me think about the geography. California\
      \ is to the west of Arizona, right? The two states are adjacent. The southern\
      \ part of California borders Arizona. But the latitude depends on where exactly.\
      \ For example, San Diego, CA is at 32.7\xB0 N, which is lower than parts of\
      \ Arizona. So San Diego is south of some parts of Arizona. But Fresno is in\
      \ central California, which is much further north. So yes, Fresno would be north\
      \ of all of Arizona. Because Arizona's northern border is at 37\xB0 N, but California's\
      \ southern border is at 32.5\xB0 N. Wait, maybe I need to double-check that.\n\
      \nWait, the northern border of Arizona is along the 37th parallel north, which\
      \ is the same latitude as the southern parts of Utah. California's northern\
      \ border is at 42\xB0 N, but its southern border is at 32.5\xB0 N. So Arizona's\
      \ northernmost point is 37\xB0 N, which is north of some parts of California,\
      \ like San Diego (32.7\xB0 N). But Fresno is at 36.7\xB0 N, which is just a\
      \ bit south of 37\xB0 N. So the northern border of Arizona is 37\xB0 N, meaning\
      \ that the very northern edge of Arizona is slightly north of Fresno. So if\
      \ Northcentral University is located in the northernmost part of Arizona (like\
      \ near the Utah border), then it would be north of Fresno. But if it's in a\
      \ city like Flagstaff (35.2\xB0 N) or Prescott (34.5\xB0 N), then Fresno (36.7\xB0\
      \ N) is north of those.\n\nWait, so if the university is in the northern part\
      \ of Arizona, like Page, AZ (36.9\xB0 N), which is near Lake Powell, then that's\
      \ north of Fresno (36.7\xB0 N). So if Northcentral University were in Page,\
      \ AZ, then it would be slightly north of Fresno. But I don't think Northcentral\
      \ University is in Page. Let me think\u2014Northcentral University is an online\
      \ university, perhaps? Wait, I think Northcentral University is based in San\
      \ Diego, but no, the question says AZ. Wait, maybe it's in Scottsdale, AZ. Let\
      \ me check my memory: Northcentral University is now known as NCU and is headquartered\
      \ in San Diego, but has administrative offices in Arizona? Wait, maybe I'm confusing\

      \ whether California State University, Fresno, CA is located south of Northcentral\
      \ University, AZ. Hmm, okay, first I need to know the locations of both universities.\
      \ \n\nLet me start with California State University, Fresno. Fresno is a city\
      \ in California, right? California is on the west coast of the US. I think Fresno\
      \ is in the central part of California, maybe in the San Joaquin Valley. Now,\
      \ Northcentral University in Arizona\u2014where is that exactly? I'm not as\
      \ familiar with Arizona's geography. Northcentral University, from the name,\
      \ sounds like it's in the northern part of Arizona. Maybe in a city like Flagstaff\
      \ or Prescott?\n\nWait, let me confirm. I should check the exact locations.\
      \ But since I can't look it up right now, I'll have to go off what I know. Let's\
      \ recall that Arizona is east of California. The northern part of Arizona shares\
      \ a border with southern Utah. Cities in northern Arizona include Flagstaff,\
      \ which is known for being near the Grand Canyon. If Northcentral University\
      \ is in northern Arizona, maybe its latitude is higher (more north) than Fresno,\
      \ CA.\n\nNow, where is Fresno in terms of latitude? I know that in California,\
      \ the major cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles are more towards the coast.\
      \ Fresno is inland. Let me think about the approximate latitudes. San Francisco\
      \ is around 37\xB0N, Los Angeles around 34\xB0N. Fresno is between them, maybe\
      \ around 36.7\xB0N. What about northern Arizona? Flagstaff is around 35\xB0\
      N, but wait, that's actually a bit south of Fresno. Wait, that can't be right.\
      \ Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I\
      \ mixed up the latitudes. Let's see: Los Angeles is about 34\xB0N. San Francisco\
      \ is 37\xB0N. Fresno is northeast of LA, so maybe around 36.7\xB0N. Now, Flagstaff,\
      \ AZ is at 35\xB011' N. So that's around 35.2\xB0N. So Fresno would be at a\
      \ higher latitude (more north) than Flagstaff. If Northcentral University is\
      \ in Flagstaff, then Fresno would be north of it. But wait, is Northcentral\
      \ University actually in Flagstaff? Wait, I think Northcentral University is\
      \ an online university based in Arizona, but their headquarters might be in\
      \ a specific city. Let me see. Northcentral University was originally based\
      \ in Prescott Valley, Arizona. Prescott Valley is in Yavapai County. Let me\
      \ check Prescott Valley's latitude. Prescott Valley is around 34.61\xB0N. So\
      \ that's lower than Fresno's 36.7\xB0N. Wait, but 34.61 is south of 36.7. So\
      \ in that case, if Northcentral University is in Prescott Valley at 34.61\xB0\
      N, then Fresno's 36.7\xB0N would be north of that. So Fresno would be north\
      \ of Northcentral University. Therefore, the answer would be NO, Fresno is not\
      \ south of Northcentral University, AZ.\n\nWait, but maybe I got the locations\
      \ wrong. Let me double-check. If Northcentral University is in Scottsdale, Arizona,\
      \ maybe? Wait, Scottsdale is around 33.5\xB0N. That's even further south. So\
      \ Fresno at 36.7\xB0N would definitely be north. So regardless, if Northcentral\
      \ University is in northern Arizona, but northern Arizona cities like Flagstaff\
      \ (35\xB0N) or Prescott Valley (34.6\xB0N) are still south of Fresno's latitude\
      \ of 36.7\xB0N. Therefore, California State University, Fresno would be north\
      \ of Northcentral University in Arizona. So the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine\

      \ AZ, then that's in north-central Arizona. \n\nSo Fresno, CA: latitude-wise,\
      \ where is that? Fresno's coordinates are approximately 36.7378\xB0 N, 119.7871\xB0\
      \ W. Prescott Valley, AZ: let's see, Prescott Valley is around 34.6100\xB0 N,\
      \ 112.3157\xB0 W. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 34.6\xB0 N is actually\
      \ more southern than Fresno's 36.7\xB0 N. Because latitude increases as you\
      \ go north. So if Prescott Valley is at 34.6\xB0 N, then it's south of Fresno,\
      \ which is at 36.7\xB0 N. Therefore, Fresno would be north of Prescott Valley.\
      \ But wait, the question is if Fresno is south of Northcentral University. If\
      \ Northcentral is in Prescott Valley at 34.6\xB0 N, then Fresno at 36.7\xB0\
      \ N is north of that. So the answer would be NO.\n\nWait, but maybe I got the\
      \ location of Northcentral University wrong. Let me verify. A quick check: Northcentral\
      \ University is headquartered in San Diego, California? Wait, no, that's National\
      \ University. Northcentral University, according to my knowledge, was established\
      \ in Arizona and has its administrative offices in Scottsdale, AZ. Wait, Scottsdale\
      \ is in the Phoenix metropolitan area, which is around 33.5\xB0 N latitude.\
      \ So Scottsdale, AZ is at about 33.5\xB0 N, which is definitely south of Fresno's\
      \ 36.7\xB0 N. So if Northcentral University is in Scottsdale, then Fresno is\
      \ north of it, meaning the answer is NO. \n\nBut earlier I thought Prescott\
      \ Valley was around 34.6\xB0 N. If the university is there, then same logic:\
      \ 34.6 is still south of 36.7, so Fresno is north. Wait, but the question is\
      \ asking if Fresno is south of Northcentral. So if Northcentral is in a location\
      \ that's north of Fresno, then answer would be YES. But if Northcentral is south\
      \ of Fresno, then answer is NO. \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the universities.\
      \ Let me get exact locations. California State University, Fresno is definitely\
      \ in Fresno, CA. Coordinates: 36.7378\xB0 N. Now, Northcentral University: according\
      \ to a quick check (even though I can't browse, but relying on prior knowledge),\
      \ Northcentral University is an online university that was founded in Arizona\
      \ and has its administrative offices in Scottsdale, AZ. Scottsdale's latitude\
      \ is approximately 33.4942\xB0 N. So Scottsdale is at 33.5\xB0 N, which is south\
      \ of Fresno's 36.7\xB0 N. Therefore, Fresno is north of Scottsdale. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is NO, because Fresno is not south of Northcentral University (which\
      \ is in Scottsdale, AZ). \n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe Northcentral University's\
      \ main campus is in a different part of Arizona. For example, if it's in Flagstaff,\
      \ which is at 35.1983\xB0 N, that's still north of 36.7\xB0 N? Wait, no: 35.1983\
      \ is less than 36.7, so Flagstaff is at 35.2\xB0 N. Fresno is 36.7\xB0 N. So\
      \ Flagstaff is south of Fresno. So if Northcentral were in Flagstaff, then Fresno\
      \ would be north of it, answer still NO. \n\nAlternatively, if Northcentral\
      \ were in a northern Arizona city like Page, AZ, which is around 36.9147\xB0\
      \ N, then Fresno at 36.7378\xB0 N would be slightly south of that. But Page\
      \ is at 36.9147, so that's north of Fresno. But I don't think Northcentral University\
      \ is in Page. \n\nWait, but according to my knowledge, Northcentral University\
      \ is based in Scottsdale, AZ. So Scottsdale is definitely south of Fresno. Therefore,\
      \ Fresno is north of Scottsdale, meaning the answer is NO. \n\nBut let me just\
      \ double-check the latitudes. Fresno, CA: 36.7378\xB0 N. Scottsdale, AZ: approximately\
      \ 33.4942\xB0 N. 33.5 is south of 36.7, so Scottsdale is south of Fresno. Therefore,\
      \ Fresno is north of Scottsdale. Therefore, the question is asking if Fresno\
      \ is south of Northcentral University (Scottsdale). The answer is NO.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if California State University, Fresno (CSUF) is south of Northcentral\
      \ University (NCU), AZ:  \n1. **CSUF's location**: Fresno, CA, at approximately\
      \ **36.7378\xB0 N** latitude.  \n2. **NCU's location**: Administrative offices\
      \ are in Scottsdale, AZ, at roughly **33.4942\xB0 N** latitude.  \n\nSince **36.7378\xB0\

      \ California State University, Fresno, CA is located south of Northcentral University,\

      \ California State University, Fresno. I know that Fresno is a city in California.\
      \ I'm not exactly sure where in California, but I think it's in the central\
      \ part of the state. Maybe in the Central Valley? I remember that cities like\

      \ might be somewhere in the middle.\n\nNow, Northcentral University, AZ. The\
      \ AZ stands for Arizona, right? So that's in Arizona. But where in Arizona?\
      \ The name \"Northcentral\" might be a hint. Maybe it's in the north-central\
      \ part of Arizona. Let me think about Arizona's geography. The capital is Phoenix,\
      \ which is in the central part. Then there's Flagstaff up north, which is a\
      \ bigger city. Maybe Northcentral University is in a place like Prescott or\
      \ Flagstaff? Or maybe it's an online university? Wait, I should check if it's\
      \ a physical campus. A quick search in my mind: Northcentral University was\
      \ an online university based in Arizona, but I think they might have a physical\
      \ location in San Diego, CA? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe they have\
      \ their headquarters in Arizona. Let me clarify. \n\nWait, Northcentral University\
      \ is now part of National University System, and their headquarters is in La\
      \ Jolla, California. But originally, it was based in Prescott, Arizona. Hmm,\
      \ but maybe the question is referring to their main campus. If the university\
      \ is in Arizona, then I need to find its location. Let me assume that Northcentral\
      \ University's main campus is in Prescott, AZ. Prescott is in north-central\
      \ Arizona. \n\nSo now, I need to compare the latitudes of Fresno, CA and Prescott,\
      \ AZ. Which one is further south? Latitude is the key here. If Fresno is at\
      \ a lower latitude (more south) than Prescott, then the answer is YES. Otherwise,\
      \ NO.\n\nI know that Fresno, CA is in the Central Valley. Let me recall approximate\
      \ latitudes. San Francisco is around 37\xB0N. Los Angeles is about 34\xB0N.\
      \ Fresno is between them, maybe around 36.7\xB0N. Prescott, AZ: Arizona's latitude.\
      \ Phoenix is around 33.4\xB0N. Flagstaff is higher, around 35.2\xB0N. Prescott\
      \ is north of Phoenix but south of Flagstaff. Let me check: Prescott's latitude\

      N. Prescott, AZ: Let's see. Prescott is in Yavapai County. Its latitude is approximately\
      \ 34.54\xB0N. So 34.5\xB0N. So Fresno is at 36.7\xB0N, Prescott at 34.5\xB0\
      N. That means Prescott is further south than Fresno. Therefore, California State\

    cc397ece-653d-4bea-bddf-5054ea0c2ab4: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ California State University, Fresno, CA is located south of Northcentral University,\
      \ AZ. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know the locations\
      \ of both universities. Let's start with California State University, Fresno.\
      \ That's in Fresno, California. I know Fresno is in the central part of California,\
      \ maybe in the Central Valley. So where exactly is Fresno on the map? I think\
      \ it's in the San Joaquin Valley, which is part of the Central Valley. Geographically,\
      \ California is a large state, stretching a lot from north to south. Major cities\
      \ like San Francisco are in the north, and Los Angeles is in the south. But\
      \ Fresno... I'm not sure if it's more towards the middle or the southern part.\n\
      \nNow, Northcentral University is in Arizona. Wait, but Arizona is a different\
      \ state. Northcentral University... hmm, I'm not as familiar with that one.\
      \ Let me check in my mind: Northcentral University is an online university based\
      \ in Arizona, maybe? Or is it a physical campus? Wait, I think they have their\
      \ main offices in San Diego, California, but their headquarters might be in\
      \ Arizona. Wait, no, maybe they're based in Scottsdale, AZ. Let me think again.\
      \ Northcentral University is an accredited online university headquartered in\
      \ San Diego, but perhaps they have a physical presence in Arizona. Wait, maybe\
      \ I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify: Northcentral University was originally\
      \ founded in Arizona, perhaps in Prescott or another city. Wait, perhaps their\
      \ administrative offices are in Arizona. I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe the question is referring to Northern Arizona University, which is a\
      \ well-known public university in Flagstaff, AZ. But the question specifically\
      \ says Northcentral University, AZ. So that's a different institution. Let me\
      \ check again. Northcentral University is an online university, and according\
      \ to my previous knowledge, it's based in Arizona. So their main campus or administrative\
      \ office is in Arizona, perhaps Scottsdale or another city. So I need to find\
      \ where exactly in Arizona Northcentral University is located.\n\nAssuming that\
      \ Northcentral University is located in a city in Arizona, I need to compare\
      \ the latitudes of Fresno, CA and that city in Arizona to determine which is\
      \ further south. Since the question is asking if CSU Fresno is south of Northcentral\
      \ University, AZ, I need to see if the latitude of Fresno is lower (south) than\
      \ that of Northcentral University's location in Arizona.\n\nLet me recall: Arizona\
      \ is to the east of California. The southern part of Arizona, like Tucson, is\
      \ quite far south, close to the Mexican border. But northern Arizona, like Flagstaff,\
      \ is at a higher latitude. If Northcentral University is in northern Arizona,\
      \ like Flagstaff, then Fresno might be south of it. But if it's in southern\
      \ Arizona, like Phoenix or Tucson, Fresno might be north. Wait, Phoenix is central\
      \ Arizona, but still, depends on exact latitude.\n\nSo first, let's get approximate\
      \ latitudes. Fresno, CA is around 36.7378\xB0 N. Flagstaff, AZ is around 35.1983\xB0\
      \ N. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me verify. Wait, maybe\
      \ I got that wrong. Let me think: San Francisco is about 37.7\xB0 N. Los Angeles\
      \ is about 34\xB0 N. Fresno is in between, so maybe around 36.7\xB0 N, which\
      \ is correct. Flagstaff, AZ is at approximately 35.1983\xB0 N. Wait, that would\
      \ mean Flagstaff is actually south of Fresno? But that can't be. Wait, no, maybe\
      \ I got the numbers wrong. Let me think again. Phoenix, AZ is about 33.4\xB0\
      \ N, so that's south of Fresno. But Flagstaff is in northern Arizona and is\
      \ at a higher elevation. Let me look up approximate latitudes.\n\nFresno, CA:\
      \ Approximately 36.7378\xB0 N.\n\nPhoenix, AZ: Approximately 33.4484\xB0 N.\
      \ So Phoenix is south of Fresno. Flagstaff, AZ is around 35.1983\xB0 N. So that's\
      \ still north of Phoenix but south of Fresno (since 35.1983 is less than 36.7378).\
      \ Wait, 35.1983 is ~35.2\xB0 N, and Fresno is ~36.7\xB0 N, so 35.2 is south\
      \ of 36.7. So if Northcentral University is in Phoenix (33.4\xB0), that's further\
      \ south. If it's in Flagstaff (~35.2\xB0), then it's still south of Fresno.\
      \ If it's in Prescott, AZ, which is around 34.54\xB0 N, that's also south of\
      \ Fresno.\n\nBut where exactly is Northcentral University located? Let me recall.\
      \ Northcentral University is an online university, so perhaps it doesn't have\
      \ a traditional campus, but its headquarters. According to my knowledge, Northcentral\
      \ University is headquartered in San Diego, California, but I might be confusing\
      \ it with another institution. Wait, maybe it's based in Arizona. Let me check\
      \ mentally: if I search for Northcentral University's location, I think they\
      \ are based in Scottsdale, Arizona. Scottsdale, AZ is part of the Phoenix metropolitan\
      \ area. So Scottsdale's latitude is around 33.4942\xB0 N. That's even a bit\
      \ south of Phoenix's 33.4484\xB0 N. So Scottsdale is around 33.5\xB0 N.\n\n\
      So if Northcentral University is in Scottsdale, AZ (33.5\xB0 N), then Fresno,\
      \ CA is at 36.7\xB0 N. Comparing latitudes, 33.5\xB0 N is south of 36.7\xB0\
      \ N. Therefore, Northcentral University in AZ would be south of Fresno, CA.\
      \ Therefore, the question is asking if CSU Fresno is south of Northcentral University,\
      \ AZ. If Northcentral is in Scottsdale (33.5\xB0 N), then Fresno (36.7\xB0 N)\
      \ is north of it. Therefore, the answer would be NO.\n\nBut wait, maybe the\
      \ university is in a different part of Arizona. Let me confirm the exact location\
      \ of Northcentral University. I think Northcentral University is an online institution,\
      \ so their administrative offices might be in Arizona. Let's see: a quick search\
      \ in my mind... Yes, Northcentral University is headquartered in San Diego,\
      \ California? Wait, no, conflicting information. Alternatively, I remember that\
      \ Northcentral University was established in Prescott, Arizona, but later moved.\
      \ Alternatively, maybe it's in Scottsdale, AZ. Let me verify. \n\nAssuming that\
      \ Northcentral University's headquarters is in Scottsdale, AZ (approx 33.5\xB0\
      \ N), then Fresno, CA at 36.7\xB0 N would be north of that. Therefore, the answer\
      \ is NO, because Fresno is north of Scottsdale, AZ. However, if Northcentral\
      \ were located in northern Arizona, like Flagstaff (35.2\xB0 N), then Fresno\
      \ (36.7\xB0 N) is north of Flagstaff, so again, Flagstaff is south of Fresno.\
      \ Wait, 35.2 is less than 36.7, so yes, Flagstaff is south of Fresno. Therefore,\
      \ regardless of whether Northcentral University is in northern or southern Arizona,\
      \ Fresno would be north of it. Wait, but Arizona's southern border is at 31\xB0\
      \ N, and its northern border is around 37\xB0 N. So northern Arizona is up to\
      \ 37\xB0 N. Let me check: the latitude of the northern border of Arizona is\
      \ 37\xB0 N. That's the same as the latitude of Fresno, which is 36.7\xB0 N.\
      \ So if Northcentral University is in northern Arizona near 36.7\xB0 N, then\
      \ it could be at a similar latitude. But generally, cities in northern Arizona\
      \ like Page (36.9\xB0 N) are slightly north of Fresno. Wait, Page, AZ is at\
      \ 36.9\xB0 N, which is north of Fresno's 36.7378\xB0 N. So if Northcentral were\
      \ in Page, then it would be north of Fresno. But Page is a small town, and I\
      \ don't think the university is there.\n\nBut the key here is determining where\
      \ exactly Northcentral University is located in Arizona. If the university is\
      \ in the northern part of Arizona, near the Utah border, it's possible that\
      \ it's north of Fresno. But most major cities in Arizona, like Phoenix, Tucson,\
      \ Flagstaff, etc., are south of Fresno's latitude. For example, Flagstaff is\
      \ at 35.1983\xB0 N, which is south of Fresno. Phoenix is further south. So unless\
      \ the university is in a very northern city in Arizona, like Page or somewhere\
      \ close to 37\xB0 N, it would be south of Fresno. But I don't think Northcentral\
      \ University is in such a northern location. It's more likely in a major city\
      \ like Phoenix or Scottsdale. Let's confirm:\n\nUpon checking (mentally), Northcentral\
      \ University is based in San Diego, California? Wait, that conflicts with the\
      \ question which says Northcentral University, AZ. Wait, the question states\
      \ Northcentral University is in AZ. So perhaps I was incorrect earlier. Let's\
      \ correct that. If the university is indeed in Arizona, then it's located there.\
      \ So if their administrative office is in Scottsdale, AZ, which is in the Phoenix\
      \ area, then latitude ~</think>"

      \ step.\n\nFirst, I should find out where each university is located. The University\
      \ of Mary is in North Dakota (ND), and Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA).\
      \ Now, I need their exact cities to check their latitudes since the question\

      \ Rapids, Iowa. So now, the key is to compare the latitudes of Bismarck, ND,\
      \ and Cedar Rapids, IA.\n\nLatitude measures how far north or south a place\
      \ is. The higher the latitude, the farther north. So if Bismarck has a higher\
      \ latitude than Cedar Rapids, then it's farther north, meaning University of\

      \ to recall or figure out the approximate latitudes of these two cities. Let's\
      \ start with Bismarck, ND. North Dakota is in the northern part of the US. Bismarck\
      \ is the capital. From what I remember, North Dakota's latitude is around 46-47\
      \ degrees north. Let me think\u2014Minnesota is to the east, which has Minneapolis\
      \ at about 44-45 degrees. Since North Dakota is further north, Bismarck might\
      \ be around 46.8 degrees north latitude. \n\nCedar Rapids, Iowa. Iowa is south\
      \ of Minnesota, so it's further south. Des Moines, Iowa's capital, is around\
      \ 41.5 degrees north. Cedar Rapids is in eastern Iowa, so maybe similar or slightly\
      \ higher. Wait, Cedar Rapids might be a bit north of Des Moines. Let me visualize\
      \ a map. Iowa is between Minnesota (north) and Missouri (south). Cedar Rapids\
      \ is in the eastern part, near Iowa City. Maybe around 42 degrees north? Let's\
      \ say approximately 42.0 degrees north latitude.\n\nComparing the two: If Bismarck\
      \ is around 46.8\xB0N and Cedar Rapids is around 42.0\xB0N, then Bismarck is\
      \ significantly north of Cedar Rapids. Therefore, the University of Mary in\
      \ Bismarck, ND, would be north of Mount Mercy in Cedar Rapids, IA. So the answer\
      \ would be NO, University of Mary is not south of Mount Mercy\u2014it's to the\
      \ north.\n\nWait, but wait a second\u2014maybe I should double-check the exact\
      \ coordinates to be sure. Let me think again. Bismarck's latitude is approximately\
      \ 46.8083\xB0 N, and Cedar Rapids is approximately 41.9779\xB0 N. Yes, 46.8\
      \ vs. 42.0. So Cedar Rapids is at a lower latitude (more south) than Bismarck.\
      \ Therefore, the University of Mary is north of Mount Mercy. So the answer is\
      \ NO.\n</think>The University of Mary is located in Bismarck, ND (latitude ~46.8\xB0\
      N), while Mount Mercy University is in Cedar Rapids, IA (latitude ~42.0\xB0\

      \ York, Massachusetts, and maybe others. The question specifies the NY location,\
      \ so I should focus on that. I think their New York campus is in Albany, the\
      \ state capital. Now, Widener University in Delaware\u2014I remember that Widener\
      \ has a law school in Wilmington, Delaware. So Widener's Delaware campus is\
      \ in Wilmington.\n\nNext step is to determine the geographical positions. Albany,\
      \ NY is in upstate New York, along the Hudson River. Wilmington, DE is in the\
      \ northern part of Delaware, near the border with Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\
      \ Now, comparing their latitudes: the key is to see which is further north.\

      \ the geographic locations of both places. \n\nStarting with the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater. I know that Wisconsin is a state in the Midwest.\
      \ Whitewater is a city in Wisconsin. I might not remember the exact coordinates,\
      \ but I can think about the general location. Wisconsin is north of Illinois,\
      \ which is where Chicago is. Since Chicago is around 41 degrees north latitude,\
      \ maybe Wisconsin is a bit further north? Let me check in my mind\u2014Madison,\
      \ the capital of Wisconsin, is at about 43 degrees north. Whitewater is a bit\
      \ southeast of Madison, so maybe around 42.8 degrees north or so. I'm not 100%\
      \ sure, but that's a rough estimate.\n\nNow, the Graduate School of Social Work\
      \ is part of the University of Denver in Colorado. Denver is a major city in\
      \ Colorado, known as the Mile-High City. I recall that Denver's latitude is\
      \ approximately 39.7 degrees north. So Denver is south of the 40th parallel.\
      \ \n\nComparing the two latitudes: If UW-Whitewater is around 42.8 degrees north\

      \ that means Whitewater is north of Denver. Therefore, UW-Whitewater is not\
      \ south of the University of Denver's location. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't\
      \ mix up the latitudes. Maybe I should double-check some key cities. For example,\
      \ Chicago is about 41.8 degrees north. If Whitewater is in southeastern Wisconsin,\
      \ maybe it's near the Illinois border. Let's say Whitewater is at 42.8\xB0N,\

      \ N. \n\nNow, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater is in Whitewater,\
      \ Wisconsin. Whitewater is a city in southeastern Wisconsin. I believe Wisconsin\

      \ of both places. \n\nFirst, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater. I\
      \ remember that Whitewater is in Wisconsin. Maybe I can look up its latitude.\
      \ From what I recall, Wisconsin is in the northern part of the US, but I'm not\
      \ exactly sure where Whitewater is specifically. Let me think. Wisconsin is\
      \ north of Illinois, right? So cities like Milwaukee are in southeastern Wisconsin.\
      \ Whitewater might be somewhere in the southern part of the state. \n\nAnd then\
      \ the University of Denver is in Colorado. Denver is a well-known city, so I\

      \ is more towards the center of the US. But I need the exact coordinates for\
      \ both.\n\nWait, latitude is the key here because that determines north-south\

      \ University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater has a lower latitude than the University\
      \ of Denver's Graduate School of Social Work, then it would be south of it.\
      \ \n\nLet me try to recall or estimate. Denver is at about 39.7 degrees north\
      \ latitude. I think that's correct. Now, what about Whitewater, WI? Let me think.\
      \ Madison, Wisconsin's capital, is around 43 degrees north. Since Whitewater\
      \ is in Wisconsin and maybe south of Madison? Let's check. If Madison is at\
      \ 43, and Whitewater is in southern Wisconsin, maybe around 42.8 or so? Wait,\
      \ but Denver is 39.7. Wait, 42.8 is higher than 39.7, meaning that Whitewater\

      \ latitude means it's more north. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me confirm.\
      \ Let me check approximate latitudes. Denver, CO's latitude is approximately\
      \ 39.7392\xB0 N. And University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater is in Whitewater,\
      \ WI. Let's see, Whitewater, WI's coordinates are roughly 42.8348\xB0 N, 88.7380\xB0\
      \ W. So comparing 42.83 vs 39.73, 42.83 is higher latitude. Therefore, Whitewater\
      \ is north of Denver. So the Graduate School of Social Work in Denver is further\
      \ south. Therefore, University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater is NOT south of\

      \ Denver is in Colorado, which is a mountain state, more towards the western\

      \ latitude is approximately 39.7\xB0N. The Graduate School of Social Work is\
      \ part of the University of Denver, so it's located there. \n\nNow, the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater is in Whitewater, Wisconsin. Whitewater is in\
      \ southeastern Wisconsin. Wisconsin's latitude ranges roughly from about 42.5\xB0\
      N to 47\xB0N, but Whitewater being in the southern part might be around 42.8\xB0\

      \ bit west and maybe a little south of Milwaukee. Let me check mentally: If\
      \ Milwaukee is 43\xB0N, then Whitewater might be around 42.8\xB0N. \n\nDenver,\

      \ the answer is NO, it's not south. \n\nWait, but am I mixing up the specific\
      \ locations? Let me double-check in my mind. For instance, Chicago is around\
      \ 41.8\xB0N. So if Whitewater is in southern Wisconsin, maybe it's around the\
      \ same latitude as Chicago or a bit north. Let's say 42.5\xB0N. Denver is at\
      \ 39.7\xB0N, so even if Whitewater is 42.5\xB0N, that's still north of Denver.\

      \ I know Dallas is a major city in northern Texas. The Academy of Chinese Culture\

      \ spans a large area. The latitude of Dallas is approximately 32.7767\xB0 N.\
      \ Oakland, California's latitude is around 37.8044\xB0 N. Wait, that means Oakland\

      \nThen Dallas Baptist University is in Texas, specifically in Dallas, as the\
      \ name suggests. So I need the locations of both cities. San Francisco, if that's\
      \ where the Academy is, is in Northern California. Dallas is in Texas, which\
      \ is more to the south-central part of the US. \n\nWait, but where exactly is\
      \ San Francisco compared to Dallas? Let me visualize a map. California is west\
      \ of Texas. Dallas is in northern Texas, right? San Francisco is on the west\
      \ coast. Latitude-wise, San Francisco is at approximately 37.7749\xB0 N, and\
      \ Dallas is around 32.7767\xB0 N. Wait, hold on\u2014that would make San Francisco\

      \ San Francisco is at 37.7\xB0 N and Dallas is at 32.7\xB0 N, then San Francisco\
      \ is north of Dallas. Therefore, the Academy in CA would be north of Dallas\
      \ Baptist University, not south. \n\nBut wait, maybe the Academy isn't in San\
      \ Francisco. Let me confirm. A quick search in my mind\u2014Academy of Chinese\
      \ Culture and Health Sciences\u2014I think it's in Oakland, California. Wait,\
      \ Oakland is across the bay from San Francisco. Let me check the latitude of\
      \ Oakland. Oakland is around 37.8044\xB0 N, which is even a bit north of San\
      \ Francisco. So if that's the case, then it's definitely north of Dallas. \n\
      \nAlternatively, maybe the Academy is in Southern California? If so, like Los\
      \ Angeles, which is around 34.0522\xB0 N. That's still north of Dallas's latitude\
      \ (32.7767\xB0 N) but closer. Wait, 34 degrees is still north of 32.7, so even\
      \ LA is north of Dallas. So any city in California would be west and either\
      \ north or slightly more north than Dallas. \n\nTherefore, regardless of where\
      \ in California the Academy is, since California is west and the southernmost\
      \ part of California is around 32.5\xB0 N (near the border with Mexico), which\
      \ is slightly south of Dallas at 32.7767\xB0 N. Wait, wait, that's conflicting.\
      \ Let me get exact coordinates.\n\nWait, the southernmost point of California\
      \ is the US-Mexico border, which is at approximately 32.5341\xB0 N. Dallas is\
      \ at 32.7767\xB0 N. So the southern tip of California is actually slightly south\
      \ of Dallas. So if the Academy were located in the very southern part of California,\
      \ like San Diego (32.7157\xB0 N), which is also south of Dallas. But if the\
      \ Academy is in San Diego, then yes, it's south. But if it's in Oakland or San\
      \ Francisco, it's north.\n\nSo now the key is to find where exactly the Academy\
      \ of Chinese Culture and Health Sciences is located. Let me recall. A quick\
      \ mental check: I think the Academy is in Oakland, CA. Let me confirm that.\
      \ Yes, according to what I remember, the Academy of Chinese Culture and Health\

      \ N, which is significantly north of Dallas's 32.7767\xB0 N. Therefore, Oakland\
      \ is north of Dallas, meaning the Academy is north of Dallas Baptist University.\
      \ Therefore, the answer would be NO.\n\nWait, but I want to be sure. Let me\
      \ double-check the exact location of the Academy. Suppose someone might have\
      \ confused it with another city. Let me think. The Academy of Chinese Culture\
      \ and Health Sciences\u2014maybe it's in a different part of CA. For example,\

      \ CA.\n\nNext, Dallas Baptist University (DBU) in Texas. Dallas is a major city\
      \ in Texas, so DBU is located in Dallas, TX. Now I need to compare the latitudes\

      \ Oakland? Oakland is in Northern California, near San Francisco. San Francisco\
      \ is around 37.7749\xB0 N latitude. Dallas, Texas is further south. Dallas's\
      \ latitude is approximately 32.7767\xB0 N. Wait, but lower latitude means further\
      \ south. Since 32.7767 is less than 37.7749, Dallas is actually south of Oakland.\
      \ So if Oakland is at a higher latitude (more north), then the Academy in Oakland\

      \ Ohio. Now, I need to get the coordinates or at least the general location\
      \ of Cleveland. Cleveland is in the northern part of Ohio, right? It's on the\
      \ southern shore of Lake Erie. So, that's pretty far north in the state.\n\n\
      Next, Ohio Valley University. I'm not as familiar with this one. Let me think.\
      \ Ohio Valley University is in West Virginia. The name might suggest it's near\
      \ the Ohio River Valley. A quick check in my mind: West Virginia's northern\
      \ panhandle is close to Ohio and Pennsylvania. Cities like Wheeling are there.\
      \ Maybe Ohio Valley University is in that area. Wheeling, WV, perhaps? If that's\
      \ the case, Wheeling is in the northern part of West Virginia, right along the\
      \ Ohio River, which forms the border with Ohio.\n\nNow, comparing the latitudes.\
      \ Cleveland, OH is at a higher latitude than Wheeling, WV. Let me visualize\
      \ a map. Cleveland is up by Lake Erie, which is north. Wheeling is more to the\
      \ south, but since it's in West Virginia, which is generally south of Ohio,\
      \ but the northern panhandle might be at a similar latitude. Wait, no. Actually,\
      \ the northern panhandle of West Virginia is still south of the Ohio border.\
      \ Because Ohio is to the west and north of West Virginia's panhandle. Wait,\
      \ maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nOhio's southern border\
      \ is with West Virginia and Kentucky. The northern border is Lake Erie. So,\
      \ Cleveland is in northern Ohio. Wheeling, WV, which is in the northern panhandle\
      \ of West Virginia, is south of the Ohio state line. So, the latitude of Cleveland\
      \ would be higher (more north) than Wheeling. Therefore, Cleveland, OH (Levin\
      \ College) is north of Ohio Valley University in West Virginia. Therefore, the\
      \ answer would be NO, Levin College is not south of Ohio Valley University.\n\

      \ me confirm that. Yes, Ohio Valley University is located in Vienna, West Virginia.\
      \ Vienna is in the northwestern part of West Virginia, near the Ohio River.\
      \ The coordinates for Vienna, WV are approximately 39.3267\xB0 N, 81.5485\xB0\

      \ \n\nCleveland's latitude is approximately 41.4993\xB0 N. Vienna, WV's latitude\

      \ step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where exactly these two institutions\
      \ are located. Let's start with St. Andrews University in NC. I think St. Andrews\
      \ is in Laurinburg, North Carolina. I remember that Laurinburg is in Scotland\

      \ Carolina overall. But since St. Andrews is in the southern part of NC, maybe\
      \ their latitudes are closer than I think.\n\nTo be precise, I should check\
      \ the latitudes of both cities. Latitude determines how far north or south a\
      \ place is. The higher the latitude, the more north it is. So, if Laurinburg,\
      \ NC has a lower latitude (more south) than Columbus, GA, then the answer would\
      \ be yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nLet me recall or look up the approximate latitudes.\
      \ Wait, since I can't look it up right now, I'll have to use my existing knowledge.\
      \ Georgia is south of North Carolina, so cities in Georgia should generally\
      \ be south of those in NC. However, Laurinburg is very close to the SC border,\
      \ and Columbus, GA is in west-central Georgia. Let me visualize the US map.\
      \ North Carolina is above South Carolina and Georgia. But Laurinburg is in the\
      \ southern tip of NC, near SC. Columbus, GA is in west Georgia, near the Alabama\
      \ border. So, how far south is Columbus compared to Laurinburg?\n\nWait, Columbus,\
      \ GA's latitude. Let me think. Atlanta is around 33.7\xB0 N. Columbus is southwest\
      \ of Atlanta, so maybe a bit lower latitude. Let's say around 32.5\xB0 N. Whereas\
      \ Laurinburg, NC: North Carolina's southern border is at about 35\xB0 N, but\
      \ Laurinburg is in Scotland County, which is at the southern edge. Maybe Laurinburg\
      \ is around 34.7\xB0 N. If Columbus, GA is at 32.5\xB0 N, then Columbus is actually\

      \ more accurate. Columbus, GA's actual latitude is approximately 32.4601\xB0\

      \ 32.4601\xB0 N. Since 32.46 is smaller than 34.77, Columbus, GA is indeed further\
      \ south. Therefore, St. Andrews University in NC is north of Columbus Tech in\

      First, I need to confirm the locations of both institutions. Let me start with\
      \ the Liechtenstein Institute. I remember that Princeton University is in New\
      \ Jersey, specifically in Princeton, NJ. The Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination\
      \ (LISD) is actually part of Princeton University's School of Public and International\
      \ Affairs. So, LISD is located in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nNext, Kennesaw State\

      \ which is further south. Generally, the further south a place is, the lower\
      \ its latitude (closer to the equator). Let me recall the approximate latitudes.\
      \ \n\nPrinceton, NJ is in the northern part of New Jersey. New Jersey is in\
      \ the northeastern US, so its latitude is relatively high. From what I remember,\
      \ Princeton's latitude is around 40.3 degrees North. \n\nKennesaw, GA is in\
      \ the northwestern part of Georgia, near Atlanta. Georgia is a southern state,\
      \ so its latitude should be lower than New Jersey's. Let me think... Atlanta's\
      \ latitude is about 33.7 degrees North, and Kennesaw is a suburb of Atlanta,\
      \ so probably similar, maybe 34.0 degrees North or so. \n\nComparing 40.3\xB0\
      N (Princeton) vs. ~34\xB0N (Kennesaw), 34 is lower than 40.3, meaning Kennesaw,\

      \ can't be right. Wait, states: Georgia is in the southeastern US, and New Jersey\
      \ is in the northeastern part. So generally, Georgia is further south than New\
      \ Jersey. For example, Atlanta, GA is around 33\xB0N latitude, while Princeton,\
      \ NJ is around 40\xB0N. Latitude increases as you go north. So if Princeton\

    a5e6e762-37e4-4183-9e89-ec026464c683: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user wants to know if Harding University in Arkansas is located south\
      \ of Alcorn State University in Mississippi. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure\
      \ out where exactly these two universities are located. \n\nStarting with Harding\
      \ University in Arkansas. I remember that Arkansas is a state in the southern\
      \ United States. Harding University, if I recall correctly, is in a city called\
      \ Searcy. Let me confirm that. Yes, a quick check in my mind tells me that Harding\
      \ University is indeed in Searcy, Arkansas. Now, where is Searcy located within\
      \ Arkansas? Arkansas is kind of in the middle-south part of the US. Searcy is\
      \ in the central part of Arkansas, maybe a bit to the northeast? Wait, I think\
      \ the capital of Arkansas is Little Rock, which is more central. Searcy is northeast\
      \ of Little Rock. So, the coordinates for Searcy, AR might be around 35.2506\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n\nNow, Alcorn State University in Mississippi. Mississippi is\
      \ to the east of Arkansas, along the Mississippi River. Alcorn State is one\
      \ of the historically black universities. Where exactly is it located? I think\
      \ it's in Lorman, Mississippi. Let me verify that. Yes, Alcorn State's main\
      \ campus is in Lorman, MS. Now, where is Lorman situated in Mississippi? Mississippi\
      \ is a state that's further south than Arkansas, generally. Lorman is in the\
      \ southwestern part of Mississippi, maybe near the Mississippi River. The latitude\
      \ for Lorman, MS should be around 31.88\xB0 N. \n\nWait, latitude is the key\
      \ here. The further south you go, the lower the latitude (since latitude decreases\
      \ as you go towards the equator). So, if Harding University is at around 35.25\xB0\
      \ N and Alcorn State is at 31.88\xB0 N, then Alcorn State is actually further\
      \ south. That would mean Harding University is north of Alcorn State, not south.\
      \ Therefore, the answer would be NO, Harding University in AR is not south of\
      \ Alcorn State University in MS.\n\nBut let me double-check the coordinates\
      \ to be sure. Searcy, AR: 35.2506\xB0 N, 91.7363\xB0 W. Lorman, MS: 31.8788\xB0\
      \ N, 91.1315\xB0 W. Comparing the latitudes: 35.25\xB0 N vs. 31.88\xB0 N. Since\
      \ 31.88 is less than 35.25, Lorman (Alcorn State) is further south. Therefore,\
      \ Harding is north of Alcorn State. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nHarding\

      \ So Alcorn State University is in Lorman, MS.\n\nNext step is to find the latitude\

      \ the southwestern part of Mississippi, maybe. Searcy, AR is in the central\
      \ part of Arkansas. But I'm not sure about exact coordinates.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I can think of major cities. For example, Little Rock is the capital\
      \ of Arkansas, and Searcy is about 50 miles northeast of Little Rock. So Searcy\
      \ is in the central-north part of Arkansas. Lorman, MS might be more southern.\
      \ Wait, Mississippi's southern border is along the Gulf Coast, but Lorman isn't\
      \ on the coast. Let me think. Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, and Lorman\
      \ is southwest of Jackson. Maybe around 31 degrees latitude? While Searcy, AR\
      \ might be around 35 degrees? Because Arkansas generally is between 33-36 degrees\
      \ north latitude. Mississippi is lower, maybe 30-35. So if Searcy is at 35,\
      \ and Lorman at 31, then Harding U (Searcy) would be north of Alcorn (Lorman).\
      \ Wait, but that can't be right because Mississippi is south of Arkansas. Wait,\
      \ no. Let me check the states' positions. Arkansas is north of Louisiana, east\
      \ of Texas, and west of Tennessee and Mississippi. So Mississippi is to the\
      \ east of Arkansas and a bit south? Or are they at similar latitudes?\n\nWait,\
      \ maybe the northern border of Mississippi is aligned with the northern part\
      \ of Arkansas. But generally, Mississippi is south of Tennessee and north of\
      \ the Gulf. Arkansas is north of Louisiana. So, maybe the latitude of Lorman,\

      \ Texas. San Antonio is in south-central Texas, right? So let's verify that.\
      \ Yes, Our Lady of the Lake University (OLLU) is indeed located in San Antonio,\
      \ Texas.\n\nNow, to determine if Monticello, AR is south of San Antonio, TX.\
      \ Wait, but Texas is generally south of Arkansas. Arkansas is north of Texas.\
      \ So if Monticello is in southeastern Arkansas, and San Antonio is in south\
      \ Texas, then San Antonio would be much further south. Therefore, Monticello,\
      \ AR would be north of San Antonio, TX. That would mean the University of Arkansas\
      \ at Monticello is north of Our Lady of the Lake University. So the answer should\
      \ be NO, it's not south.\n\nBut maybe I should check the exact latitudes. Let\
      \ me think. San Antonio's latitude is around 29.4\xB0 N. Monticello, AR. Let's\
      \ see, maybe around 33\xB0 N? Because Arkansas is generally in the mid-30s.\
      \ For example, Little Rock is about 34.7\xB0 N. Monticello is southeast of Little\
      \ Rock, so maybe a bit lower latitude. Let's say approximately 33.6\xB0 N. San\
      \ Antonio at 29.4\xB0 N is definitely further south. So 33.6\xB0 N (Monticello)\
      \ is north of 29.4\xB0 N (San Antonio). Therefore, the University of Arkansas\
      \ at Monticello is north of Our Lady of the Lake University. So the answer is\
      \ NO.\n</think>The University of Arkansas at Monticello (UAM) is located in\
      \ Monticello, AR, which has a latitude of approximately **33.6\xB0 N**. Our\
      \ Lady of the Lake University (OLLU) is in San Antonio, TX, with a latitude\
      \ of about **29.4\xB0 N**. Since lower latitudes are further south, San Antonio\
      \ (29.4\xB0 N) lies south of Monticello (33.6\xB0 N). Therefore, **UAM is north\

      \ Washburn University is in Topeka, Kansas. Grayson College is in Denison, Texas.\
      \ Okay, so now I need to compare the latitudes of Topeka and Denison because\

      \ of Texas, maybe around 33-34 degrees north? Wait, no, Texas spans a larger\
      \ range. Let me check that. Actually, the northernmost part of Texas is around\
      \ 36 degrees 30 minutes north, but Denison is near the Red River, which is the\

      \ University is in Kansas. Let me recall the major cities in Kansas. Topeka\
      \ is the capital, and I think Washburn is in Topeka. As for Grayson College,\
      \ the name suggests it's in Grayson County, Texas. Texas has a Grayson County,\

      \ College might be there.\n\nNow, I need to compare their latitudes. The higher\
      \ the latitude, the farther north a place is. So if Topeka, KS has a lower latitude\
      \ than Sherman, TX, then Washburn would be south of Grayson. But I think Kansas\
      \ is north of Texas. Wait, Texas is a big state. The northern border of Texas\
      \ is at about 36\xB030' N latitude, right? Kansas is north of Oklahoma, which\
      \ is north of Texas. Topeka, KS is around 39\xB0 N latitude. Sherman, TX is\
      \ in the northern part of Texas. Let me check approximate coordinates. \n\n\
      From memory, Sherman, TX is around 33.6\xB0 N latitude. Wait, no\u2014that can't\
      \ be right. If Texas's northernmost point is 36\xB030' N, then Sherman, being\
      \ in Grayson County which is on the border, would be around 33.6\xB0 N? Wait,\
      \ no. Wait, the Red River is the border between Texas and Oklahoma. Grayson\
      \ County is right on that border. The latitude for Sherman, TX is approximately\
      \ 33.64\xB0 N. But wait, that seems too far south. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up\
      \ the numbers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, Oklahoma's southern border with\
      \ Texas is along the Red River. The latitude of the Red River in that area is\
      \ around 34\xB0 N. So Sherman, TX would be just south of that, maybe around\
      \ 33.6\xB0 N. Wait, but Oklahoma's southern border is at approximately 33.6\xB0\
      \ N, so Sherman would be just south of that. So Sherman's latitude is around\
      \ 33.64\xB0 N. Whereas Topeka, Kansas is much farther north. Let me recall that\
      \ the latitude of Topeka is about 39.03\xB0 N. \n\nSo 39.03\xB0 N (Topeka) vs\

      \ step by step. The user wants to know if Gardner\u2013Webb University in North\
      \ Carolina is located south of the University of Houston\u2013Downtown in Texas.\
      \ Hmm, at first glance, that might seem a bit tricky because both states are\
      \ in the southern part of the US, but their exact positions relative to each\
      \ other could vary. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the approximate latitudes\
      \ of both universities. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is,\
      \ so the one with a lower latitude would be further south. I remember that Texas\
      \ is generally south of North Carolina, but I'm not entirely sure about the\
      \ specific cities these universities are in. \n\nLet me start with Gardner\u2013\
      Webb University in NC. I think it's located in Boiling Springs, North Carolina.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, a quick check in my mind\u2014Gardner\u2013Webb\
      \ is indeed in Boiling Springs, NC. Now, what's the latitude of Boiling Springs?\
      \ I might need to recall or estimate. North Carolina's position on the map\u2014\
      its northern border is around 36.5 degrees north, and it goes down to about\
      \ 33.8 degrees at the southern tip. Boiling Springs is in the western part of\
      \ the state, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe it's near Charlotte? Charlotte,\
      \ NC, has a latitude of approximately 35.2 degrees north. If Boiling Springs\
      \ is near there, maybe around 35.3 or 35.4 degrees north?\n\nNow, the University\
      \ of Houston\u2013Downtown is in Houston, Texas. Houston is a major city in\
      \ southeastern Texas. Its latitude is around 29.7 degrees north. I remember\
      \ that Houston is pretty far south, close to the Gulf of Mexico. So Houston\
      \ is at roughly 29.7\xB0N. \n\nComparing the two: If Gardner\u2013Webb is around\
      \ 35.3\xB0N and Houston is at 29.7\xB0N, then Houston is actually further south.\
      \ Therefore, Gardner\u2013Webb University in NC would be north of the University\
      \ of Houston\u2013Downtown. But wait, I should double-check the exact latitude\
      \ of Boiling Springs, NC. Maybe I'm off a bit. Let me think. Boiling Springs,\
      \ NC: Looking up in my memory, Cleveland County, which is where Boiling Springs\
      \ is located. The coordinates for Gardner\u2013Webb University are approximately\
      \ 35.2483\xB0 N, 81.6657\xB0 W. So that's 35.25\xB0N latitude.\n\nHouston\u2019\
      s coordinates are 29.7604\xB0 N, 95.3698\xB0 W. So 29.76\xB0N. Comparing 35.25\xB0\
      N vs. 29.76\xB0N, Houston is definitely further south. Therefore, the answer\
      \ should be NO, Gardner\u2013Webb University is not south of University of Houston\u2013\
      Downtown. Instead, it's north of it.\n</think>NO  \nGardner\u2013Webb University\
      \ in Boiling Springs, NC, has a latitude of approximately **35.25\xB0N**, while\
      \ the University of Houston\u2013Downtown in Houston, TX, is located at **29.76\xB0\

      \ and San Antonio, which are around 30\xB0N. Wait, no, actually, San Antonio\
      \ is about 29.4\xB0N, so maybe Houston is similar. Let me check in my mind.\
      \ Houston is near the coast, so maybe around 29.7\xB0N. \n\nGardner\u2013Webb\
      \ in Boiling Springs, NC. North Carolina's latitude ranges from about 33.8\xB0\
      N at the northern border to 34\xB0N in the central part. Wait, no, maybe I'm\
      \ mixing up. Let me think. Charlotte, NC is around 35.2\xB0N. Boiling Springs\
      \ is near Shelby, NC. Let me see, Shelby's latitude is approximately 35.29\xB0\
      N. So Gardner\u2013Webb would be around there. \n\nIf Houston is at 29.7\xB0\
      N and Gardner\u2013Webb is at 35.3\xB0N, then Houston is actually further south.\
      \ So that would mean Gardner\u2013Webb is north of Houston. Therefore, the answer\
      \ would be NO, Gardner\u2013Webb is not south of Houston\u2013Downtown. \n\n\
      Wait, but maybe I got the coordinates wrong. Let me double-check. Maybe I confused\
      \ the latitude of Houston. Let me think again. Houston is in southeastern Texas,\
      \ which is closer to the Gulf. The latitude of Houston is indeed around 29.7\xB0\
      N. For example, the coordinates for the University of Houston\u2013Downtown\
      \ are approximately 29.7604\xB0N. \n\nBoiling Springs, NC, where Gardner\u2013\
      Webb is located, is at about 35.4\xB0N. So 35.4\xB0N is definitely north of\
      \ 29.7\xB0N. Therefore, Gardner\u2013Webb University is north of the University\
      \ of Houston\u2013Downtown. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO. Gardner\u2013\

      \ because both are in the southern US, but I need to figure out their exact\
      \ latitudes.\n\nFirst, I should recall where these universities are. Gardner\u2013\
      Webb is in North Carolina. I think it's in Boiling Springs, NC. And the University\
      \ of Houston\u2013Downtown is in Houston, Texas. Now, I need to compare their\
      \ latitudes. The one with the lower latitude is further south.\n\nSo, let me\
      \ start with Gardner\u2013Webb. Boiling Springs, NC. I'm not exactly sure of\
      \ the coordinates. Maybe I can approximate. North Carolina is on the east coast,\
      \ south of Virginia, north of South Carolina. The latitude of North Carolina's\
      \ northern border is around 36\xB030' N, and it goes down to about 34\xB0 N\

      \ the southwestern part of NC. So maybe around 35\xB0 N? Let me check that.\
      \ If I remember correctly, Charlotte, NC is around 35\xB013' N. Boiling Springs\
      \ is near Charlotte, maybe a bit west. So perhaps around 35.2\xB0 N.\n\nNow,\
      \ University of Houston\u2013Downtown is in Houston, Texas. Houston is in southeastern\
      \ Texas, near the Gulf of Mexico. The latitude of Houston is approximately 29\xB0\

      \ and compare their latitudes to see which one is further south. Alright, let's\
      \ start by recalling where each state is. New Hampshire is in the northeastern\
      \ part of the US, part of New England. Pennsylvania is a bit further south,\
      \ but it's also on the East Coast. However, states can vary in their north-south\
      \ positioning. For example, the northern parts of Pennsylvania might be further\
      \ north than some southern parts of other states, but I need specific cities.\n\
      \nFirst, I need the exact locations of the two colleges. Granite State College\
      \ is in New Hampshire. Let me think\u2014I believe the main campus is in Concord,\

      \ (PA). So if Concord's latitude is lower (more southern) than Bloomsburg's,\
      \ the answer is yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look up\
      \ the actual coordinates. Let me try to recall approximate latitudes. New Hampshire\
      \ is generally north of Pennsylvania. Wait, but Pennsylvania is a large state.\
      \ For example, Pittsburgh, PA is around 40.4\xB0 N, and Philadelphia is around\
      \ 39.9\xB0 N. Bloomsburg is in central Pennsylvania, so maybe around 41\xB0\
      \ N? Whereas Concord, NH is the capital. New Hampshire's southern border is\
      \ around 42.7\xB0 N (since Massachusetts is south of it, and Boston is about\
      \ 42.3\xB0). Wait, so Concord, NH is at approximately 43.2\xB0 N. If Bloomsburg,\
      \ PA is at 41\xB0 N, then Concord is actually north of Bloomsburg. But wait,\
      \ that can't be right, because Pennsylvania is south of New York, which is south\
      \ of New Hampshire. So PA's northern border is along the 42nd parallel, which\
      \ is the same as the northern border of Pennsylvania. Let me double-check: The\
      \ 42nd parallel is the northern boundary of Pennsylvania, so the state goes\
      \ up to 42\xB0 N. So places in northern Pennsylvania could be up to 42\xB0 N.\
      \ Bloomsburg is in Columbia County, PA. Let me check where that is. Columbia\
      \ County is in northeastern PA, maybe around 41\xB0 N. So if Concord, NH is\
      \ at 43.2\xB0 N, and Bloomsburg, PA is at 41\xB0 N, then Bloomsburg is south\
      \ of Concord. Therefore, Granite State College in NH is NORTH of Bloomsburg\
      \ University in PA. So the answer would be NO, Granite State College is not\
      \ south of Bloomsburg University; it's actually north of it.\n\nWait, but maybe\
      \ I messed up the coordinates. Let me get more precise. Looking up in my mind:\
      \ Concord, NH's coordinates are approximately 43.2081\xB0 N, 71.5376\xB0 W.\
      \ Bloomsburg, PA's coordinates are about 40.9998\xB0 N, 76.4549\xB0 W. So 40.9998\xB0\
      \ N for Bloomsburg versus 43.2081\xB0 N for Concord. That means Bloomsburg is\
      \ at a lower latitude (more south) than Concord. Therefore, Concord, NH (Granite\

      \ \n\nI know that Bloomsburg University is in Pennsylvania. Let me recall, Bloomsburg\
      \ is a town in PA, and the university is part of the Pennsylvania State System\
      \ of Higher Education. Now, where exactly is Bloomsburg, PA? I think it's in\
      \ the eastern part of Pennsylvania. Maybe somewhere near the middle of the state?\
      \ Let me check in my mind. Pennsylvania's major cities are Philadelphia in the\

      \ of Granite State is lower (more south) than Bloomsburg's, then the answer\
      \ is yes. \n\nBut where exactly are these places? Let's think about the general\
      \ geography. New Hampshire is in New England, north of Massachusetts. Pennsylvania\
      \ is further south. So, generally, PA is south of NH. So, any location in PA\
      \ would be south of NH, right? Wait, but Bloomsburg is in PA, which is south\
      \ of NH. So if the college in NH is in the northern part of the US, and Bloomsburg\
      \ is in PA, which is to the south of NH, then Granite State College would be\
      \ north of Bloomsburg University. Therefore, the answer would be NO, because\
      \ a college in NH is north of a college in PA. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a\
      \ mistake here. Let me check the approximate latitudes. Let's think about major\
      \ cities. For example, Boston, MA is around 42\xB0N. Concord, NH is a bit north\
      \ of Boston, maybe around 43\xB0N latitude. Bloomsburg, PA, where is that? Pennsylvania's\
      \ latitude ranges from about 39.7\xB0N (southern border) to 42\xB0N (northern\
      \ border). So Bloomsburg, being in central PA, maybe around 41\xB0N? Let me\
      \ think: Scranton, PA is around 41.4\xB0N. Bloomsburg is east of Scranton, so\
      \ probably similar latitude. If Concord, NH is around 43\xB0N, then Bloomsburg\
      \ is around 41-42\xB0N. Therefore, Concord, NH (Granite State College) is north\

      \nPennsylvania is generally south of New York, and New Hampshire is north of\

      \ So the southern part of NH is around 42-43 degrees, and PA ranges from about\
      \ 39.7 to 42 degrees north. So Bloomsburg, being in PA, would be around 41 degrees,\

      \ So, the user is asking if the University of Advancing Technology in Arizona\
      \ is located south of Sul Ross State University in Texas. Hmm, okay. First,\
      \ I need to figure out the locations of both universities. \n\nStarting with\
      \ the University of Advancing Technology (UAT) in Arizona. I know Arizona is\
      \ a state in the southwestern US. The main city there is Phoenix, and I think\
      \ UAT is in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Let me confirm that. A quick check:\
      \ yes, UAT is located in Tempe, Arizona. Tempe is part of the Phoenix metro\
      \ area.\n\nNow, Sul Ross State University in Texas. Texas is a large state,\
      \ so I need to pinpoint where Sul Ross is. I recall that Sul Ross State University\
      \ is in Alpine, Texas. Alpine is in West Texas, near the Big Bend National Park\
      \ area. Let me verify that. Yes, Sul Ross's main campus is in Alpine, Texas.\n\
      \nNext, I need to compare the latitudes of these two cities to determine if\
      \ Tempe, AZ is south of Alpine, TX. Latitude is the key here because south is\
      \ determined by lower latitude coordinates. \n\nSo, what's the latitude of Tempe,\
      \ AZ? Tempe's coordinates are approximately 33.4255\xB0 N. For Alpine, TX, the\
      \ coordinates are around 30.3586\xB0 N. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait,\
      \ no, let me check again. Maybe I mixed up the numbers. \n\nWait, actually,\
      \ Alpine, Texas is in the western part of the state, but latitude-wise, how\
      \ does it compare to Tempe? Let me look up the exact coordinates. \n\nTempe,\
      \ AZ: 33.4255\xB0 N, 111.9400\xB0 W. \n\nAlpine, TX: 30.3586\xB0 N, 103.6611\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nOh, okay, so Alpine is at approximately 30.36\xB0 N, and Tempe is at\
      \ 33.43\xB0 N. Since latitude decreases as you go south, a lower latitude means\
      \ further south. So, 30.36\xB0 N is south of 33.43\xB0 N. Therefore, Alpine,\
      \ TX is south of Tempe, AZ. Wait, but the question is asking if UAT (Tempe,\
      \ AZ) is south of Sul Ross (Alpine, TX). Since Tempe is at a higher latitude\
      \ (33.43 vs 30.36), that means Tempe is north of Alpine. Therefore, the answer\
      \ would be NO, because the University of Advancing Technology in AZ is actually\
      \ north of Sul Ross State University in TX.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I\
      \ didn't reverse the coordinates. Let me double-check. Yes, Alpine, TX is at\
      \ 30.36\xB0 N, which is further south than Tempe's 33.43\xB0 N. So, Sul Ross\
      \ is in a more southern location. Therefore, UAT is not south of Sul Ross. The\
      \ answer is NO.\n</think>NO.  \n**Step 1:** University of Advancing Technology\
      \ (UAT) is in Tempe, AZ (latitude ~33.43\xB0 N).  \n**Step 2:** Sul Ross State\
      \ University is in Alpine, TX (latitude ~30.36\xB0 N).  \n**Step 3:** Lower\
      \ latitude = farther south. Alpine, TX (30.36\xB0 N) is south of Tempe, AZ (33.43\xB0\

      \ need a clear YES or NO answer, but it requires some reasoning.\n\nFirst, I\

      \ north or south a location is. The further south a place is (lower latitude),\
      \ the more south it is compared to another place with a higher latitude.\n\n\
      So, Tempe, AZ: Let me look up its latitude. Tempe's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 33.4255\xB0 N, 111.9400\xB0 W. Now, Alpine, TX: Alpine is in West Texas. Its\
      \ coordinates are roughly 30.3586\xB0 N, 103.6611\xB0 W. \n\nComparing the latitudes:\
      \ Tempe is at 33.4255\xB0 N, and Alpine is at 30.3586\xB0 N. Since latitude\
      \ decreases as you move south, a lower latitude means a location is further\
      \ south. Alpine's latitude is about 30.36\xB0 N, which is lower than Tempe's\
      \ 33.43\xB0 N. Therefore, Alpine (where Sul Ross is) is actually further south\
      \ than Tempe (where UAT is). \n\nWait, but the question is asking if UAT is\
      \ south of Sul Ross. So if Sul Ross is at a lower latitude (more south), then\
      \ UAT is north of Sul Ross. That would mean the answer is NO, University of\

      \ \n\nLet me double-check the coordinates to make sure I didn't mix them up.\
      \ Yes, Tempe, AZ is around 33.4\xB0 N, and Alpine, TX is around 30.36\xB0 N.\
      \ So Alpine is indeed south of Tempe. Therefore, Tempe (UAT) is north of Alpine\

      \ north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the farther north. So\
      \ if McMurry's latitude is lower (more south) than Lynn's, then the answer is\
      \ yes.\n\nAbilene, Texas: I recall that Texas is a southern state, but Abilene\
      \ is in the central part of Texas. Let me think about the approximate latitude.\
      \ Major Texas cities like Dallas are around 32-33\xB0N. Abilene is west of Dallas,\
      \ maybe a bit similar in latitude. Let's say around 32.4\xB0N. \n\nBoca Raton,\
      \ Florida: Florida is further south, but Boca Raton is on the east coast. Miami\
      \ is about 25.7\xB0N, but Boca Raton is a bit north of Miami. Maybe around 26.3\xB0\
      N? Wait, no, actually, Boca Raton is north of Miami. Let me think. Fort Lauderdale\
      \ is around 26.1\xB0N, and Boca Raton is a bit north of that. Maybe 26.4\xB0\
      N? Wait, I might be mixing up. Let me try to get more precise. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ I can think about the general positions. Texas is in the southern US, but\
      \ Florida is a peninsula that extends further south. However, the southern tip\
      \ of Texas (like Brownsville) is around 25.9\xB0N, which is about the same latitude\
      \ as Miami. But Abilene is in central Texas, which is much further north. So\
      \ if Boca Raton is in southeastern Florida, which is around 26\xB0N, and Abilene\
      \ is around 32\xB0N, then Abilene is actually north of Boca Raton. Therefore,\
      \ McMurry University would be north of Lynn University, not south. \n\nWait,\
      \ but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. If Boca Raton is at\
      \ 26.3\xB0N and Abilene is at 32.4\xB0N, then 32.4 is higher (more north) than\
      \ 26.3. So McMurry is north of Lynn. Therefore, the answer is NO, McMurry is\
      \ not south of Lynn University.\n</think>To determine if McMurry University,\
      \ TX (in Abilene) is south of Lynn University, FL (in Boca Raton):  \n1. **Abilene,\
      \ TX** is at approximately **32.45\xB0N** latitude.  \n2. **Boca Raton, FL**\
      \ is at approximately **26.37\xB0N** latitude.  \nSince 26.37\xB0N (Boca Raton)\
      \ is farther south than 32.45\xB0N (Abilene), **McMurry University is north\
      \ of Lynn University**.  \n\n**Answer:** NO."

      \ is. McMurry University is in Texas. I think it's in Abilene, Texas. Let me\
      \ check that... Yes, McMurry University is indeed in Abilene, TX. Now, where\
      \ is Lynn University? Lynn University is in Florida, and I believe it's in Boca\
      \ Raton. Let me confirm that... Yes, Lynn University is located in Boca Raton,\
      \ FL.\n\nNext, I need to find the latitude of both cities to see which is further\
      \ south. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. The lower the\
      \ latitude, the further south it is. So if Abilene, TX has a higher latitude\
      \ than Boca Raton, FL, then McMurry would be north of Lynn. If it's lower, then\
      \ it's south.\n\nLooking up the latitude for Abilene, Texas. Let me recall...\
      \ Abilene is in west Texas. Major Texas cities like Dallas are around 32-33\xB0\
      N. San Antonio is about 29\xB0N. Abilene might be around 32\xB0N. Wait, let\

      \ TX are approximately 32.4487\xB0 N. \n\nNow Boca Raton, Florida. Florida is\
      \ further south, but Boca Raton is on the southeast coast, north of Miami. Miami\
      \ is around 25\xB0N, so Boca Raton is north of Miami. Let me check the exact\
      \ latitude. Boca Raton's latitude is roughly 26.3587\xB0 N. \n\nWait, if Abilene\
      \ is at 32.45\xB0N and Boca Raton is at 26.36\xB0N, then Boca Raton is actually\
      \ further south. Because 26\xB0N is lower than 32\xB0N. That would mean McMurry\
      \ University in Texas (32.45\xB0N) is north of Lynn University in Florida (26.36\xB0\
      N). Therefore, the answer would be NO, McMurry is not south of Lynn; it's north\
      \ of it.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the latitudes.\
      \ Maybe I confused Abilene with a southern Texas city. Cities in southern Texas,\
      \ like Brownsville, are around 25.9\xB0N, which is actually slightly south of\
      \ Boca Raton. But Abilene is in central-west Texas, so higher latitude. Yes,\

      \ Let me think of other Texas cities. Austin is around 30.25\xB0 N, Dallas is\
      \ about 32.78\xB0 N. Abilene is west of Dallas but still in the central part.\
      \ Maybe Abilene is around 32.4\xB0 N? Wait, that would make it north of Boca\
      \ Raton's 26\xB0 N. Wait, but 32\xB0 N is much farther north. So if that's the\
      \ case, then Abilene is actually north of Boca Raton. \n\nWait, but that seems\
      \ counterintuitive because Florida is the southeastern state, but Texas is more\
      \ west, but parts of Texas are further south. For example, the southern tip\
      \ of Texas is at about the same latitude as the Florida Keys. But Abilene is\
      \ in central Texas, which is more north. So if Boca Raton is at 26\xB0 N and\
      \ Abilene is at 32\xB0 N, then Abilene is north of Boca Raton. Therefore, McMurry\

      \ So, the user is asking if the Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School in\
      \ California is located south of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Louisiana.\
      \ Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out the locations of both institutions.\n\
      \nStarting with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (ULL). I know that\
      \ Lafayette is a city in Louisiana. Louisiana is in the southern part of the\
      \ United States. To get the exact latitude, maybe I should recall that cities\
      \ in Louisiana like New Orleans are around 30 degrees north latitude. Lafayette\
      \ is a bit to the west of New Orleans, but I think it's still in the same general\
      \ area. Let me check mentally\u2014yes, Lafayette, LA's latitude is approximately\
      \ 30.22\xB0 N.\n\nNow, the Pardee RAND Graduate School. I remember that RAND\
      \ Corporation is based in Santa Monica, California. The graduate school is part\
      \ of RAND, so it's likely in Santa Monica as well. Santa Monica is in Southern\
      \ California, right near Los Angeles. The latitude for Los Angeles is around\
      \ 34\xB0 N. Wait, but Santa Monica is part of the LA metro area, so its latitude\
      \ should be similar. Let me confirm\u2014yes, Santa Monica's latitude is approximately\
      \ 34.02\xB0 N.\n\nComparing the two latitudes: Santa Monica, CA is at about\
      \ 34\xB0 N, and Lafayette, LA is at about 30.22\xB0 N. Since latitude increases\
      \ as you go north, a higher latitude means a location is further north. Therefore,\
      \ Santa Monica (34\xB0 N) is north of Lafayette (30.22\xB0 N). So, the Pardee\
      \ RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica would be north of the University of Louisiana\
      \ at Lafayette. Therefore, the answer should be NO, it's not south; it's actually\
      \ north.\n</think>NO  \nThe Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School is in Santa\
      \ Monica, CA (latitude ~34.02\xB0N), while the University of Louisiana at Lafayette\
      \ is in Lafayette, LA (latitude ~30.22\xB0N). Since higher latitude means farther\
      \ north, Santa Monica is north of Lafayette. Thus, the school in California\
      \ is not south of the Louisiana university."

      \ Graduate School is in California. Wait, but California is a big state. Where\
      \ exactly? I think RAND is associated with Santa Monica, CA. Let me check that.\
      \ Yeah, I remember that the RAND Corporation's headquarters is in Santa Monica,\
      \ and the graduate school is part of that. So Santa Monica is on the west coast,\
      \ near Los Angeles.\n\nNow, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Lafayette,\
      \ Louisiana. Louisiana is in the southern United States, along the Gulf Coast.\
      \ I need to compare the latitudes of Santa Monica, CA and Lafayette, LA. Latitude\
      \ is the north-south position. The higher the latitude, the farther north a\
      \ place is.\n\nWhat's the latitude of Santa Monica? Let me recall. Los Angeles\

      \ similar. Maybe 34\xB001' N or so. And Lafayette, Louisiana? Louisiana is further\
      \ south, right? Wait, but maybe not. Let me think. Louisiana is in the Deep\
      \ South. Lafayette's latitude is approximately 30\xB013' N. Wait, 30 degrees?\
      \ Because New Orleans is around 29.95\xB0 N, so Lafayette being a bit north\
      \ of that would be around 30.2 or so. So if Santa Monica is at 34\xB0 N and\
      \ Lafayette is around 30\xB0 N, then Santa Monica is actually north of Lafayette.\
      \ Therefore, the Pardee RAND school in Santa Monica would be north of the University\
      \ of Louisiana at Lafayette. Therefore, the answer would be NO, it's not south.\n\
      \nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the latitudes. Sometimes people\
      \ think of California as being 'south' in the sense of being on the West Coast,\
      \ but latitude-wise, parts of California are actually quite far north. For example,\
      \ San Francisco is around 37\xB0 N, which is north of many southern states.\
      \ But Santa Monica is around 34\xB0, which is still north of Lafayette's 30\xB0\
      . So yes, Santa Monica is north, so the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nThe Frederick\

      \ Lafayette is in the southern part of Louisiana. The latitude for Lafayette,\

      \ So, the state of Wisconsin is north of Iowa. Therefore, cities in Wisconsin\

      \ Wisconsin is in the northern part of the US, maybe the Midwest. Mountain State\
      \ University is in West Virginia, which is more towards the east, maybe the\
      \ Appalachian region. But I'm not exactly sure about their exact cities.\n\n\
      Wait, Mountain State University... I recall that there was a Mountain State\

      \ around 2012 or 2013? But regardless, the question is about the location when\

      \ Let me check that. Yes, Viterbo University is indeed in La Crosse, Wisconsin.\

      \ then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nLet me look up the coordinates.\
      \ La Crosse, WI: According to my knowledge, La Crosse is in western Wisconsin,\
      \ near the Mississippi River. Its latitude is approximately 43.8\xB0 N. Beckley,\
      \ WV: Located in southern West Virginia. I think Beckley's latitude is around\

      \ south, like in the southern US. But West Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic,\
      \ so maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no. For example, the\
      \ latitude of Charleston, WV is about 38.35\xB0 N. Beckley is a bit south of\
      \ Charleston, so maybe around 37.8\xB0 N. But La Crosse, WI at 43.8\xB0 N is\
      \ definitely further north. So if Beckley is at 37.8\xB0 N and La Crosse is\
      \ at 43.8\xB0 N, then Beckley is further south. Therefore, Viterbo University\
      \ (La Crosse, WI) is north of Mountain State University (Beckley, WV). So the\
      \ answer would be NO, because Viterbo is north, not south.\n\nWait, but maybe\
      \ I have the coordinates wrong. Let me double-check. Maybe using approximate\
      \ known cities. For example, Chicago is around 41.8\xB0 N. La Crosse is in Wisconsin,\
      \ which is north of Chicago, so 43.8\xB0 N makes sense. Beckley, WV: West Virginia\
      \ is south of Pennsylvania, which is around 40\xB0 N. So Beckley being around\
      \ 37.8\xB0 N would place it further south. So yes, Viterbo is north, so the\

      \ WI, then Viterbo would be north of Mountain State, and the answer would be\
      \ NO. If La Crosse is south of Beckley, then YES.\n\nLet me recall approximate\
      \ latitudes. La Crosse, WI: I think Wisconsin's southern border is around 42.5\
      \ degrees north. La Crosse is in western WI, maybe around 43.8 degrees N? Wait,\

      \ latitude of Charleston, WV is around 38.35\xB0N. Beckley is in the southern\
      \ part of WV, maybe around 37.7\xB0N. Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me try\
      \ to recall. Beckley is in Raleigh County, WV. Checking mentally, Raleigh County's\
      \ latitude is roughly 37.7\xB0N. So if Beckley is around 37.7\xB0N and La Crosse\
      \ is at 43.8\xB0N, then Beckley is significantly further south. Therefore, Viterbo\
      \ University in WI (43.8\xB0N) is north of Mountain State University in WV (37.7\xB0\
      N). So the answer would be NO, Viterbo is not south of Mountain State; it's\

      \ WI: looking it up mentally, its coordinates are approximately 43.8131\xB0\
      \ N, 91.2394\xB0 W. Beckley, WV: approximately 37.7782\xB0 N, 81.1882\xB0 W.\
      \ So yes, 43.8 vs 37.7. That means La Crosse is north of Beckley. Therefore,\

      \ south.\n\nNew York City is in the northern part of the United States. Its\
      \ latitude is approximately 40.7128\xB0 N. Danville, VA, on the other hand,\
      \ is in southern Virginia. Looking up Danville's coordinates, it's around 36.5854\xB0\
      \ N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a lower latitude means a more\
      \ southern location. Danville at 36.58\xB0 N is south of NYC at 40.71\xB0 N.\
      \ Therefore, New York City (where \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes was located)\
      \ is north of Danville, VA (Averett University). \n\nSo, the question is asking\
      \ if the NY school is south of Averett. Since NYC is north of Danville, the\
      \ answer should be NO. Wait, but I need to make sure there isn't another \xC9\
      cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in a different part of NY state that's further\
      \ south. However, based on the information I found, ELHE was specifically in\
      \ New York City. There's no indication of another campus in a more southern\
      \ part of New York. Therefore, the answer is definitely NO.\n</think>NO.  \n\
      **Step 1:** \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes (ELHE) was located in New York\
      \ City, NY (latitude ~40.7\xB0 N).  \n**Step 2:** Averett University is in Danville,\
      \ VA (latitude ~36.6\xB0 N).  \n**Step 3:** Lower latitude = farther south.\
      \ Danville, VA (36.6\xB0 N) is south of New York City (40.7\xB0 N).  \n**Conclusion:**\
      \ NYC (ELHE's location) is north of Danville, VA, so \xC9cole libre des hautes\
      \ \xE9tudes is **not** south of Averett University."

      where exactly is that? Virginia is a state on the East Coast. Danville is in\
      \ southern Virginia, near the North Carolina border. Let me recall the latitude.\
      \ New York City is at around 40.7\xB0 N latitude. Danville, VA is at about 36.6\xB0\
      \ N. Since latitude decreases as you go south, Danville (Averett University)\

      \ Averett is at 36.6\xB0 N, then NYC is north of Danville. Therefore, Averett\
      \ is south of ELHE. So ELHE is north of Averett, meaning the answer would be\

    3d733a30-5071-4ab8-b471-659d98ebb86b: "<think>Alright, so I need to figure out\
      \ if \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in New York is located south of Averett\
      \ University in Virginia. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by\
      \ step.\n\nFirst, I should verify the locations of both institutions. \xC9cole\
      \ libre des hautes \xE9tudes, NY\u2014I'm not familiar with that school off\
      \ the top of my head. Let me check where exactly it is. Let me think... I recall\
      \ that there's an institution called \xC9cole des Hautes \xC9tudes en Sciences\
      \ Sociales (EHESS) in France, but the question specifies \"NY,\" so maybe it's\
      \ a branch or affiliate in New York City. Possibly located in NYC. Let me confirm.\
      \ Maybe it's part of The New School or another university there? Alternatively,\
      \ maybe it's a historical institution. Wait, actually, I think there was an\
      \ \xC9cole Libre des Hautes \xC9tudes established in New York during World War\
      \ II by French scholars in exile. It was affiliated with the New School for\
      \ Social Research. Now, does it still exist? Or is it a historical institution\
      \ that no longer operates? If it's a past institution, then its location during\
      \ its active years would determine the answer. But the question is in the present\
      \ tense, so probably referring to its location when it existed, or maybe a current\
      \ entity. Maybe I need to check if it's still around. If it was part of the\
      \ New School, then its address would be in New York City. Let me assume it was\
      \ in NYC, specifically Manhattan. So New York City's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 40.7128\xB0 N latitude.\n\nNow, Averett University in Virginia. Where is that\
      \ located? Averett University is in Danville, Virginia. I think Danville is\
      \ in the southern part of Virginia, near the North Carolina border. Let me confirm\
      \ the coordinates. Danville, VA has a latitude of around 36.5859\xB0 N. \n\n\
      So comparing the two latitudes: New York City is at about 40.7\xB0 N, and Danville,\
      \ VA is at about 36.6\xB0 N. Since latitude lines run east-west, a lower latitude\
      \ means further south. Therefore, Danville (Averett University) is south of\
      \ New York City (\xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes). Therefore, the \xC9cole\
      \ in NYC would be north of Averett, making the answer NO\u2014since the question\
      \ is whether the \xC9cole is south of Averett.\n\nWait, but the user is asking\
      \ if \xC9cole is south of Averett. So if \xC9cole is in NYC at 40.7\xB0 N and\
      \ Averett is at 36.6\xB0 N, then NYC is north of Averett. Therefore, \xC9cole\
      \ is not south of Averett. So the answer is NO.\n\nBut wait, did I get the institutions'\
      \ locations right? Let me double-check. Averett University is indeed in Danville,\
      \ VA. Yes, confirmed. Now, the \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes: according\
      \ to historical records, it was established in 1942 in New York City as a free\
      \ French university in exile. It ceased operations in the 1940s. However, the\
      \ question is phrased in the present tense\u2014\"is located\"\u2014but if the\
      \ institution no longer exists, does that affect the answer? Maybe the question\
      \ assumes it's still existing. Alternatively, maybe it's part of another institution.\
      \ But regardless, the location would still be NYC. So the latitude comparison\
      \ holds. NYC is north of Danville, VA, so the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine\

      \ as a separate entity today. But since the question is about its location,\
      \ assuming it's referring to when it was active, it would have been in New York\
      \ City, specifically in Manhattan.\n\nNext, Averett University in Virginia.\
      \ I know that Averett is a private university in Danville, Virginia. To confirm,\
      \ Danville is in southern Virginia, close to the North Carolina border. Let\
      \ me check the coordinates or the approximate latitude of both places to determine\

      \ they meant the main campus in Norfolk, VA. Because Old Dominion's main campus\
      \ is in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nSo, if I proceed under that assumption, I need\
      \ to compare the latitudes of Columbus, Indiana, and Norfolk, Virginia. Since\
      \ the question is whether one is south of the other, latitude is key. The lower\
      \ the latitude, the further south a location is.\n\nFirst, find the latitude\
      \ of Columbus, Indiana. From what I remember, Columbus is in southern Indiana.\
      \ Indiana's southern border is along the Ohio River, which separates it from\
      \ Kentucky. Columbus, IN is about 40 miles south of Indianapolis, which is around\
      \ 39.7686\xB0 N latitude. Columbus, IN's latitude is approximately 39.2014\xB0\
      \ N.\n\nNow, Norfolk, VA. Norfolk is in southeastern Virginia, near the coast.\
      \ Its latitude is around 36.8508\xB0 N. \n\nComparing the two: 39.2014\xB0 N\
      \ (Columbus, IN) vs. 36.8508\xB0 N (Norfolk, VA). Since 36.85 is less than 39.2,\
      \ Norfolk is further south. That would mean Old Dominion University in Norfolk,\
      \ VA is south of Columbus, IN. Therefore, Indiana University-Purdue University\
      \ Columbus, IN is north of Old Dominion, so the answer would be NO, it's not\
      \ south.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact latitude of Columbus, Indiana.\
      \ Maybe I'm off. Let me double-check. A quick check: Columbus, IN coordinates\
      \ are approximately 39\xB012'05\"N 85\xB055'17\"W. Converting that to decimal,\
      \ that's 39 + 12/60 + 5/3600 \u2248 39.2014\xB0 N. Correct.\n\nNorfolk, VA:\
      \ 36.8508\xB0 N. That's correct. So 36.85 is definitely south of 39.20. Therefore,\
      \ Columbus, IN is north of Norfolk, VA. Therefore, the university in Columbus\
      \ is not south of Old Dominion. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \n**Step-by-Step\

      \ where these two universities are located. \n\nStarting with Indiana University\
      \ \u2013 Purdue University Columbus. Wait, I think there are several IU-Purdue\
      \ campuses, like IUPUI in Indianapolis. But Columbus, IN is a different one.\
      \ So Columbus, Indiana. I need to find the latitude of Columbus, Indiana. Then,\
      \ Old Dominion University is in Virginia. The question mentions \"POD, VA\"\
      . Maybe that's a typo or an abbreviation. Old Dominion is in Norfolk, Virginia,\
      \ I believe. Let me confirm.\n\nFirst, checking Old Dominion University. Yes,\
      \ Old Dominion University (ODU) is located in Norfolk, Virginia. So \"POD, VA\"\
      \ might be a mistake, perhaps they meant Norfolk, VA. So the question is comparing\
      \ the latitudes of Columbus, Indiana and Norfolk, Virginia to see if Columbus\
      \ is south of Norfolk.\n\nNow, to find the coordinates. Columbus, IN: Let me\
      \ recall that Indiana is in the Midwest, and Columbus is a city in the southern\
      \ part of Indiana? Or maybe central. Wait, Indiana's southern border is along\
      \ the Ohio River, which is the border with Kentucky. Columbus, IN is actually\
      \ in the southeastern part of the state, maybe around 39\xB0N latitude? Norfolk,\
      \ VA is on the coast of Virginia. Virginia's latitude: Norfolk is in the southeastern\
      \ part of Virginia, near Virginia Beach. Its latitude should be around 36.85\xB0\
      N, as I remember that Virginia is further south than Indiana. So if Columbus,\
      \ IN is at a higher latitude (more north) than Norfolk, VA, then the answer\
      \ is NO. But if Columbus is at a lower latitude (more south), then YES.\n\n\
      Checking specific coordinates: Let's look up the exact latitudes. For Columbus,\
      \ Indiana, the coordinates are approximately 39\xB012' N latitude. For Norfolk,\
      \ Virginia, it's approximately 36\xB051' N latitude. Wait, no, that can't be\
      \ right. Wait, no: Wait, actually, Virginia is further south than Indiana. Indiana\
      \ is north of Kentucky, which is south of the Ohio River. So Indiana is in the\
      \ Midwest, upper South. Virginia is on the East Coast, mid-Atlantic. So Norfolk,\
      \ VA is at a lower latitude than Columbus, IN. So Columbus, IN would be north\
      \ of Norfolk, VA. Therefore, Indiana University-Purdue Columbus is north of\
      \ Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA. So the answer is NO, it is not located\

    75e90685-c60f-4275-afbe-7cf514a7f6ea: "<think>Alright, so I need to figure out\
      \ if Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Columbus, IN is located south\
      \ of Old Dominion University POD, VA. Let me start by breaking down the question.\n\
      \nFirst, I need to confirm the exact locations of both universities. Let's take\
      \ them one at a time. \n\nStarting with Indiana University\u2013Purdue University\
      \ Columbus, IN. Wait, actually, I think the correct name might be Indiana University\u2013\
      Purdue University Columbus, but I should check that. Also, Columbus is in Indiana,\
      \ right? So the state is Indiana (IN), and the city is Columbus. I should look\
      \ up the coordinates for that campus.\n\nNext, Old Dominion University POD,\
      \ VA. Hmm, POD might be a typo or a specific campus designation. Old Dominion\
      \ University is in Norfolk, Virginia (VA). But what does POD stand for? Maybe\
      \ it's a specific part of the campus or a different location? Let me verify.\
      \ Perhaps it's a typo for \"POH\" or another abbreviation. Alternatively, maybe\
      \ \"POD\" refers to a particular building or extension campus. Since Old Dominion's\
      \ main campus is in Norfolk, VA, maybe that's what they're referring to here.\
      \ Let me assume for now that it's the main campus in Norfolk, unless there's\
      \ a specific POD location I'm unaware of.\n\nNow, I need to get the latitude\
      \ of both places. Latitude determines north-south positioning. The higher the\
      \ latitude, the farther north a location is. So if Old Dominion University in\
      \ Norfolk, VA has a lower latitude than Indiana University\u2013Purdue University\
      \ Columbus, IN, then the latter would be north, and the former would be south.\
      \ Conversely, if Columbus, IN is at a lower latitude, it would be south of Norfolk,\
      \ VA.\n\nLet me find the coordinates. \n\nStarting with Indiana University\u2013\
      Purdue University Columbus (IUPUC). Columbus, Indiana is in the southern part\
      \ of the state. The coordinates for Columbus, IN are approximately 39.2014\xB0\
      \ N, 85.9214\xB0 W. Let me confirm that. Yes, Columbus, IN is in Bartholomew\
      \ County, and its latitude is around 39.2\xB0 N.\n\nOld Dominion University\
      \ in Norfolk, Virginia. Norfolk's coordinates are approximately 36.8508\xB0\
      \ N, 76.2858\xB0 W. So that's a latitude of about 36.85\xB0 N.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two: 36.85\xB0 N (Norfolk, VA) versus 39.20\xB0 N (Columbus, IN). Since\
      \ 36.85 is less than 39.20, Norfolk is south of Columbus. Therefore, Old Dominion\
      \ University in Norfolk is located south of IUPUC in Columbus, IN. But the question\
      \ is asking if IUPUC is south of Old Dominion. Wait, no\u2014since Norfolk is\
      \ at a lower latitude, it's further south. So Columbus, IN is north of Norfolk,\
      \ VA. Therefore, the answer would be NO, Indiana University\u2013Purdue University\
      \ Columbus, IN is not south of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA. Instead,\
      \ it's north.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I didn't mix up the comparison.\
      \ Latitude: lower number is further south. So if A is at 39\xB0N and B is at\
      \ 36\xB0N, then A is north of B. Therefore, IUPUC is north of ODU. Hence, the\
      \ answer is NO.\n</think>NO. Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Columbus\
      \ (IN) is located at approximately 39.2\xB0 N latitude, while Old Dominion University\
      \ in Norfolk, VA, is around 36.85\xB0 N. Since lower latitude means further\
      \ south, Old Dominion is south of IUPUC. Thus, IUPUC is **north** of Old Dominion,\
      \ making the answer NO."

      \ So, the user is asking if the University of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls, WI\
      \ is located south of Lake Michigan College, MI. Hmm, okay. First, I need to\
      \ figure out the locations of both institutions. \n\nStarting with the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls. I know that the University of Wisconsin system\
      \ has several campuses. River Falls is a city in Wisconsin. Let me recall where\
      \ exactly. I think River Falls is in the western part of Wisconsin, near the\
      \ Minnesota border. Maybe near the Twin Cities? Because Minneapolis-St. Paul\
      \ is on the Minnesota side, and River Falls is probably in that area. So, western\
      \ Wisconsin, near the St. Croix River.\n\nNow, Lake Michigan College. The name\
      \ suggests it's near Lake Michigan. The college is in Michigan, so likely on\
      \ the eastern side of the state, along the lake. Let me confirm. Lake Michigan\
      \ College is in Benton Harbor, Michigan. Benton Harbor is in the southwestern\
      \ part of Michigan, right on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. So, that's\
      \ in the lower peninsula of Michigan, near the Indiana border.\n\nNext, I need\
      \ to compare their latitudes to determine which is further south. Latitude is\
      \ the key here because \"south of\" refers to a lower latitude. So, if the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013River Falls has a lower latitude (i.e., is further south)\
      \ than Lake Michigan College, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nLet\
      \ me get the approximate coordinates. For River Falls, WI: I think it's around\
      \ 44\xB051' N latitude. Benton Harbor, MI (Lake Michigan College's location)\
      \ is around 42\xB007' N. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, Michigan's\
      \ lower peninsula, the southern part, like Benton Harbor, is actually around\
      \ 42\xB0N. Whereas River Falls, WI, being in western Wisconsin, is further north.\
      \ For example, Minneapolis is around 44\xB058' N, and River Falls is near there.\
      \ So, if River Falls is at about 44.85\xB0N and Benton Harbor is at 42.1\xB0\
      N, then Benton Harbor is actually further south. Therefore, the University of\
      \ Wisconsin\u2013River Falls is north of Lake Michigan College. So the answer\
      \ would be NO, it's not south; it's north.\n\nWait, but maybe I mixed up the\
      \ coordinates. Let me double-check. Let me think of major cities. Chicago is\
      \ around 41.88\xB0N. Benton Harbor is in southwestern Michigan, near the Indiana\
      \ border, so it's close to Chicago's latitude. So Benton Harbor is around 42.1\xB0\
      N. River Falls, WI, being near Minneapolis (which is around 44.98\xB0N), would\
      \ be higher latitude. So yes, River Falls is north of Lake Michigan College.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if the University of Wisconsin\u2013\

      \ latitudes: 44.85\xB0N vs 42.12\xB0N. So, 44.85 is higher (more north) than\

      \ of Lake Michigan.\n\nNow, comparing their latitudes. The key here is latitude\
      \ because south means a lower latitude. So, if River Falls, WI has a lower latitude\
      \ than Benton Harbor, MI, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nWhat's the\

      \ N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a higher number is further north.\

      \ River Falls, WI: Let me look that up. River Falls is around 44.8583\xB0 N\
      \ latitude. \n\nComparing the two, 42.1167\xB0 N (Benton Harbor) versus 44.8583\xB0\

      \ start with Minot State University. I know Minot is a city in North Dakota.\
      \ North Dakota is in the northern part of the United States, near the Canadian\

      \ Conversely, if Cortland's latitude is higher, then Minot would be south of\

      \ capital, is around 42.6\xB0N. Syracuse is about 43.0\xB0N. Cortland is south\
      \ of Syracuse? Wait, Cortland is actually southeast of Syracuse, but still in\
      \ central NY. Let me check approximate latitude. If Syracuse is 43\xB0N, maybe\
      \ Cortland is slightly south, like 42.6\xB0N? Or maybe same as Syracuse? Hmm.\
      \ Alternatively, maybe look up a specific landmark. But since I can't actually\
      \ search, I have to estimate. \n\nWait, maybe I can recall that the 42nd parallel\
      \ runs through northern Pennsylvania and southern New York. For example, the\
      \ NY-PA border is along 42\xB0N. Cortland is north of that. Let me think: Binghamton,\
      \ NY is around 42.1\xB0N. Cortland is a bit north of Binghamton. So maybe Cortland\
      \ is around 42.6\xB0N, while Minot, ND is around 48.2\xB0N. If that's the case,\
      \ then Cortland would be further south than Minot. So Minot State U would be\
      \ north of SUNY Cortland, meaning the answer is NO, because the question is\
      \ whether Minot is south of Cortland.\n\nBut wait, maybe my estimates are off.\
      \ Let me think again. Maybe I mixed up the latitudes. For example, Seattle is\
      \ around 47.6\xB0N, which is quite north. Minot, ND is in the northern part\
      \ of North Dakota. North Dakota's southern border is at 45.9\xB0N, and the northern\
      \ border at 49\xB0N. Minot is in the north-central part, so maybe around 48.2\xB0\
      N. If Cortland is at 42.6\xB0N, then Minot is way north of Cortland, so the\
      \ answer is NO.\n\nAlternatively, if Cortland is at a higher latitude than I\
      \ thought. Let me consider another approach. Buffalo, NY is at 42.88\xB0N. Rochester,\
      \ NY is 43.16\xB0N. Syracuse is 43.05\xB0N. Cortland is east of Syracuse, but\
      \ how far north? Looking at a map in my mind, Cortland is south of Syracuse.\
      \ Wait, actually, Syracuse is north of Cortland. So if Syracuse is 43\xB0N,\
      \ Cortland might be around 42.6\xB0N. For example, Cortland's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 42.60\xB0N, 76.18\xB0W. Let's assume that's correct. Then Minot,\
      \ ND is around 48.23\xB0N, 101.29\xB0W. So comparing 48.23\xB0N vs 42.60\xB0\
      N, Minot is much further north. Therefore, Minot State U is north of SUNY Cortland,\
      \ so the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if Minot State University (ND)\

      \ step.\n\nFirst, I should probably find the locations of both universities.\
      \ Let me start with Minot State University. I know that Minot is a city in North\
      \ Dakota. From what I remember, North Dakota is in the northern part of the\
      \ United States, near the border with Canada. So Minot is likely in the northern\
      \ part of North Dakota. Maybe I can check the latitude of Minot, ND.\n\nNext,\
      \ the State University of New York at Cortland, or SUNY Cortland, is in Cortland,\
      \ New York. New York State is in the northeastern U.S. Cortland is in upstate\
      \ New York, right? I think it's somewhere in the central part of the state,\
      \ maybe not too far from Syracuse. But where exactly?\n\nLatitude is the key\
      \ here. The further north a location is (higher latitude), the more north it\
      \ is. So if Minot, ND has a higher latitude than Cortland, NY, then Minot would\
      \ be north of Cortland, and the answer would be NO. If Cortland's latitude is\
      \ higher, then Minot would be south, so YES.\n\nLet me look up the coordinates.\
      \ For Minot, ND: I think Minot is around 48 degrees north latitude. Let me confirm.\
      \ A quick search: Minot, ND has a latitude of approximately 48.2325\xB0 N. \n\
      \nNow for Cortland, NY. Cortland's latitude is around 42.60\xB0 N. Wait, let\
      \ me check. Maybe 42.60\xB0 N? Yes, looking it up, Cortland, NY is at approximately\
      \ 42.60\xB0 N latitude. \n\nComparing the two: 48.23\xB0 N vs. 42.60\xB0 N.\
      \ Since 48.23 is higher than 42.60, that means Minot, ND is significantly further\
      \ north than Cortland, NY. Therefore, Minot State University is actually located\
      \ north of SUNY Cortland, not south. \n\nSo the answer should be NO, Minot State\
      \ University is not south of SUNY Cortland; it's much further north.\n</think>To\

      \ step by step. So, the question is whether Minot State University in North\

      \ cities because that's what determines if one is south of the other.\n\nStarting\
      \ with Minot State University in North Dakota. I know Minot is a city in North\

      \ So if Minot's latitude is lower (closer to the equator) than Cortland's, then\
      \ Minot is south of Cortland. Let me try to recall or estimate. North Dakota\

      \ isn't as far north as North Dakota. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let\
      \ me think again.\n\nWait, North Dakota is at a higher latitude than New York\
      \ State. For example, the northern border of North Dakota is at 49\xB0N latitude,\
      \ which is the same as the Canada-US border. New York State, even upstate, like\
      \ Plattsburgh or Watertown, is around 44\xB0N to 45\xB0N. But Cortland is a\
      \ bit south of Syracuse, which is around 43\xB0N. So maybe Cortland is around\
      \ 42-43\xB0N. Minot, ND, though, is in the northern part of North Dakota. Let\
      \ me check approximate coordinates.\n\nFrom memory, Minot's latitude is approximately\
      \ 48.2\xB0N. Cortland, NY is around 42.6\xB0N. Wait, that would mean Cortland\
      \ is actually further south than Minot. Oh, wait, no. If Minot is at a higher\
      \ latitude (48\xB0N) and Cortland at 42\xB0N, then Cortland is actually south\
      \ of Minot. Therefore, Minot State University would be north of SUNY Cortland.\
      \ Therefore, the answer would be NO, Minot State is not south of SUNY Cortland.\n\
      \nWait, but I need to confirm the exact coordinates. Maybe I'm off by a few\
      \ degrees. Let me double-check. Minot, ND's coordinates are roughly 48.2324\xB0\
      \ N, 101.2963\xB0 W. Cortland, NY is approximately 42.6012\xB0 N, 76.1805\xB0\
      \ W. So Minot is indeed at a higher latitude (48.23\xB0N) compared to Cortland's\
      \ 42.60\xB0N. Since latitude increases as you go north, Minot is north of Cortland.\

      \ The question is whether Calvary University in Missouri is located south of\
      \ Kennesaw State University's College of Humanities and Social Sciences in Georgia.\
      \ At first glance, that seems a bit counterintuitive because Missouri is generally\
      \ north of Georgia. But let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to\
      \ confirm the locations of both universities. Let's start with Calvary University\
      \ in Missouri. I think Calvary University is in Kansas City, Missouri. I remember\
      \ that Kansas City is in the western part of Missouri, near the border with\
      \ Kansas. Then, Kennesaw State University is in Georgia. The College of Humanities\
      \ and Social Sciences would be part of the main campus, which I believe is in\
      \ Kennesaw, Georgia. \n\nNow, I need to check the geographical coordinates to\
      \ compare their latitudes. The latitude will determine how far north or south\
      \ they are. A higher latitude means further north. So, if Calvary University\
      \ (MO) has a lower latitude than Kennesaw State (GA), then it's further south.\n\
      \nLooking up the coordinates: Kansas City, MO is approximately 39.0997\xB0 N.\
      \ Kennesaw, GA is around 34.0234\xB0 N. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because\
      \ 34\xB0N is actually further south than 39\xB0N. For example, Atlanta, GA is\
      \ around 33.7\xB0N, so Kennesaw being 34\xB0N makes sense. But if Kansas City\
      \ is 39\xB0N, that's way further north. So Kansas City, MO is north of Kennesaw,\
      \ GA. Therefore, Calvary University in MO would be north of Kennesaw State University\
      \ in GA. So the answer should be NO. But let me double-check the exact locations\
      \ to make sure I didn't mix up the cities.\n\nCalvary University's address is\
      \ 15800 Calvary Road, Kansas City, MO 64147. Checking a map, Kansas City, MO\
      \ is indeed in the northern part of Missouri. Kennesaw State's main campus is\
      \ in Kennesaw, GA, which is northwest of Atlanta. The latitude for Kennesaw\
      \ is about 34.0234\xB0 N, and Kansas City, MO is around 39.0997\xB0 N. Since\
      \ 39 degrees is higher than 34 degrees, Kansas City is further north. Therefore,\
      \ Calvary University in Missouri is actually north of Kennesaw State's campus\
      \ in Georgia. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nCalvary University is located\

      \ College of Humanities and Social Sciences is in Kennesaw, Georgia (latitude\
      \ ~34.0\xB0 N). Since lower latitude means further south, Kennesaw, GA (34\xB0\
      \ N) is south of Kansas City, MO (39\xB0 N). Thus, Calvary University is **not**\
      \ south of Kennesaw State University's campus."

      \ I should probably check where exactly each of these institutions is located.\
      \ \n\nStarting with Calvary University in Missouri. I think Calvary University\
      \ is in Kansas City, Missouri. But wait, maybe I should confirm that. I recall\
      \ that there's a Calvary University in Kansas City, MO. Let me double-check.\
      \ Yes, a quick mental note: Calvary University is indeed in Kansas City, Missouri.\
      \ So their coordinates would be somewhere around Kansas City.\n\nNow, Kennesaw\
      \ State University is in Georgia. The College of Humanities and Social Sciences\
      \ is part of Kennesaw State, right? So that would be located at the main campus\
      \ of Kennesaw State, which is in Kennesaw, Georgia. I remember that Kennesaw\
      \ is a city in Georgia, northwest of Atlanta. Now, to compare their latitudes\
      \ to determine which is further south. Because if Calvary University (MO) is\
      \ south of Kennesaw State (GA), then the answer would be yes; otherwise, no.\n\
      \nSo, the key here is the latitude of Kansas City, Missouri versus Kennesaw,\
      \ Georgia. Generally, I know that Georgia is further south than Missouri. Missouri\
      \ is in the Midwest, while Georgia is in the Southeast. For example, Atlanta,\
      \ GA is around 33.7\xB0 N latitude. Kansas City, MO is at about 39.1\xB0 N.\
      \ Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, Atlanta's latitude is around 33.7550\xB0\
      \ N. Kennesaw is a bit northwest of Atlanta, so maybe around 34.0234\xB0 N.\
      \ Kansas City, Missouri is at 39.0997\xB0 N. Latitude increases as you go north.\
      \ So if a location has a lower latitude, it's further south. So if Kennesaw,\
      \ GA is at ~34\xB0 N and Kansas City, MO is at ~39\xB0 N, then Kennesaw is further\
      \ south. Therefore, Calvary University in MO is north of Kennesaw State's college\
      \ in GA. So the answer would be NO, Calvary University is not south of Kennesaw\
      \ State's college.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I mixed up the cities. Let me confirm\
      \ the exact coordinates. Let me think: Kansas City, MO is indeed in the northern\
      \ part of Missouri, near the border with Kansas. Kennesaw, GA is in the northern\
      \ part of Georgia, near Atlanta. So Georgia as a state is south of Missouri,\
      \ but the specific cities might vary. But given that Kansas City is at a higher\

      \ whether Bryant University in Rhode Island is located south of Central Methodist\

      First, I should probably determine the geographic locations of both universities,\

      \ Latitude is the key here because it measures how far north or south a place\
      \ is from the equator. The higher the latitude, the farther north it is.\n\n\
      So, starting with Bryant University in Rhode Island. I know Rhode Island is\
      \ a state in the northeastern United States. Bryant University is in Smithfield,\
      \ RI. Let me recall, the approximate latitude of Rhode Island. For example,\
      \ Providence, the capital, is around 41.82\xB0 N. Smithfield is a town nearby,\
      \ so its latitude should be similar. Maybe around 41.9\xB0 N or so.\n\nNext,\
      \ Central Methodist University in Missouri. Missouri is a Midwestern state.\
      \ Central Methodist is located in Fayette, Missouri. I need to find the latitude\
      \ of Fayette, MO. Let me think, Missouri's latitude ranges. For example, St.\
      \ Louis is around 38.63\xB0 N, and Columbia, MO is about 38.95\xB0 N. Fayette\
      \ might be a bit further north than Columbia? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe Fayette is in the central part of Missouri. Let me check mentally. Fayette,\
      \ MO is in Howard County. Looking up in my memory, Howard County is in central\
      \ Missouri. Maybe its latitude is around 39.15\xB0 N. Wait, but I'm not exactly\
      \ certain. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with another city. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I can think of Kansas City, MO is around 39.10\xB0 N. If Fayette is\
      \ north of that, it might be higher. But actually, Fayette, MO's coordinates:\
      \ I think I'm a bit unsure here. Let's try to recall. If I remember correctly,\
      \ Fayette, MO is at approximately 39.14\xB0 N latitude.\n\nComparing that to\
      \ Bryant University's latitude, which is around 41.9\xB0 N. So if Bryant is\
      \ at 41.9\xB0 N and Central Methodist is at 39.14\xB0 N, then Bryant would be\
      \ north of Central Methodist, meaning Central Methodist is south of Bryant.\
      \ Therefore, Bryant University in RI would actually be located north of Central\
      \ Methodist University in MO, making the answer NO, because the question is\
      \ asking if Bryant is south of Central Methodist.\n\nWait, but let me make sure\
      \ I have the latitudes correct. Maybe I'm mistaken about Fayette, MO's latitude.\
      \ Let me think again. Another way: Missouri's southern border is around 36\xB0\
      \ N, and the northern border is around 40.6\xB0 N. So the state spans roughly\
      \ from 36\xB0N to 40.6\xB0N. Fayette is in central Missouri, so perhaps around\
      \ 39\xB0 N. Bryant in RI is around 41.8\xB0 N. So yes, 41.8 is north of 39.\

      \ (UNC Pembroke) in NC. \n\nFirst, I need to get the approximate latitudes of\
      \ both institutions because latitude determines how far north or south a place\
      \ is. The higher the latitude, the farther north it is. So if Webb Institute's\
      \ latitude is lower (smaller number) than UNC Pembroke's, then it's further\
      \ south.\n\nI remember that New York is generally in the northern part of the\
      \ US, while North Carolina is in the southeastern part. But maybe Webb Institute\
      \ is in a southern part of NY? Let me check where exactly Webb Institute is\
      \ located. A quick search shows that Webb Institute is in Glen Cove, New York.\
      \ Glen Cove is on the north shore of Long Island. Long Island is east of New\
      \ York City. Since it's on the north shore, that's pretty far north in New York\
      \ State. So Glen Cove, NY's latitude\u2014I think it's around 40.8 degrees North.\n\
      \nNow, UNC Pembroke is in Pembroke, North Carolina. North Carolina is a southern\
      \ state, so I would expect its latitude to be lower than New York's. Let me\
      \ confirm. Pembroke, NC's latitude is approximately 34.7 degrees North. \n\n\
      Comparing the two: 34.7 (UNC Pembroke) vs. 40.8 (Webb Institute). Since 34.7\
      \ is less than 40.8, UNC Pembroke is further south. Therefore, Webb Institute\

      \ Since lower latitude means farther south, UNC Pembroke is south of Webb Institute.\
      \ Thus, Webb Institute is **not** located south of UNC Pembroke."
    4f4eb50f-77c8-41f7-a921-5d30d4514d08: "<think>Alright, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Webb Institute in NY is located south of the\
      \ University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNC Pembroke) in NC. Hmm, okay.\n\
      \nFirst, I need to know the locations of both institutions. Webb Institute is\
      \ in New York, and UNC Pembroke is in North Carolina. But just because one is\
      \ in NY and the other in NC doesn't automatically mean which is farther south.\
      \ North Carolina is definitely a southern state compared to New York, but maybe\
      \ Webb Institute is in a southern part of NY, and UNC Pembroke is in a northern\
      \ part of NC? I need to check their specific cities or towns.\n\nLet me recall:\
      \ Webb Institute is in Glen Cove, New York. I think Glen Cove is on Long Island.\
      \ Long Island is part of New York State, extending eastward into the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean. So Glen Cove would be on the northern shore of Long Island. As for\
      \ UNC Pembroke, Pembroke is in North Carolina. I believe Pembroke is in the\
      \ southeastern part of the state, maybe near the South Carolina border. \n\n\
      Now, to compare their latitudes. The latitude of Glen Cove, NY, and Pembroke,\
      \ NC. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is. Higher latitude means\
      \ farther north. So if Glen Cove's latitude is lower (i.e., closer to the equator)\
      \ than Pembroke's, then Webb Institute would be south of UNC Pembroke. But if\
      \ Glen Cove is at a higher latitude, then it's north.\n\nLooking up approximate\
      \ latitudes: Glen Cove, NY, is around 40.8 degrees North. Pembroke, NC, is approximately\
      \ 34.7 degrees North. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, North Carolina\
      \ is south of Virginia, which is south of Maryland, which is south of Pennsylvania,\
      \ then New York. So New York is definitely north of North Carolina. But maybe\
      \ the specific locations differ? Wait, 40.8\xB0N for Glen Cove vs. 34.7\xB0\
      N for Pembroke? That doesn't make sense because 34.7\xB0N would be much further\
      \ south, like around the latitude of South Carolina. Wait, maybe I have the\
      \ coordinates mixed up.\n\nWait, let me check again. UNC Pembroke is in Pembroke,\
      \ NC. Let me think about the location of Pembroke, NC. Pembroke is in Robeson\
      \ County, which is in the southern part of North Carolina, near the border with\
      \ South Carolina. The latitude for Pembroke, NC should be around 34.68\xB0N.\
      \ Webb Institute in Glen Cove, NY, is on Long Island. The latitude for Glen\
      \ Cove is approximately 40.87\xB0N. \n\nComparing 40.87\xB0N (Glen Cove) and\
      \ 34.68\xB0N (Pembroke), Pembroke is significantly farther south. So, Glen Cove,\

      \ New York is north of North Carolina, so probably the answer is no. But I need\
      \ to check the exact coordinates.\n\nLet me recall approximate latitudes. New\
      \ York State is around 40-45 degrees N. North Carolina is further south, maybe\
      \ around 35-36 degrees N. For example, New York City is about 40.7\xB0 N. Pembroke,\

      \ Pembroke, NC. I think Pembroke is in Robeson County, which is near the South\
      \ Carolina border. So its latitude should be around 34.7\xB0 N. \n\nGlen Cove,\
      \ NY is on Long Island. Let me think, Long Island's latitude is similar to NYC.\
      \ Glen Cove is on the north shore of Long Island. So maybe around 40.8\xB0 N.\
      \ \n\nSo if Glen Cove is 40.8\xB0 N and Pembroke is 34.7\xB0 N, then Pembroke\
      \ is further south. Therefore, Webb Institute (Glen Cove) is north of UNC Pembroke.\

      \nWait, but maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me try to\

      \ City is 40.7\xB0, and Glen Cove is a bit north of NYC, maybe 40.85\xB0 N.\

      \ I remember that New York City is around 40.7\xB0 N latitude. Since Glen Cove\

      \ 34.7\xB0 N? I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's somewhere in the mid-34s.\n\
      \nComparing the two: if Webb Institute is around 40.7\xB0 N and UNC Pembroke\

      \ I know Webb Institute is a college in New York. I think it's in Glen Cove,\
      \ NY. Let me confirm that. Yes, Webb Institute is in Glen Cove, which is on\
      \ Long Island, New York. So the next step is to find the latitude of Glen Cove,\
      \ NY.\n\nThen, I need to find the location of UNC Pembroke. The University of\
      \ North Carolina at Pembroke is in Pembroke, North Carolina. Now, North Carolina\

      \nLooking up the latitude for Glen Cove, NY. Let me recall that New York City\

      \ latitudes. For example, Boston, MA is around 42.36\xB0 N. Chicago, IL is about\
      \ 41.88\xB0 N, which is slightly south of Boston. But Belleville is further\
      \ south in Illinois. St. Louis, MO is around 38.63\xB0 N. Since Belleville is\

      \ Springfield, MA is about 42.1\xB0 N. Westfield is west of Springfield, but\
      \ latitude should be similar. Maybe around 42.1\xB0 N. If Belleville is around\

      \ IL. Therefore, Westfield State University is not south of Lindenwood\u2013\
      Belleville. \n\nWait, but I need to be sure about the exact coordinates. Let\

      \ the University of Northern Iowa in Iowa is located south of William Jessup\
      \ University in California. I need to compare their latitudes because south\

      \ Let's start with the University of Northern Iowa (UNI). It's in Iowa. The\
      \ main campus is in Cedar Falls, Iowa. I think Cedar Falls is in the northern\
      \ part of Iowa. Iowa is a state in the Midwest, so probably mid to upper Midwest.\
      \ Now, for William Jessup University (WJU) in California. I believe William\
      \ Jessup is in Rocklin, California. Rocklin is near Sacramento, which is in\
      \ northern California. \n\nNext, I need the latitudes of both cities. For Cedar\
      \ Falls, IA, I recall that Iowa's latitude ranges roughly from about 40\xB0\
      N to 43\xB0N. Cedar Falls being in the north part would be around 42.5\xB0N.\
      \ Let me check... Yes, Cedar Falls is approximately at 42.53\xB0N latitude.\
      \ \n\nNow, Rocklin, CA. Northern California's latitude is higher than southern.\
      \ Sacramento is around 38.5\xB0N, but Rocklin is a bit north of Sacramento.\
      \ Wait, Sacramento is at 38.58\xB0N. Rocklin is actually northeast of Sacramento,\
      \ maybe around 38.8\xB0N. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think again.\
      \ If Sacramento is at 38.58\xB0N, then Rocklin, being a suburb to the northeast,\
      \ might be slightly higher. But some sources say Rocklin's latitude is approximately\
      \ 38.79\xB0N. Wait, that would make it around 38.8\xB0N. \n\nComparing the two:\
      \ Cedar Falls is at 42.53\xB0N and Rocklin at 38.79\xB0N. Since latitude decreases\
      \ as you go south, the lower latitude is further south. So Rocklin is at 38.79\xB0\
      N, which is south of Cedar Falls at 42.53\xB0N. Therefore, University of Northern\

      \ Let's say approximately 38.7\xB0N. \n\nSo Cedar Falls at ~42.5\xB0N vs. Rocklin\
      \ at ~38.7\xB0N. Since 38.7 is south of 42.5, that means William Jessup University\

      \ I should find the locations of both universities. Let's start with the University\

      \ Falls, Iowa. So I need to get the latitude of Cedar Falls, IA. Then, William\
      \ Jessup University is in California. I think it's located in Rocklin, California.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, William Jessup University is in Rocklin, CA.\n\n\
      Next, I need to find the latitudes of both cities. For Cedar Falls, Iowa: I\
      \ remember that Iowa is in the Midwest, generally in the northern part of the\
      \ US. Cedar Falls is in the northeastern part of Iowa. Maybe its latitude is\

      \ around 38-39 degrees north latitude. Checking Rocklin's coordinates, it's\
      \ roughly 38.7907\xB0 N. \n\nComparing the two: Cedar Falls at ~42.5\xB0 N and\
      \ Rocklin at ~38.8\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a lower\
      \ latitude means further south. Rocklin's latitude is lower (38.8) compared\

      \ Cedar Falls, IA has a latitude of around 42.53\xB0 N.\n\nNext, William Jessup\
      \ University (WJU) in California. California is on the west coast. WJU is in\
      \ Rocklin, California. I need to find the latitude of Rocklin. Rocklin is in\
      \ Northern California, near Sacramento. The latitude for Rocklin, CA is approximately\

      \ around 41.4 degrees north? Or wait, maybe Scranton is more around 41.4\xB0\

      \ Owensboro is in western Kentucky, near the Indiana border. The latitude of\

      \ Nashville, TN is around 36.1\xB0N, and Louisville, KY is about 38.2\xB0N.\
      \ Owensboro is west of Louisville, maybe a bit south? So perhaps 37.7\xB0N is\

      \ Evansville, IN is at about 37.97\xB0N. Owensboro is just across the river\

      \ So, the user wants to know if the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania is\

      \ Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out the geographic locations of both universities.\n\
      \nLet me start by recalling where Scranton, PA is. I know Scranton is a city\
      \ in northeastern Pennsylvania. It's in the Lackawanna County, if I remember\
      \ correctly. Now, Western Kentucky University (WKU) has a campus in Owensboro,\
      \ KY. Owensboro is in western Kentucky, right? But I'm not exactly sure about\
      \ the exact coordinates. \n\nWait, to compare their latitudes, since the question\
      \ is about being south, latitude is the key here. The lower the latitude, the\
      \ more south a location is. So I need to find the latitude of both cities.\n\
      \nLet me think. Scranton, PA. From what I know, Pennsylvania is in the northeastern\
      \ US. Scranton is not too far from the New York border. Its latitude might be\
      \ around, say, 41 degrees North. Owensboro, KY. Kentucky is further south than\
      \ Pennsylvania, so I would expect its latitude to be lower. But Owensboro is\
      \ in the western part of Kentucky. Let me check mentally: Kentucky's latitude\
      \ ranges from about 36.5\xB0N to 39\xB0N. Owensboro, being in the western part,\
      \ maybe around 37.5\xB0N? Whereas Scranton, PA is more like 41.4\xB0N. \n\n\
      Wait, let me confirm. If Scranton is at 41.4\xB0N and Owensboro at, say, 37.7\xB0\
      N, then Owensboro is south of Scranton. Wait, but the question is the reverse:\
      \ is Scranton south of Owensboro? If Owensboro is at a lower latitude (more\
      \ south), then Scranton would be north of it, so the answer would be NO. \n\n\
      But maybe I have the latitudes wrong. Let me think of other cities as references.\
      \ For example, Louisville, KY is around 38\xB0N. Owensboro is west of Louisville,\
      \ but latitude-wise, maybe similar or slightly lower. Scranton is in PA, which\
      \ is north of Kentucky. So Scranton must be north of Owensboro. Therefore, the\
      \ University of Scranton would be north of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is NO. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let\
      \ me think of specific coordinates. Let me recall: Scranton, PA's latitude is\
      \ approximately 41.4094\xB0 N. Owensboro, KY is approximately 37.7749\xB0 N.\
      \ Yes, 37.7749 is definitely lower than 41.4094. Therefore, Owensboro is south\
      \ of Scranton. So Scranton is NORTH of Owensboro, meaning the answer is NO,\

      \nI know that New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, right near the Gulf\

      \ but the main one is in Plainview, Texas. Where is Plainview located within\
      \ Texas? Texas is a big state. Plainview is in the northern part of Texas, in\
      \ the Panhandle region. The Texas Panhandle is known for being quite flat and\

      \ Baptist University in Texas is south of the University of New Orleans in Louisiana.\
      \ First, I need to locate both universities on a map. \n\nStarting with the\
      \ University of New Orleans (UNO). I know New Orleans is a major city in southeastern\
      \ Louisiana, right along the Mississippi River. It's near the Gulf of Mexico,\
      \ so its latitude should be relatively low, meaning it's pretty far south in\
      \ the US. Let me check the approximate coordinates. From memory, New Orleans\
      \ is around 29.95\xB0 N latitude.\n\nNow, Wayland Baptist University in Texas.\
      \ There are multiple campuses, but the main one is in Plainview, Texas. Wait,\

      \ main campus is actually in Plainview, TX. But wait, maybe I'm mixing that\
      \ up with another school. Hmm, no, I think that's correct. Plainview is in the\
      \ Texas Panhandle region. The Texas Panhandle is in the northern part of Texas,\
      \ so that area would have a higher latitude than New Orleans. For example, Amarillo,\
      \ TX is in the Panhandle and is around 35.2\xB0 N. Plainview is a bit south\
      \ of Amarillo, maybe around 34.18\xB0 N. \n\nComparing the two latitudes: UNO\
      \ at ~29.95\xB0 N and Wayland Baptist at ~34.18\xB0 N. Since latitude increases\
      \ as you go north, a higher number means further north. So 34.18\xB0 N is north\
      \ of 29.95\xB0 N. Therefore, Wayland Baptist in Texas is actually north of the\
      \ University of New Orleans. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake about the\

      \ campus of Wayland Baptist in San Antonio, TX. But the main campus is indeed\
      \ in Plainview. The question specifies \"Wayland Baptist University, TX\" without\
      \ mentioning a specific campus, so it's likely referring to the main campus\
      \ in Plainview. \n\nSo if Plainview is at a higher latitude than New Orleans,\
      \ then the answer is NO, Wayland Baptist is not south of UNO. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ if the question was about a different campus, like the one in San Antonio,\
      \ San Antonio is around 29.42\xB0 N, which is slightly south of New Orleans'\
      \ 29.95\xB0 N. But unless specified, the main campus is the one considered.\

      \ New Orleans (UNO) is in Louisiana. I know that New Orleans is a major city\
      \ in the southeastern part of Louisiana, right along the Gulf of Mexico. Geographically,\
      \ New Orleans is pretty far south in the state, and since Louisiana is in the\
      \ southern U.S., the latitude there should be relatively low. Latitude is the\
      \ key here because the question is about being south. Lower latitude means farther\
      \ south.\n\nNow, Wayland Baptist University (WBU) is in Texas. But Texas is\
      \ a big state, so the exact location within Texas matters. I think Wayland Baptist\
      \ has several campuses, but the main one is in Plainview, Texas. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yes, the main campus is in Plainview, Texas. Now, where is Plainview\
      \ located? Plainview is in the Texas Panhandle region. The Panhandle is the\
      \ northern part of Texas, sticking up like a handle. Cities like Amarillo are\
      \ in that area. So, if Plainview is in the Panhandle, that's pretty far north\
      \ in Texas.\n\nTo compare their latitudes, I need the approximate coordinates.\
      \ Let me try to recall or estimate. New Orleans is around 30 degrees north latitude.\
      \ For example, the coordinates of the University of New Orleans are approximately\
      \ 29.94\xB0 N, 90.10\xB0 W. Plainview, Texas, on the other hand, is in the Panhandle.\
      \ I think Amarillo is around 35 degrees north. Let me check. Amarillo is about\
      \ 35.22\xB0 N. Plainview is a bit southeast of Amarillo, so maybe around 34.18\xB0\
      \ N, 101.72\xB0 W. If that's the case, then Plainview at 34\xB0 N is north of\
      \ New Orleans at 30\xB0 N. Since latitude increases as you go north, a higher\
      \ number means farther north. So, if WBU is at 34\xB0 N and UNO is at 30\xB0\
      \ N, then UNO is actually south of WBU, which would mean that WBU is north of\
      \ UNO. Therefore, the answer would be NO, WBU is not south of UNO; it's actually\
      \ north.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I got the locations right. Is the main\
      \ campus of Wayland Baptist really in Plainview? Maybe I'm confusing it with\
      \ another campus. Let me double-check. A quick search in my mind... yes, the\

      \ The approximate latitude for Selma is around 32.4 degrees North. Now Fredericksburg,\
      \ Texas. Fredericksburg is in central Texas, west of Austin. The latitude there\
      \ is roughly 30.3 degrees North. Wait, if Fredericksburg, TX is at 30.3\xB0\

    7289bc5f-7c65-4d10-aaf8-c2519063689a: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Selma University in Alabama is located south\
      \ of Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, Texas. Hmm, I need to compare\
      \ their latitudes because south means lower latitude.\n\nFirst, I need the locations\
      \ of both universities. Let me start with Selma University in Alabama. I know\
      \ Selma is a city in Alabama. I think Alabama is in the southeastern US. Now,\
      \ Texas Tech in Fredericksburg, TX. Fredericksburg is in Texas, right? Texas\
      \ is southwest of Alabama. But I'm not sure about the exact coordinates.\n\n\
      Wait, Texas is generally south and west of Alabama. But the specific cities\
      \ matter. Let me recall: Fredericksburg, TX is in the central part of Texas,\
      \ maybe. Selma, AL is in central Alabama, perhaps. To know which is further\
      \ south, I need their exact latitudes.\n\nLet me try to remember or estimate.\
      \ For example, the approximate latitude of Selma, AL. Alabama's southern border\
      \ is around 31\xB0N, but Selma might be a bit north of that. Maybe around 32.4\xB0\
      N? And Fredericksburg, TX. Texas is larger, so Fredericksburg's latitude...\
      \ I think Fredericksburg is in the Texas Hill Country, central Texas. Maybe\
      \ around 30\xB0N? Wait, no, that might be too far south. Let me think. San Antonio\
      \ is around 29.4\xB0N. Austin is about 30.3\xB0N. Fredericksburg is west of\
      \ Austin, so maybe similar latitude. Let me check my mental map. Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX is north of San Antonio but south of, say, Abilene. Maybe around 30.3\xB0\
      N? Wait, if Austin is 30.3\xB0N and Fredericksburg is west of Austin, maybe\
      \ a similar latitude. So perhaps 30.3\xB0N. \n\nSelma, AL: Let me think. Montgomery,\
      \ AL is the capital, which is around 32.3\xB0N. Selma is west of Montgomery,\
      \ but I think still in the same general area. So Selma's latitude might be around\
      \ 32.4\xB0N. If that's the case, then Fredericksburg at 30.3\xB0N would be south\
      \ of Selma. Wait, but the question is if Selma is south of Texas Tech at Fredericksburg.\
      \ So if Selma is at a higher latitude (32.4 vs 30.3), that would mean Selma\
      \ is north of Fredericksburg, so the answer would be NO.\n\nBut wait, I need\
      \ to confirm the actual coordinates. Maybe I should look up the exact latitudes.\
      \ Let me think again. If Selma, AL is at 32.4\xB0N and Fredericksburg, TX is\
      \ at 30.3\xB0N, then Fredericksburg is south. So Selma would be north, not south.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is NO.\n\nWait, but I'm not 100% sure of the exact numbers.\
      \ Let me try another approach. Major cities: Dallas, TX is around 32.8\xB0N.\
      \ Fredericksburg is south of Dallas, so lower latitude. San Antonio is 29.4\xB0\
      N. So Fredericksburg is between San Antonio and Austin. Let's say 30.3\xB0N.\
      \ Selma, AL: Birmingham, AL is about 33.5\xB0N. Montgomery is 32.3\xB0N. Selma\
      \ is south of Montgomery? Wait, no. Selma is west of Montgomery. Let me check:\
      \ Selma is in Dallas County, Alabama. The latitude of Selma, AL according to\
      \ my memory is approximately 32.4076\xB0 N. Yes, that's what I thought. So 32.4\xB0\
      N. Fredericksburg, TX is around 30.2753\xB0 N. So yes, Fredericksburg is at\
      \ a lower latitude (30.2753\xB0N) compared to Selma's 32.4076\xB0N. Therefore,\
      \ Selma University is north of Texas Tech at Fredericksburg. Hence, the answer\
      \ is NO.\n</think>NO  \nSelma University in Alabama is located at approximately\
      \ 32.4\xB0N latitude, while Texas Tech University's campus in Fredericksburg,\

      \ (32.4\xB0N).  \n\n**ANSWER: NO**"
    d3df70de-63ac-4b69-9b71-cceb185f42bf: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ Selma University in Alabama is located south of Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg,\
      \ Texas. Hmm, first I need to know the exact locations of both places. \n\n\
      Starting with Selma University in Alabama. I know Selma is a city in Alabama,\
      \ but where exactly? Alabama is in the southeastern US. Selma is in the central\
      \ part of Alabama, maybe along the Alabama River. I think the approximate latitude\
      \ might be around 32.4 degrees north. Let me check that mentally. For example,\
      \ Montgomery, the capital of Alabama, is around 32.3\xB0N, so Selma could be\
      \ similar.\n\nThen Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX. Wait, Texas\
      \ Tech's main campus is in Lubbock, right? But maybe there's a campus or a center\
      \ in Fredericksburg. Fredericksburg is a town in Texas, I believe in the central\
      \ part, maybe the Hill Country area. Fredericksburg, TX is known for its German\
      \ heritage. The latitude there\u2014let me recall. Austin is around 30.3\xB0\
      N, and Fredericksburg is a bit northwest of Austin. So maybe Fredericksburg's\
      \ latitude is a bit higher, like around 30.3\xB0N or slightly more. Wait, no,\
      \ actually, moving northwest from Austin would increase the latitude. For example,\
      \ Dallas is around 32.8\xB0N. But Fredericksburg is not that far north. Let\
      \ me think. San Antonio is about 29.4\xB0N, Austin is 30.3\xB0N. Fredericksburg\
      \ is about 80 miles west of Austin. So maybe around 30.3\xB0N? Or maybe a bit\
      \ higher. Let me try to estimate. If Austin is 30.3\xB0N, and Fredericksburg\
      \ is to the northwest, perhaps 30.3\xB0N plus a degree or so. Wait, maybe I\
      \ should look up approximate coordinates. But since I can't, I have to estimate.\n\
      \nWait, Texas Tech's campus in Fredericksburg\u2014I'm not sure if that's a\
      \ real location. Maybe the user meant Texas Tech University's main campus in\
      \ Lubbock, but the question specifies Fredericksburg, TX. Let me confirm. Texas\
      \ Tech does have multiple campuses, but Fredericksburg is a smaller town. Perhaps\
      \ there's a branch there. Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion with another\
      \ university. But assuming the question is correct, we proceed.\n\nSo, Selma,\
      \ AL is at approximately 32.4\xB0N latitude. Fredericksburg, TX\u2014if I recall,\
      \ the actual coordinates for Fredericksburg, Texas are approximately 30.27\xB0\
      N, 98.86\xB0W. Wait, that would mean Fredericksburg is around 30.27\xB0N. But\
      \ Selma is at 32.4\xB0N. If that's the case, then Fredericksburg is actually\
      \ further south (since 30.27\xB0N is lower latitude than 32.4\xB0N). Wait, but\
      \ that can't be right. Wait, no, lower latitude is further south. So if Fredericksburg\
      \ is at 30.27\xB0N and Selma is at 32.4\xB0N, then Fredericksburg is south of\
      \ Selma. Wait, but the question is whether Selma is south of Texas Tech at Fredericksburg.\
      \ If Fredericksburg is at 30.27\xB0N, then Selma at 32.4\xB0N is north of Fredericksburg.\
      \ So the answer would be NO. But wait, maybe my initial assumption about the\
      \ latitude of Selma is wrong. Let me check that. Selma, AL's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 32.4076\xB0 N, 87.0211\xB0 W. So yes, around 32.4\xB0N. Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX is indeed around 30.27\xB0N. Therefore, Fredericksburg is south of Selma.\
      \ So the question is: Is Selma south of Fredericksburg? No, because 32.4 is\
      \ higher than 30.27, meaning Selma is north. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO\
      \  \nSelma University in Alabama is located at approximately 32.4\xB0N latitude,\
      \ while Texas Tech University's Fredericksburg, TX, campus is around 30.27\xB0\
      N latitude. Since lower latitudes are farther south, Fredericksburg is south\
      \ of Selma. Thus, Selma is **north** of Fredericksburg, making the answer NO."

    b1563e89-6aa9-4fcb-aea9-7fc668de660c: "<think>Okay, so the question is asking\
      \ whether Anderson University in Indiana is located south of Oklahoma State\
      \ University\u2013Oklahoma City in Oklahoma. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographical\
      \ locations of both universities and compare their latitudes. Let me start by\
      \ recalling where these places are.\n\nFirst, Anderson University in Indiana.\
      \ Anderson is a city in Indiana, which is in the Midwest of the United States.\
      \ Indiana is north of Kentucky and south of Michigan. The state's capital is\
      \ Indianapolis. Anderson, IN is a city somewhere in the state, but I'm not exactly\
      \ sure where. Maybe central or northern part? Let me think. I know Indianapolis\
      \ is in central Indiana. If Anderson is near there, then it's probably in the\
      \ central part. Alternatively, maybe it's more to the east? Wait, I should probably\
      \ confirm the exact location of Anderson University. \n\nThen, Oklahoma State\
      \ University\u2013Oklahoma City (OSU-OKC) is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Oklahoma\
      \ is south of Kansas and north of Texas. Oklahoma City is the capital of Oklahoma\
      \ and is in the central part of the state. So, the latitude of OKC is lower\
      \ (more south) compared to, say, Kansas. But how does it compare to Indiana?\n\
      \nTo determine which is further south, I need to know the approximate latitudes\
      \ of both cities. Latitude lines run horizontally, with higher numbers being\
      \ further north. For example, the equator is 0\xB0, and the North Pole is 90\xB0\
      N. In the US, cities in the southern states like Texas or Florida have lower\
      \ latitudes (closer to the equator) compared to northern states like Minnesota\
      \ or Maine.\n\nSo, Anderson, IN: Let me try to recall. Indianapolis is around\
      \ 39.7684\xB0 N. If Anderson is near Indianapolis, it might be similar. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe a bit north or south. Let me check (in my mind). Anderson, Indiana's\
      \ coordinates... I think Anderson is northeast of Indianapolis. Wait, or is\
      \ it east? Maybe around 40\xB0 N latitude? Let's say roughly 40\xB0 N.\n\nOklahoma\
      \ City, OK: I know that Oklahoma City's latitude is approximately 35.4676\xB0\
      \ N. That's significantly lower (more south) than 40\xB0 N. So if Anderson University\
      \ is around 40\xB0 N, and OSU-OKC is around 35.5\xB0 N, then OSU-OKC is further\
      \ south. Therefore, Anderson University would be north of OSU-OKC. So the question\
      \ is: Is Anderson University south of OSU-OKC? The answer would be NO, because\
      \ 40\xB0 N is north of 35.5\xB0 N. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscalculating the\
      \ latitude of Anderson, IN. Let me think again. Anderson is a city in Madison\
      \ County, Indiana. If I recall the map of Indiana, cities like South Bend are\
      \ in the north, near Lake Michigan, at around 41.7\xB0 N. Indianapolis is around\
      \ 39.8\xB0 N. So Anderson, being in the central part of the state, maybe around\
      \ 40\xB0 N? Let me confirm: Looking up (mentally) Anderson, IN coordinates.\
      \ Let's say, for example, Anderson is approximately 40.1\xB0 N. That's higher\
      \ than Oklahoma City's 35.5\xB0 N. Therefore, Anderson University would be located\
      \ north of OSU-OKC. Thus, the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if Anderson\
      \ University (Indiana) is south of Oklahoma State University\u2013Oklahoma City\
      \ (Oklahoma):  \n1. **Anderson, IN** is located at approximately **40.1\xB0\

      \ OK: Its latitude is about 35.4676\xB0 N. Oklahoma City is definitely more\
      \ south because Oklahoma is a southern state compared to Indiana. So 35.46\xB0\
      \ N is lower (more south) than 40.10\xB0 N. \n\nWait, wait, but the question\
      \ is if Anderson University is south of OSU-OKC. If Anderson is at 40.1\xB0\
      \ N and OSU-OKC is at 35.46\xB0 N, then Anderson is actually north of OSU-OKC.\
      \ Because lower latitude means more south. So 35 degrees is south of 40 degrees.\
      \ Therefore, OSU-OKC is south of Anderson, which would mean Anderson is north\
      \ of OSU-OKC. So the answer would be NO, Anderson University is not south of\
      \ Oklahoma State University\u2013Oklahoma City.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.\
      \ Maybe I got the latitudes reversed. Let me confirm. For example, Texas is\
      \ around 30-35\xB0 N, Oklahoma is around 35\xB0 N, and Indiana is around 40\xB0\
      \ N. So yes, Oklahoma City is around 35.5\xB0 N, Anderson, IN is 40.1\xB0 N.\
      \ So Anderson is north. Therefore, the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if\
      \ Anderson University (IN) is south of Oklahoma State University\u2013Oklahoma\

      \ a bit counterintuitive because Florida is generally much further south than\
      \ North Carolina. But I need to make sure by checking the exact locations.\n\
      \nFirst, I need to figure out where each university is located. Elizabeth City\
      \ State University (ECSU) is in Elizabeth City, NC. The other institution is\
      \ part of Florida A&M University and Florida State University's College of Engineering,\
      \ which I believe is located in Tallahassee, FL, since that's where both universities\

    11aa22e5-ca99-44ee-9f75-633d481355f7: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, I need to figure out if Elizabeth City University in North Carolina is\

      \ of both institutions. \n\nStarting with Elizabeth City State University (ECSU)\
      \ in North Carolina. I know that Elizabeth City is in the northeastern part\

      \ Yes, Elizabeth City is in NC's Pasquotank County, right along the Albemarle\
      \ Sound. The coordinates for ECSU are approximately 36.2973\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \nNow, the other institution is Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State\
      \ University College of Engineering. That's in Florida. Florida A&M is in Tallahassee,\
      \ which is the state capital. The College of Engineering is part of the FAMU-FSU\
      \ College of Engineering, located in Tallahassee as well. The latitude for Tallahassee\

      \ N, and Tallahassee is at 30.4\xB0 N. Since latitude measures how far north\
      \ a place is, a lower latitude means it's further south. So Tallahassee, FL\

      \ step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out where each of these universities\
      \ is located geographically. Let's start with Elizabeth City State University\
      \ (ECSU) in North Carolina. I know that Elizabeth City is a city in North Carolina.\
      \ From what I remember, North Carolina is in the southeastern part of the United\
      \ States, but it's one of the states that's more to the north compared to the\
      \ deep southern states like Georgia, Alabama, or Florida. Elizabeth City specifically,\
      \ I think, is in the northeastern part of North Carolina, near the coast. Maybe\
      \ close to the border with Virginia? Because Virginia is north of North Carolina,\
      \ so if ECSU is near the VA-NC border, its latitude would be higher (more north)\
      \ than areas further south in NC.\n\nNext, Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida\
      \ State University College of Engineering (FAMU-FSU CoE) is in Florida. The\
      \ College of Engineering is likely located in Tallahassee since both Florida\
      \ A&M and Florida State University are based there. Tallahassee is the capital\
      \ of Florida, situated in the northern part of the state, near the border with\
      \ Georgia. So, Tallahassee is in the Florida Panhandle area, which is the northwestern\
      \ part of Florida. \n\nNow, to compare their latitudes. If ECSU is in northeastern\
      \ NC near Virginia, its latitude would be around, say, 36.3 degrees north. Let\
      \ me check that... Wait, I might need approximate coordinates. Let me think.\
      \ Elizabeth City, NC: I recall that the city is at approximately 36.3\xB0N latitude.\
      \ Tallahassee, FL is at around 30.45\xB0N latitude. Wait, but that would mean\
      \ Tallahassee is actually south of Elizabeth City? Because the lower the latitude\
      \ number, the further south you are. Wait, no\u2014if 30 degrees is Florida,\
      \ that's correct. For example, Miami is around 25.7\xB0N, so Tallahassee is\
      \ in the northern part of Florida, but still at a lower latitude than North\
      \ Carolina. \n\nWait a second, North Carolina's southern border is at about\
      \ 33.8\xB0N (the border with South Carolina and Georgia), so the entire state\
      \ of North Carolina is north of 33.8\xB0N. Elizabeth City is in the northeast\
      \ part, so maybe around 36.3\xB0N as I thought. Tallahassee, in Florida, is\
      \ around 30.45\xB0N, which is significantly further south. So, Tallahassee is\
      \ actually south of many parts of the southern states, but compared to North\
      \ Carolina, which is further north, it's actually that Tallahassee is south\
      \ of Elizabeth City. Wait, because 30.45\xB0N is south of 36.3\xB0N. So, that\
      \ would mean that Florida's northern parts are south of North Carolina's southern\
      \ parts. Wait, but the question is whether ECSU (NC) is south of FAMU-FSU CoE\
      \ (FL). If ECSU is at around 36.3\xB0N and FAMU is at 30.45\xB0N, then ECSU\
      \ is north of FAMU. Therefore, the answer would be NO, ECSU is not south of\
      \ FAMU-FSU CoE.\n\nWait, but maybe I got the coordinates wrong. Let me try to\
      \ recall more accurately. Let's think of major cities. For example, Raleigh,\
      \ NC is at about 35.8\xB0N. Elizabeth City is northeast of Raleigh, so possibly\
      \ a bit lower in latitude? Or higher? Wait, moving east in North Carolina from\
      \ Raleigh towards the coast, the latitude might not decrease much. Let me think\u2014\
      Virginia Beach, VA is around 36.85\xB0N, and it's north of Elizabeth City. So\
      \ Elizabeth City is just south of the Virginia border. The Virginia-NC border\
      \ is at 36.55\xB0N approximately. So Elizabeth City would be just south of that,\
      \ maybe 36.3\xB0N. Tallahassee, FL is at 30.45\xB0N. So 36.3\xB0N is definitely\
      \ north of 30.45\xB0N. Therefore, ECSU is north of FAMU-FSU CoE, making the\
      \ answer NO.\n</think>To determine if Elizabeth City State University (ECSU)\

      \ FL is around 30.45\xB0 N. Elizabeth City, NC... I'm not exactly sure, but\
      \ since North Carolina is above South Carolina and Georgia, which are above\
      \ Florida, but Elizabeth City is in the northeastern part of NC. Let me think,\
      \ maybe around 36\xB0 N? Because Raleigh, the capital of NC, is about 35.8\xB0\
      \ N. Elizabeth City is further east and north, maybe 36.3\xB0 N or so. \n\n\
      If that's the case, then Elizabeth City, NC (36.3\xB0 N) is north of Tallahassee,\

    94465989-d86b-493e-b474-4a1d61a3f433: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking whether Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina\
      \ is located south of Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State University\
      \ College of Engineering in Florida. Hmm, at first glance, that seems a bit\
      \ counterintuitive because Florida is generally further south than North Carolina.\
      \ But maybe there's a twist here. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to figure out the locations of both institutions. Let's start with\
      \ Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) in North Carolina. I know that Elizabeth\
      \ City is in the northeastern part of North Carolina, near the coast. It's close\
      \ to the Virginia border. I remember that North Carolina is south of Virginia\
      \ but north of South Carolina. So ECSU is in the northern part of NC.\n\nNow,\
      \ the other institution is the Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State University\
      \ College of Engineering. That's a bit of a mouthful. I think this college is\
      \ part of both Florida A&M and Florida State University, which are both located\
      \ in Tallahassee, Florida. Tallahassee is the capital of Florida and is in the\
      \ northern part of the state, near the Georgia border. So Tallahassee is in\
      \ the panhandle region of Florida, which is the northwestern part of the state.\n\
      \nNext, I need to compare the latitudes of Elizabeth City, NC, and Tallahassee,\
      \ FL. Latitude determines how far north or south a place is. The higher the\
      \ latitude, the further north it is. So if ECSU has a lower latitude than the\
      \ College of Engineering in Tallahassee, then it would be further south. But\
      \ given that Florida is generally south of North Carolina, I would expect Tallahassee\
      \ to be further south than Elizabeth City. However, since Tallahassee is in\
      \ the northern part of Florida, maybe there's a chance that Elizabeth City is\
      \ actually further south.\n\nLet me check approximate latitudes. Elizabeth City,\
      \ NC, has a latitude of around 36.3\xB0 N. Tallahassee, FL, is at approximately\
      \ 30.45\xB0 N. Wait, that can't be right. If Tallahassee is at 30.45\xB0 N,\
      \ that's actually further south than Elizabeth City's 36.3\xB0 N. Because latitude\
      \ increases as you go north. So 30\xB0 N is south of 36\xB0 N. Therefore, Tallahassee\
      \ is south of Elizabeth City. That would mean that ECSU in NC is north of the\
      \ College of Engineering in FL. Therefore, the answer would be NO, ECSU is not\
      \ south of the Florida institution.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the exact locations.\
      \ Maybe I mixed up the cities. Let me double-check. Elizabeth City, NC: yes,\
      \ it's in the northeastern part, near the coast. Latitude around 36.3\xB0 N.\
      \ Tallahassee, FL: yes, in the panhandle, latitude about 30.45\xB0 N. So 30.45\
      \ is definitely south of 36.3. So Tallahassee is further south. Therefore, ECSU\
      \ is north of the Florida college. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate Elizabeth City State University (ECSU):** Situated\
      \ in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which is in the northeastern part of the\
      \ state near the Virginia border. Its approximate latitude is **36.3\xB0 N**.\
      \  \n2. **Locate Florida A&M \u2013 Florida State College of Engineering:**\
      \ Part of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. Tallahassee is in\
      \ northern Florida (panhandle region) with a latitude of **30.45\xB0 N**.  \n\
      3. **Compare Latitudes:** Since 30.45\xB0 N (Tallahassee) is **south** of 36.3\xB0\
      \ N (Elizabeth City), ECSU in North Carolina is **north** of the Florida institution.\

      \ US, but I need to check their exact locations.\n\nFirst, I should figure out\
      \ where each university is. Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) is in North\

      \ Elizabeth City, NC has a latitude of about 36.3\xB0 N. Tallahassee, FL is\
