      of Capital University in Ohio and Claflin University in South Carolina to answer
      whether Capital University is south of Claflin University.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Capital University is in Ohio (OH), which is in the Midwest/Northern part
      of the United States.

      - Claflin University is in South Carolina (SC), which is in the Southeastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Ohio and South Carolina.

      - Ohio is generally located north of South Carolina.

      - South Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean in the southeastern part of the
      country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Ohio is significantly further north than South Carolina.

      - Since Capital University is in Ohio, and Claflin University is in South Carolina,
      Capital University must be north of Claflin University, not south.


      NO, Capital University in Ohio is not located south of Claflin University in
      South Carolina. It is located north of it.'

      University, WA is located south of Brown College, MN, I need to consider the
      geographical positions of both institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Central Washington University is located in Ellensburg, Washington state,
      which is in the northwestern United States.

      - Brown College is located in Minnesota, which is in the upper Midwest of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Washington state is on the west coast, bordering Canada, but extends further
      south than Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is in the northern part of the country, bordering Canada as well.

      - Generally, Washington state is at a similar latitude to Minnesota, with parts
      of Washington extending both further north and further south than Minnesota.


      Step 3: Be more specific about these institutions.

      - Central Washington University is in central Washington state.

      - Minnesota is entirely north of the southern parts of Washington state.

      - Any location in Minnesota (including Brown College) would be north of central
      Washington.


      Therefore, Central Washington University would be south of Brown College, Minnesota.


      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check this. Looking more carefully:

      - Minnesota is positioned entirely north of the central part of Washington state.

      - Central Washington University in Ellensburg, WA would be south of any location
      in Minnesota.

      of Washburn University in Kansas and Grayson College in Texas to answer this
      question.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Washburn University is located in Topeka, Kansas

      - Grayson College is located in Denison, Texas


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Kansas and Texas.

      - Kansas is a state that lies north of Texas in the United States

      - Texas is south of Kansas


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Topeka is in northeastern Kansas

      - Denison, Texas is in north Texas, near the Oklahoma border


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Since Kansas is entirely north of Texas, and Washburn is in Kansas while Grayson
      is in Texas, Washburn University must be north of Grayson College.

      - Therefore, Washburn University is NOT south of Grayson College.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Selma University is located in Selma, Alabama (AL)

      - I need to check about "Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX"


      Step 2: Verify the second university.

      Texas Tech University''s main campus is in Lubbock, TX. However, "Texas Tech
      University at Fredericksburg, TX" doesn''t appear to be an actual campus of
      Texas Tech University. Fredericksburg is a city in Texas, but Texas Tech doesn''t
      have a campus there. This appears to be a fictional or incorrectly named institution.


      Step 3: Since one of the universities in the question doesn''t exist as stated,
      I can''t make a geographical comparison between their locations.


      NO - I cannot confirm that Selma University is south of Texas Tech University

      - Selma University is located in Selma, Alabama (AL)

      - I need to check if "Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX" exists


      Step 2: Checking Texas Tech University locations.

      Texas Tech University''s main campus is in Lubbock, TX. Texas Tech does have
      some satellite campuses, but I don''t believe they have a campus specifically
      in Fredericksburg, TX. There is a Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, Germany
      (a study abroad program), but not in Fredericksburg, Texas.


      Step 3: Since one of the universities in the question appears to be incorrectly

      Fredericksburg, TX does exist - it''s a city in central Texas, but it doesn''t
      have a Texas Tech campus.


      Step 4: Compare the geographic locations.

      - Selma, Alabama is in the southern United States

      - Fredericksburg, Texas is in central Texas


      Step 5: Determine relative positions. Alabama is east of Texas, not south of
      Texas. On a map of the US, Alabama is to the east and slightly north of central
      Texas.


      NO - Selma University in Alabama is not south of Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg,
      TX. It is east of Fredericksburg, Texas (and there isn''t actually a Texas Tech
      campus in Fredericksburg, TX).'
