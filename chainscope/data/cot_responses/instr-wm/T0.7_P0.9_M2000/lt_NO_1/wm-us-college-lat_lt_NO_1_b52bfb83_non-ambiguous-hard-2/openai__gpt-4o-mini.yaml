      1. **Location of Eastern University**: Eastern University is located in St.
      Davids, Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      2. **Location of Texas Tech University**: Texas Tech University is located in
      Lubbock, Texas, which is in the northwestern part of Texas.


      3. **Geographical Relationship**: Pennsylvania is situated to the northeast
      of Texas. Therefore, when comparing the latitude of both universities, Eastern
      University is further north than Texas Tech University.


      Based on this reasoning, Eastern University is not located south of Texas Tech
      University.


      The answer is: **NO**.'
