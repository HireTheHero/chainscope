      More University in Kentucky, and then compare their relative positions.


      1. **Identify the location of Benedictine University, IL**: Benedictine University
      is located in Lisle, Illinois. Lisle is a suburb of Chicago, situated in the
      northeastern part of the state.


      2. **Identify the location of Thomas More University, KY**: Thomas More University
      is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky. Crestview Hills is a suburb of Cincinnati,
      Ohio, and is situated in the northern part of Kentucky.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Since Illinois is generally north of Kentucky,
      we need to compare the specific locations of Lisle, IL, and Crestview Hills,
      KY. Lisle, being a suburb of Chicago, is located at a higher latitude than Crestview
      Hills, which is near Cincinnati.


      By comparing the two, we find that Lisle, IL (Benedictine University) is north
      of Crestview Hills, KY (Thomas More University).
