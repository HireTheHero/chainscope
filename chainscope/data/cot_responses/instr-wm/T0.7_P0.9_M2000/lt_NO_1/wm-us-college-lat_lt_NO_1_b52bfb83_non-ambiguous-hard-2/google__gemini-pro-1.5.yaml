      2. **IDSVA''s Location:**  IDSVA is in Portland, Maine.


      3. **Cal Poly Humboldt''s Location:** Cal Poly Humboldt is in Arcata, California.


      4. **Maine vs. California:** Maine is on the East Coast of the United States,
      while California is on the West Coast.


      5. **North/South Relationship:**  Being on the East Coast, Maine (and therefore
      IDSVA) is *not* south of California (and therefore not south of Cal Poly Humboldt).  In
      fact, it''s far to the northeast.

      (IDSVA) and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (Cal Poly Humboldt).

      2. **IDSVA Location:** IDSVA is in Portland, Maine (ME).

      3. **Cal Poly Humboldt Location:** Cal Poly Humboldt is in Arcata, California
      (CA).

      4. **Maine vs. California:** Maine is on the East Coast of the United States,
      while California is on the West Coast.

      5. **North/South Relationship:**  Since Maine is east of California, the concept
      of north/south relative to each other becomes essentially about latitude.

      6. **Latitude Comparison:** Maine is at a higher latitude (further north) than
      California.


      Therefore, IDSVA in Maine is *not* south of Cal Poly Humboldt in California.


      NO

      in the Visual Arts (IDSVA) and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt
      (Cal Poly Humboldt).


      2. **IDSVA''s location:**  A quick search shows IDSVA has a main location in
      Portland, Maine (ME).


      3. **Cal Poly Humboldt''s location:** Cal Poly Humboldt is in Arcata, California
      (CA).


      4. **Maine vs. California:** Maine is on the East Coast of the United States,
      while California is on the West Coast.


      5. **North/South relationship:**  Since Maine is east of California, the concept
      of "south" doesn''t directly apply in the typical sense.  However, Maine is
      at a lower latitude than northern California.


      6. **Interpreting the question:** The question likely intends to ask if IDSVA
      is at a lower latitude than Cal Poly Humboldt.


      7. **Conclusion:** Maine is at a lower latitude than California.


      Answer: YES
