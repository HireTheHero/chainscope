      know, we can''t answer the question. So, let''s take a look at the context and
      see if we can find out more information.

      The context provides some information about Ball State University and University

      This is helpful, but it doesn''t tell us if Ball State University is located

      more research.

      One way to find out if Ball State University is located south of University
      of Virginia Center for Politics is to look at a map. We can use Google Maps
      or Bing Maps to find out if Ball State University is located south of University
      of Virginia Center for Politics. If we can''t find a map, we can ask someone
      who knows where Ball State University is located.

      If we can''t find a map, we can also use other resources to find out if Ball
      State University is located south of University of Virginia Center for Politics.
      We can use the internet to search for information about Ball State University
      and University of Virginia Center for Politics. We can also use books or other
      printed resources to find out if Ball State University is located south of University
      of Virginia Center for Politics.

      So, to answer the question, we need to do some research. We need to find out
      where Ball State University is located, and we need to find out where University

      This is because the location of the school is not specifically mentioned, and
      there is no information about its location in relation to other geographical
      features.
