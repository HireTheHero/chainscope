    a900a9e9-fb64-4c7b-b21d-ef6ea9e1adad: 'Step 1: Identify the locations of the two
      universities.

      Winston-Salem State University, NC is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

      California State University San Marcos, CA is in San Marcos, California.


      Step 2: Determine the general geographical relationship between North Carolina
      and California.

      North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States.

      California is on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the latitudinal relationship between the two states.

      North Carolina is generally at a higher latitude (further north) than Southern
      California.


      Step 4: While specific latitudes of the universities are needed for a precise
      answer, the general location of North Carolina relative to Southern California
      indicates that North Carolina is further north.


      Step 5: Therefore, Winston-Salem State University, NC is located north of California
      State University San Marcos, CA.


      Step 6: The question asks if Winston-Salem State University is located *south*
      of California State University San Marcos. Based on the previous steps, this
      is incorrect.


      NO'

      State University is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (NC). California State
      University San Marcos is in San Marcos, California (CA).

      2.  **Determine the general relative locations of the states:** North Carolina
      is on the East Coast of the United States. California is on the West Coast of
      the United States.

      3.  **Consider latitude (north/south position):** North Carolina is generally
      located further north than Southern California, where San Marcos is located.
      While both states span a range of latitudes, the *entire state* of North Carolina
      is at a higher latitude (further north) than the latitude of San Marcos, CA.

      4.  **Compare the specific locations based on latitude:** Winston-Salem, NC
      is at approximately 36.1 degrees North latitude. San Marcos, CA is at approximately
      33.1 degrees North latitude.

      5.  **Conclusion based on latitude:** Since 36.1 is greater than 33.1, Winston-Salem
      is located further north than San Marcos.

      6.  **Rephrase the question:** Is Winston-Salem State University located south
      of California State University San Marcos? This is the same as asking if Winston-Salem
      is south of San Marcos.

      7.  **Final Answer:** Based on the latitude comparison, Winston-Salem is north
      of San Marcos. Therefore, it is *not* south of San Marcos.

      Mesa University, CO.**

      Colorado Mesa University is located in Grand Junction, Colorado.


      **Step 2: Determine the location of Antioch University Santa Barbara, CA.**

      Antioch University Santa Barbara is located in Santa Barbara, California.


      **Step 3: Consider the general geographical relationship between Colorado and
      California.**

      Colorado is located to the east of California.


      **Step 4: Consider the general latitude of Grand Junction, CO and Santa Barbara,
      CA.**

      While a precise latitude isn''t strictly necessary, knowing the states'' relative
      positions helps. Grand Junction, CO is in western Colorado. Santa Barbara, CA
      is on the coast of southern California.


      **Step 5: Compare the latitudes more specifically.**

      Grand Junction, CO is located at approximately 39.08 degrees North latitude.
      Santa Barbara, CA is located at approximately 34.42 degrees North latitude.


      **Step 6: Determine if Colorado Mesa University is south of Antioch University
      Santa Barbara based on latitude.**

      A lower latitude means a location is further south. Since Santa Barbara''s latitude
      (34.42) is lower than Grand Junction''s latitude (39.08), Antioch University
      Santa Barbara is located south of Colorado Mesa University.


      **Step 7: Rephrase the question in terms of our finding.** The question asks
      if Colorado Mesa University is *south* of Antioch University Santa Barbara.
      Our finding is that Antioch University Santa Barbara is *south* of Colorado
      Mesa University. These are opposite statements.


      **Step 8: Formulate the final answer based on the comparison.** Since Santa
      Barbara is south of Grand Junction, Grand Junction is north of Santa Barbara.
      Therefore, Colorado Mesa University is *not* south of Antioch University Santa

      Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff. Let''s consider Phoenix as a representative central
      AZ location.

      3.  Determine the relative latitude of Fresno, CA. Fresno is in central California.

      4.  Determine the relative latitude of Phoenix, AZ. Phoenix is in central Arizona.

      5.  Compare the latitudes. Fresno, CA is roughly around 36.7 degrees North latitude.
      Phoenix, AZ is roughly around 33.4 degrees North latitude.

      6.  A location with a higher North latitude is *north* of a location with a
      lower North latitude.

      7.  Since 36.7 is greater than 33.4, Fresno is north of Phoenix.

      8.  Therefore, California State University, Fresno is *not* located south of
      a location in central Arizona like Phoenix.


      Alternatively, let''s consider Tucson, AZ (further south in AZ, around 32.2
      degrees North). 36.7 is still greater than 32.2, so Fresno is still north of
      Tucson.


      Let''s even consider the southernmost tip of Arizona, near Nogales, which is
      around 31.3 degrees North. 36.7 is still greater than 31.3, so Fresno is still
      north of even the southernmost point in Arizona.


      Conclusion: Fresno, CA is geographically north of any location in Arizona.


      Therefore, it is not located south of Northcentral University, AZ (regardless
      of where exactly in AZ we consider it to be).


      The question asks if Fresno is *south* of Northcentral University, AZ. Based
      on the latitude comparison, Fresno is *north* of Northcentral University, AZ.


      The answer is the opposite of what the question asks.


      The question is "Is California State University, Fresno, CA located south of
      Northcentral University, AZ?".

      The conclusion is that Cal State Fresno is north of Northcentral University,
      AZ.

      So, the answer to the question is NO.

      2. **Determine the general latitude of each state:** Iowa is in the Midwest,
      generally considered a more northerly state in the US. California is on the
      West Coast, and Rocklin is in Northern California, which is still significantly
      south of the latitude of Iowa.


      3. **Consider the relative positions on a map:** Looking at a map of the United
      States, Iowa is clearly positioned to the north and east of California.


      4. **Compare the latitudes:** While precise latitudes aren''t needed for a general
      YES/NO answer, it''s evident that a location in Iowa will be at a higher (more
      northerly) latitude than a location in Northern California.


      5. **Formulate the comparison:** If University of Northern Iowa is at a more
      northerly latitude than William Jessup University, then William Jessup University
      is located south of University of Northern Iowa.


      6. **Answer the question asked:** The question asks if University of Northern

      \ in Texas and the University of New Orleans in Louisiana. Specifically, is\
      \ Wayland Baptist *south* of the University of New Orleans?\n\n2.  **Identify\
      \ the locations:**\n    *   Wayland Baptist University: Plainview, Texas.\n\
      \    *   University of New Orleans: New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n3.  **Determine\

      \ Approximately 34.18\xB0 N latitude.\n    *   New Orleans, LA: Approximately\
      \ 29.95\xB0 N latitude.\n\n6.  **Analyze the comparison:** New Orleans has a\
      \ *lower* latitude (29.95\xB0) than Plainview (34.18\xB0). This means New Orleans\
      \ is further south than Plainview.\n\n7.  **Re-read the question:** \"Is Wayland\

    bd66f5fe-78e0-4029-8d6f-b7f936bc1201: "Here's the thought process to answer the\
      \ question:\n\n1.  **Identify the two locations:**\n    *   Elizabeth City State\
      \ University (ECSU)\n    *   Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State University\
      \ College of Engineering (FAMU-FSU College of Engineering)\n\n2.  **Determine\
      \ the state of each location:**\n    *   ECSU is in North Carolina (NC).\n \
      \   *   FAMU-FSU College of Engineering is in Florida (FL).\n\n3.  **Consider\
      \ the geographical relationship between the states:**\n    *   North Carolina\
      \ is located geographically *north* of Florida.\n\n4.  **Relate the locations\
      \ within their states:**\n    *   ECSU is located in North Carolina.\n    *\
      \   The FAMU-FSU College of Engineering is located in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\
      \n5.  **Compare the relative positions:** Since *all* of North Carolina is north\
      \ of *all* of Florida, any location within North Carolina will be north of any\
      \ location within Florida.\n\n6.  **Formulate the answer to the specific question:**\
      \ The question asks if ECSU (NC) is *south* of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering\
      \ (FL). Based on the geographical relationship between the states, this is the\
      \ opposite of the reality. ECSU is north of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering.\n\
      \n7.  **Determine the final YES or NO:** The statement \"Elizabeth City State\
      \ University, NC is located south of Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State\
      \ University College of Engineering, FL\" is false. Therefore, the answer is\
      \ NO.\n\n**Final Answer is NO.**"
