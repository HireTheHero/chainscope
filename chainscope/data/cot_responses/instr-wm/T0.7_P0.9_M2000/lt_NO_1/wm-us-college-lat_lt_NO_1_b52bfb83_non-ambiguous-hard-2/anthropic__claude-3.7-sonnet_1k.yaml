      To answer this, I need to know the approximate locations of both universities
      within their states, and then determine their relative positions north/south.


      Capital University is in Ohio (OH), which is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      United States.


      Claflin University is in South Carolina (SC), which is in the southeastern United

      Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is in Savannah, GA, which is on

      Savannah, GA is in the far eastern part of Georgia, near the border with South
      Carolina. In fact, Savannah is very close to the South Carolina border.


      Greenville, SC is in the northwestern part of South Carolina, far from the Georgia
      border.


      Given these locations, Furman University (in Greenville, SC) would be north

      University of Northern Colorado is in Greeley, Colorado, which is in the northern

      Tennessee is in the southeastern part of the US, and is positioned below Colorado

      to determine the locations of two colleges and compare them:

      1. Michigan Technological University in Michigan (MI)

      2. Mount Mary College in Wisconsin (WI)


      First, I need to recall where these institutions are located within their respective
      states.


      Michigan Technological University is located in Houghton, Michigan, which is
      in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The Upper Peninsula is the northern part
      of Michigan that connects to Wisconsin.


      Mount Mary College (now Mount Mary University) is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
      which is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin.


      Now I need to compare the north-south positioning:

      - Michigan''s Upper Peninsula is north of most of Wisconsin

      - Milwaukee is in the southern part of Wisconsin

      - Houghton, MI (where Michigan Tech is) is in the northern part of Michigan''s
      Upper Peninsula


      So Michigan Technological University in Houghton, MI would be north of Mount
      Mary College in Milwaukee, WI.


      Therefore, Michigan Technological University is NOT south of Mount Mary College.
      It''s north of it.</think># Is Michigan Technological University, MI located
      south of Mount Mary College, WI?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Locate Michigan Technological University

      Michigan Technological University is located in Houghton, Michigan, in the Upper
      Peninsula of Michigan. The Upper Peninsula is the northernmost part of Michigan
      that borders Wisconsin.


      ## Step 2: Locate Mount Mary College

      Mount Mary College (now Mount Mary University) is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
      which is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin.


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      The Upper Peninsula of Michigan extends north of Wisconsin. Houghton is located
      in the northern part of the Upper Peninsula, while Milwaukee is in the southern
      part of Wisconsin. On a north-south axis, Michigan Tech is significantly further
      north than Mount Mary College.


      NO - Michigan Technological University is NOT located south of Mount Mary College.
      It is located north of it.'

      of Hartford in Connecticut is located south of Arkansas State University-Newport
      in Arkansas.


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographic locations of Connecticut
      and Arkansas in the United States.


      Connecticut (CT) is located in the northeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.

      Arkansas (AR) is located in the southern central United States.


      In the United States, states that are more northern have higher latitudes, while
      states that are more southern have lower latitudes.


      Connecticut is much further north than Arkansas. Therefore, University of Hartford
      in CT would be north of Arkansas State University-Newport in AR, not south of
      it.


      So the answer is NO, University of Hartford is not located south of Arkansas
      State University-Newport. It''s located north of it.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to compare the geographic locations of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      United States.

      - Arkansas State University-Newport is in Newport, Arkansas (AR), which is in
      the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Compare their north-south positions (latitudes).

      - Connecticut is located in the Northeast region of the US.

      - Arkansas is located much further south in the country.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      Since Connecticut is substantially north of Arkansas on a map of the United
      States, the University of Hartford would be north of (not south of) Arkansas
      State University-Newport.

      US.


      Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region, specifically in what''s sometimes

      First, I need to determine the approximate latitude of each location:


      Husson University is located in Bangor, Maine, which is in the northeastern

      - Maine is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering Canada.

      - Ohio is located in the Great Lakes region, significantly south of Maine.


      Step 3: Specifically locating the cities:

      - Husson University is in Bangor, Maine, in the central part of the state.

      - Franciscan University is in Steubenville, Ohio, in the eastern part of that
      state.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Maine''s latitude is higher (further north) than Ohio''s latitude.

      Oklahoma City University is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

      Tarleton State University is located in Stephenville, Texas.


      In the United States, generally speaking:

      - Lower latitudes are more southern

      - Texas is south of Oklahoma


      However, I need to be careful because specific locations within states can vary.
      Just because Oklahoma is generally north of Texas doesn''t automatically mean
      that Oklahoma City University is north of Tarleton State University.


      Let me think about where these cities are located:

      - Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma

      - Stephenville, Texas is in north-central Texas


      Looking at the relative positions on a mental map:

      - Oklahoma City is approximately at the center of Oklahoma, near the southern
      border of the state

      - Stephenville is in north-central Texas, not too far from the Oklahoma border


      Given that Oklahoma is directly north of Texas, and Oklahoma City is in central
      Oklahoma while Stephenville is in north-central Texas, it seems very likely
      that Oklahoma City University would be north of Tarleton State University, not
      south.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO.</think># Is Oklahoma City University, OK
      located south of Tarleton State University, TX?


      To solve this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Oklahoma City University is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

      - Tarleton State University is located in Stephenville, Texas


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Oklahoma and Texas

      - Oklahoma is generally located directly north of Texas

      - Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma

      - Stephenville (where Tarleton State is located) is in north-central Texas


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      Even though Stephenville is in the northern part of Texas, it''s still in Texas,
      which is south of Oklahoma. Oklahoma City, being in Oklahoma, is therefore north
      of Stephenville.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Oklahoma City University is NOT located south of Tarleton State University.
      It is located north of it.'

      - Oklahoma is generally north of Texas on a map

      - Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma

      - Stephenville is in north-central Texas

      - Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas, and Oklahoma City is in central
      Oklahoma, it must be north of Stephenville, which is in north-central Texas.

      - Therefore, Oklahoma City University is not south of Tarleton State University,

      (MS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Tennessee is located directly north of Mississippi. On a US map, Tennessee sits
      entirely above Mississippi.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Bethel University is in Tennessee, and the University of Mississippi Medical

      if Bethel University in Tennessee is located south of the University of Mississippi

      To answer this, I need to determine the locations of both institutions and compare
      their latitudes. If Bethel University, TN has a smaller latitude (further south)
      than University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry, MS, then
      the answer is YES. Otherwise, it''s NO.


      Let me reason through this:


      1. Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN). Tennessee is generally north of Mississippi.


      2. University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is in Mississippi
      (MS). Mississippi is generally south of Tennessee.


      3. Based on general geographic knowledge, Tennessee is north of Mississippi
      on the map of the United States.


      4. Therefore, Bethel University in TN is likely north of any institution in
      Mississippi, including the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of
      Dentistry.


      So, Bethel University, TN is likely NOT south of University of Mississippi Medical
      Center School of Dentistry, MS.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the locations of both institutions and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Locate Bethel University in Tennessee.

      - Bethel University is located in McKenzie, Tennessee, which is in the northwest
      part of Tennessee.


      Step 2: Locate the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry.

      - This institution is located in Jackson, Mississippi, which is in the central
      part of Mississippi.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Tennessee is generally positioned north of Mississippi on the U.S. map.

      - McKenzie, TN (where Bethel University is located) is in northwestern Tennessee.

      - Jackson, MS (where UMMC School of Dentistry is located) is in central Mississippi.

      - Since Tennessee is north of Mississippi, Bethel University would be north
      of (not south of) the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry.


      NO'

      their latitudes.


      1. Bethel University is located in McKenzie, Tennessee.

      2. University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is located in
      Jackson, Mississippi.


      Now I need to determine which is further south. In the United States, Tennessee
      is generally north of Mississippi. Tennessee borders Mississippi to the north.


      So geographically speaking, institutions in Tennessee would typically be north
      of institutions in Mississippi. This means that Bethel University in Tennessee
      would likely be north of the University of Mississippi Medical Center School
      of Dentistry in Mississippi.


      If something is north of something else, it''s not south of it.

      - Tennessee is generally positioned north of Mississippi

      - Mississippi borders Tennessee on Mississippi''s northern boundary


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Tennessee is north of Mississippi, educational institutions in Tennessee
      would generally be north of those in Mississippi

      - McKenzie, TN (where Bethel is located) is in the northern part of Tennessee,
      while Jackson, MS is in the central part of Mississippi, reinforcing this north-south

      Since Tennessee is entirely north of Mississippi, and Bethel University is in
      Tennessee while the University of Mississippi Medical Center is in central Mississippi,
      Bethel University must be north of (not south of) the University of Mississippi
      Medical Center School of Dentistry.

      are south of most locations in Tennessee.


      Even though Bethel is in northwestern Tennessee, and the UMMC School of Dentistry
      is in central Mississippi, Mississippi''s northern border is still south of
      northwestern Tennessee. Jackson, MS would definitely be further south than McKenzie,

      the country in terms of latitude.

      2. Georgia is a southeastern state, positioned much further south than Colorado.

      3. In terms of north-south positioning (latitude), Colorado is north of Georgia.

      1) Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania,
      in the western part of Pennsylvania state.


      2) University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) is located in Wilmington,
      North Carolina, near the Atlantic coast.


      3) Pennsylvania is a northern state that borders New York, Ohio, West Virginia,
      Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey.


      4) North Carolina is a southern state that lies significantly south of Pennsylvania.


      5) Even the southernmost points of Pennsylvania are still north of North Carolina.


      6) Since IUP is in Pennsylvania and UNCW is in North Carolina, IUP must be north
      of UNCW.


      Therefore, Indiana University of Pennsylvania is NOT located south of University

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Indiana, Pennsylvania (despite the
      potentially confusing name).

      - University of North Carolina Wilmington is in Wilmington, North Carolina.


      Step 2: Compare the states geographically.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, located in the Mid-Atlantic region.

      - North Carolina is a southern state, considerably south of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Consider their specific positions within those states.

      - Indiana, PA is in western Pennsylvania.

      - Wilmington, NC is on the southeastern coast of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Even the southernmost points of Pennsylvania are generally north of the northernmost
      points of North Carolina.

      - Wilmington''s position on NC''s coast places it well into the southern portion
      of the state.


      NO - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located NORTH of University of North

      1. Cincinnati Christian University (CCU) is in Cincinnati, Ohio, which is in

      Looking at the geographic positions of these states:

      - North Dakota is a northern border state, located near the Canadian border

      - North Dakota is north of South Dakota, which is north of Nebraska, which is
      north of Kansas/Missouri, which is north of Iowa.

      - Actually, Iowa is directly south of Minnesota, which is south of North Dakota.


      So Iowa is south of North Dakota. Since University of Mary is in North Dakota
      and Mount Mercy University is in Iowa, University of Mary is north of Mount
      Mercy University.

      North Carolina is generally north of Georgia in the United States. North Carolina

      - North Carolina (NC) is generally north of Georgia (GA) on a map of the United

      - Georgia is south of North Carolina


      Based just on the states, St. Andrews University in NC would be NORTH of Columbus
      Technical College in GA, not south.


      To be more precise, I should consider the specific locations within these states:

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southern part
      of North Carolina

      - Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, GA, which is in the western central
      part of Georgia near the Alabama border


      Even though St. Andrews is in southern NC, Georgia is still south of North Carolina
      geographically. The border between NC and GA doesn''t overlap directly (SC is

      So St. Andrews University in NC would be north of Columbus Technical College
      in GA, not south.</think>To determine if St. Andrews University in North Carolina
      is located south of Columbus Technical College in Georgia, I need to compare
      their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      North Carolina is located north of Georgia on the US map.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, in the southern part of North Carolina.

      Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, GA, in the west-central part of Georgia.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Even though St. Andrews is in southern North Carolina, Georgia as a state is
      still entirely south of North Carolina. The two states don''t directly border
      each other (South Carolina lies between them), but the north-south relationship
      is clear.


      NO, St. Andrews University in NC is not located south of Columbus Technical
      College in GA. It is located north of it.'
    c5021260-7217-4ba2-9858-3b0f932bc286: '<think>Let me reason about the locations
      of these two colleges step by step:


      1. St. Andrews University is located in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Columbus Technical College is located in Georgia (GA)


      To determine which is further south, I need to know the relative geographical
      positions of these states and cities.


      Generally:

      - North Carolina is north of Georgia (GA is south of NC)

      - This suggests that a college in Georgia would likely be south of one in North
      Carolina


      However, I should be careful because locations within states can vary - a location
      in southern NC could potentially be south of a location in northern GA.


      Let me think about specific cities:

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southern part
      of North Carolina

      - Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, GA, which is in west-central Georgia
      near the Alabama border


      Georgia is definitely south of North Carolina, and Columbus is not in the extreme
      northern part of Georgia. Given Georgia''s southern position relative to North
      Carolina, Columbus Technical College would be south of St. Andrews University.


      So the answer would be NO - St. Andrews University is NOT south of Columbus
      Technical College. Rather, Columbus Technical College is south of St. Andrews
      University.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of
      these two colleges by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Columbus Technical College is in Georgia (GA)

      - Georgia is located south of North Carolina on the US map


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, in the southern portion of North
      Carolina

      - Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, GA, which is in the west-central
      region of Georgia


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Even though St. Andrews is in southern North Carolina, the entirety of Georgia
      is still further south than most of North Carolina

      - Columbus, GA has a latitude that is definitely south of Laurinburg, NC


      NO - St. Andrews University in NC is NOT located south of Columbus Technical
      College in GA. It''s the opposite: Columbus Technical College is south of St.
      Andrews University.'

      to determine the geographical locations of St. Andrews University in North Carolina
      and Columbus Technical College in Georgia, and then compare their north-south
      positions.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      1. St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Columbus Technical College is in Georgia (GA)


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of these states. In the United
      States:

      - North Carolina is located on the East Coast

      - Georgia is also on the East Coast, but is south of North Carolina


      Generally speaking, Georgia is south of North Carolina. So a college in North
      Carolina would typically be north of a college in Georgia.


      However, I should be careful because the specific locations within each state
      matter. A college in southern North Carolina could potentially be south of a
      college in northern Georgia.


      Let me think more specifically:

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southern part
      of North Carolina, not far from the South Carolina border

      - Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, GA, which is in the western part
      of Georgia near the Alabama border, but not in the northernmost part of Georgia


      Given that Georgia is entirely south of North Carolina, even a location in southern
      NC would be north of a location in GA. Therefore, St. Andrews University in
      NC would be north of Columbus Technical College in GA, not south of it.</think>I
      need to determine if St. Andrews University in North Carolina is located south
      of Columbus Technical College in Georgia.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each college is located.

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Columbus Technical College is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      North Carolina and Georgia are both on the East Coast of the United States.
      Georgia is positioned entirely south of North Carolina on a map.


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within the states.

      Even though St. Andrews University is in the southern part of North Carolina
      (in Laurinburg), Georgia''s northern border is still south of North Carolina''s
      southern border.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      Since Georgia is entirely south of North Carolina geographically, any location
      in North Carolina (including St. Andrews University) must be north of any location
      in Georgia (including Columbus Technical College).

      - Our Lady of the Lake University is in Texas (likely San Antonio, TX)


      Step 2: To determine which is further south, I need to compare the latitudes

      - Monticello, AR is located in southern Arkansas

      - San Antonio, TX (where I believe Our Lady of the Lake University is located)
      is in southern Texas


      Step 3: Generally speaking, most of Texas is south of Arkansas. Arkansas is
      directly north of Louisiana, while Texas extends from the southern border with
      Louisiana and extends further south.


      Let me think about the specific locations. San Antonio is in south-central Texas,

      Looking at the general geography, San Antonio is considerably further south

      to determine the locations of Granite State College in New Hampshire (NH) and
      Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania (PA), then compare their locations to
      see which one is more southern.


      Let me think about the geographical locations:


      1. Granite State College is in New Hampshire (NH), which is in the northeastern
      United States.

      2. Bloomsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is also in the northeastern
      United States, but generally south of New Hampshire.


      Looking at the geography of the northeastern United States:

      - New Hampshire borders Massachusetts to the south, Maine to the east, Vermont
      to the west, and Canada to the north.

      - Pennsylvania is south of New York and west of New Jersey.

      - Generally, New Hampshire is north of Pennsylvania.


      So in terms of the states, New Hampshire is north of Pennsylvania. This would
      suggest that Granite State College is north of Bloomsburg University.


      But I should consider the specific locations of these institutions within their
      states, as a college in southern NH could potentially be south of a university
      in northern PA.


      However, PA is generally south of NH as a whole. Even the northern parts of
      PA are likely to be at similar latitude or south of the southern parts of NH.

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Granite State College is located in New Hampshire (NH), which is in the northeastern
      United States.


      2) Bloomsburg University is located in Pennsylvania (PA), which is also in the
      northeastern United States.


      3) Geographically, New Hampshire is positioned north of Pennsylvania. New Hampshire
      borders Massachusetts to the south, while Pennsylvania is south of New York.


      4) Even considering possible variations in location within each state, New Hampshire''s
      southernmost points are generally north of Pennsylvania''s northern border.


      5) Therefore, Granite State College in New Hampshire would be north of Bloomsburg
      University in Pennsylvania, not south of it.

      Let me think about the locations geographically:


      1. Granite State College is in New Hampshire (NH), which is in the northeastern
      United States.

      2. Bloomsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is also in the northeastern
      United States.


      To determine which is more south, I need to compare their latitudes. In the
      northern hemisphere, lower latitude means further south.


      New Hampshire is generally north of Pennsylvania. New Hampshire borders Maine,
      Massachusetts, Vermont, and Canada to the north. Pennsylvania is below New York
      state, which itself is generally south of New Hampshire.


      So geographically speaking, New Hampshire is north of Pennsylvania, which would
      mean that Granite State College in NH would likely be north of Bloomsburg University
      in PA, not south of it.

      New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States, part of the New
      England region.

      Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern US, but is positioned south of New
      England.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      New Hampshire shares borders with Maine (east), Massachusetts (south), Vermont
      (west), and Canada (north).

      Pennsylvania is positioned south of New York state, which itself is south of
      New Hampshire.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Generally speaking, New Hampshire lies at a higher latitude (more northerly)
      than Pennsylvania.

      While specific campus locations could vary, the entirety of New Hampshire is
      north of Pennsylvania''s northern border.


      Based on this geographical analysis, Granite State College in NH would be north

      or with campuses in different parts of NH.


      Bloomsburg University is in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern
      part of Pennsylvania.


      Given the general geography of the US, New Hampshire is typically north of Pennsylvania,
      so Granite State College is likely north of Bloomsburg University, not south.

      ## Step 2: Compare their geographical positions

      - New Hampshire is generally north of Pennsylvania in the United States

      - Granite State College (regardless of which NH campus) would be in the state
      of New Hampshire

      - Bloomsburg University is located in northeastern Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Determine relative north-south positioning

      National Paralegal College is in Arizona. Arizona is in the southwestern United

      Now I need to determine which is further south. I can think about the general
      geography of these states:


      Illinois is generally north of Kentucky. Kentucky borders Illinois on Illinois''
      southern border. So generally speaking, locations in Kentucky tend to be south
      of locations in Illinois.


      To be more precise:

      - Lisle, IL is in the northeastern part of Illinois, near Chicago

      - Crestview Hills, KY is in the northern part of Kentucky, near Cincinnati,
      OH


      Even though Crestview Hills is in northern Kentucky, Kentucky as a whole is
      south of Illinois. So it''s very likely that Thomas More University in Kentucky
      is south of Benedictine University in Illinois.

      - Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky


      Step 2: Compare the general geographic positions of Illinois and Kentucky.

      - Illinois is a northern state that borders Kentucky

      - Kentucky is situated directly south of Illinois


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Lisle, IL is in the northeastern part of Illinois (in the Chicago metropolitan

    969ccee5-0565-415c-9141-b5f23de2e4e8: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      locations of Benedictine University in Illinois and Thomas More University in
      Kentucky.


      First, let me identify where each university is located:


      1. Benedictine University is in Illinois (IL). Specifically, it''s located in
      Lisle, Illinois, which is in the northern part of Illinois, near Chicago.


      2. Thomas More University is in Kentucky (KY). It''s located in Crestview Hills,
      Kentucky, which is in the northern part of Kentucky, near Cincinnati, Ohio.


      Now, to determine if Benedictine University is south of Thomas More University,
      I need to compare their latitudes:


      - Northern Illinois (where Benedictine is) is generally in the northern part
      of the United States

      - Northern Kentucky (where Thomas More is) is also in the northern part of the
      US, but Kentucky as a whole is south of Illinois


      If we look at a map of the US, Illinois is north of Kentucky. However, since
      Benedictine is in northern Illinois and Thomas More is in northern Kentucky,
      I need to be more precise.


      Lisle, IL is in the Chicago suburbs, which is very far north in Illinois.

      Crestview Hills, KY is in the northernmost part of Kentucky, right across the
      Ohio River from Cincinnati.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative geographical positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Benedictine University is located in Lisle, Illinois, which is in the northern
      part of Illinois (near Chicago).

      - Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, which is in
      the northern part of Kentucky (near Cincinnati).


      Step 2: Consider the general geographical relationship between Illinois and
      Kentucky.

      - Illinois is generally north of Kentucky on the map of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Lisle, IL is in the Chicago metropolitan area, in the northeastern part of
      Illinois.

      - Crestview Hills, KY is in the northernmost part of Kentucky, just across the
      Ohio River from Cincinnati.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Even though Benedictine is in northern Illinois and Thomas More is in northern
      Kentucky, the general north-south relationship between the states holds true
      for these specific locations.

      - Benedictine University (in northern Illinois) is still north of Thomas More
      University (in northern Kentucky).


      NO, Benedictine University in Illinois is NOT located south of Thomas More University
      in Kentucky. It is located north of it.'

      Let me think about the geography:

      - Scranton, Pennsylvania is in northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Owensboro, Kentucky is in western Kentucky


      Pennsylvania is generally north of Kentucky in the United States. Kentucky borders
      the southern part of Ohio, which borders the southern part of Pennsylvania.
      So Kentucky is south of Pennsylvania.


      Specifically:

      - Scranton, PA is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Owensboro, KY is in the western part of Kentucky


      So Scranton, PA would be in the north, and Owensboro, KY would be in the south.
      This means that the University of Scranton would be NORTH of Western Kentucky
      University-Owensboro, not south of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, the University of Scranton is NOT located south

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Pennsylvania and Kentucky.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state in the eastern US

      - Kentucky is located south of Ohio, which is south of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of Kentucky on a map

      - Scranton is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Owensboro is in the western part of Kentucky


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      Since Pennsylvania is north of Kentucky, and Scranton is in the northern part

      University-Owensboro, not south of it.

      First, let me identify where these two universities are located:


      Elizabeth City State University is in Elizabeth City, North Carolina (NC).

      Florida A&M University - Florida State University College of Engineering is
      in Florida (FL).


      Now, to determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes:

      - North Carolina is a state that''s north of Florida on the US east coast

      - Florida is the southernmost state on the US mainland east coast


      Since North Carolina is north of Florida, Elizabeth City State University (in

      - Elizabeth City State University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Florida A&M University - Florida State University College of Engineering is
      in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Florida is the southernmost state on the U.S. mainland''s east coast

      - North Carolina is positioned north of Florida


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the universities.

      - Since North Carolina is north of Florida, a university in North Carolina (Elizabeth
      City State University) would be north of a university in Florida (Florida A&M-FSU
      College of Engineering)

      - Therefore, Elizabeth City State University is NOT south of Florida A&M-FSU
