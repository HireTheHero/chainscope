      - Specifically, it is near the Gulf Coast, west of Tallahassee


      2. Next, I''ll locate Young County, TX on a map:

      - Young County is in north-central Texas

      - It is located in the north-central part of the state


      3. Now, I''ll compare their relative positions:

      - Okaloosa County, FL is east of Young County, TX

      - They are not in the same state, and Okaloosa County is further east


      4. The question asks: "Is Okaloosa County, FL located west of Young County,
      TX?"

      - Since Okaloosa County is east of Young County, not west, the answer is NO.
