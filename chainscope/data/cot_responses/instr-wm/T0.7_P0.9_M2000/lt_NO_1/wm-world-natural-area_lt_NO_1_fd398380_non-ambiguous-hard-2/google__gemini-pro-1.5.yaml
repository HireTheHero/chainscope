      quick search reveals the Java Sea has an area of approximately 320,000 sq km.


      2. **Find the area of Coleto Creek Reservoir:**  A search shows Coleto Creek
      Reservoir has a surface area of about 3,100 acres.


      3. **Convert units for comparison:** Convert acres to square kilometers.  1
      acre is approximately 0.00405 sq km.  So, 3,100 acres is roughly 3,100 * 0.00405
      = 12.555 sq km.

      The Java Sea is significantly larger.
