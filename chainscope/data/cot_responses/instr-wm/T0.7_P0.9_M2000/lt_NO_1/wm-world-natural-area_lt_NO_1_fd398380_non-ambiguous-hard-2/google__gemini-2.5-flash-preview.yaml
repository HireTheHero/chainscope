      Pacific Ocean. Its area is approximately 320,000 square kilometers.

      Coleto Creek Reservoir is a reservoir in Texas, United States. Its surface area
      is approximately 3,100 acres.

      To compare these two areas, we need to convert them to the same unit.

      1 square kilometer = 247.105 acres.

      So, the area of the Java Sea in acres is 320,000 * 247.105 = 79,073,600 acres.

      The area of Coleto Creek Reservoir is 3,100 acres.

      Comparing the two areas: 79,073,600 acres (Java Sea) vs 3,100 acres (Coleto
      Creek Reservoir).

      The area of the Java Sea is significantly larger than the area of Coleto Creek

      \    *   Lakes, even large reservoirs, are typically much smaller than gulfs\
      \ or seas, often measured in tens or hundreds of square kilometers.\n5.  **Formulate\
      \ a preliminary hypothesis:** Based on the typical scale of gulfs/seas versus\
      \ lakes, it is highly likely that the Gulf of Oman (a gulf) is much larger than\
      \ Lake Caliraya ( a lake/reservoir).\n6.  **Seek specific data (if necessary\

      \ up the area of the Gulf of Oman. A quick search reveals its area is approximately\
      \ 181,000 square kilometers (or 70,000 sq mi).\n    *   Look up the area of\
      \ Lake Caliraya. A quick search reveals its area is approximately 32 square\
