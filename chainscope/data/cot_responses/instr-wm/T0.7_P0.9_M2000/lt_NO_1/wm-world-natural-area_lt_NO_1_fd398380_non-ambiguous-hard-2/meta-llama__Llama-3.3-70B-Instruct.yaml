      \ as a reservoir.\n\n3. **Compare Sizes**: Generally, seas are much larger than\
      \ lakes or ponds. The Sulu Sea covers an area of approximately 280,000 to 320,000\
      \ square kilometers. In contrast, \xC9tang de Lavalduc, being a small lake,\

      \ and their general sizes, it's reasonable to conclude that the Sulu Sea has\
      \ a much larger area than \xC9tang de Lavalduc. Therefore, the statement that\
