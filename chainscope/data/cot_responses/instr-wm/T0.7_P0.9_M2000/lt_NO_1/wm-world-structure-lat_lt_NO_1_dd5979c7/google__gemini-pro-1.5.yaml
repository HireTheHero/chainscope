      the question of Rocksavage being south of a location in Ireland is irrelevant.  Rocksavage

      However, focusing solely on the relationship between Rocksavage and St. Helen''s:  Rocksavage

      the answer is NO, as there is no such place as "St. Helen''s, Booterstown".


      Given the likely intent of the question is to determine the relative location
      of Rocksavage and St. Helen''s, the most helpful answer is YES.

      of these two clubs.  A quick search reveals that the English Disco was on Sunset
      Strip in West Hollywood, while the Starwood was also on Sunset Strip but further
      west.  Sunset Strip runs roughly east-west.  Therefore, being further west doesn''t
      necessarily mean south. More precise location information is needed.


      4. **More specific locations:** Research shows the English Disco was at 8175
      Sunset Blvd while the Starwood was at 8151 Sunset Blvd.  Lower numbered addresses
      on Sunset are further west.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since both are on Sunset Blvd, and a lower number indicates
      a more westerly location, the English Disco was *west* of the Starwood, not
      south.

      the Starwood was slightly northwest of Rodney Bingenheimer''s English Disco.

      WPG-77 was sunk in the North Atlantic during World War II. The wreck site is

      the coast of Greenland is likely to the west or south, but more importantly,
      Greenland itself is well north of any other significant landmass.


      4. **Determine Relative Position:** Since the wreck of the Escanaba is near
      Greenland, and Hvalsey Church is *in* southern Greenland, the Escanaba wreck
      *cannot* be south of the church.

      USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77).  Since it was decommissioned and scrapped, its current
      location is irrelevant.  However, its *last* known location, or locations of
      service, would be relevant.  It served primarily in the Great Lakes and North
      Atlantic.


      2. We need to determine the location of Hvalsey Church.  This is a ruined Norse
      church in southern Greenland.


      3.  Southern Greenland is much further north than the North Atlantic and Great
      Lakes region where Escanaba operated.


      Therefore, USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was *not* located south of Hvalsey Church.

      2. **USCGC Escanaba:**  Escanaba was a US Coast Guard cutter.  Since it was
      decommissioned and scrapped, its location is irrelevant.  If we were talking
      about its usual operating area in the past, it would have likely been in the
      Great Lakes region of North America.

      3. **Compare Locations:** Southern Greenland is, by definition, south of anywhere

      location matters), it is likely north of Hvalsey Church which is in *southern*
      Greenland.


      4. **Verify:** A quick search confirms the Escanaba sank off the *southwestern*
      coast of Greenland, but still further north than the southernmost tip where
      Hvalsey is located.

      2. **Compare the street addresses:**  Both churches are in Merrillville, IN,
      simplifying the comparison.  We can focus on the street names and numbers.  East
      St. Joseph Street and Mississippi Street are different streets.  Street numbers
      alone won''t tell us the north/south relationship without a map.


      3. **Visualize or use a map:**  Using a mapping tool (like Google Maps or Bing
      Maps) is the most reliable way.  Entering the addresses confirms their locations.  Visually,
      St. Stanislaus is north of Saint Sava.

      2. **What''s the relationship we''re looking for?** We want to know if Lake
      Mulwala is *south* of Hume Dam.


      3. **How are they related?** Hume Dam actually forms Lake Mulwala.  The dam
      holds back the Murray River, creating the lake.


      4. **So, is the lake south of the dam?** Since the lake is formed *by* the dam,
      it must be at least partially downstream/south of it, as the water flows southward.

      Mulwala and Hume Dam?** Lake Mulwala is formed by the Hume Dam.  The dam walls
      the Murray River, creating the lake.


      2. **So, where is the lake relative to the dam?** A dam typically holds back
      water on the upstream side. Therefore, the lake is upstream/behind the dam.


      3. **Which direction does the Murray River flow?** The Murray River flows generally
      west.


      4. **So, if the dam is holding back water flowing west, where would the lake
      be in relation to the dam in terms of north/south?**  If the river flows west
      and the dam blocks it, the lake (upstream) would stretch generally east from
      the dam. North/south wouldn''t be the primary directional relationship.


      5. **Therefore, is the lake *south* of the dam?** Not precisely.  While some
      parts of the very large lake might extend slightly south, the primary relationship
      is that it is *upstream/east* of the dam.

      4. **South:** Something is south of another location if it has a lower latitude.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since Colchester is at a higher latitude than Ekibastuz,
      the Mercury Theatre is *not* south of Ekibastuz GRES-1.

      2. **Determine their latitudes:** Once we know their locations, we can determine
      which one is further south by comparing their latitudes (the north-south position).  The
      structure with the lower latitude value is further south.


      3. **Compare latitudes and conclude:** After comparing the latitudes, we can
      definitively say whether St Botolph''s Church, Hardham is south of Sherborne
      Abbey.


      St Botolph''s Church, Hardham is in West Sussex. Sherborne Abbey is in Dorset.  Dorset
      is further west and south of West Sussex.
