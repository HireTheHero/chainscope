      2. **Understand the geography**: London is a large city with various districts
      and neighborhoods. Tulse Hill is in the southern part of London, while Petersham
      is more to the west of central London.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that Tulse Hill is in the southern
      part of London and Petersham is more to the west, it''s safe to say that Tulse
      Hill is not directly south of Petersham.


      4. **Consider the specific locations**: Even though Tulse Hill is in the southern
      part of London, it''s not directly south of Petersham. If we consider the specific
      locations of Tulse Hill railway station and Sudbrook Park, they are not in a

      relationship between these two locations.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Both the Cathedral Church of St. Paul and the
      Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception are located in Burlington, Vermont, USA.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To determine if one location is south
      of another, we need to know their respective latitudes. Generally, the farther
      south a location is, the lower its latitude.


      3. **Compare locations**: Based on my knowledge, I don''t have the exact coordinates
      for these two locations. However, both are in the same city, Burlington, Vermont.
      Given the relatively small size of Burlington, it''s reasonable to assume that
      the difference in latitude between these two locations would be negligible.


      4. **Determine the relationship**: Considering both cathedrals are in the same
      city, it''s unlikely that one would be significantly south of the other. Instead,
      they would be more or less at the same latitude, meaning neither is truly south
      of the other.

    9950ceef-fe58-4ff4-8a2a-60402be18221: 'To answer whether Thomson Dam is located
      south of Monash Freeway, we need to establish the geographical relationship
      between these two locations.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Thomson Dam and
      Monash Freeway are located. Thomson Dam is a reservoir located in Victoria,
      Australia, near the town of Rawson. The Monash Freeway, on the other hand, is
      a major freeway in Melbourne, also in Victoria, Australia.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we consider the geographical positions
      of these locations. The town of Rawson, where the Thomson Dam is located, is
      situated in the eastern part of Victoria, relatively close to the state''s border
      with New South Wales. The Monash Freeway runs through the southeastern suburbs
      of Melbourne, which is also in Victoria.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Considering the relative positions, both locations
      are in Victoria, Australia. However, to determine if Thomson Dam is south of
      the Monash Freeway, we need to understand their specific placements relative
      to each other. Melbourne, where the Monash Freeway is, is generally considered
      to be south or southwest of Rawson, where Thomson Dam is.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout, Thomson Dam is indeed located
      north of the Monash Freeway, making it not south of the freeway but rather north
      or northeast of it, depending on the precise locations within their respective
      regions.

      in Collinsville, Queensland, Australia. Lake Moondarra is also in Queensland,
      Australia, near the town of Mount Isa.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we consider the geographical positions
      of these locations. Collinsville, where the power station is located, is situated
      in the northeastern part of Queensland. Mount Isa, where Lake Moondarra is located,
      is also in the northeastern part of Queensland but is more inland and west of
      Collinsville.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Considering the relative positions, both locations
      are in the northeastern part of Queensland. However, to determine if Collinsville
      Power Station is south of Lake Moondarra, we need to understand their specific
      placements relative to each other. Collinsville is generally considered to be
      east or northeast of Mount Isa, where Lake Moondarra is located.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout, Collinsville Power Station
      is not south of Lake Moondarra but rather is located more to the east or northeast
      of it, depending on the precise locations within their respective regions.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      in the Horn of Africa, east of the African continent. Thailand, where the Chaeng
      Watthana Government Complex is located, is in Southeast Asia, east of India.

      is located south of Villa of the Papyri, we need to establish the geographical
      relationship between these two locations.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where All Saints Church
      (Manhattan) and Villa of the Papyri are located. All Saints Church (Manhattan)
      is located in New York City, USA. The Villa of the Papyri is located in the
      ancient Roman city of Herculaneum, near Naples, Italy.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we consider the geographical positions
      of these locations. New York City, where All Saints Church (Manhattan) is located,
      is situated on the east coast of the United States. Herculaneum, where the Villa
      of the Papyri is located, is situated in southern Italy.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Considering the relative positions, New York City
      is located in North America, while Herculaneum is in Europe. Europe is generally
      considered to be east of North America, and Italy is specifically located in
      southern Europe.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout, All Saints Church (Manhattan)
      is not located south of the Villa of the Papyri. Instead, it is located west
      of the Villa of the Papyri, considering their global positions on different
      continents.

      the steps needed to reason this out:


      1. **Identify the Location of All Saints Church (Manhattan)**: First, we need
      to know where All Saints Church (Manhattan) is. After research, it appears that
      All Saints Church is located in New York City, specifically in the Manhattan
      borough.


      2. **Identify the Location of Villa of the Papyri**: Next, we need to identify
      the location of Villa of the Papyri. Villa of the Papyri is an archaeological
      site located in Herculaneum, Italy.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Knowing that All Saints Church is in New York City,
      and Villa of the Papyri is in Italy, we can proceed to compare their geographical
      locations. New York City is located in the United States, specifically on the
      east coast. Italy, on the other hand, is located in southern Europe.


      4. **Determine the Relative Position**: Without exact coordinates but knowing
      the cities and countries, it''s reasonable to infer that All Saints Church in
      New York City would be west or northwest of Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum,
      Italy, given the general geography of the United States and Europe. New York
      City is not south of the region of Italy where Villa of the Papyri is situated.

      3. **Compare Locations**: Given that both locations are on the Sunset Strip,
      we can compare their relative positions. The Sunset Strip is a stretch of Sunset
      Boulevard, which runs east-west through West Hollywood. If both places were

      USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) is a U.S. Coast Guard Cutter that was in service from
      1932 to 1943. The ship was named after Escanaba, Michigan, which is a city in
      the United States. Hvalsey Church, on the other hand, is located in Hvalsey
      Fjord, Greenland. It is the best-preserved Norse ruin in Greenland.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we consider the geographical positions
      of these locations. Michigan, where the ship was named after, is located in
      the Midwest region of the United States. Greenland, where Hvalsey Church is
      located, is an autonomous territory of Denmark situated between the Arctic and
      Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Considering the relative positions, Michigan is located
      in the northern hemisphere, while Greenland is also in the northern hemisphere
      but is much further north than Michigan. The general direction from Michigan
      to Greenland would be northeast.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout, USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77), named
      after a city in Michigan, is not located south of Hvalsey Church in Greenland
      but rather is located to the southwest or west, depending on the precise locations

      United States.


      2. **Understand Geographical Directions**: To determine if one location is south
      of another, we need to know their respective latitudes. Generally, the farther
      south a location is, the lower its latitude.


      3. **Compare Locations**: The Palace of the Kings of Navarre of Olite is in
      the northern part of Spain, while Basic Creek Reservoir is in the northeastern
      part of the United States. Spain is generally located southeast of the United
      States.


      4. **Determine the Relationship**: Given that the Palace of the Kings of Navarre
      of Olite is in Spain, and Basic Creek Reservoir is in the United States, the
      palace would be east or southeast of the reservoir, not south. However, the
      question asks specifically about "south," so we need to consider the global
      perspective. When considering the curvature of the Earth and global positioning,
      the palace is not directly south of the reservoir but rather southeast.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout, the Palace of the Kings of
      Navarre of Olite is not south of Basic Creek Reservoir but rather southeast
      or east, depending on the perspective.

      the continent. Concordia Station is situated in the middle of the Antarctic
      plateau, which is the highest and most central part of the continent. Scott
      Base is located in the Ross Dependency, which is in the far east of Antarctica,
      closer to the coast.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the above information, we can conclude that Concordia
      Station is not located south of Scott Base. Instead, Concordia Station is located
      more to the west of Scott Base. The Ross Dependency, where Scott Base is located,
      is to the east of the Antarctic plateau where Concordia Station is situated.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Concordia Station is located south of Scott
      Base is: $\boxed{NO}$

      Concordia Station is a research facility located in Antarctica. It is situated
      at Dome C, which is a site on the Antarctic Plateau, about 1,100 kilometers
      inland from the French research station Dumont d''Urville Station.


      Scott Base is a New Zealand scientific research station in Antarctica. It is
      located on Ross Island, near Mount Erebus in the Ross Dependency.


      Given the information available, Concordia Station is located inland from the
      coast of Antarctica, while Scott Base is located on Ross Island, which is near
      the coast. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Concordia Station is located
      south of Scott Base, as it is further inland and thus likely at a higher latitude.


      So, the answer to whether Concordia Station is located south of Scott Base is:
      YES.

      is located in Kenya, specifically in the West Pokot County, near the border
      with Uganda.


      2. **Understand the geographical relationship**: Somalia and Kenya are neighboring
      countries in East Africa. Mogadishu, where Villa Somalia is situated, is located
      on the southern coast of Somalia, facing the Indian Ocean. Turkwel Hydroelectric
      Power Station is located in the western part of Kenya, near the border with
      Uganda, which is west of Somalia.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Considering the geographical layout
      of East Africa, Somalia is located to the east of Kenya. Therefore, Turkwel
      Hydroelectric Power Station, being in western Kenya, would be west of Somalia.
      Mogadishu, where Villa Somalia is located, is on the southern coast of Somalia.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical positions of Villa Somalia in Mogadishu,
      Somalia, and Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station in West Pokot County, Kenya,
      Villa Somalia is not south of Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station. Instead,
      Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station is west of Villa Somalia.


      So, the answer to whether Villa Somalia is located south of Turkwel Hydroelectric
      Power Station is: $\boxed{NO}$

      south of Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station, let''s break down the steps needed
      to reason this out:


      1. **Identify the Location of Villa Somalia**: First, we need to know where
      Villa Somalia is. After research, it appears that Villa Somalia is located in
      Mogadishu, Somalia.


      2. **Identify the Location of Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station**: Next, we
      need to identify the location of Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station. Turkwel
      Hydroelectric Power Station is located in Kenya, specifically in the Rift Valley
      Province.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Knowing that Villa Somalia is in Somalia and Turkwel
      Hydroelectric Power Station is in Kenya, we can proceed to compare their geographical
      locations. Somalia is located in the Horn of Africa, while Kenya is situated
      in East Africa.


      4. **Determine the Relative Position**: Without exact coordinates but knowing
      the countries, it''s reasonable to infer that Villa Somalia in Somalia would
      be northeast of Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station in Kenya, given the general
      geography of Africa. Somalia is not south of the region of Kenya where Turkwel
      Hydroelectric Power Station is situated.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Villa Somalia is located south of
      Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station is **NO**'

      \   - **Ekibastuz GRES-1** in Kazakhstan has a latitude of about 51.88\xB0N.\n\

      of these locations. Colchester, England, is situated in the southeastern part
      of England. Ekibastuz, Kazakhstan, is located in the northeastern part of the
      country, close to the border with Russia.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Considering the relative positions, both locations
      are in the northern hemisphere. However, to determine if Mercury Theatre is
      south of Ekibastuz GRES-1, we need to understand their specific placements relative

      the steps needed to reason this out:


      1. **Identify the Location of Inya Lake**: First, we need to know where Inya
      Lake is. After research, it appears that Inya Lake is located in Yangon, Myanmar.


      2. **Identify the Location of 54 University Avenue**: Next, we need to identify
      the location of 54 University Avenue. This address could refer to multiple locations
      worldwide, so we need more context or information to pinpoint its exact location.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Knowing that Inya Lake is in Yangon, Myanmar, we can
      proceed to compare its location with 54 University Avenue. However, without
      the specific location of 54 University Avenue, it''s challenging to determine
      the relative positions of these two points.


      4. **Determine the Relative Position**: Without the specific location of 54
      University Avenue, we can''t definitively say whether Inya Lake is located south
      of it. The answer could vary depending on where 54 University Avenue is located.


      Based on these steps and the available information, the answer to whether Inya
      Lake is located south of 54 University Avenue is **UNKNOWN**.

    3a831c81-6397-4549-9ea6-7bda4b2dd9c1: 'To answer whether Inya Lake is located
      south of 54 University Avenue, we need to establish the geographical relationship
      between these two locations.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Inya Lake and 54
      University Avenue are located. Inya Lake is a freshwater lake located in Yangon,
      Myanmar. The address 54 University Avenue is not a common address globally,
      but for the sake of this question, let''s assume it''s located in the United
      States, given the naming convention.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we consider the geographical positions
      of these locations. Yangon, where Inya Lake is located, is situated near the
      south of Myanmar, which is a country in Southeast Asia. The United States, where
      54 University Avenue might be, is a country in North America.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Considering the relative positions, Yangon is generally
      south or southeast of the United States. However, to determine if Inya Lake
      is south of the specific location of 54 University Avenue, we need to understand
      their specific placements relative to each other. Given the vast distance and
      different continents involved, it''s unlikely that Inya Lake would be directly
      south of a specific location in the United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout, Inya Lake is not directly
      south of 54 University Avenue. However, given the relative positions of the
      countries involved, it''s reasonable to say that Inya Lake is generally south
      or southeast of the United States.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      is located south of Muttukadu boat house, we need to establish the geographical
      relationship between these two locations.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Milagres Church
      (Mangalore) and Muttukadu boat house are located. Milagres Church is in Mangalore,
      which is in the state of Karnataka, India. The Muttukadu boat house is in Muttukadu,
      which is in the state of Tamil Nadu, India.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we consider the geographical positions
      of these locations. Mangalore, where the Milagres Church is located, is situated
      on the west coast of India. Muttukadu, where the boat house is located, is on
      the east coast of India, south of Chennai.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Considering the relative positions, Mangalore is
      on the west coast, while Muttukadu is on the east coast. However, to determine
      if Milagres Church is south of Muttukadu boat house, we need to understand their
      specific placements relative to each other. The state of Karnataka, where Mangalore
      is, is generally considered to be north or northwest of the state of Tamil Nadu,
      where Muttukadu is.

      of Muttukadu boat house but rather is located more to the north or northwest
      of it, depending on the precise locations within their respective states.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      the geographical relationship between these two locations.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Centennial Tower
      (Philippines) and Central United Methodist Church (Manila) are located. Centennial
      Tower is located in Quezon City, Philippines, which is part of Metro Manila.
      Central United Methodist Church is located in Manila, Philippines, which is

      is located in the northern part of the Philippines.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Considering the relative positions, both locations
      are within Metro Manila. However, to determine if Centennial Tower is south
      of Central United Methodist Church, we need to understand their specific placements
      relative to each other. The city of Quezon, where Centennial Tower is located,

      in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. Colombo, where St. Anthony''s Shrine
      is located, is on the west coast of Sri Lanka.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Considering the relative positions, both locations
      are in Sri Lanka. However, to determine if Lake Gregory is south of the St.
      Anthony''s Shrine, we need to understand their specific placements relative

      2. Determine the geographical relationship between these two locations, specifically
      whether Lake Gregory is south of St. Anthony''s Shrine.


      Lake Gregory is located in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka, in the central part of the
      island country. St. Anthony''s Shrine is situated in Kochchikade, which is a
      part of Colombo, Sri Lanka, on the western coast.


      Considering the locations, Lake Gregory in Nuwara Eliya is in the central highlands
      of Sri Lanka, while St. Anthony''s Shrine in Kochchikade is on the western coast.
      The central highlands are generally more to the east and slightly south of Colombo,
      where Kochchikade is located.


      Therefore, Lake Gregory in Nuwara Eliya is not south of St. Anthony''s Shrine
      in Kochchikade but is more to the east or southeast.

      3. **Compare Locations**: Knowing that Lake Gregory is in Nuwara Eliya, Central
      Province, and St. Anthony''s Shrine, Kochchikade, is in Colombo, we can proceed
      to compare their geographical locations. Colombo is located on the western coast
      of Sri Lanka, while Nuwara Eliya is more inland and central.


      4. **Determine the Relative Position**: Nuwara Eliya is generally located east
      of Colombo. However, the question asks whether Lake Gregory is located south
      of St. Anthony''s Shrine. Since Nuwara Eliya is not directly south of Colombo
      but rather more eastward, Lake Gregory in Nuwara Eliya would not be south of

      \ is located in Orlando, Florida, in the United States.\n   - Jahanpanah is\
      \ not a widely recognized location. After research, it's found that Jahanpanah\
      \ is a historical site in Delhi, India. It was a fortified city built by Muhammad\
      \ bin Tughluq in the 14th century.\n\n2. **Understand the geographical relationship**:\
      \ \n   - Orlando, Florida, is in the southeastern part of the United States.\n\
      \   - Delhi, India, is located in the northern part of India.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ the locations**:\n   - Since Delhi is located in the northern part of India,\
      \ and Orlando is in the southeastern part of the United States, the two locations\
      \ are not directly south-north in relation to each other. Delhi is more eastward\
      \ from Orlando.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the geographical positions,\
      \ Cathedral Church of St. Luke in Orlando, Florida, is not located south of\
      \ Jahanpanah in Delhi, India. It's more to the west or southwest, depending\
      \ on the exact locations within the cities.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NO}$\n\
