      2. First Baptist Church of Dallas is located in Dallas, Texas.


      3. These are churches in two different states, with Charleston being further
      south than Dallas.


      4. Therefore, Emanuel AME Church is NOT located south of First Baptist Church
      (Dallas).


      The answer is: NO.'

      - San Clemente Dam is west of Santorini

      - More specifically, it is northwest of Santorini

      - Therefore, it is NOT south of the cathedral


      5. Conclusion:

      The answer is NO, San Clemente Dam is not located south of St. John the Baptist
      Cathedral, Santorini.

      1. First, let''s locate San Clemente Dam:

      - San Clemente Dam is located in California, United States

      - Specifically, it was located in Monterey County, California

      - It was actually removed in 2015-2017 as part of an environmental restoration
      project


      2. Next, let''s locate St. John the Baptist Cathedral in Santorini:

      - Santorini is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea

      - St. John the Baptist Cathedral is located in the town of Fira on this island


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - San Clemente Dam was in California, North America

      - St. John the Baptist Cathedral is in Santorini, Greece, Europe

      - These locations are on different continents, separated by the Atlantic Ocean


      4. Determining relative position:

      - California is geographically north of Santorini

      - Therefore, San Clemente Dam is north of St. John the Baptist Cathedral


      5. Answering the specific question:

      - Is San Clemente Dam located south of St. John the Baptist Cathedral? No.

    deec9ea7-e48a-4602-87fb-590309a1cb2a: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Lake Gregory and St. Anthony''s Shrine on a map of Sri
      Lanka.


      2. Lake Gregory is located in Nuwara Eliya, which is in the central highlands
      of Sri Lanka.


      3. St. Anthony''s Shrine is located in Kochchikade, which is a coastal area
      in the western part of Sri Lanka, near Colombo.


      4. Nuwara Eliya is located in the central part of Sri Lanka, at a higher elevation.


      5. Kochchikade is located on the western coast, closer to sea level.


      6. Geographically, Nuwara Eliya is actually north of Kochchikade, not south.


      7. Therefore, Lake Gregory is NOT located south of St. Anthony''s Shrine.
