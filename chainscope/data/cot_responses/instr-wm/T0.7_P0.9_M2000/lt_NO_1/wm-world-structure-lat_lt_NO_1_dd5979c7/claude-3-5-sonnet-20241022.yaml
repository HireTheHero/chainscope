      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Rocksavage Power Station is in Cheshire, England

      - St. Helen''s is a town in Merseyside, England

      - Booterstown is a suburb of Dublin, Ireland


      2. Since Booterstown is in Ireland and the other locations are in England, we
      can eliminate it from consideration.


      3. Looking at the relative positions in England:

      - Rocksavage Power Station is near Runcorn

      - St. Helen''s is north of Runcorn/Rocksavage


      4. Therefore, Rocksavage Power Station is located south of St. Helen''s.


      Answer: YES'

      - St. Helen''s is a town in Merseyside, England

      - Booterstown is in Dublin, Ireland


      2. Since the question refers to "St. Helen''s, Booterstown", it''s specifically
      referring to the Booterstown location, not the town in Merseyside.


      3. Booterstown is in Dublin, Ireland, while Rocksavage Power Station is in England.


      4. Given they are in different countries separated by the Irish Sea, we can
      determine their relative positions:

      - Rocksavage Power Station is in England, which is east of Ireland

      - Therefore, Rocksavage Power Station cannot be south of any location in Ireland

      2. The Emerson Theater is located at 4630 E 10th St, Indianapolis, IN 46201


      3. Looking at the addresses:

      - Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral is on N Meridian Street (indicating north)

      - The Emerson Theater is on E 10th Street


      4. In Indianapolis''s grid system:

      - N Meridian Street is around the 1300 block north

      - E 10th Street is around the 4600 block east


      5. The Cathedral is located in downtown Indianapolis, while The Emerson Theater
      is located further east and north


      6. The Cathedral is actually north of 10th Street, so it cannot be south of
      The Emerson Theater which is on 10th Street

      1. The Post & Echo Building is located in Liverpool, England.


      2. The Towers is located in Manchester, England.


      3. Looking at a map of England:

      - Manchester is located in the northwestern part of England

      - Liverpool is also in northwestern England

      - Liverpool is west of Manchester

      - In terms of north-south positioning, Liverpool is slightly south of Manchester


      4. Therefore, since the Post & Echo Building is in Liverpool, and Liverpool
      is slightly south of Manchester where The Towers is located...


      NO - The Post & Echo Building is not south of The Towers. It is southwest of
      The Towers.'
