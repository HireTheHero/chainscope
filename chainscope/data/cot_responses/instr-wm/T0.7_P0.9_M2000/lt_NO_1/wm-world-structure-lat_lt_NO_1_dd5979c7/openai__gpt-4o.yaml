      locations of these places step by step.


      1. **Euston St Pancras railway station**: This refers to either Euston station
      or St Pancras station. Both are major railway stations located in central London,
      and they are situated relatively close to each other on the north side of central
      London.


      2. **Lord''s tube station**: It appears there might be a misunderstanding here,

      Next, we consider the relative geographic positions:


      - Runcorn, Cheshire, England (where Rocksavage Power Station is located), is
      situated to the east of Ireland and is generally north of Dublin.


      - Booterstown is in Dublin, which is on the east coast of Ireland.


      By comparing these locations on the map, we can conclude:


      - Runcorn (and therefore Rocksavage Power Station) is indeed north of Booterstown,
      Dublin.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      NO.'

      city of Rybinsk in the Yaroslavl Oblast.


      2. **Vennesla Library and Culture House**: This is located in Vennesla, a town
      in Southern Norway.


      Now, comparing the geographical positions:


      - The Rybinsk Reservoir is located in Russia, which is generally further east
      and can be found at a northern latitude, but typically not as far north as Southern
      Norway.

      - Vennesla is in Southern Norway, which is at a higher northern latitude than
      the central part of Russia where the Rybinsk Reservoir is located.


      Considering latitudinal positions:


      - Southern Norway (where Vennesla is located) is at a higher latitude than the
      central regions of Russia, where the Rybinsk Reservoir is positioned.


      Thus, the Rybinsk Reservoir is indeed located south of Vennesla Library and
      Culture House.

      1. **Cherrybrook Technology High School** is situated in Cherrybrook, a suburb
      in the north-western Sydney region in New South Wales, Australia.


      2. **RM Williams Way** is a road located in South Australia. It runs through
      the Mid North region of South Australia, connecting the towns of Clare and Burra.


      Now, comparing the relative positions:


      - Cherrybrook is in New South Wales, which is on the east coast of Australia.

      - RM Williams Way is in South Australia, which is geographically to the west
      and slightly north of New South Wales.


      Based on this information, RM Williams Way is not located south of Cherrybrook
      Technology High School. Therefore, the answer is:


      NO.'

      is located south of Royal Victoria DLR station, we need to consider their positions
      on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) network in London.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Both East India and Royal Victoria are DLR stations
      in the Docklands area of East London.


      2. **Check their relative positions**: East India station is on the Beckton/Woolwich
      Arsenal branch of the DLR. Royal Victoria is also on the same Beckton branch.


      3. **Determine the direction**: When traveling from Tower Gateway (a central
      DLR station) towards Beckton, the order of stations is East India followed by
      Royal Victoria.


      Given this order, East India is located to the west of Royal Victoria when traveling
      along the DLR line from central London toward Beckton.


      However, the question asks if East India is south of Royal Victoria. To determine
      this, we need to check their geographical coordinates or map locations:


      - **East India station**: Located slightly north of the River Thames.

      - **Royal Victoria station**: Located closer to the ExCel London exhibition
      center, also north of the River Thames.

      2. **Location of Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay**: Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is a proposed
      tidal power station that would be located in Swansea Bay, near Swansea, Wales.


      3. **Relative Locations**: Geographically, Swansea is located in Wales, which
      is to the west of England. However, in terms of latitude (north-south positioning),
      Swansea is further south than Wood Green, London.


      Considering these steps, Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay is indeed located south of
      Wood Green tube station.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
