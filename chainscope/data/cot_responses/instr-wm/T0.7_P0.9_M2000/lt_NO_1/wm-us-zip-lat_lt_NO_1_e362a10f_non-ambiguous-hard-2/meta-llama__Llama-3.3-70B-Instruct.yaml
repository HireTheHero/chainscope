      \ these zip codes and their relative positions:\n\n- 35951, AL (Alabama) is\
      \ generally at a latitude around 34.4\xB0N.\n- 32818, FL (Florida) is generally\
      \ at a latitude around 28.5\xB0N.\n\nGiven this, Alabama is north of Florida,\
      \ and even the southernmost parts of Alabama are generally north of the northernmost\
      \ parts of Florida. Thus, 35951, AL being in the northeastern part of Alabama\
      \ would likely be north of 32818, FL, which is in central Florida.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer to whether 35951, AL is located south of 32818, FL is: **NO**."

      1. Identify the states: 28602 is in North Carolina (NC), and 31206 is in Georgia
      (GA).

      2. Consider the general geography of the states: North Carolina is located north
      of Georgia.

      3. Since we are comparing locations within these states, we must determine if
      the specific locations of these zip codes alter the general north-south relationship
      between the two states.


      Given that 28602 is in North Carolina and 31206 is in Georgia, and knowing North
      Carolina is generally north of Georgia, the specific locations of these zip
      codes do not change the fact that North Carolina is north of Georgia.

      the geographic locations of the two zip codes and compare them.


      1. **Identify the states**: The first step is to recognize the states associated
      with each zip code. The zip code 84302 is located in the state of Utah (UT),
      and the zip code 73644 is located in the state of Oklahoma (OK).


      2. **Determine general geographic location of states**: Next, consider the general
      geographic location of Utah and Oklahoma in the United States. Utah is located
      in the western United States, while Oklahoma is situated in the central part
      of the southern United States.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is south of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Generally, the farther south a location
      is, the lower its latitude. Without specific latitude values for these zip codes,
      we can use general knowledge about the states'' locations. Utah''s latitude
      ranges are generally higher (more north) than Oklahoma''s, given Utah''s position
      relative to Oklahoma.


      4. **Conclusion based on state locations**: Given that Utah is generally north
      of Oklahoma, it is reasonable to conclude that a zip code in Utah would be north
      of a zip code in Oklahoma, without needing the exact latitudes of the specific
      zip codes.

      \ of 78148, TX, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify\
      \ the locations**:\n   - 93434, CA refers to a zip code in California.\n   -\
      \ 78148, TX refers to a zip code in Texas.\n\n2. **General geographical knowledge**:\n\
      \   - California (CA) is a state on the West Coast of the United States.\n \
      \  - Texas (TX) is a state located in the South-Central United States.\n\n3.\
      \ **Latitude comparison**:\n   - To determine if one location is south of another,\
      \ we need to compare their latitudes. Generally, the lower the latitude, the\
      \ closer a location is to the equator, and thus, the more \"south\" it is.\n\
      \   - Without specific latitude values, we can rely on general knowledge:\n\
      \     - California's latitude ranges approximately from 32\xB0N to 42\xB0N.\n\
      \     - Texas's latitude ranges approximately from 25\xB0N to 36\xB0N.\n\n4.\
      \ **Comparing the general locations**:\n   - Given that parts of Texas are closer\
      \ to the equator (lower latitude) than any part of California, Texas can extend\
      \ further south than California.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Texas extends\

      with each zip code. The zip code 54180 is located in Wisconsin (WI), and the
      zip code 11767 is located in New York (NY).


      2. **General Geographic Location of States**: Next, we consider the general
      geographic location of these states. Wisconsin is located in the Midwest, and
      New York is located in the Northeast.


      3. **Latitude Comparison**: To determine if one location is south of another,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Generally, the farther south a location
      is, the lower its latitude. Without specific latitude numbers, we can use general
      knowledge about the states'' positions. New York is known to be one of the northern
      states in the U.S., and Wisconsin, while also in the northern part of the country,
      is generally south of New York.

      (NY), and the zip code 80465 is located in the state of Colorado (CO).


      2. **Determine general geographic locations**: Next, we need to understand the
      general geographic locations of these states. New York is located in the northeastern
      United States, while Colorado is located in the western United States.


      3. **Compare latitudes**: To determine if one location is south of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Generally, New York has a higher latitude
      than Colorado, meaning New York is farther north than Colorado.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic locations and without needing
      the exact latitudes and longitudes of the specific zip codes, we can conclude
      that New York (12009) is north of Colorado (80465).

      2. Next, we need to consider the general geography of the United States. New\
      \ York is located in the northeastern part of the country, while Colorado is\
      \ in the western part.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the latitudes. Generally, the\
      \ farther south you go, the lower the latitude. New York has a relatively high\
      \ latitude (around 40-45\xB0N), and Colorado also has a relatively high latitude\

      of 33025, FL, we need to consider the general geographic locations associated
      with these zip codes.


      1. **Identify the states**: 36869 is in Alabama (AL), and 33025 is in Florida
      (FL).

      2. **General geographic location of states**: Alabama is located northwest of
      Florida.

      3. **Consider the latitude**: Since Alabama is northwest of Florida, on average,
      points in Alabama are at a higher latitude (further north) than points in Florida.

      4. **Specific zip code locations**: Without exact coordinates, we rely on the
      general state locations. However, knowing that 36869 refers to a location in
      Alabama and 33025 refers to a location in Florida, and given the northwest-southeast
      relationship between these states, we can infer their relative north-south positioning.


      Given these steps, since Alabama is generally north of Florida, a location in
      Alabama (36869) would typically be north of a location in Florida (33025), not
      south.

      \ United States.\n   - Florida (FL) is located in the southeastern part of the\
      \ United States.\n\n2. **Determine the general latitude of each state:**\n \
      \  - Arizona's latitude ranges approximately from 31.3\xB0N to 37.0\xB0N.\n\
      \   - Florida's latitude ranges approximately from 24.4\xB0N to 31.0\xB0N.\n\
      \n3. **Compare the latitudes:**\n   - Since Florida's northernmost point (31.0\xB0\
      N) is very close to Arizona's southernmost point (31.3\xB0N), and given that\
      \ 85614, AZ would be above this latitude, we can infer that parts of Arizona\
      \ are indeed north of the entire state of Florida.\n\n4. **Conclusion based\
      \ on the question:**\n   - Given that 85614, AZ is in Arizona and 34145, FL\
      \ is in Florida, and knowing that Arizona is generally west and partly north\
      \ of Florida, the specific zip code 85614, AZ, being in the southern part of\
      \ Arizona, could still be north of or at least not significantly south of 34145,\
      \ FL, considering the general geography of the two states.\n\nHowever, considering\
      \ the specific latitudes of these zip codes:\n- 85614, AZ has a latitude of\
      \ approximately 31.9\xB0N.\n- 34145, FL has a latitude of approximately 26.2\xB0\
      N.\n\nGiven this information, 85614, AZ is actually north of 34145, FL. \n\n\
      So, the answer to whether 85614, AZ is located south of 34145, FL is: **NO**."

      the zip code 29033 is located in South Carolina (SC).


      2. **General geographic location of the states**: Next, we need to know the

      United States.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is south of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Generally, Pennsylvania is at a higher latitude
      than South Carolina, meaning Pennsylvania is north of South Carolina.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic locations and the fact that

      1. First, let''s identify the states: 98229 is located in Washington (WA), and
      03303 is located in New Hampshire (NH).

      2. Next, we need to consider the general geography of the United States. Washington
      is a state in the northwest, while New Hampshire is a state in the northeast.

      3. Now, let''s look at the latitude of the two states. Washington is generally
      at a lower latitude than New Hampshire, but not significantly so in terms of
      being "south." However, we need to consider the overall geography.

      4. Considering the general geography, the northwest (Washington) is not typically
      considered south of the northeast (New Hampshire). In fact, the northwest is
      often at a similar latitude or slightly lower than the northeast, but the concept
      of "south" in this context refers to a more significant difference in latitude.

      5. However, it''s essential to consider that "south" refers to a direction,
      and in the context of the United States, the difference in latitude between
      the northwest and northeast is not as significant as the difference in longitude.
      The key factor here is that the northwest (Washington) is generally west of
      the northeast (New Hampshire), but in terms of latitude, Washington is slightly
      south or at a similar latitude to New Hampshire.
