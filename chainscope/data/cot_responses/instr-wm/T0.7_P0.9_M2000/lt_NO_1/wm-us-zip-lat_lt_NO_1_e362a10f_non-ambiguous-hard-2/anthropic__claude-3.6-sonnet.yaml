      - 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - 46013 is in Indiana (IN)


      2) Let me recall the general geography:

      - Wisconsin is north of Indiana

      - Wisconsin borders the northern part of Illinois

      - Indiana is south of Illinois


      3) Looking at zip code patterns:

      - Wisconsin zip codes start with 53-54

      - Indiana zip codes start with 46-47

      - However, within each state, zip codes don''t necessarily follow strict north-south
      patterns


      4) Given that these zip codes are in different states, the state locations are
      more relevant than the specific zip codes within each state.


      5) Since Wisconsin is definitively north of Indiana, and these zip codes are
      within their respective states...


      NO - 54143, WI is NOT located south of 46013, IN. It is located north of it.'

      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - 36869 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 33025 is in Florida (FL)


      2) Generally, in US zip codes:

      - Lower numbers in the first 3 digits indicate more northern locations

      - 368xx is in southern Alabama

      - 330xx is in southern Florida


      3) Looking at a map:

      - Florida is south of Alabama

      - Any point in Alabama will be north of southern Florida

      - 33025 is in Hollywood, FL (near Miami in south Florida)

      - 36869 is in Fort Mitchell, AL (near Columbus, GA)


      4) Therefore, since 36869 is in Alabama, and 33025 is in south Florida, the
      Alabama zip code must be north of the Florida zip code.

      - 36869 is in Alabama (AL)

      2) Let me recall US geography:

      - Alabama is located directly north of Florida

      - Florida is the southernmost state of the continental US


      3) Looking at the zip code numbers:

      - Alabama zip codes start with 35-36

      - Florida zip codes start with 32-34

      - However, zip code numbers don''t directly correlate with latitude in a way
      that would help determine north/south position


      4) Since 36869 is in Alabama, and 33025 is in Florida, and we know Alabama is

      - Therefore, 18210 PA must be north of 27408 NC


      4. Since 18210 PA is NORTH of 27408 NC, it cannot be south of it.

      1. Let me identify the locations:

      - 18210 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 27408 is in North Carolina (NC)


      2. General geography of these states:

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, bordering New York

      - North Carolina is a southern state, located several states south of Pennsylvania


      3. Relative positions:

      - Pennsylvania is definitively north of North Carolina

      - Therefore, any location in PA will be north of any location in NC


      4. Specific conclusion:

      - Since 18210, PA is in Pennsylvania, and 27408, NC is in North Carolina

      - 18210, PA must be north of 27408, NC

      - Therefore it cannot be south of it
