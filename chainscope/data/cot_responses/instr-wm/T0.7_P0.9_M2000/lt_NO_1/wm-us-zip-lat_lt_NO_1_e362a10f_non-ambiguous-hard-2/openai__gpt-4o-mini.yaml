      south of 92887, CA, we need to analyze the geographical locations of these two
      zip codes.


      1. **Location of 24523, VA**: The zip code 24523 corresponds to the town of
      Altavista in Virginia. Virginia is located on the eastern side of the United
      States.


      2. **Location of 92887, CA**: The zip code 92887 corresponds to the area of
      Yorba Linda in California. California is located on the western side of the
      United States.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Virginia is situated to the east of California.
      Therefore, any location in Virginia, including 24523, would generally be to
      the east of locations in California, including 92887.


      4. **Determining "South"**: Since 24523 is to the east of 92887, it cannot be
      considered south of it. For a location to be south of another, it must be positioned
      at a lower latitude, which is not the case here.
