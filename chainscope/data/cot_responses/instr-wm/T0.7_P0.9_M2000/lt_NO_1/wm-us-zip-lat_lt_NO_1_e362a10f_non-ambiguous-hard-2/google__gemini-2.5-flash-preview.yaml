      coast of the United States. New York is on the east coast of the United States.


      3. **Compare the latitude of the states:** Generally speaking, the contiguous
      US is wider than it is tall. While there are variations within each state, New
      York''s general latitude is south of Washington''s general latitude.


      4. **Consider the specific zip codes:** While specific zip codes can vary within
      a state, the overall north-south positioning of the states is the primary factor.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since Washington is generally north of New York, a zip code
      in Washington is generally north of a zip code in New York.

      \ 97236, OR and 11561, NY.\n2.  \"South\" and \"North\" relate to latitude.\

      \ far south for New York state. The latitude of Merrick is approximately 40.6\xB0\
      \ North.\n6.  Comparing the latitudes: 45.5\xB0 N (Oregon) vs. 40.6\xB0 N (New\
      \ York).\n7.  Since 45.5\xB0 is a higher number than 40.6\xB0, the location\

      from west to east and north to south. The east coast is generally east of the
      west coast.

      4.  **Relate longitude to east/west:** Locations in Oregon will have a more
      westerly longitude (closer to -120 degrees) than locations in New York (closer
      to -74 degrees). East is to the right on a map (increasing longitude), West
      is to the left (decreasing longitude).

      5.  **Relate latitude to north/south:** Locations in New York are generally
      at a higher latitude (closer to 40 degrees North) than locations in Oregon (closer
      to 45 degrees North). However, latitude is not the primary determinant of east/west

      Step 2: Determine the approximate latitude of each location.

      The Bronx, NY is in New York City. New York City is located at approximately
      40.7 degrees North latitude. The Bronx is slightly north of the main island
      of Manhattan, so its latitude will be around 40.8 degrees North.

      Danville, KY is located in central Kentucky. Kentucky is generally south of
      New York. The latitude of Danville, KY is approximately 37.6 degrees North.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      40.8 degrees North (Bronx, NY) is a higher latitude than 37.6 degrees North

      15683 is in Pennsylvania (PA).

      38655 is in Mississippi (MS).


      Step 2: Determine the approximate geographic location of each state within the
      US.

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States.

      Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative latitudes of the two states.

      north) than states in the southeastern US.


      Step 4: Conclude the relative north-south position of the two locations based
      on the state comparison.

      Since Pennsylvania is north of Mississippi, any location in Pennsylvania (like
      15683) will be north of any location in Mississippi (like 38655).

      \ the answer:** Since Iowa (where 51109 is located) is generally south of Pennsylvania\
      \ (where 19362 is located), the statement \"51109, IA is located south of 19362,\
      \ PA\" is true.\n\n9.  **State the final answer:** The answer is YES.\n\nThis\
      \ step-by-step process moves from identifying the core question to understanding\
      \ the locations, comparing them, and finally confirming the answer. The key\
      \ insight here is that the states' general locations are sufficient to answer\
      \ the north-south question, making the specific zip codes within those states\
      \ less critical for this particular comparison.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n\
      *   Iowa is in the Midwest.\n*   Pennsylvania is in the Northeast.\n*   On a\
      \ map, the Midwest is generally south of the Northeast.\n*   Therefore, Iowa\
      \ is generally south of Pennsylvania.\n*   Since 51109 is in Iowa and 19362\
      \ is in Pennsylvania, 51109, IA is south of 19362, PA.\n\nFinal Answer is YES."

      south of 42420, KY.

      2. Zip codes are assigned geographically. Lower zip codes generally start in
      the Northeast and increase as you move west and south.

      3. We need to determine the approximate geographic location of each zip code.

      4. 14204 is a zip code in Buffalo, New York. Buffalo is located in the western
      part of New York State, near the border with Canada. New York is in the northeastern
      United States.

      5. 42420 is a zip code in Henderson, Kentucky. Henderson is located in the northwestern
      part of Kentucky, on the border with Indiana. Kentucky is in the southeastern
      United States.

      6. To determine relative north/south positions, we can consider the states''
      general latitudes. New York is significantly further north than Kentucky.

      7. Therefore, Buffalo, NY (14204) is geographically north of Henderson, KY (42420).

      \ 42.3\xB0 N.\n7.  **Determine which location is further north (higher latitude)\
      \ and which is further south (lower latitude):** 45.5\xB0 N is a higher latitude\
      \ than 42.3\xB0 N. Therefore, Portland, OR (97227) is further north than Watkins\
      \ Glen, NY (14892).\n8.  **Relate the finding back to the original question:**\
      \ The question asks if 97227, OR is *south* of 14892, NY. Since 97227, OR is\
      \ *north* of 14892, NY, the answer is no.\n\n9.  **Formulate the final answer:**\

      Fort Worth, TX is located in northern Texas. Its approximate latitude is around
      32.7 degrees North.


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes to determine which location is further south.
      A lower latitude number indicates a more southern location in the Northern Hemisphere.

      32.7 degrees North (Fort Worth, TX) is less than 35.5 degrees North (Gallup,
      NM).


      Step 5: Conclude whether 87301 (Gallup, NM) is located south of 76148 (Fort
      Worth, TX) based on the latitude comparison. Since Gallup, NM is at a higher

      are shared, with New Mexico being directly to the west of the western part of
      Texas.


      Step 3: Consider the first few digits of the zip codes as broad regional indicators.
      While not a precise latitude or longitude, the first digit of a US zip code
      often indicates a broad geographical area. 87xxx is in the Western US, and 76xxx
      is in the Southwestern US (specifically, Texas).

      will be in the state of New York, and a zip code in North Carolina will be in
      the state of North Carolina.

      5. **Compare the states:** Since New York is north of North Carolina, any location
      within New York will be north of any location within North Carolina.


      Therefore, 11782, NY is located north of 27707, NC.

      \ States. New Jersey is on the right (east) side, and California is on the left\
      \ (west) side.\n\n5.  **Determine North/South Relationship:** When comparing\
      \ locations across the vast expanse of the continental US, the dominant north-south\
      \ relationship is determined by latitude. While there might be slight variations\
      \ within each state, the general latitude range of New Jersey is significantly\

      \ is in southern California (near Los Angeles).\n\n    Even comparing southern\
      \ NJ to southern CA, southern CA is further south in terms of latitude.\n\n\
      7.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Since California is located generally to the\
      \ southwest of New Jersey, and specifically, southern California is significantly\
      \ further south than southern New Jersey, the location in New Jersey (08022)\
      \ is *not* south of the location in California (91502).\n\n8.  **Translate to\

      asks about the relative location of 15137, PA and 94930, CA.

      2.  **Determine the state locations:** Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern
      part of the United States. California (CA) is located on the west coast of the
      United States.

      3.  **Compare general state locations:** The entire state of Pennsylvania is
      located significantly further east and generally further north than the entire
      state of California.

      4.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** Even within these states, 15137 is
      in western PA (near Pittsburgh) and 94930 is in northern CA (near Petaluma).

      5.  **Determine relative latitude:** Pennsylvania is at a higher latitude (further
      north) than California. While California spans a range of latitudes, even northern
      California is generally south of Pennsylvania. To confirm, the approximate latitude
      of Pittsburgh (near 15137) is around 40.4 degrees North. The approximate latitude
      of Petaluma (near 94930) is around 38.2 degrees North.

      6.  **Compare south vs. north:** Since 15137, PA is at a higher latitude (more
      degrees North) than 94930, CA, 15137, PA is located *north* of 94930, CA.

      7.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if 15137, PA is located *south*
      of 94930, CA. Based on the latitude comparison, it is not.

      code: 15137 is in Pennsylvania (PA).

      2.  Identify the state for the second zip code: 94930 is in California (CA).

      3.  Determine the relative geographical positions of Pennsylvania and California
      within the United States. Pennsylvania is on the East Coast, and California
      is on the West Coast.

      4.  Determine which state is generally further south. California extends significantly
      further south than Pennsylvania. Northern California is roughly at the same
      latitude as Pennsylvania, but Southern California extends much further south.
      The specific zip code 94930 is in Novato, Marin County, California, which is
      in Northern California, roughly at the latitude of central Pennsylvania. However,
      the question asks if Pennsylvania is *south* of California.

      5.  Since California is generally located further south than Pennsylvania (especially

      in the northeastern part of the United States. California (CA) is located on
      the west coast of the United States.

      3.  **Consider the north-south orientation:** The question asks if 15137, PA
      is *south* of 94930, CA.

      4.  **Compare latitudes:** While we don''t need precise latitude coordinates,
      we know that generally, the Northeast is further north than Southern California
      (where 94930 is located - it''s Fairfax, Marin County, north of San Francisco,
      which is roughly parallel to or slightly south of much of Pennsylvania). To
      be more precise, Pittsburgh (near 15137) is around 40.4 degrees North latitude.
      Fairfax, CA (94930) is around 38.0 degrees North latitude.

      5.  **Conclusion based on latitude:** Since 40.4 degrees North is further north

      Pennsylvania (PA). 94930 is in California (CA).

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Pennsylvania is in the
      northeastern part of the United States. California is on the west coast of the
      United States.

      3.  **Compare the latitudes:** States on the west coast generally span a wide
      range of latitudes. States in the northeast also span a range. However, the
      US is roughly rectangular, and the western edge is generally further south than
      the eastern edge at equivalent latitudes, but this isn''t precise enough.

      4.  **Use zip code prefixes as a rough geographic indicator:** Lower zip code
      prefixes tend to be in the east, and higher prefixes in the west. 15xxx is in
      the east (Pennsylvania). 94xxx is in the west (California).

      5.  **Consider the overall position of the states:** Pennsylvania is significantly
      east of California. To be south of California, Pennsylvania would need to be
      much further south, potentially even below the US border with Mexico, which
      it clearly is not. Conversely, California is generally *west* of Pennsylvania.

      6.  **Visualize or recall the relative positions:** Pennsylvania is in the northeast/mid-Atlantic
      region. California is on the Pacific coast. Pennsylvania is latitude-wise roughly
      equivalent to or slightly north of central California.

      7.  **Direct Comparison:** Since Pennsylvania is in the northeast and California
      is on the west coast, and generally west coast states are further west than
      eastern states at similar latitudes, Pennsylvania is not south of California.

      2. **Determine the states:** 24523 is in Virginia (VA) and 92887 is in California
      (CA).


      3. **Consider the general location of the states:** Virginia is on the East
      Coast of the US, and California is on the West Coast.


      4. **Consider the relative latitude:** While Virginia and California span a
      range of latitudes, the general position of California is further south than
      the general position of Virginia. However, this is not precise enough.


      5. **Consider the specific zip codes:** Zip codes in the US are assigned based
      on geographic areas. Lower zip codes generally correspond to areas further east
      and north, while higher zip codes generally correspond to areas further west
      and south.


      6. **Compare the zip code ranges:** The first digit of a zip code broadly indicates
      a region of the US. 24523 starts with ''2'', which is in the eastern part of
      the US. 92887 starts with ''9'', which is in the western part of the US. This
      confirms the states'' locations.


      7. **Consider the southern extent of Virginia and the northern extent of the
      zip code area in California:** To definitively answer the "south of" question,
      we need to consider the latitudes of the specific locations represented by these
      zip codes. However, based on the general geographic location of the states and
      the zip code ranges, California is significantly further west and generally
      further south than Virginia.


      8. **Conclusion based on typical geography:** It is highly probable that a location
      in Southern California is south of a location in Virginia.


      9. **Refine with zip code regions:** The ''2'' region for zip codes covers the
      southeastern US. The ''9'' region covers the western US. While the ''9'' region
      extends further north than some parts of the ''2'' region, the specific zip
      code 92887, being in Southern California (near Riverside/Orange County), is
      at a latitude that is almost certainly further south than any location represented
      by the 24523 zip code in Virginia (which is in the southwestern part of the
      state, near Lynchburg).


      10. **Final check:** Looking up the locations of these zip codes confirms that
      24523 is in Hurt, Virginia, and 92887 is in Corona, California. Corona, CA is
      at a significantly lower latitude than Hurt, VA.

      asks about the relative location of Jamestown, North Dakota (58401) and Leonia,
      New Jersey (07640).

      2.  **Determine latitude:** North-south location is determined by latitude.
      We need to know the approximate latitudes of North Dakota and New Jersey.

      3.  **Approximate latitude of North Dakota:** North Dakota is a northern US
      state, roughly around 46-49 degrees North latitude. Jamestown (58401) is in
      central North Dakota, so its latitude is likely in the mid-to-upper 40s North.

      4.  **Approximate latitude of New Jersey:** New Jersey is a mid-Atlantic state,
      roughly around 39-41 degrees North latitude. Leonia (07640) is in northern New
      Jersey, so its latitude is likely in the low 40s North.

      5.  **Compare latitudes:** North Dakota''s latitude (mid-to-upper 40s N) is
      higher than New Jersey''s latitude (low 40s N).

      6.  **Relate latitude to north/south:** Higher North latitude means further
      north. Lower North latitude means further south.

      7.  **Conclusion:** Since North Dakota is at a higher North latitude than New
      Jersey, North Dakota is located north of New Jersey. Therefore, 58401, ND is
      located north of 07640, NJ.


      Therefore, 58401, ND is NOT located south of 07640, NJ.

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing 58401, ND and 07640, NJ.

      2.  **Determine the state locations:** North Dakota (ND) is a state in the upper
      Midwest of the US, bordering Canada. New Jersey (NJ) is a state on the East
      Coast of the US, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.

      3.  **Determine the general latitudinal relationship of the states:** Geographically,
      North Dakota is significantly further north than New Jersey.

      4.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While a specific zip code pinpoints
      a location *within* a state, the state itself gives a strong indication of general
      latitude. Jamestown, ND (58401) is in central North Dakota. Oradell, NJ (07640)
      is in northern New Jersey.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** Since North Dakota is a northern state and New
      Jersey is a more southerly state (relative to ND), a location in North Dakota
      will be further north than a location in New Jersey.

      6.  **Formulate the answer:** The question asks if 58401, ND is located *south*
      of 07640, NJ. Based on the geographical location of the states, 58401, ND is
      located *north* of 07640, NJ.

    c8245f76-2ce6-43cc-be54-828fbb495969: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning to answer
      the question:


      1.  **Identify the first zip code and state:** 15061, PA.

      2.  **Identify the second zip code and state:** 23832, VA.

      3.  **Determine the general location of Pennsylvania (PA):** Pennsylvania is
      in the northeastern United States.

      4.  **Determine the general location of Virginia (VA):** Virginia is in the
      southeastern United States, south of Pennsylvania.

      5.  **Compare the states:** Since Virginia is generally south of Pennsylvania,
      a location in Virginia is likely to be south of a location in Pennsylvania.

      6.  **Consider the zip codes:** While specific locations within states can vary
      in latitude, the zip code prefixes often give a clue about the region within
      the state or a general north-south distribution. Pennsylvania zip codes generally
      start with 15xxx, 16xxx, 17xxx, 18xxx, 19xxx. Virginia zip codes generally start
      with 20xxx, 22xxx, 23xxx, 24xxx. The 23xxx series in Virginia is in the central
      to southeastern part of the state, including areas south of Richmond. The 15xxx
      series in Pennsylvania is in the western part of the state, around Pittsburgh.

      7.  **Synthesize the information:** Pittsburgh (where 15061 is located, specifically
      Irwin, a suburb) is in western PA. The zip code 23832 is in Chester, VA, south
      of Richmond. Given the relative positions of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and
      the general locations within those states corresponding to these zip code prefixes,
      Chester, VA (23832) is significantly south of Irwin, PA (15061).


      Therefore, 15061, PA is located north of 23832, VA.


      The question asks if 15061, PA is located *south* of 23832, VA. Based on the
      reasoning, it is *north*.

      (TX).

      3.  **Visualize or recall the relative geographic positions:** California is
      on the west coast of the United States. Texas is further east and south-central.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** To determine if one is south of the other, we
      need to compare their latitudes. While knowing the exact latitude of the zip
      codes isn''t necessary for this general comparison, we know that California,
      in general, is further north than central/southern Texas. Los Angeles County
      (where 91351 is located) is roughly at the same latitude as parts of northern
      Texas, but significantly north of Houston (where 77007 is located).

      5.  **Confirm the relative positions:** Looking at a map or considering the
      general locations of California and Texas, it''s clear that Texas is generally
      south and east of California. Specifically, Houston (77007) is significantly
      further south than Santa Clarita (91351).

      code.

      - 12009 is in NY (New York).

      - 80465 is in CO (Colorado).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographical location of each state within the
      United States.

      - New York is located in the Northeastern part of the US.

      - Colorado is located in the Western/Mountain West part of the US.


      Step 3: Compare the general latitudinal positions of New York and Colorado.

      - New York''s latitude is generally higher (further north) than Colorado''s
      latitude. Colorado is roughly aligned with the central part of the US latitudinally.


      Step 4: Based on the general locations, infer the relative north-south position
      of zip code 12009 compared to 80465.

      - Since New York is generally north of Colorado, a location in New York is likely
      to be north of a location in Colorado.


      Step 5: Confirm with specific locations or geographical understanding if needed.
      While zip codes can be complex, the general state location provides a strong
      indicator for a YES/NO answer regarding being south or north. New York is clearly
      north of Colorado on a map.


      Step 6: Formulate the answer based on the comparison. 12009, NY is located north
      of 80465, CO. Therefore, it is not located south of 80465, CO.

    986c2830-34c0-4a1b-9947-68d46842a95c: '1.  **Identify the locations:** We are
      comparing 61611, IL and 95110, CA.

      2.  **Determine the state locations:** Illinois (IL) is in the Midwestern United
      States. California (CA) is in the Western United States, specifically on the
      Pacific coast.

      3.  **Estimate relative latitudes:** The Midwest is generally located north
      of the southern states and roughly in the middle latitude range of the continental
      US. California spans a significant range of latitudes, but 95110 is in San Jose,
      which is in Northern California. Northern California is generally at a latitude
      similar to or slightly south of the central Midwest, but significantly west.

      4.  **Consider the question:** The question asks if 61611, IL is *south* of
      95110, CA.

      5.  **Compare latitudes more precisely (optional but confirms):** Peoria, IL
      (where 61611 is located) is around 40.7 degrees North latitude. San Jose, CA
      (where 95110 is located) is around 37.3 degrees North latitude.

      6.  **Draw the conclusion:** A lower North latitude means a location is further
      south. Since 37.3 is less than 40.7, San Jose, CA (95110) is located south of
      Peoria, IL (61611).

      7.  **Answer the question:** Is 61611, IL south of 95110, CA? No, 61611, IL
      is north of 95110, CA.

      by the zip codes.

      61611 is a zip code in Illinois (IL).

      95110 is a zip code in California (CA).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographical location of Illinois within the United
      States. Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the US.


      Step 3: Determine the general geographical location of California within the
      United United States. California is located on the West Coast of the US.


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes of the two states. Illinois is generally located
      at a more northerly latitude than much of California, particularly the area
      around 95110 (San Jose). San Jose, CA is located at approximately 37.3 degrees
      North latitude. Peoria, IL (near 61611) is located at approximately 40.7 degrees
      North latitude.


      Step 5: Determine the relative north-south positions based on latitude. A lower
      latitude indicates a more southerly position. Since San Jose, CA (around 37.3
      degrees N) has a lower latitude than Peoria, IL (around 40.7 degrees N), 95110,
      CA is located south of 61611, IL.


      Step 6: Rephrase the question to match the conclusion: Is 61611, IL located
      south of 95110, CA? This is the opposite of our finding. Since 95110, CA is
      south of 61611, IL, then 61611, IL is located *north* of 95110, CA.

      code.

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL).

      - 95110 is in California (CA).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographical location of each state within the
      United States.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the US, roughly in the central
      part of the country, east of the Mississippi River.

      - California is located on the Pacific coast of the US, in the western part
      of the country.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of the two states. While specific zip code latitudes
      are not needed for this general comparison, the states themselves have distinct
      latitudinal ranges. California is generally further south than Illinois. For
      instance, the southern border of Illinois is around 37 degrees North latitude,
      while the southern border of California is around 32.5 degrees North latitude.
      Northern California extends further north than most of Illinois, but the question
      asks about specific zip codes.


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes of the specific locations within the states, or
      at least the general latitude of areas represented by these zip codes. 61611
      is in Peoria, IL, which is in the central part of Illinois. 95110 is in San
      Jose, CA, which is in Northern California. San Jose is significantly further
      north than the southern parts of California, but it is still generally at a
      lower latitude (further south) than Peoria, IL. Peoria is around 40.7 degrees
      North latitude. San Jose is around 37.3 degrees North latitude.


      Step 5: Determine if 61611 (Peoria, IL) is located south of 95110 (San Jose,
      CA) based on their latitudes. Since 40.7 degrees North (Peoria) is a higher
      latitude number than 37.3 degrees North (San Jose), Peoria is located north
      of San Jose.


      Step 6: Re-read the question: Is 61611, IL located south of 95110, CA? Based

      in southern Florida, and Benson is inland in southern Arizona.

      Step 5: Based on the relative positions of these locations, Marco Island, FL
      is further south than Benson, AZ.


      Final Answer based on reasoning: 85614, AZ (Benson, AZ) is located *north* of
      34145, FL (Marco Island, FL).


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is 85614, AZ located south of 34145,
      FL?" is NO.

      in a meaningful geographic sense. While parts of Florida are south of parts
      of California, that''s not relevant to New Jersey and California. To be south
      of 91602, NJ would need to be significantly further south than the latitude

      2. **Determine the general location of each state:** New Jersey (NJ) is on the
      east coast of the US. California (CA) is on the west coast of the US.

      3. **Consider the relative latitude:** While zip codes don''t directly encode
      precise latitude, generally speaking the east coast is further north than the
      west coast at similar latitudes. However, this is a less reliable way to compare
      locations across the entire continent.

      4. **Consider the relative longitude and the shape of the US:** The US is wider
      than it is tall. California is significantly west of New Jersey.

      5. **Visualize or consider a map:** If you picture a map of the US, New Jersey
      is on the Atlantic coast and California is on the Pacific coast. To go from
      New Jersey to California, you would travel westward across the continent.

      6. **Determine the general north/south position:** New Jersey is located in
      the northeastern part of the US. California is located in the southwestern part
      of the US (though it stretches north).

      7. **Compare the relative north/south positions:** Based on the general locations,

      Midwest region of the United States. California is located on the Pacific West
      Coast.

      4.  **Compare latitudes:** Generally, states on the East Coast and Midwest tend
      to be further north than states on the West Coast at similar longitudes, especially
      when comparing areas like Chicago (in Illinois) to areas in Northern California
      (where 94585 is located - specifically, Rohnert Park, CA, which is north of
      San Francisco). Illinois is significantly east of California. When comparing
      locations across the country, latitude is the primary factor for "north" vs.
      "south". Illinois is at a higher latitude than Northern California.

      5.  **Conclusion:** Since Illinois is located at a higher latitude than Northern
      California, Chicago (where 60625 is located) is north of Rohnert Park (where

      \ if 49445, MI is located south of 25601, WV:\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:**\
      \ The question asks about the relative north/south position of two locations\
      \ based on their zip codes and states.\n\n2.  **Identify the Locations:**\n\
      \    *   Location 1: 49445, MI (Michigan)\n    *   Location 2: 25601, WV (West\
      \ Virginia)\n\n3.  **Determine the Geographic Areas:** We need to know the general\
      \ location of Michigan and West Virginia within the United States.\n    *  \
      \ Michigan is a northern state, part of the Great Lakes region.\n    *   West\
      \ Virginia is an Appalachian state, generally located further south than Michigan.\n\
      \n4.  **Consider Latitude (Implicit in North/South):** North/south position\
      \ is determined by latitude. A location further north has a higher latitude\
      \ (closer to 90\xB0 N), and a location further south has a lower latitude (closer\
      \ to 0\xB0).\n\n5.  **Compare the States Geographically:** Since Michigan is\
      \ generally a more northern state and West Virginia is generally a more southern\
      \ state, any location within Michigan is likely to be north of any location\
      \ within West Virginia.\n\n6.  **Consider the Specific Zip Codes (Refinement\
      \ - though likely unnecessary here):** While zip codes can narrow down the location\
      \ within a state, the difference in the *states* is significant enough that\
      \ the specific zip codes are unlikely to reverse the general north/south relationship.\n\
      \    *   49445 is a zip code in Muskegon, Michigan.\n    *   25601 is a zip\
      \ code in Logan, West Virginia.\n    *   Muskegon, MI is on the western side\

      \ N.\n    *   Logan, WV is in the southern part of West Virginia. Its approximate\
      \ latitude is around 37.8\xB0 N.\n\n7.  **Compare Latitudes:** 43.2\xB0 N is\
      \ a higher latitude than 37.8\xB0 N. A higher latitude means a location is further\

    bec42fca-ed22-40b9-a3ff-2155949b4dee: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing 10973, NY and 72364, AR.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** New York (NY) is a state
      in the northeastern United States. Arkansas (AR) is a state in the southern
      United States.

      3.  **Determine the general geographic relationship between the states:** The
      Southern states are generally located south of the Northeastern states.

      4.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While zip codes within a state can
      vary, the first few digits often broadly correlate with a geographic region
      within the state or region. However, the *state* itself provides the primary
      geographic context.

      5.  **Compare the general locations:** Since Arkansas is south of New York,
      any location in Arkansas will generally be south of any location in New York.

      6.  **Apply to the specific zip codes:** Therefore, 72364, AR is located south
      of 10973, NY.


      Now, answer the question asked: Is 10973, NY located south of 72364, AR?

      significantly south of Pennsylvania.

      4.  **Consider potential edge cases within zip codes:** While zip codes represent
      specific areas, the question asks about the location *of* the zip code (meaning
      the area it represents generally). Given the vast distance between Pennsylvania
      and South Carolina, it is highly improbable that any area within a PA zip code
      would be geographically south of any area within an SC zip code.

      3.  **Compare the latitudes:** Washington is located in the northwestern part
      of the US. New Hampshire is located in the northeastern part of the US. While
      both are in the northern half of the country, New Hampshire is further south
      than Washington based on their relative positions within the US.

      4.  **Confirm relative positions:** Think of the US map. WA is up high on the
      left. NH is up high on the right, but generally lower than WA.


      Therefore, 98229, WA is located *north* of 03303, NH.
