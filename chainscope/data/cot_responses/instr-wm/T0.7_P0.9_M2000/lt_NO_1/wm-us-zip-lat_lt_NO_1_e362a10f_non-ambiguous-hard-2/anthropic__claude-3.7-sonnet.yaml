      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      because of the states'' relative positions.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geography.

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Alabama and Florida.

      - Alabama is located directly north of Florida

      - Florida extends south from Alabama''s southern border


      Step 3: Look at the zip codes.

      - In the US zip code system, generally (though not perfectly), lower numbers
      in the first three digits often indicate more southern locations within a region

      - 359xx (Alabama) vs 328xx (Florida)

      - However, zip codes across different states don''t follow a strict north-south
      pattern


      Step 4: Consider the actual geographic facts.

      - Alabama is positioned north of Florida

      - Any location in Alabama (including 35951) would be north of most locations

      if 35951, AL is south of 32818, FL.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Florida is located south of Alabama. Alabama is directly north of Florida.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip codes.

      - In the US zip code system, the first three digits generally indicate a geographical
      region.

      - 359xx is in Alabama

      - 328xx is in Florida


      Step 4: Make the geographical determination.

      - Since Alabama is north of Florida, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, a location in Alabama (35951) would be north of a location in Florida
      (32818).


      NO, 35951, AL is not south of 32818, FL. It is north of it.'

      south of 32818, FL. Let me think through this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Florida is located south of Alabama. Florida is the southernmost state in
      the continental United States, while Alabama is directly north of Florida.


      Step 3: Consider the zip codes.

      - While specific zip codes can sometimes cross expected geographic patterns,
      the general pattern holds that Alabama locations will be north of Florida locations.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the states'' relative positions.

      - Since 35951 is in Alabama, and 32818 is in Florida, and Alabama is north of
      Florida, the Alabama zip code must be north of the Florida zip code, not south.


      NO'
    c2693ed1-023f-45a6-ada8-38cd68c9c084: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the states for each zip code.

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Alabama and Florida.

      Alabama is located directly north of Florida. Florida forms part of the Gulf
      Coast and extends southward, while Alabama is positioned above Florida''s panhandle.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip codes.

      In the US zip code system, generally (though not perfectly), lower numbers in
      the first three digits often indicate more southern locations within a region.
      Here we have:

      - 359xx for the Alabama location

      - 328xx for the Florida location


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Even though the Alabama zip code has a higher number (35951) than the Florida
      zip code (32818), the geographic reality is that any location in Alabama will
      be north of central Florida locations. Florida extends much further south than
      Alabama, and zip code 32818 is in the Orlando area of central Florida, well
      south of the Alabama border.


      NO, 35951, AL is NOT located south of 32818, FL. It is located north of it.'

      - However, state boundaries are more relevant for north/south positioning in
      this case


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Alabama is located north of Florida, and these zip codes are in their
      respective states, 35951 in Alabama must be north of 32818 in Florida

      - Therefore, 35951, AL cannot be south of 32818, FL

      - North Carolina is located north of Georgia in the United States.

      - Georgia is south of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      - In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers tend to be in the northeastern
      US, while higher numbers tend to be in the southern and western regions.

      - The first digit "2" in 28602 indicates an area in the eastern US (NC)

      - The first digit "3" in 31206 indicates an area further south (GA)


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Georgia is south of North Carolina, and the zip code 31206 is in Georgia

      if 28602, NC is located south of 31206, GA.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 28602 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 31206 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the states.

      - North Carolina is generally north of Georgia in the United States.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in
      the northeastern US, and higher numbers tend to be in the southern and western
      regions.

      - The first digit "2" in 28602 indicates a more northern region than the first
      digit "3" in 31206.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      - Since 28602 is in North Carolina (a more northern state) and has a lower first
      digit in its zip code compared to 31206 in Georgia (a more southern state),
      28602 is located north of 31206, not south of it.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 03079 is a zip code in Salem, New Hampshire (NH)

      - 40108 is a zip code in Ekron, Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New Hampshire is typically located around 42-45 degrees North latitude

      - Kentucky is typically located around 36-39 degrees North latitude


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since New Hampshire is further north than Kentucky, zip code 03079 in NH would
      be north of zip code 40108 in KY

      - "South of" would mean NH is at a lower latitude than KY, which is not the

      - 38655 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the US

      - Mississippi is in the southern part of the US


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Pennsylvania zip codes are generally around 40-42 degrees North latitude

      - Mississippi zip codes are generally around 30-35 degrees North latitude

      - Lower latitude numbers indicate more southern locations


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Pennsylvania is significantly further north than Mississippi in the United
      States, zip code 15683 in PA would be north of zip code 38655 in MS, not south
      of it.

      - 30350 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Virginia and Georgia.

      - Georgia is located in the Southeastern United States

      - Generally, Virginia is north of Georgia


      Step 3: Think about cardinal directions.

      - "South" means lower in latitude

      - For a location in Virginia to be south of a location in Georgia, it would

      - 30350 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Virginia and Georgia in
      the United States.

      - Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, south of Virginia


      Step 3: Since Virginia is north of Georgia in general, a zip code in Virginia
      (24482) would typically be north of a zip code in Georgia (30350).


      Step 4: Even considering potential variations within each state, the entire
      state of Virginia lies north of most of Georgia. The northernmost parts of Georgia
      do not extend above the southernmost parts of Virginia.

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - South Carolina is located north of Florida on the US East Coast.


      Step 3: Check if there could be exceptions based on specific zip codes.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the northeastern
      US and higher numbers are in the southwestern US.

      - The zip code for SC (29404) has a lower number than the FL zip code (34108),

      - 36869 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 33025 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Alabama and Florida.

      Alabama is located north of Florida in the United States. Florida extends southward
      from Alabama.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - Alabama zip codes generally start with 35-36

      - Florida zip codes generally start with 32-34

      - 36869 is in the southern part of Alabama (based on the "36" prefix)

      - 33025 is in the southern part of Florida (based on the "33" prefix)


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Florida extends south of Alabama, and 33025 is in southern Florida, this
      zip code is almost certainly south of any Alabama location, including 36869.


      NO, 36869, AL is NOT located south of 33025, FL. It''s the opposite - 33025,
      FL is south of 36869, AL.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 36869, AL is a zip code in Alabama (AL)

      - 33025, FL is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Understand the geographic relationship between Alabama and Florida.

      - Alabama is located north of Florida

      - Florida extends south of Alabama along the Gulf Coast


      Step 3: Analyze the zip codes'' positions.

      - In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers in the first three digits
      indicate more northern locations within a region

      - 368xx (Alabama) vs 330xx (Florida)

      - However, comparing across different states requires caution as zip code numbering
      systems have regional patterns


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations.

      - 36869 is in the southeastern part of Alabama near the Georgia border

      - 33025 is in southern Florida (Broward County/Hollywood area)

      - Southern Florida is significantly further south than any part of Alabama


      Step 5: Make the determination.

      - Since Alabama is entirely north of southern Florida, and 33025 is in southern
      Florida, zip code 36869 in Alabama must be north of zip code 33025 in Florida.


      NO, 36869, AL is not located south of 33025, FL. It is located north of it.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both zip codes.

      - 36869, AL is a zip code in Alabama (AL)

      - 33025, FL is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Alabama and Florida.

      - Alabama is located north of Florida in the United States

      - Florida extends south of Alabama along the Gulf Coast


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - Zip codes in the US generally follow patterns where lower numbers tend to
      be in the eastern and northern parts of the country

      - 36869 (Alabama) has a higher number than 33025 (Florida)

      - However, the state location is more important than the numeric value of the
      zip code


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      - Since 36869 is in Alabama, and Alabama is north of Florida, this zip code
      must be north of any location in Florida

      - 33025 is in Florida, which is south of Alabama


      Therefore, 36869, AL cannot be south of 33025, FL. It must be north of it because
      Alabama is north of Florida.
