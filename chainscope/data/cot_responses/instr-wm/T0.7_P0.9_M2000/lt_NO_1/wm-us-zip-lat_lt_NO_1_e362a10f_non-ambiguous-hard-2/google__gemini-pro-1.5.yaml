      values than locations further west.

      2. **General locations:** North Carolina is generally east and slightly north
      of Mississippi.

      3. **Latitude is the key:**  Since we''re talking about "south of", latitude
      is what matters.  Even though NC is slightly north of MS overall, a location
      in NC could still be south of a location in MS.

      4. **Look up zip code latitudes:** I don''t have the ability to look up zip
      codes.  I would need to use a resource like an online zip code lookup to determine
      the latitude of each.

      5. **Compare latitudes:** Once the latitudes are found, I would compare them.  If
      27896, NC has a lower latitude than 39350, MS, then it is south of it.


      Since I cannot look up the zip codes, I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer.
