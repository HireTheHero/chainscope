      Based on my knowledge, Experiment is a very small community with a population
      of approximately 3,000-4,000 people.


      Step 3: Ridgebury, CT is not a separate municipality but rather a historic district/neighborhood

      Upon research, Sawgrass is not actually an incorporated city or town in Florida.
      It''s a planned community located in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, which is part
      of St. Johns County. Since it''s not an incorporated municipality, it doesn''t
      have an official population count as a city.

      Since Sawgrass is not an incorporated municipality but rather a community or

      Step 1: I need to find population data for Sawgrass, FL.

      Upon research, I should note that Sawgrass is not actually an incorporated city
      or town in Florida. Sawgrass is a planned community development located in Ponte
      Vedra Beach, Florida. It''s known for its golf courses and the TPC Sawgrass
      golf course, but it''s not a separate municipality with official population
      statistics.


      Step 2: Find population data for Mount Ephraim, NJ.

      Mount Ephraim is an incorporated borough in Camden County, New Jersey. According

      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Since Sawgrass is not an incorporated municipality but rather a development
      within Ponte Vedra Beach, it doesn''t have an official population count as a
      city. As a residential community, its population would be smaller than an incorporated
      borough like Mount Ephraim.


      Based on this reasoning, Sawgrass, FL (not being an actual city but a community

      Mount Ephraim is an incorporated borough in Camden County, New Jersey. It has

      Mount Ephraim is an incorporated borough in Camden County, New Jersey. It has
      a population of approximately 4,600-4,700 residents.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Since Sawgrass isn''t an actual incorporated city or town in Florida with its

      entities. Bluewell is a town or census-designated place in West Virginia, while
      Slippery Rock University is an educational institution in Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: To make a proper population comparison, I should identify what "Slippery
      Rock University, PA" refers to in population terms. This could mean either:

      - The student population of Slippery Rock University

      - The town of Slippery Rock, PA (where the university is located)

      - Bluewell, WV is a small census-designated place with approximately 2,000-2,500
      residents

      - Slippery Rock University has a student enrollment of roughly 8,000-9,000 students

      Califon is a small borough in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. Its population is
      approximately 1,000-1,100 residents.


      Step 2: I need to find the population of McLeansville, NC.

      La Homa is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hidalgo County, Texas.


      Step 2: Identify what University of California-Santa Barbara, CA is.

      University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB) is a university, not a city or
      census-designated place. It''s located in Santa Barbara, California.


      Step 3: Consider the comparison.

      This is comparing a place (La Homa) with an institution (UCSB). For population
      comparisons, we should compare places with places, not places with institutions.


      Step 4: Determine the appropriate comparison.

      The question appears to be comparing La Homa, TX with the UCSB campus area,
      which might be considered a census-designated place called "University of California-Santa
      Barbara, CA" (though this is not a standard designation).

      Since UCSB is not a city but a university, it doesn''t have a population in

      - UCSB itself has a student population of around 25,000-26,000, plus faculty

      Step 2: Identify what University of California-Santa Barbara, CA is.

      This appears to be referring to the University of California-Santa Barbara campus
      or potentially a CDP associated with the university. However, "University of
      California-Santa Barbara" is not itself a city or town - it''s a university
      campus located in the Santa Barbara area.

      According to census data, La Homa, TX has a population of approximately 11,000-12,000

      population count. The university is located in the Santa Barbara area, specifically
      near Goleta and Isla Vista.


      Step 5: Compare the entities.
