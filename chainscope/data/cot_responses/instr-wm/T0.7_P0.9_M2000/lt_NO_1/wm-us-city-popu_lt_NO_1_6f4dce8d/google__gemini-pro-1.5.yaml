      2. **Identify the nature of Paramount-Long Meadow:** Paramount-Long Meadow is
      a census-designated place (CDP), which is a statistical area defined by the

      find population data for Willis, TX, and Bangor Base, WA.


      2. **Bangor Base:** Bangor Base is likely referring to Bangor Trident Base,
      a US Navy base in Kitsap County, Washington.  Military bases don''t usually
      have their own separate population figures; they are part of the county''s population.  Kitsap
      County includes several cities and towns, including Bremerton and Silverdale.


      3. **Willis vs Kitsap County:**  Willis, TX, is an incorporated city with its
      own population data.  We need to compare the population of Willis with the population
      of Kitsap County (since Bangor Base''s population is part of Kitsap County''s).


      4. **Find Population Data:** We can find this data using a reliable source like
      the US Census Bureau.


      5. **Compare:** Once we have the populations, we can determine if Willis is
      less populous.


      According to the US Census Bureau, the population of Willis, TX (2022 estimate)
      is around 8,500. The population of Kitsap County, WA (2022 estimate) is around
      277,000.

      2. **Find the population of Bangor Base, WA:** Bangor Base is actually part
      of  Bangor, Washington, which is the location of a US Naval base (Naval Base
      Kitsap).  It doesn''t have its own separate population figures. The population
      referenced would be for the larger Bangor area.  Searches show Bangor has a
      population considerably smaller than Willis.

      Bangor is much smaller.

      2. **Find the population of Bangor Base, WA:** Bangor Base is a US Navy facility.  Navy
      bases don''t have independent populations in the same way cities do. Their population
      consists of the personnel stationed there.  While finding a precise number is
      difficult, it''s safe to assume it''s smaller than a town of 7,500.


      3. **Compare:**  A town of 7,500 is larger than the likely population of a naval
      base.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

      has a population much larger than Willis.


      3. **Compare the populations:** Even using the highest estimate for Willis,

      2. **Bangor Base clarification:** Bangor Base is likely referring to Naval Base
      Kitsap-Bangor.  It''s important to recognize that a naval base''s population
      isn''t usually reported the same way as a city''s general population.  We might
      find housing capacity or military personnel numbers, but not overall population
      in the same way as a city.


      3. **Willis, TX population:** Willis, TX is a city and will have a readily available
      population figure.


      4. **Comparison:** Since we''re looking for general population comparison, and
      Bangor Base''s population figures likely represent the number of military personnel
      and their families living on base, it''s highly probable that Willis, TX (a
      full city) has a larger population.

      unlikely there''s a significant population difference, but it''s impossible

      2. **Find the population of Yellville, AR:** A search reveals Yellville is a

      3. **Compare the populations:**  Since Stottville is part of Hudson, and we''re

      If Hudson''s population is smaller than Yellville''s, the answer is YES. If

      Hudson, NY has a population of around 6,000. Yellville, AR has a population
      of around 1,200.  Since ~6,000 is greater than ~1,200, the answer is NO.

      figure.  We''d need to use Brecknock Township''s population, which contains
      other communities besides Alleghenyville.  The Census designated place (CDP)
      covering part of the township is called Gouglersville and has a population of
      548 (2020 census). It is unclear if Alleghenyville is included in Gouglersville.

      but likely significantly smaller than the whole township, and even the CDP of
      Gouglersville (part of the township) has a population smaller than Union Bridge,
      it''s highly probable Alleghenyville has fewer people.

      within Elizabeth Township, Lancaster County.  Therefore, it doesn''t have its
      own official population separate from the township.  We can estimate, but precise
      figures are difficult to obtain.


      2. **Find the population of Tubac, AZ:** A search reveals Tubac, AZ has a population
      that can be more readily found.  Estimates suggest it is around 1,000 or slightly
      more.


      3. **Compare the populations:** Since Brickerville doesn''t have its own official
      population, and is part of a larger township, it''s highly likely its population
      is smaller than Tubac''s, which has a population in the thousands.  Even a generous
      estimate for Brickerville would likely be far less than a thousand.

    6e280197-b80c-4b9f-b8e0-517889549700: '1. **Find the population of Fort Leonard
      Wood, MO:**  Fort Leonard Wood is a military installation.  While it has a large
      number of people present, it''s not generally considered a city in population
      counts, and census data usually focuses on the surrounding civilian population.  The
      nearby town of St. Robert is often associated with Fort Leonard Wood.


      2. **Find the population of Grovetown, GA:**  Grovetown, GA is a city. We need

      3. **Compare the populations:**  Compare the population of Grovetown, GA to
      the relevant population figure for Fort Leonard Wood (likely the surrounding
      area, not the military personnel on base).


      Since the question asks about city populations, we should compare Grovetown''s
      population to the nearby town of St. Robert, MO.  According to the 2020 census,
      Grovetown''s population was approximately 15,577.  St. Robert''s population
      was approximately 6,460.


      Therefore, Fort Leonard Wood (represented by St. Robert) is less populous than
      Grovetown, GA.

      '
    c5ade3ff-82a8-4a45-ac9d-4d5cea4f048c: '1. **Find the population of Fort Leonard
      Wood, MO:**  Fort Leonard Wood is a military installation.  While it has a sizable
      population of soldiers and their families, it''s not typically considered a
      city in the same way Grovetown is and its population isn''t usually counted
      in civilian city population data.  Instead, it''s part of the larger Pulaski
      County.


      2. **Find the population of Grovetown, GA:** Grovetown is a civilian city and
      will have a population figure readily available through census data.  It''s
      likely to be a reasonably small city.


      3. **Compare populations:**  Since we are looking for city population comparisons,
      and Fort Leonard Wood is not a city in the traditional sense, its "population"
      (the people living on base) is not relevant to the comparison.  Grovetown, as
      a city, *will* have an official population number.  Thus, any population associated
      with Fort Leonard Wood will be irrelevant.


      4. **Conclusion:**  Even if Fort Leonard Wood has more people living on base
      than live in Grovetown, the question asks about city populations.  Therefore,
      Grovetown, as an incorporated city, will have a population number while Fort
      Leonard Wood, for these purposes, effectively does not.


      **Answer:** YES

      '
    e743c53f-10a4-4b8c-84f2-02f2066e905c: '1. **Fort Leonard Wood''s population:**
      Fort Leonard Wood is a military installation.  While many people live and work
      there, it''s not generally considered a city in the same way Grovetown is and
      its population figures usually refer to military personnel.  We need to look
      at the surrounding area or census-designated place if we want to compare civilian
      populations.  The nearby town of St. Robert, MO, is often associated with Fort
      Leonard Wood.


      2. **Grovetown''s population:** Grovetown, GA is a city with its own incorporated
      government and civilian population.  We can readily find population figures
      for it.


      3. **Comparing populations:**  To make a fair comparison, we should compare
      Grovetown''s population to that of St. Robert, MO.  According to census data,
      St. Robert has a larger population than Grovetown.


      4. **Answering the question:**  Since the question specifically asks about Fort
      Leonard Wood and not St. Robert, and Fort Leonard Wood''s population figures
      primarily reflect military personnel and not a civilian population like Grovetown,
      a direct comparison is problematic. However, if the intent is to compare the
      population of the communities, then the nearby town of St. Robert should be
      used.  Since St. Robert has a larger population than Grovetown, the answer concerning
      Fort Leonard Wood (by proxy of St. Robert) is NO.

    e850618b-d93f-463b-8dca-9fdfca9cf8da: '1. **Find the population of Fort Leonard
      Wood, MO:**  Fort Leonard Wood is a military installation.  While it has a large
      number of people present on base,  census data generally reflects the *civilian*
      population residing within the defined boundaries of a place. The civilian population
      of Fort Leonard Wood itself is very small.


      2. **Find the population of Grovetown, GA:**  Grovetown is a city in Georgia
      with a civilian population that can be found through census data.  It''s likely
      significantly larger than the civilian population of Fort Leonard Wood.


      3. **Compare the populations:** Given the nature of Fort Leonard Wood as a military
      base, its civilian population is almost certainly smaller than Grovetown, GA''s
      population.

      of Slippery Rock University, PA.


      2. **Understanding the entities:**  Bluewell, WV is a town. Slippery Rock University
      is a university.  We''re comparing a town''s population to a university''s *student*
      population (presumably, not the total population including staff, faculty, etc).

      in Pennsylvania.  Essentially, we''re comparing a town''s population to a university''s
      population.


      2. **Finding the populations:** We need population data for both.  A web search
      will be necessary.


      3. **Comparing the populations:** Once we have the numbers, we can determine
      which is larger.


      *Preliminary research shows Bluewell, WV is an unincorporated community within
      the city of Bluefield, WV, making a precise population difficult to isolate.  However,
      Slippery Rock University has a student body and faculty/staff population readily
      available online.*  Slippery Rock''s total population is likely smaller than
      the greater Bluefield area.  However, the question specifically references Bluewell
      and not all of Bluefield.


      4. **Consider the definition:**  Bluewell is a small community, likely much
      smaller than the town of Bluefield as a whole. It is unlikely to have a population
      greater than a university.


      *Further searching reveals no official population statistic for Bluewell, WV.*

      population than a university campus.

      not typically compared to a city''s population in standard demographic comparisons.
      Cities encompass a broader range of residents and infrastructure.

      3. **Comparison:** The question asks about population size.  We''re essentially
      comparing a city''s population to a university''s population.


      Since the populations being compared are fundamentally different (city versus
      university community), the comparison is flawed. However, if the question intends
      to ask whether the city of La Homa has fewer residents than the *number of people*
      associated with UC Santa Barbara, then the answer would likely be yes.  Cities
      are generally larger than university populations.  However, without specific
      numbers, a definitive answer is difficult.

      3. **Comparison:** Once we have both populations, we compare them to determine

      La Homa, TX has a population of around 400. UCSB has a student population of

      figure for the area of Lake Norman in Catawba County, we would compare that
      figure to the population of Cascades, VA.


      Since "Lake Norman of Catawba, NC" doesn''t refer to a specific, readily quantifiable
