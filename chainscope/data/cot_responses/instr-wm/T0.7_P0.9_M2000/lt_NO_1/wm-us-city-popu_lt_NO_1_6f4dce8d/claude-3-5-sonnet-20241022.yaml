      * It has a population of approximately 5,000-6,000 people


      2. Next, let me consider Rio Pinar, FL

      * Rio Pinar is a census-designated place in Orange County, Florida

      * It has a population of approximately 5,000 people


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      * Rothschild, WI: ~5,000-6,000
