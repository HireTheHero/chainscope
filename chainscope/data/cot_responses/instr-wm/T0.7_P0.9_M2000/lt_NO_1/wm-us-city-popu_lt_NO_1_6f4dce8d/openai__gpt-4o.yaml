      1. **Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD**: This is a U.S. Army facility and not a traditional
      city or town. It has a limited residential population, primarily consisting
      of military personnel and their families. Its population is relatively small.


      2. **Paramount-Long Meadow, MD**: This is a census-designated place (CDP) in
      Washington County, Maryland. As a CDP, it has a defined residential population
      that is recorded in census data.


      In general, a military installation like Aberdeen Proving Ground typically has
      a smaller residential population compared to a residential area like Paramount-Long
      Meadow, which is designed for civilian habitation.

      Next, we consider the population sizes:


      - Aberdeen Proving Ground, being a military installation, has a relatively small
      permanent population compared to typical civilian towns or cities. The population
      is primarily comprised of military personnel and their families, along with
      civilian workers.


      - Paramount-Long Meadow, as a residential area, has a civilian population recorded
      in census data, which is typically larger than the number of people residing
      on a military base like Aberdeen Proving Ground.


      Given these considerations, Aberdeen Proving Ground likely has a smaller population

      than Bangor Base, WA, we need to compare the populations of the two locations.


      Step 1: Determine the population of Willis, TX.

      - Willis is a small city in Texas. According to the latest estimates from the
      U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Willis is in the range of a few thousand
      residents.


      Step 2: Determine the population of Bangor Base, WA.

      - Bangor Base refers to Naval Base Kitsap at Bangor, which is a military installation.
      It is not a traditional city with a civilian population, but it does have a
      significant number of military personnel and their families residing there.
      However, specific population numbers might not be readily available in the same
      way they are for cities, as it''s primarily a military base.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      - While precise numbers might be challenging to obtain for Bangor Base without
      specific military data, traditional city data suggests Willis, TX has a small
      population. Typically, military bases like Bangor Base have a fluctuating population
      that can sometimes exceed that of small towns or cities.


      Conclusion:

      - In general, it is likely that Willis, TX is less populous than the total number
      of residents and personnel at Bangor Base, WA.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
    d1da48e9-00d9-44c2-82f7-158a8f255ce3: 'To determine if Willis, TX is less populous

      1. **Willis, TX**: Willis is a small city in Montgomery County, Texas. According

      2. **Bangor Base, WA**: Bangor Base is a part of the Naval Base Kitsap in Washington
      and is not a city but rather a military installation. It does have a residential
      population, primarily of military personnel and their families, but it is not
      typically listed with civilian city populations.


      Given these considerations, we must compare the population figures. Based on
      available data:

      - Willis, TX has a defined and relatively small civilian population.

      - Bangor Base, WA, being a military base, will have a fluctuating and less formally
      recognized civilian population size.


      Therefore, the comparison is not straightforward because Bangor Base is not
      a city with typical census data available. However, generally speaking, Willis,
      TX is likely to have a larger population than the residential component of a
      military base like Bangor Base.

      populous than Ridgebury, CT, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Experiment, GA**: Experiment is an unincorporated community and
      census-designated place (CDP) in Spalding County, Georgia. As an unincorporated
      area, its population data is available from census sources.


      2. **Identify Ridgebury, CT**: Ridgebury is not an incorporated city or town.
      It is a section of the town of Ridgefield in Connecticut. Ridgefield is a town
      with its own population data, but Ridgebury itself does not have separate population
      statistics as it is not a CDP or incorporated entity.


      3. **Population Data Comparison**: Since Ridgebury is not a separate entity
      for census purposes, we cannot directly compare its population to Experiment,
      GA. However, we can compare Experiment, GA to Ridgefield, CT, the town containing
      Ridgebury.


      4. **Current Population Data**: Based on the latest census data (which would
      need to be verified with the most recent sources for precise numbers), Experiment,
      GA has a population of a few thousand people. Ridgefield, CT, on the other hand,
      is a larger town with a population typically exceeding 20,000 people.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since Experiment, GA is a smaller community compared to the
      town of Ridgefield, CT, it is reasonable to conclude that Experiment, GA is
      less populous than Ridgefield, CT. However, a direct comparison to Ridgebury
      cannot be made due to the lack of specific data.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question, "Is Experiment, GA less
      populous than Ridgebury, CT?" is:


      NO (because Ridgebury, CT does not have distinct population data separate from
      Ridgefield, CT, which is more populous than Experiment, GA).'

      approximately 11,000 to 12,000 people in recent years.


      2. **UCSB Population**: The University of California-Santa Barbara is primarily
      an institution and not a city or census-designated place. However, we can consider
      the student enrollment numbers. UCSB typically has an enrollment of around 25,000
      students, including undergraduate and graduate students, in addition to faculty
      and staff.


      3. **Comparison**: When comparing the population of a city or census-designated
      place to a university''s enrollment, it''s important to note the different contexts.

      is less populous than Talco, TX, we need to compare the populations of these
      two places.


      1. **Atlantic Mine, MI**: Atlantic Mine is an unincorporated community in Houghton
      County, Michigan. As an unincorporated area, it does not have a defined population
      count separate from the surrounding area. However, it is part of a rural region
      with generally low population density.


      2. **Talco, TX**: Talco is a city in Titus County, Texas. According to recent
      population estimates, Talco has a small population, typically in the range of
      a few hundred people (e.g., around 500).


      Given that Atlantic Mine is an unincorporated community and typically smaller
      than incorporated cities, and considering that Talco, TX has a defined population
      of a few hundred residents, it is reasonable to conclude that Atlantic Mine,
      MI is indeed less populous.

      places:


      1. **Atlantic Mine, MI**: This is an unincorporated community in Houghton County,
      Michigan. As it is unincorporated, it does not have an official population count
      like incorporated cities or towns do. However, it is generally considered a

      to the most recent census data available, Talco has a population of a few hundred
      residents.

      small population, it is reasonable to conclude that it is less populous than
      Talco, which, despite being small, is an incorporated town with a recorded population.
