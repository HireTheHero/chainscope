      1. **Balerno**: Balerno is a suburb of Edinburgh, Scotland. It is a relatively
      small suburb with a population that is generally in the range of a few thousand
      residents. As of recent estimates, Balerno has a population of around 5,000
      to 6,000 people.


      2. **Waterford, Queensland**: Waterford is a suburb of Logan City, Queensland,
      Australia. It is part of a larger urban area and is more populous than Balerno.
      As of recent estimates, Waterford has a population of approximately 5,000 to
      10,000 people.


      Given these estimates:


      - Balerno''s population: Approximately 5,000 to 6,000.

      - Waterford''s population: Approximately 5,000 to 10,000.


      Considering these ranges, Waterford, Queensland, is likely more populous than
      Balerno, particularly since Waterford''s population range potentially extends
      to higher numbers.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Balerno less populous than Waterford,
      Queensland?" is:


      **YES**.'

      than Waterford, Queensland, we need to consider the population of each location.


      1. **Balerno**: Balerno is a suburb of Edinburgh, Scotland. It is a relatively
      small community, primarily residential, and typically does not have a large
      population compared to urban areas.


      2. **Waterford, Queensland**: Waterford is a suburb of Logan City in Queensland,
      Australia. Logan City is part of the larger Brisbane metropolitan area and typically
      has suburbs with larger populations compared to small towns or rural communities.


      Based on these general characteristics:


      - Balerno, being a suburb of Edinburgh, likely has a smaller population compared
      to a suburb within a larger metropolitan area in Australia, like Waterford in
      Logan City.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:


      **YES**, Balerno is less populous than Waterford, Queensland.'

      given its location in a rapidly growing area of Australia, it likely has a population
      in the range of several thousand to possibly over ten thousand.


      5. **Comparison**: Generally, suburbs in rapidly developing regions of Australia,
      like Waterford, tend to have larger populations compared to smaller suburbs

      in international databases or resources. However, towns in Azad Kashmir can
      vary widely in population, often ranging from a few thousand to several tens
      of thousands.


      2. **Namsai District**: This district is located in the northeastern Indian
      state of Arunachal Pradesh. As of the latest available data, the population
      of Namsai district is approximately 95,000 people.


      To determine which is less populous, we need an estimate of Mong''s population.
      Given the lack of specific data for Mong, we can assume it is likely a smaller
      town within Azad Kashmir. Generally, towns in Azad Kashmir are often considerably
      smaller in population than the entire district of Namsai.

      Given the variability in estimates, Mateur''s population could be either more
      or less than Hale County''s. For a definitive answer, we would need a specific
      and current population count for both. Based on the information provided, the

      For accuracy, we would typically check the most recent population statistics

      - Lumarzo, being a small municipality in Italy, might have a population in the
      low to mid-thousands.

      - Tourouvre, as a small commune in France, might have a similar population range
      but could likely be slightly larger or smaller.


      Without specific data, it''s challenging to definitively say which is more populous,
      but assuming both are of similar size, it''s plausible that Tourouvre, being
      in France, could be slightly more populous due to France''s generally higher

      of Queens in New York City. As a neighborhood, it does not have an official
      population count like cities do, but it is part of Queens, which is a densely
      populated area.


      2. **Population of Aungban**: Aungban is a town in Myanmar. Exact population
      figures for Aungban are not readily available, but it is known to be smaller
      than major cities in Myanmar.


      3. **Comparative Analysis**: Typically, neighborhoods in urban areas like Queens
      have substantial populations, often in the tens of thousands. Small towns like
      Aungban in Myanmar are likely to have smaller populations, potentially a few
      tens of thousands or less.


      Based on these considerations, it is reasonable to infer that Maspeth, Queens,
      as part of a major urban area, is likely more populous than the small town of
      Aungban.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      a much larger population, but Clifton as a district would not surpass Comacchio''s
      population.


      Considering these points, the answer is:


      YES, Clifton, Bristol is less populous than Comacchio.'
    139b37e0-6bbb-42bc-a640-7c4f22ff6845: 'To determine whether Clifton, Bristol is
      less populous than Comacchio, we need to consider the populations of both places.


      1. **Clifton, Bristol:** Clifton is a district in the city of Bristol, United
      Kingdom. It is known for its historic architecture and the Clifton Suspension
      Bridge. As it is only a district within a larger city, it does not have a separate
      population count from Bristol. Bristol, as a whole, has a population of several
      hundred thousand, but Clifton itself would have a smaller fraction of that total.


      2. **Comacchio:** Comacchio is a small town in the Emilia-Romagna region of
      Italy. It is known for its canals and historic buildings. The population of
      Comacchio is in the range of several thousand people.


      Now, comparing the two:

      - Clifton, being a district of Bristol, likely has a population that can be
      estimated or is available through local data, but it is generally smaller than
      the entire city''s population.

      - Comacchio is an independent town with a population in the thousands.


      Considering these points, it is reasonable to assume that Clifton, as a district,
      might be less populous than the entire town of Comacchio, depending on specific
      population data.


      Ultimately, without exact population figures for Clifton alone, a definitive
      comparison is difficult. However, given that Clifton is just a district, it
      is plausible that it could be less populous than Comacchio.


      Therefore, based on general assumptions and typical population sizes:

      **YES**, Clifton is likely less populous than Comacchio.'

      populous than Zevio, we need to consider the populations of both locations.


      1. **Crofton Park**: Crofton Park is a district in the London Borough of Lewisham,
      England. As part of the greater London area, it is an urban district, but it
      is not a town or city with its own distinct population figure readily available
      in typical data sets. The population of the entire borough of Lewisham is over
      300,000, but Crofton Park itself would have a smaller share of this.


      2. **Zevio**: Zevio is a town in the province of Verona, in the Veneto region
      of Italy. As of the latest available data, Zevio has a population of approximately
      14,000 to 16,000 people.


      Given these considerations, Crofton Park, as a district within a larger urban
      area, doesn''t have a specific population figure that is easily comparable to
      a standalone town like Zevio. However, it is likely that the population of the
      Crofton Park area is smaller than many standalone towns, especially considering
      that it is just a part of a larger borough.
