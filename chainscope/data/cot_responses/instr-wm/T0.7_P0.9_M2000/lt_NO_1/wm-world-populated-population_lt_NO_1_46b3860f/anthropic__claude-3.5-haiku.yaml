      2. Then, I''ll find the population of Namsai district

      Step 1: Researching Mong, Azad Kashmir

      - Mong is a small town/area in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan

      - Detailed population data is not readily available

      - Cannot confidently state its exact population

      - According to the 2011 census, Namsai district has a population of approximately
      47,000


      Step 3: Comparison

      - Without precise population data for Mong, I cannot definitively say whether
      it is less populous than Namsai

      - Given the lack of clear information about Mong''s population, I cannot confidently
      answer YES or NO

      Province.


      2. Uppingham is a small market town in Rutland, England, United Kingdom.


      3. Ghandruk is a rural mountain village with a very small population, likely

      4. Uppingham is a small town, but still has a more substantial population, typically

      4. Then I''ll check the population of Hulu Perak District:

      - This is a rural district with fewer people

      - Population estimates suggest it has around 30,000-40,000 people


      5. Comparing the populations:

      - Cruzeiro do Sul: ~88,376

      - Hulu Perak District: ~30,000-40,000


      6. Conclusion:

      - Cruzeiro do Sul is MORE populous than Hulu Perak District


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

    5101011b-f10e-4a2b-b344-d328f368d9b7: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Faranah Region:

      - Faranah Region is located in Guinea, West Africa

      - It is a relatively rural administrative region


      2. Next, I''ll locate Province of Pontevedra:

      - Pontevedra is a province in Galicia, northwestern Spain


      3. I''ll find population data:

      - Faranah Region (Guinea) has approximately 367,000 people (as of recent estimates)

      - Pontevedra Province (Spain) has approximately 940,000 people (as of recent
      census)


      4. Comparing populations:

      - Faranah Region: ~367,000

      - Pontevedra Province: ~940,000

      - 367,000 is less than 940,000


      5. Answering the specific question: Is Faranah Region less populous than Province
      of Pontevedra?


      YES'
