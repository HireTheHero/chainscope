      - **Gladysdale, Victoria**''s population is not specified, but it''s described
      in terms that suggest it''s a small community, potentially comparable to or
      even smaller than Muenster.

      guess based on the available data would lean towards Gladysdale potentially
      being less populous or at least not significantly more populous than Muenster,

      \   - Without exact numbers, we need to rely on general knowledge about the\

      \   - Typically, small villages in Canada like Muenster might have populations\

      the population of Gladysdale, a locality in Victoria, Australia. As of my last
      update, specific population figures for small localities like Gladysdale might
      not be readily available or could be part of a larger census area. However,
      given its description as a locality, it''s reasonable to infer that it''s a
      small community.


      2. **Find the population of Muenster, Saskatchewan**: Next, we look for the
      population of Muenster, a village in Saskatchewan, Canada. Muenster is known
      to have a small population, but specific numbers can vary. According to the
      2016 Census, the population of Muenster was 430 people.


      3. **Compare the populations**: Without the exact population of Gladysdale,
      we must consider typical population ranges for such localities. However, since
      Gladysdale is described in the context of being compared to Muenster, and given
      that both are small, the question hinges on the relative sizes.


      4. **Conclusion based on available data**: Given the lack of specific data on
      Gladysdale but knowing that Muenster has a population of around 430, if Gladysdale''s
      population is indeed smaller than this number, the answer would be yes. If Gladysdale
      has a significantly larger population, the answer would be no. However, considering
      both are small and without explicit numbers for Gladysdale, we lean on the understanding
      that both are small communities, but Muenster''s known population size gives
      us a basis for comparison.

      of Gladysdale, the safest assumption based on the information provided and the

      1. **Identify Locations**: Gladysdale is a locality in Victoria, Australia,
      and Muenster is a village in Saskatchewan, Canada.


      2. **Population of Gladysdale, Victoria**: As of my last update, specific population
      figures for small localities like Gladysdale can be difficult to find, especially
      if they are not separately reported in census data. However, small localities
      in rural areas typically have very small populations, often less than a few
      hundred residents.


      3. **Population of Muenster, Saskatchewan**: Muenster is known to have a small
      population as well. According to the 2016 Census, the village of Muenster had
      a population of 430 people.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact figures for Gladysdale, it''s challenging to
      make a direct comparison. However, given that Muenster has a population of 430
      and considering that small rural localities can have populations that are significantly
      less than this, it''s plausible that Gladysdale could have a smaller population
      than Muenster. However, without specific data, this is an educated guess based
      on the nature of rural populations.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information and the typical population
      sizes of small rural localities, it''s reasonable to infer that Gladysdale,
      Victoria could indeed be less populous than Muenster, Saskatchewan, but without
      exact population figures for Gladysdale, this conclusion is based on general
      trends rather than specific data.


      Given these considerations, the most informed answer based on available data
      would be: **YES**.'

      Now, comparing the two populations: Varadero has around 20,000-27,000 people,
      and Conception Bay South has around 26,000 people. This means Varadero''s population
      range overlaps with Conception Bay South''s population.


      Since the population range of Varadero (20,000-27,000) includes values both
      lower and higher than the population of Conception Bay South (around 26,000),
      we can conclude that in some cases, Varadero might be less populous, but in
      others, it might be more populous. However, considering the question asks for

      in East Africa.


      2. **Population of Gash-Barka Region**: As of my last update, specific population

    9c054979-6cee-48e1-a629-191fd27b8c0c: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the Gash-Barka Region and
      Central Equatoria. The Gash-Barka Region is located in Eritrea, a country in
      the Horn of Africa. Central Equatoria, on the other hand, is one of the 10 states
      of South Sudan, located in East Africa.


      2. **Population of Gash-Barka Region**: As of my last update, specific population
      figures for the Gash-Barka Region in Eritrea might not be readily available
      due to the scarcity of recent data from Eritrea. However, we can look for general
      population trends or estimates for Eritrea and its regions.


      3. **Population of Central Equatoria**: Similarly, for Central Equatoria in
      South Sudan, population figures can be challenging to find, especially given
      the displacement and conflict in the region. However, South Sudan''s population
      data is sometimes more accessible than Eritrea''s, and we might find estimates
      for its states.


      4. **Comparative Analysis**: Without exact numbers, we must rely on general
      knowledge. Eritrea has a total population of around 3.5 million people, with
      the Gash-Barka Region being one of its most populous regions. South Sudan has
      a population of about 13 million, with Central Equatoria being a significant
      state but not the most populous.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general population sizes of Eritrea and South Sudan,
      and considering that the Gash-Barka Region is a part of Eritrea while Central
      Equatoria is a part of South Sudan, it is reasonable to infer that Central Equatoria,
      being part of a country with a significantly larger population, is likely more
      populous than the Gash-Barka Region.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether the Gash-Barka Region is less
      populous than Central Equatoria would be: **YES**.'

      the population of the Gash-Barka Region in Eritrea with that of Central Equatoria
      in South Sudan.


      1. **Identify the locations**: The Gash-Barka Region is located in Eritrea,
      a country in the Horn of Africa. Central Equatoria is a state in South Sudan,
      a country in East-Central Africa.


      2. **Population of Gash-Barka Region**: As of my last update, specific population
      figures for the Gash-Barka Region are not readily available, but Eritrea as
      a whole has a relatively small population, with estimates suggesting around
      3.5 million people for the entire country. The Gash-Barka Region is one of the
      six regions of Eritrea and is known for its agricultural significance.


      3. **Population of Central Equatoria**: Central Equatoria is one of the 10 states
      of South Sudan. South Sudan has a population of around 13 million people. Central
      Equatoria, being one of the more populous states due to its location around
      the capital city Juba, would likely have a significant portion of the country''s
      population, possibly in the millions.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact figures, we can make an educated guess based
      on the relative sizes of the countries and the significance of the regions.
      Eritrea has a smaller population than South Sudan. Given that Central Equatoria
      is a major state in South Sudan and includes the capital, it likely has a larger
      population than any single region in Eritrea, including Gash-Barka.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether the Gash-Barka Region is less
      populous than Central Equatoria would likely be **YES**. This conclusion is
      drawn from the relative population sizes of Eritrea and South Sudan and the
      significance of Central Equatoria within South Sudan.'
    a4250d4d-afc9-44f6-93c9-18ad98cb48be: 'To answer this question, let''s break it

      1. **Identify the locations**: The Gash-Barka Region is located in Eritrea,
      and Central Equatoria is a state in South Sudan.


      2. **Population of Gash-Barka Region**: According to available data, the Gash-Barka
      Region in Eritrea has a population, but the exact number can vary depending
      on the source and year. Eritrea itself has a relatively small population compared
      to many other countries, with estimates suggesting around 3.5 million people
      in total. The Gash-Barka Region is one of the more populous regions in Eritrea.


      3. **Population of Central Equatoria**: Central Equatoria is one of the states
      in South Sudan. South Sudan has a population of around 13 million people, according
      to recent estimates. Central Equatoria, being one of the ten states, would have
      a portion of this population. It''s known for having a significant population
      due to its strategic location, which includes the capital city Juba.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact numbers, which can fluctuate and depend on
      the source, we can still make an educated guess. South Sudan has roughly 4 times
      the population of Eritrea. Even if the Gash-Barka Region is one of the more
      populous in Eritrea, Central Equatoria, being part of a country with a significantly
      larger population and including the capital, likely has a substantial population.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative sizes of the countries and the significance
      of the regions within those countries, it''s reasonable to conclude that Central
      Equatoria, part of South Sudan, would have a larger population than the Gash-Barka
      Region in Eritrea, given South Sudan''s much larger total population and the
      importance of Central Equatoria within South Sudan.

      1. **Identify the places**: First, I need to understand what Maardis and Vanavasi
      refer to. As of my last update, I don''t have specific information on a place
      named Maardis. However, Vanavasi is known as a panchayat town in the Salem district
      in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.


      2. **Population Data**: To compare the population, I need data on both places.
      Given that I couldn''t identify Maardis as a known location and assuming it
      might be a small or less documented area, it''s challenging to proceed without
      specific population figures for both places.


      3. **Assumptions**: Without specific details on Maardis, if we consider it as
      potentially being a small village or an area that is not well-documented, it
      might be reasonable to assume it could be less populous than a known town like
      Vanavasi, which has some level of administrative recognition and thus likely
      a more significant population.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the assumption that Maardis is not a well-documented
      or large area and considering Vanavasi is a known town, it seems plausible that
      Maardis could be less populous. However, without concrete evidence or population
      figures, this conclusion leans on the lack of information about Maardis rather
      than a direct comparison.


      Given these steps and the lack of concrete data on Maardis, the most informed
      answer I can provide based on the process of reasoning and the information available
      up to my last update is:


      YES'

      the steps:


      1. **Identify the places**: First, we need to identify Maardis and Vanavasi.
      Maardis seems to be a less commonly known location, and without specific context,
      it''s hard to pinpoint. Vanavasi, on the other hand, is known to be a town in
      the Salem district of Tamil Nadu, India.


      2. **Population data**: Next, we need population data for both places. Without
      specific, up-to-date population figures for Maardis and Vanavasi, it''s challenging
      to make a direct comparison. However, we can try to find some information or
      make educated guesses based on available data.


      3. **Comparison**: Assuming we find that Maardis is indeed a smaller or less
      known location compared to Vanavasi, which has a notable presence in Tamil Nadu,
      India, we can make an educated guess about their relative population sizes.


      Given the lack of specific information on Maardis and without knowing its exact
      location or population size, it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer.
      However, since Vanavasi is a known town in India and assuming Maardis might
      be a smaller village or less populated area (given it''s less commonly known),
      one might lean towards the idea that Maardis could be less populous than Vanavasi.


      But, since I don''t have concrete data on Maardis, I must consider the possibility
      that it could be a different scenario altogether. Given the information typically
      available, Vanavasi, being a town, likely has a more substantial population
      than many smaller villages or less known areas.


      Therefore, based on the steps of reasoning and the assumption that Maardis is
      less known and possibly smaller, the answer would lean towards YES, but remember,
      this is with a significant caveat due to the lack of specific information on
      Maardis.

      challenging to proceed. However, assuming they are locations (cities, towns,
      villages) somewhere in the world, we can continue with a hypothetical approach.


      2. **Population Data**: To compare the population of Maardis and Vanavasi, we
      would ideally need the most recent population figures for both places. This
      data is usually available from national census reports, local government websites,
      or international databases like the United Nations.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures for both
      Maardis and Vanavasi, we can directly compare them. If the population of Maardis
      is lower than that of Vanavasi, then Maardis is less populous.

      about Maardis and Vanavasi (such as their countries or regions), it''s impossible
      to make a factual comparison. The names do not immediately correspond to well-known
      global locations, which suggests they might be smaller or less internationally
      recognized places.


      Given the lack of specific information about Maardis and Vanavasi and assuming
      this is a theoretical exercise, the most appropriate approach would be to acknowledge
      that without data, a definitive answer cannot be provided. However, since the
      question demands a YES or NO answer and considering the process of reasoning,
      I must emphasize that:


      - If Maardis and Vanavasi were real places with accessible population data,
      the answer would be based on those figures.

      down into steps:


      1. **Find the population of Caseyville, Illinois**: As of my last update, I
      don''t have the exact current population figures, but according to the 2020
      United States Census, the population of Caseyville, Illinois, is approximately
      4,400.


      2. **Find the population of Samaipata, Bolivia**: Samaipata is a small town
      in Bolivia. The exact population might be harder to find due to variations in
      data sources and updates. However, Samaipata is known for being a small town
      with a population that is significantly less than larger cities in Bolivia.


      3. **Compare the populations**: Without the exact figure for Samaipata, we can
      consider general trends. Small towns, especially those that are tourist destinations
      like Samaipata, often have populations in the range of a few thousand people.
      Given that Caseyville, Illinois, has a population of around 4,400, if Samaipata
      follows the trend of small towns, its population could potentially be less than,
      similar to, or slightly more than that of Caseyville, depending on the source
      and year of the data.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of precise, up-to-date population figures
      for Samaipata and considering that both are small in terms of population, the
      comparison hinges on specific data. However, typically, small towns in Bolivia
      might have populations ranging widely, but for the sake of this question, if
      we consider Samaipata as likely having a population that could be less than
      or comparable to Caseyville, Illinois, based on general trends of small towns,
      the most direct comparison without exact figures would lean towards Samaipata
      potentially being less populous. But, this is speculative without exact numbers.


      Given these considerations and the need for a clear YES or NO answer, and acknowledging
      that without precise, current population figures for both locations the comparison
      involves some speculation:

      1. **Find the population of Caseyville, Illinois**: As of the 2020 census, the
      population of Caseyville, Illinois, is approximately 4,400 people.


      2. **Find the population of Samaipata, Bolivia**: Samaipata is a town in Bolivia
      known for its historic sites, including the El Fuerte ruins. However, specific
      population figures for Samaipata can be challenging to find due to its smaller
      size and less frequent updates. According to some sources, the municipality
      of Samaipata has a population, but for the town itself, the data is less clear.
      For the sake of this comparison, we''ll need to consider that Samaipata''s population,
      as part of the larger municipality, could range widely, but the exact figure
      for the town is not readily available.


      3. **Comparison**: Without a precise figure for Samaipata, direct comparison
      is challenging. However, considering Samaipata is a smaller town within a larger
      municipality and given the general trend of rural versus suburban U.S. populations,
      we might infer that Caseyville, with a known population, could potentially be
      more populous than many smaller Bolivian towns, depending on the source and
      date of the population figures.


      Given these steps and acknowledging the lack of precise data for Samaipata,
      the most accurate answer based on available information would lean towards Caseyville
      likely being more populous than the town of Samaipata itself, assuming Samaipata''s
      population is significantly lower. However, without a clear population figure
      for Samaipata, this is an educated guess.

      2. **Find the population of Samaipata, Bolivia**: Similar to Caseyville, to
      get the most accurate and up-to-date population figures for Samaipata, Bolivia,

      3. **Compare the populations**: Once we have the population figures for both
      Caseyville, Illinois, and Samaipata, Bolivia, we can compare them to determine
      which is less populous.

      knowledge and the understanding that direct comparisons like this often depend
      on the most current data available.

      2020 census, its population was approximately 4,400.

      - Samaipata is a small town in Bolivia, known for its historic and natural attractions.
      The population of Samaipata itself is relatively small, with estimates suggesting
      it''s significantly less than major cities but without precise figures readily
      available, it''s challenging to compare directly.


      Given the information typically available and assuming Samaipata''s population
      might be smaller due to its characterization as a small town in a less densely
      populated area of Bolivia, one might infer that Caseyville, with its specified
      population, could be more populous than Samaipata. However, this inference requires
      confirmation with actual population data for Samaipata.

      1. **Find the population of Caseyville, Illinois**: As of the last available
      census or update, we need the most recent population figure for Caseyville.


      2. **Find the population of Samaipata, Bolivia**: Similarly, we need the population
      figure for Samaipata, Bolivia, from the most recent census or update.


      3. **Compare the two population figures**: Once we have both, we can directly
      compare them to determine which location is more populous.


      Given the nature of the question and without access to real-time data or the
      ability to fetch the latest census data as of my last update, I''ll proceed
      based on general knowledge and available data up to that point.


      - **Caseyville, Illinois**: As of the 2020 census, the population of Caseyville,
      Illinois, was approximately 4,400.


      - **Samaipata, Bolivia**: Samaipata is a small town in Bolivia, known for its
      historic and cultural significance, particularly the Fuerte de Samaipata, a
      UNESCO World Heritage site. The specific population of Samaipata can be harder
      to find, but considering it''s a small town in a rural area of Bolivia, its
      population is likely to be small.


      Without the exact figure for Samaipata and considering the context provided,

      populated region, might have a population that could potentially be smaller

      in Bolivia. As of my last update, specific population figures for Samaipata
      might not be readily available or could vary depending on the source. However,
      Samaipata is known for being a small town, and its population is significantly
      less than larger cities in Bolivia. Let''s proceed with the understanding that
      while exact figures might be hard to find, Samaipata is not a large town.


      3. **Compare the populations**: Given that Caseyville, Illinois has a population

      Given these considerations and the lack of precise data for Samaipata, the question
      requires a bit of speculation. However, if we were to make an educated guess

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Places**: First, we need to identify the places mentioned. Corning,
      California, is a city in the United States. Toton, on the other hand, is less
      straightforward and could refer to different places, but one notable mention
      is Toton, Nottinghamshire, in England, UK.


      2. **Population of Corning, California**: As of the last available census, Corning,
      California, has a population of around 7,663 people (according to the 2020 United
      States Census).


      3. **Population of Toton**: Toton is a suburb in Nottinghamshire, England. The
      exact population of Toton can be tricky to find since it''s part of the larger
      Beeston and Stapleford urban area. However, the population of the Beeston North
      ward, which includes Toton, was approximately 7,360 in the 2011 census. Given
      that Toton is a part of this ward, its population would likely be a portion
      of this number.


      4. **Comparison**: Without the exact population figures for Toton, direct comparison
      is challenging. However, considering that Corning, California, has a population
      of around 7,663 and if we assume Toton''s population is a significant portion
      of the 7,360 people in the Beeston North ward (but likely less than the total
      ward population), it''s plausible that Corning, California, could have a population
      that is not significantly less than Toton''s, depending on the exact numbers.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information and the assumption that
      Toton''s population is a subset of the Beeston North ward''s population, it
      seems possible that Corning, California, might not be significantly less populous
      than Toton, especially if Toton''s population approaches or exceeds half of
      the ward''s total. However, without precise numbers for Toton, this conclusion
      involves some uncertainty.


      Given the steps and the available data, the most informed answer based on the
      assumption that Toton''s population could be a significant portion of the Beeston
      North ward, but without exact numbers, leans towards:


      YES'

      1. **Identify Corning, California**: Corning is a city in Tehama County, California,
      United States. According to the 2020 United States Census, the population of
      Corning, California is approximately 8,244.


      2. **Identify Toton**: Toton is a suburb of Nottingham, England, in the United
      Kingdom. The population of Toton is not as straightforward to find, as specific
      population figures for smaller areas like Toton can vary and might not be readily
      available in all census data. However, for the sake of comparison, we need to
      consider if Toton''s population could be less than Corning''s.


      3. **Population Comparison**: Without the exact population of Toton, we can
      consider the context. Toton is part of the larger Nottingham area, but as a
      distinct suburb, its population is likely smaller than that of the city of Nottingham
      as a whole. However, we''re comparing it to a small city in California, Corning,
      with a population of around 8,244.


      4. **Decision**: Without the exact population of Toton, we must consider if
      it''s plausible for Toton to have a population larger than Corning, California.
      Given that Toton is a suburb and not a major city, it''s reasonable to assume
      that its population could indeed be smaller than that of Corning, California.


      Given these steps and considering the lack of exact data for Toton but understanding
      the context of both places, the answer leans towards "YES" based on the assumption
      that Toton, being a suburb, would likely have a smaller population than a defined
      city like Corning, California.


      YES.'

      Corning, California, is a city in the United States. Toton, on the other hand,
      is not as straightforward. There are a few places with the name Toton, but a
      well-known one is in Nottinghamshire, England.


      2. **Population of Corning, California**: As of my last update, Corning, California,
      has a population of around 7,600 people (according to the 2020 census).


      3. **Population of Toton**: Toton is a suburb of Nottingham and part of the
      Broxtowe borough. The population figures specifically for Toton might not be
      readily available, as it''s part of a larger administrative area. However, the
      Broxtowe borough has a population of over 100,000 people. Without the exact
      population of Toton, it''s difficult to compare directly, but we know it contributes
      to the larger population of the borough.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that Toton is part of a larger area with over 100,000
      people, and assuming Toton itself, even if just a fraction of that total, is
      likely to have more than 7,600 residents (since suburbs often have significant
      populations), we can infer that Corning, California, is likely less populous
      than Toton.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Corning, California, is less populous
      than Toton is: **YES**'
    be9a1609-af0f-48d3-b6cb-d53524379174: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      a series of steps to understand and compare the populations of Corning, California,
      and Toton.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Corning, California,
      and Toton are. Corning is a city in Tehama County, California, USA. Toton could
      refer to a few places, but without more context, it''s reasonable to consider
      Toton, Nottinghamshire, in England, as a potential candidate for comparison.


      2. **Population of Corning, California**: The next step is to find the population
      of Corning, California. According to the 2020 United States Census, the population
      of Corning, California, is approximately 7,663.


      3. **Population of Toton**: For Toton, Nottinghamshire, in England, finding
      an exact population can be challenging without specific data. However, Toton
      is a suburb or area within the borough of Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire. It''s not
      a standalone city or town with its own census data but part of the larger Broxtowe
      district. The population of Broxtowe as a whole is around 113,000 (according
      to the 2011 census), but this includes several areas, not just Toton. Without
      specific figures for Toton, it''s difficult to make a direct comparison.


      4. **Comparison**: Given the lack of specific data on Toton''s population and
      considering it''s a part of a larger district with a significant population,
      we can infer that Toton itself, if it were to be considered a distinct entity
      for this comparison, likely has a population that could be smaller, comparable,
      or possibly larger than Corning, California, depending on its size and boundaries.
      However, without exact numbers for Toton, we must rely on the general understanding
      that suburbs or areas within larger districts can have varying populations.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the available information and the steps taken to understand
      the context, we cannot definitively say whether Corning, California, is less
      populous than Toton without exact population figures for Toton. However, the
      question format demands a YES or NO answer, suggesting we must make an educated
      guess based on typical population sizes of cities versus suburbs or areas within
      districts.


      Given the constraints and the need for a definitive answer, and acknowledging
      the potential for Toton''s population to be smaller, comparable, or larger but
      lacking specific data to confirm, the safest assumption based on typical scenarios
      might lean towards Corning, California, potentially being less populous than
      the broader area Toton could represent, but this is highly speculative without
      exact figures.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'

      urbanization, the answer to whether Penamaluru is less populous than Malanville
      would likely be **NO**. However, please note that this answer is speculative
      without exact population data for both locations.'
    4d5a38c9-2912-49b5-86f9-b6f85be8bb0d: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the population of both Penamaluru and Malanville.


      1. **Identify Penamaluru**: Penamaluru is a mandal in the Krishna district of
      the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. According to the 2011 Census of India, the
      population of Penamaluru mandal was approximately 52,714.


      2. **Identify Malanville**: Malanville is a commune and city located in the
      Alibori Department of Benin. As of the latest available census data (which might
      be from 2013 or another year, depending on the source), Malanville had a population
      of around 64,853 (though this figure might have changed and could require updating
      based on more recent data).


      Given these steps:


      - The population of Penamaluru (as of 2011) is approximately 52,714.

      - The population of Malanville (with possibly outdated figures) is approximately
      64,853.


      Considering these numbers, Penamaluru, with a population of about 52,714, is
      indeed less populous than Malanville, with a population of about 64,853, based
      on the available data.


      The answer is: **YES**'
    6a837c0b-5700-4463-a2bd-735612d71524: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps required:


      1. **Identify Penamaluru and Malanville**: First, we need to know what Penamaluru
      and Malanville are. Penamaluru is a mandal (administrative division) in the
      Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Malanville is a commune and city
      located in the Alibori Department of Benin.


      2. **Determine the Population of Penamaluru**: Next, we need to find out how
      many people live in Penamaluru. According to the 2011 census, Penamaluru mandal
      had a population of approximately 52,340.


      3. **Determine the Population of Malanville**: Then, we need to find the population
      of Malanville. As of my last update, specific population figures for Malanville
      might not be readily available or could vary. However, for the purpose of comparison,
      we need to establish if Malanville''s population is known and if it''s less
      than, equal to, or greater than Penamaluru''s.


      4. **Compare Populations**: Given that specific, up-to-date population figures
      for Malanville are not provided, and assuming the question is based on available
      data, we would ideally compare the known population of Penamaluru (around 52,340)
      with the population of Malanville. If Malanville''s population is less than
      52,340, then Penamaluru is more populous. If Malanville''s population is more
      than 52,340, then Penamaluru is less populous.


      Given the information available and assuming Malanville, being a smaller city
      in Benin, might have a population potentially smaller than that of Penamaluru
      (though exact figures for Malanville are not provided here), the answer could
      lean towards Penamaluru being more populous than Malanville based on typical
      population sizes of similar administrative divisions. However, without the exact
      population of Malanville, this is a reasoned guess rather than a definitive
      answer.


      Based on the typical size and population of cities and administrative divisions
      in their respective countries, and without the specific population of Malanville:


      The answer is: YES'
    6cf80545-be22-4b2b-9f82-c7a21a76346b: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      a few steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify where Penamaluru and
      Malanville are. Penamaluru is a mandal in the Krishna district of the Indian
      state of Andhra Pradesh. Malanville is a commune and city located in the Alibori
      Department of Benin, West Africa.


      2. **Population data**: Next, we need to find population data for both locations.
      As of my last update, specific population figures for these locations might
      not be readily available or could be outdated. However, we can look for general
      population trends or estimates.


      3. **Comparative analysis**: Without exact figures, we can consider the general
      population densities of the regions. Andhra Pradesh in India is known for its
      relatively high population density compared to many parts of Africa, including
      Benin. However, Malanville, being a city, might have a higher population density
      than its surrounding areas.


      4. **Conclusion based on available data**: Given the lack of specific population
      data in the question, we must rely on general knowledge. Indian states like
      Andhra Pradesh tend to have higher population densities compared to many African
      countries, including Benin. However, Penamaluru is a mandal (a subdivision of
      a district), and its population might be smaller compared to a city like Malanville.


      Without exact population figures for Penamaluru and Malanville, it''s challenging
      to give a definitive answer. However, considering the general trend that cities
      tend to be more populous than rural areas or smaller administrative divisions,
      and assuming Malanville has a significant population as a city:

      a series of steps to compare the population of Bayla to that of Belle Glade,
      Florida.


      1. **Identify Bayla**: First, we need to identify what Bayla refers to. Without
      specific context, it''s challenging to determine if Bayla is a city, town, village,
      or another type of location. For the purpose of this exercise, let''s assume
      Bayla could refer to a small town or village, as it''s not a widely recognized
      major city or metropolitan area.


      2. **Population of Bayla**: Without knowing the exact location or type of place
      Bayla is, it''s difficult to determine its population. However, for the sake
      of argument, let''s consider that if Bayla is less known or smaller, its population
      might be relatively low, possibly in the thousands or tens of thousands, depending
      on the country and region it''s in.


      3. **Identify Belle Glade, Florida**: Belle Glade is a city in Palm Beach County,
      Florida, United States. It is known for its agricultural production, particularly
      of sugarcane.


      4. **Population of Belle Glade, Florida**: According to the 2020 United States
      Census, the population of Belle Glade is approximately 18,430.


      5. **Comparison**: Without a specific population figure for Bayla, we can only
      speculate based on the assumption that Bayla is smaller or less known. If Bayla
      indeed refers to a small town, village, or a similar type of settlement, it''s
      plausible that its population could be less than that of Belle Glade, Florida.


      Given these steps and considering that Bayla''s population details are not provided
      and assuming it might be a smaller or less populous place, the answer to whether
      Bayla is less populous than Belle Glade, Florida, would lean towards "yes" based
      on the assumption that Bayla is indeed a smaller settlement. However, without
      concrete data on Bayla, this answer involves a degree of speculation.


      ANSWER: YES'
    4d378971-0ab4-4d38-8c8e-f9d8245f7216: 'To determine if Bayla is less populous
      than Belle Glade, Florida, we need to follow a few steps:


      1. **Identify Bayla**: First, we need to know what or where Bayla is. Without
      specific information, it''s challenging to proceed. However, assuming Bayla
      refers to a city, town, or village, we would need its population data.


      2. **Identify Belle Glade, Florida**: Belle Glade is a city in Palm Beach County,
      Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was approximately
      19,175.


      3. **Compare Populations**: To compare, we need the population of Bayla. Without
      this data, we cannot directly compare. However, assuming we find that Bayla
      is indeed a smaller settlement or if we had its population data, we could proceed
      to compare.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Hypothetical Data**: If Bayla''s population is less
      than 19,175 (the population of Belle Glade, Florida, as of 2020), then Bayla
      is less populous. Without specific data on Bayla, the most accurate approach
      would be to look up its population or acknowledge that the question cannot be
      answered without more information.


      Given the lack of specific information about Bayla''s population in the question
      and assuming Bayla could refer to any number of places with varying populations,
      it''s challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO answer without making assumptions.
      However, for the sake of providing an answer based on the premise that the question
      implies Bayla is a less populous place:


      YES'

      down step by step.


      1. **Identify Bayla and Belle Glade, Florida**: First, we need to identify what
      and where Bayla and Belle Glade, Florida are. Bayla could refer to various places,
      but without a specific context, it''s hard to pinpoint. However, assuming Bayla
      refers to a specific, potentially small location (since it''s being compared
      to a city in Florida), and Belle Glade is a city in Florida, USA.


      2. **Population of Belle Glade, Florida**: As of my last update, Belle Glade,
      Florida, has a population of around 19,175 people, according to the 2020 United
      States Census. This number might have changed slightly since then due to growth
      or other factors, but it gives us a baseline.


      3. **Population of Bayla**: Without a specific location for Bayla, it''s challenging
      to determine its population. However, for the sake of argument, let''s consider
      that if Bayla is less known or smaller, it might indeed have a smaller population
      than a recognized city like Belle Glade.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that we don''t have an exact figure for Bayla but know
      that Belle Glade has a population of nearly 20,000, if Bayla is a small village,
      town, or an even smaller administrative division, it''s plausible that it could
      be less populous than Belle Glade.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without the exact population of Bayla, we can''t definitively
      say yes or no based on real numbers. However, considering the context that Bayla
      might be a smaller or less significant location compared to a city in the United
      States, the question seems to lean towards "yes" under the assumption that Bayla
      is indeed smaller.


      Given these steps and the information available, the answer to whether Bayla
      is less populous than Belle Glade, Florida, would be a tentative **YES**, based
      on the assumption that Bayla refers to a smaller location. However, please note
      that this answer comes with the caveat that we lack specific information about

      than Belle Glade, Florida, let''s break down the steps needed to reason this
      out:


      1. **Identify Bayla**: The first step is to identify what Bayla refers to. Without
      specific context, Bayla could refer to various places around the world, such
      as Bayla, Ethiopia, or other smaller locations. For the sake of this exercise,
      let''s consider Bayla, Ethiopia, as it''s one of the more identifiable locations
      with that name.


      2. **Population of Bayla, Ethiopia**: As of my last update, specific population
      figures for Bayla, Ethiopia, might not be readily available or could be very
      small, given that it''s a smaller town or village. However, without exact numbers,
      we can proceed with the understanding that smaller towns typically have lower
      populations.


      3. **Identify Belle Glade, Florida**: Belle Glade is a city in Palm Beach County,
      Florida, United States. It is known for its agricultural production, particularly
      of sugarcane.


      4. **Population of Belle Glade, Florida**: As of the 2020 United States Census,
      the population of Belle Glade was approximately 19,175 people.


      5. **Comparison**: To compare the populations, we need a specific population
      figure for Bayla. Given that Bayla is likely to be a small town or village,
      if we consider typical population sizes for such areas, they can range widely
      but are often in the hundreds or low thousands.


      6. **Conclusion**: Without an exact population for Bayla but knowing it''s a
      smaller location and comparing it to Belle Glade, Florida, which has a population
      of over 19,000, it''s reasonable to deduce that Bayla would have a significantly
      smaller population than Belle Glade, Florida.

      population, this step involves research or assumptions based on available data.


      3. **Population of Belle Glade, Florida**: We then need to find the population
      of Belle Glade, Florida. According to the 2020 United States Census, the population
      of Belle Glade is approximately 18,889.

      5. **Conclusion**: Given that I don''t have real-time or specific data on Bayla''s
      population, and without knowing the exact population of Bayla, I must rely on
      general knowledge or available data up to my last update. However, since the
      question requires a definitive YES or NO answer and assuming Bayla could refer

      with the comparison based on hypothetical or assumed data.


      Given the lack of specific information on Bayla and considering the necessity
      of a YES or NO answer, I will provide a response based on the assumption that
      Bayla could indeed be less populous than Belle Glade, Florida, depending on
      what Bayla refers to. If Bayla is a small village or town, it''s plausible that

    7895aef9-4fee-4142-b5cd-e68591d3f6a1: 'To answer this question, we need to compare
      the population of Gosen, Niigata (a city in Japan) with the population of Tioga
      County, New York (a county in the United States). Let''s break it down:


      1. **Find the population of Gosen, Niigata**: As of the latest available data
      (which might be from 2020 or slightly earlier), Gosen, Niigata has a population.
      However, without the exact figure, we can''t proceed directly. Gosen is a city,
      and its population is typically smaller than that of a county in the U.S.


      2. **Find the population of Tioga County, New York**: Tioga County, as of the
      2020 United States Census, has a population. Again, without the exact figure,
      we can consider that Tioga County, being a county, encompasses several towns
      and villages, suggesting its population could be larger than a single city like
      Gosen, Niigata.


      3. **Comparison**: Generally, cities in Japan can have significant populations
      due to the country''s high population density. However, a U.S. county often
      includes multiple towns and villages, potentially leading to a larger total
      population compared to a single Japanese city, depending on the specific locations.


      Given these considerations and without the most current or exact population
      figures for both locations, it''s reasonable to hypothesize based on typical
      population sizes:


      - Japanese cities can range widely in population size, but they tend to be densely
      populated.

      - U.S. counties can also vary greatly in population, but they often encompass
      multiple populated areas.


      However, to give a definitive answer, let''s consider some actual population
      data (using approximate numbers for the sake of argument):

      - Gosen, Niigata might have around 50,000 to 60,000 inhabitants (this is a rough
      estimate and may not reflect the current population).

      - Tioga County, New York, as of 2020, had approximately 48,455 inhabitants.


      Based on these rough estimates, Gosen, Niigata could potentially have a slightly
      larger population than Tioga County, New York. But these numbers can fluctuate,
      and the actual populations might differ from these estimates.


      Given this step-by-step reasoning and acknowledging the potential for error

      estimates provided would lean towards "NO", Gosen, Niigata is not less populous

    64b1ac3e-3177-47d8-b646-da85986fd04d: "To answer this question, we need to determine\
      \ the population of both Ejersa Goro and Perc\xE9, Quebec, and then compare\
      \ them.\n\n1. **Identify Ejersa Goro**: Ejersa Goro is known as the birthplace\
      \ of Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. It is a small town in the Oromia\
      \ Region of Ethiopia.\n\n2. **Population of Ejersa Goro**: Specific population\

      To answer this question, we''ll need to break it down into steps to compare
      the population of Masudpur with that of Moseley and Kings Heath (ward).


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where these places are.
      Masudpur could refer to several places, but without more context, it''s hard
      to pinpoint. Moseley and Kings Heath is a ward in Birmingham, England, UK.


      2. **Population of Moseley and Kings Heath**: To compare, we need the population
      of Moseley and Kings Heath ward. According to the 2011 census, the population
      of the Moseley and Kings Heath ward was approximately 25,634.


      3. **Population of Masudpur**: Without a specific Masudpur (as there could be
      multiple places with this name in different countries, particularly in India
      or Pakistan), it''s challenging to determine its population. However, for the
      sake of argument, let''s consider a hypothetical Masudpur. If we were to consider
      a small village or a less populated area, it might have a population less than
      25,634.


      4. **Comparison**: Without the exact population of Masudpur, we cannot definitively
      say whether it is less populous than Moseley and Kings Heath. However, if Masudpur
      refers to a small village or a similarly sized area to other places with that
      name, it''s plausible that it could be less populous.


      Given the lack of specific information about Masudpur and considering the need
      for a definitive YES or NO answer, the most accurate response based on the information
      provided and typical assumptions would be:


      YES'
    28e8c479-93ab-4bcd-910a-8efb179755ae: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify Places**: First, we need to identify the places mentioned - Masudpur,
      Moseley, and Kings Heath (ward). Masudpur could refer to various places, but
      without specific context, it''s challenging to pinpoint. Moseley and Kings Heath
      are areas in Birmingham, England, and when referred to as a ward, it indicates
      a specific electoral division.


      2. **Population Data**: To compare the population, we would ideally need the
      most recent population data for each area. However, without access to real-time
      data or specific sources mentioned in the question, we must rely on general
      knowledge or available statistics up to my last update.


      3. **General Knowledge Application**: Knowing that Moseley and Kings Heath are
      significant areas within Birmingham, a major city in the UK, we can infer they
      have a substantial population. Masudpur, without specific context, could be
      a smaller village or town, possibly in India or another country, given the name.
      If it''s a smaller settlement, it might have a lower population compared to
      urban areas like Moseley and Kings Heath.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact numbers, the comparison relies heavily on the
      nature of these places. A ward in a UK city like Birmingham (Moseley and Kings
      Heath) typically has a population in the tens of thousands. If Masudpur is indeed
      a smaller town or village, its population could be significantly lower.


      Given these steps and the lack of specific data on Masudpur, a general assumption
      based on typical population sizes of similar areas would suggest that Masudpur,
      if it''s a smaller settlement, is indeed less populous than the combined area
      of Moseley and Kings Heath (ward) in Birmingham.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations mentioned.
      Masudpur could refer to several places, but without more context, it''s hard
      to pinpoint exactly which Masudpur is being referred to. Moseley and Kings Heath
      is a ward in Birmingham, England, UK.


      2. **Population Data**: To compare populations, we need data. For Moseley and
      Kings Heath ward, population data can be found through the UK Census or local
      government resources. However, without specific details on Masudpur, it''s challenging
      to find its population data.


      3. **Assumptions**: Given the lack of specific information on Masudpur, let''s
      consider a general approach. If Masudpur refers to a small village or town,
      especially in a less densely populated area, it might have a smaller population
      compared to a ward in a city like Birmingham, which is known for its significant
      population.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact figures, we can make an educated guess based
      on typical population densities. A ward in a city like Birmingham is likely
      to have a substantial population, possibly in the tens of thousands. Small villages
      or less populated areas might have populations in the hundreds or low thousands.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the information typically available and the nature
      of these locations, it''s reasonable to assume that Masudpur, if it''s a smaller,
      less known location, would likely be less populous than Moseley and Kings Heath
      ward in Birmingham.


      Based on this reasoning and without specific population data for Masudpur, the

      in Canada.


      2. **Find population data for Calama, Chile**: According to the latest available
      data, Calama has a population of around 140,000 to 150,000 people.


      3. **Find population data for Barrie, Canada**: As of the last census, Barrie
      has a population of approximately 140,000 people.


      4. **Compare the populations**: Given the population figures, we can see that
      Calama and Barrie have roughly the same population, with Calama possibly being
      slightly more populous depending on the exact numbers used.


      Based on this comparison, the answer to whether Calama, Chile is less populous
      than Barrie is: **NO**.'
    e9978f33-1ceb-4bc6-98c4-e316b838df50: 'To answer this question, we''ll need to
      determine the population of Calama, Chile, and Barrie, and then compare them.


      1. **Identify Calama, Chile**: Calama is a city in the Atacama Desert in northern
      Chile. It''s known for its mining activities, especially copper mining.


      2. **Population of Calama, Chile**: As of my last update, Calama has a population
      of around 140,000 to 150,000 people. Please note that population figures can
      vary slightly depending on the source and the year of the data.


      3. **Identify Barrie**: Barrie is a city located in Ontario, Canada. It''s situated
      on the shores of Lake Simcoe and is part of the Greater Toronto Area.


      4. **Population of Barrie**: The population of Barrie, as of my last update,
      is around 141,000 people. Like with Calama, population figures can vary based
      on the source and year.


      5. **Comparison**: Comparing the two populations, Calama, Chile, with approximately
      140,000 to 150,000 inhabitants, and Barrie with about 141,000 inhabitants, we
      can see that the populations are quite close. However, based on the range provided
      for Calama, it seems that Calama could be slightly more populous than Barrie,
      depending on the exact numbers used.


      Given these steps and considering the possibility that Calama might have a slightly
      higher population or at least a comparable one, the answer to whether Calama,
      Chile, is less populous than Barrie would be:


      NO'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Mong, Azad Kashmir, and Namsai district. Azad
      Kashmir is a region in Pakistan, and Namsai is a district in the Indian state
      of Arunachal Pradesh.


      2. **Population Data**: To compare the population, we need data on both locations.
      However, specific population figures for Mong, Azad Kashmir, and Namsai district
      may not be readily available or up-to-date. But we can look for general population
      trends or estimates.


      3. **Mong, Azad Kashmir Population**: Without specific data, it''s challenging
      to determine the exact population of Mong. However, it''s known that Azad Kashmir
      has a significant population, but specific figures for smaller areas like Mong
      might not be easily accessible.


      4. **Namsai District Population**: Namsai district, being part of Arunachal

      Azad Kashmir and Namsai is a district in India, it''s plausible that Mong, Azad
      Kashmir, could be less populous than the entirety of Namsai district, given
      the typical population distribution in such regions.

    0945dbbc-4d60-4a56-b4c8-ef49bb6b3821: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the places**: Bommidi and Kavaratti are the two places in question.
      Bommidi is a town in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu, India. Kavaratti
      is the capital of the Lakshadweep islands, a union territory of India.


      2. **Population of Bommidi**: As of my last update, specific population figures
      for Bommidi might not be readily available or could vary depending on the source.
      However, it''s a town, which generally implies a smaller population compared
      to cities or major urban centers.


      3. **Population of Kavaratti**: Kavaratti, being the capital of Lakshadweep,
      would likely have a significant population within the context of the islands.
      Lakshadweep has a total population of around 64,000 people (as per the 2011
      census), and Kavaratti, being the capital, would be expected to have a notable
      portion of this population.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact figures, we can make an educated guess based
      on the nature of these places. Bommidi, being a town in a larger state (Tamil
      Nadu), could potentially have a population that varies widely. However, Kavaratti,
      as the capital of a small union territory, likely has a population that, while
      significant for Lakshadweep, is still relatively small in the context of India
      as a whole.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of precise population figures for both places,
      a definitive answer would ideally require up-to-date census data. However, considering
      that Kavaratti is the capital of Lakshadweep and given the general population
      distribution in India, where towns in larger states can have varying populations,
      it''s plausible that Bommidi could have a population that is either larger or
      smaller than Kavaratti''s, depending on the specific numbers.


      Given these considerations and without current, exact population figures, it''s
      challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO answer. However, for the sake
      of providing an answer based on the general nature of the question and acknowledging
      the typical population sizes of towns in larger states versus the capital of
      a small union territory:


      YES'
    16d2d572-13d1-4ef6-98ee-e520bd9d07b0: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Bommidi and Kavaratti are the places in question.
      Bommidi is a town in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu, India. Kavaratti
      is an island and the capital of the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, India.


      2. **Understand the context of population**: To compare the population of these
      two places, we need to consider the latest available census data or other reliable
      sources. As of my last update, specific population figures might not be readily
      available, but we can look at general trends or known population sizes for these
      areas.


      3. **Population of Bommidi**: Bommidi, being a town, would likely have a population
      that could range from a few thousand to tens of thousands, depending on its
      size and the region''s population density.


      4. **Population of Kavaratti**: Kavaratti, being the capital of Lakshadweep,
      would have a population that reflects its role as an administrative center.
      However, given that Lakshadweep is a union territory with a total population
      of less than 65,000 (as per the 2011 census), and it''s spread across several
      islands, the population of Kavaratti itself would be a fraction of this total.


      5. **Comparison**: Without exact figures, we can make an educated guess. Given
      that Bommidi is part of a larger state (Tamil Nadu) with a high population density,
      it''s possible that Bommidi could have a significant population. On the other
      hand, Kavaratti, being part of a smaller union territory with a much lower total
      population, likely has a smaller population.


      Based on these steps, and acknowledging the lack of precise population figures
      in this response, we should consider the general population trends of such areas.
      Typically, towns in densely populated states like Tamil Nadu can have larger
      populations than the capitals of smaller union territories like Lakshadweep,
      given the overall population and density differences.


      Given the above considerations, the answer to whether Bommidi is less populous
      than Kavaratti, without precise numbers but considering general trends, would
      likely be **NO**. This is because Bommidi, being part of a highly populated
      region, might have a larger population compared to Kavaratti, which is in a
      much less populated union territory. However, this answer is speculative without
      exact population figures.'
    187d1201-ad5e-43c3-a13d-ec9c78db4730: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Bommidi and Kavaratti**: First, we need to know what and where
      Bommidi and Kavaratti are. Bommidi is a town in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil
      Nadu, India. Kavaratti is the capital of the Lakshadweep union territory, India.


      2. **Understand Population Context**: Next, we should understand the population
      context of both places. The population of a place like Bommidi, being a town
      in a larger state (Tamil Nadu), might vary but typically could range from a
      few thousand to tens of thousands, depending on its size and economic activities.
      Kavaratti, being the capital of Lakshadweep, which is a union territory consisting
      of islands, might have a smaller population due to its geographical limitations.


      3. **Find Population Figures**: To accurately compare, we would ideally need
      the most recent population figures for both Bommidi and Kavaratti. However,
      without access to real-time data or the most recent census figures directly
      in this interaction, we''ll proceed with general knowledge that might not be
      entirely up-to-date.


      4. **General Knowledge Application**: From general knowledge, we know that Lakshadweep
      is a small group of islands with a total population of around 70,000 people
      according to the 2011 census, and Kavaratti is its capital. Given its size and
      role, Kavaratti''s population is likely a fraction of Lakshadweep''s total.
      Bommidi, being a part of a larger and more populous state (Tamil Nadu), could
      potentially have a population that is comparable or possibly larger than that
      of Kavaratti, depending on its specific size and the region''s population density.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without the exact population
      figures for both places, we must make an educated guess based on the context
      provided. Given that Bommidi is part of a highly populous state and Kavaratti
      is the capital of a sparsely populated union territory, it''s plausible that
      Bommidi could have a comparable or even larger population than Kavaratti, depending
      on the specifics of each location.


      However, since I must provide a YES or NO answer and considering the general
      trend of population distribution in India and the nature of these places (a
      town in a large state vs. the capital of a small union territory), I will lean
      towards the most likely scenario based on typical population distributions in
      such contexts.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      Nadu, India. Kavaratti is the capital of the Lakshadweep union territory, India.


      2. **Population of Bommidi**: Next, we need to find out the population of Bommidi.
      As of my last update, specific population figures for smaller towns like Bommidi
      might not be readily available or could vary, but we can look for general population
      trends or estimates.


      3. **Population of Kavaratti**: Then, we need to determine the population of
      Kavaratti. Kavaratti, being the capital of Lakshadweep, would have a population
      that can be found through official census data or recent estimates. Lakshadweep
      itself has a small population, with Kavaratti being one of its most populous
      islands.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact figures, we can consider the general context.
      Lakshadweep, including Kavaratti, is known for having a relatively small population
      due to its island nature and limited land area. Bommidi, being part of a larger
      state (Tamil Nadu), might have a varying population size but could potentially
      be larger or smaller depending on its urban or rural status and economic factors.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures
      for both places in the question, we must rely on general knowledge. However,
      considering that Kavaratti is the capital of a small union territory (Lakshadweep)
      with a total population of less than 65,000 people as per the 2011 census, and
      Bommidi is a part of Tamil Nadu, one of the more populous states in India, it''s
      plausible that Bommidi could have a larger population than Kavaratti, especially
      if we consider the overall population density and distribution in Tamil Nadu
      versus the limited population of the Lakshadweep islands.


      Based on these steps and general reasoning, the answer to whether Bommidi is
      less populous than Kavaratti would likely be **NO**, considering the context
      and the potential population sizes based on their locations and the general
      population trends in India. However, without exact and current population figures,

    b30a27c5-4005-4316-9c0a-97dbe77ffc78: 'To determine if Bommidi is less populous
      than Kavaratti, we''ll need some information about both places.


      1. **Identify the places**: Bommidi is a town in the Dharmapuri district of
      Tamil Nadu, India. Kavaratti is the capital of the Union Territory of Lakshadweep,
      India.


      2. **Population comparison**: To compare their populations, we need the most
      recent available data. As of my last update, specific population figures for
      both places might not be readily available, but we can look at general trends
      and available data.


      3. **Bommidi''s population**: Bommidi, being a part of Tamil Nadu, would likely
      have a population that can be found in the census data or local government reports.
      Tamil Nadu is a densely populated state, and while Bommidi might not be a large
      city, it''s part of a larger, more populous region.


      4. **Kavaratti''s population**: Kavaratti, as the capital of Lakshadweep, is
      part of a union territory known for its islands and relatively small population
      compared to mainland India. Lakshadweep has a total population of around 70,000

      specifically asks about Bheemunipatnam, not the larger district or urban area
      it''s part of.


      4. **Conclusion**: Without the exact population of Bheemunipatnam and only knowing
      it''s a part of a larger, more populous area, it''s challenging to definitively
      answer the question based on available data. However, if we must make an educated
      guess based on typical sizes of neighborhoods or towns within large cities,
      it''s possible that Bheemunipatnam, being a specific area within Visakhapatnam,
      might have a population that could be smaller than that of Columbus County,
      depending on how its boundaries are defined and how its population is counted.


      Given the information typically available and the nature of the question, the
      most straightforward answer, based on the assumption that Bheemunipatnam''s
      population might be smaller due to it being a part of a larger city, would lean
      towards "YES", Columbus County, North Carolina, could be more populous than
      Bheemunipatnam, but this is speculative without exact numbers for Bheemunipatnam.

      the population of Bagmara Upazila and Butembo.


      Step 1: Identify the locations - Bagmara Upazila is located in Bangladesh, and

      Step 2: Find the population data - As of my knowledge cutoff, Bagmara Upazila
      has a population of around 263,000 people, and Butembo has a population of approximately
      217,000 people (urban area) but the larger territory (Butembo Territory) has
      around 750,000 people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations - Since we are comparing the Upazila (a sub-district)
      of Bagmara directly to Butembo, we should consider the closest comparable figure
      for Butembo, which is likely its urban area or the territory as a whole for
      broader comparison. However, for the purpose of this question, comparing the
      Upazila directly to the city might not fully align, but considering the city''s
      population as a basis for comparison, Butembo''s urban area is less populous
      than Bagmara Upazila.

      1. **Identify the places**: First, we need to identify Lumarzo and Tourouvre.
      Lumarzo is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Genoa in the Italian region
      Liguria. Tourouvre is a commune in the Orne department in the Normandy region
      of northwestern France.


      2. **Population data**: To compare their populations, we need data on the number
      of inhabitants in each location. As of my last update, I don''t have real-time
      access to current population figures, but I can look for the most recent data
      available.


      3. **Lumarzo''s population**: According to available data, Lumarzo has a population
      of around 1,500 inhabitants.


      4. **Tourouvre''s population**: Tourouvre has a population of approximately
      1,500 inhabitants as well, but this number can fluctuate, and it''s essential
      to have the most current data for an accurate comparison.


      5. **Comparison**: Given that both have roughly the same population based on
      available data, the comparison might seem straightforward. However, without
      the most current and precise figures, it''s challenging to definitively say
      one is less populous than the other.


      6. **Conclusion**: Assuming the population figures are close to equal or very

      to consider that they might be comparable in terms of population size. However,
      the question asks for a definitive YES or NO answer regarding whether Lumarzo
      is less populous than Tourouvre.


      Given the information and the need for a clear YES or NO answer, and acknowledging

      - As of my last update, Lumarzo had a population of around 1,500 inhabitants.

      - Tourouvre, being part of the Orne department in France, might have a population
      that could vary, but for the sake of comparison, let''s consider if it''s significantly
      larger or smaller.


      Given the hypothetical nature of this step without exact figures, let''s proceed

      Step 1: Identify the locations - Lumarzo is a comune (municipality) in the Province
      of Genoa in the Italian region Liguria, and Tourouvre is a commune in the Orne
      department in the Normandy region of northwestern France.


      Step 2: Find population data for both locations. As of my last update, I don''t

      population data.


      Step 3: For Lumarzo, the population as of 2007 was approximately 1,600 inhabitants.


      Step 4: For Tourouvre, the population as of 2017 was about 1,900 inhabitants.


      Step 5: Compare the populations. Based on the available data from different

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the places**: Aveley and Gharm are the two places in question.
      Aveley is a town in England, United Kingdom, and Gharm is a town in Tajikistan.


      2. **Find population data for Aveley**: As of my last update, specific population
      figures for Aveley might not be readily available without the most current census
      data. However, Aveley is a small town in the Thurrock unitary authority in England,
      with a population that can be considered relatively small in the context of
      global urban areas.


      3. **Find population data for Gharm**: Gharm, known as Ghafurov in some sources,
      is a district capital in the Sughd Province of Tajikistan. The population of
      Gharm (or Ghafurov) can vary depending on the source, but it is generally considered
      to be relatively small as well, typical of many towns in Tajikistan.


      4. **Compare population sizes**: Without exact figures, it''s challenging to
      make a precise comparison. However, generally speaking, towns in England, even
      smaller ones like Aveley, might have populations ranging from a few thousand
      to tens of thousands. Similarly, towns in Tajikistan, like Gharm, can have varying
      population sizes but might often be smaller due to the country''s overall lower
      population density compared to the UK.


      5. **Make an educated guess**: Given the lack of specific data, one might lean
      towards assuming that Aveley, being part of a more densely populated country
      (the UK), could potentially have a larger or comparable population to Gharm,
      which is in a less densely populated country (Tajikistan). However, without
      exact numbers, this is speculative.


      Given these considerations and the speculative nature of the comparison without
      precise population figures, the most accurate answer based on typical population
      trends in such areas might lean towards "NO", Aveley is not less populous than
      Gharm, but this is highly speculative and could be incorrect without current,
      precise population data.


      **Answer: NO**'
    50e3a0d1-acae-401c-b151-5d03a247c3f5: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      a series of steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify Aveley and Gharm. Aveley
      is a town in England, United Kingdom, and Gharm is a town in the Rasht District
      of Tajikistan.


      2. **Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both places.
      As of my last update, specific population figures might not be readily available,
      but we can look for general population trends or recent estimates.


      3. **Compare Populations**: Once we have the population figures, we can compare
      them to determine if Aveley is less populous than Gharm.


      Given the general nature of this task and without access to real-time data or
      the ability to browse the internet for the most current population figures,
      I''ll rely on general knowledge:


      - Aveley, being a part of England, which is a densely populated country, might
      have a population in the thousands or tens of thousands, given its status as
      a town.

      - Gharm, in Tajikistan, a less densely populated country compared to the UK,
      could potentially have a smaller population, but this depends heavily on the
      specific data.


      Without precise numbers, it''s challenging to make a definitive comparison.
      However, considering the context:


      - England is generally more densely populated than Tajikistan.

      - Towns in England can range widely in population, but they often have more
      residents than similar-sized towns in less densely populated countries.


      Given these considerations and the lack of specific data, making an accurate
      comparison is difficult. However, if we were to generalize based on national
      population densities and the typical size of towns, one might lean towards Aveley
      being more populous than Gharm due to the overall population density differences
      between the UK and Tajikistan. But, this is a broad assumption without concrete
      numbers.


      **Answer**: Given the need for precise data to accurately answer this question
      and the assumptions made, the most informed response based on typical densities
      and town sizes would be **NO**, Aveley is not less populous than Gharm, assuming
      general trends hold. However, please note, this answer carries a level of uncertainty

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Ghandruk and Uppingham**: Ghandruk is a village in Nepal, and
      Uppingham is a town in England, United Kingdom.


      2. **Population of Ghandruk**: Ghandruk is known for being a significant trekking
      destination in the Annapurna range of Nepal. While it''s a notable village,
      its population is relatively small, typical of many rural Nepalese villages.
      The exact population might not be widely documented, but rural villages in Nepal
      usually have populations ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.


      3. **Population of Uppingham**: Uppingham is a small market town in Rutland,
      England. As of the 2011 census, the population of Uppingham was approximately
      4,745 people. This is a small town by UK standards but is significantly larger
      than many rural villages.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that Ghandruk is a rural village in Nepal and Uppingham
      is a small town in England with a known population of nearly 4,750 people, it''s
      reasonable to infer that Uppingham is more populous than Ghandruk, considering
      typical population sizes for such areas.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether Ghandruk is less populous than
      Uppingham is: **YES**.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Ghandruk is a village in Nepal, and Uppingham
      is a town in Rutland, England, UK.


      2. **Find population data for Ghandruk**: As of my last update, specific population
      figures for Ghandruk might not be readily available, but it''s known to be a
      small village in the Annapurna range of Nepal. Villages in such areas typically
      have small populations, often in the range of a few thousand people.


      3. **Find population data for Uppingham**: Uppingham has a population that can
      be found through census data or local government resources. According to the
      2011 census, Uppingham had a population of approximately 4,000 people.


      4. **Compare the populations**: Without exact figures for Ghandruk, we can still
      make an educated guess based on typical village sizes in Nepal''s rural areas
      and the known population of Uppingham. Given that Ghandruk is a small village
      in a rural area of Nepal, it''s reasonable to assume its population could be
      in the same ballpark as Uppingham''s or possibly smaller, but without exact
      numbers, this step requires some assumption.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the assumption that Ghandruk, being a small village,
      might have a population comparable to or smaller than Uppingham''s, and considering
      the lack of precise data for Ghandruk, the most informed answer would lean towards
      Ghandruk potentially being less populous or similarly populated. However, since
      the question requires a definitive YES or NO answer and considering that villages
      in Nepal can vary significantly in size, the safest assumption based on typical
      village sizes would be that Ghandruk is likely less populous than Uppingham,

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in my current database,
      I''ll provide a general approach:


      - **Tando Muhammad Khan District**: As of the 2017 census, the population was

      Tando Muhammad Khan District, with a 2017 population of around 677,098, seems
      to have a lower population than Pathankot district''s 2011 population of about
      683,546. Given that populations generally increase over time, it''s reasonable

      Nala, on the other hand, refers to a place in Nepal. Without more specific information,
      it''s a bit challenging, but we can proceed with the understanding that we are
      comparing a suburban area in Australia with a location in Nepal.


      2. **Population Comparison Basis**: The question revolves around the population
      of these two places. To compare them accurately, we would ideally need the most
      current population figures for both Safety Beach, Victoria, and Nala, Nepal.
      However, given the nature of the question and without access to real-time data
      or specific census figures in this format, we must rely on general knowledge
      and available data up to my last update.


      3. **General Population Trends**: Generally, suburbs in developed countries
      like Australia tend to have a higher population density compared to many rural
      areas in developing countries like Nepal. However, this is a broad generalization
      and not a hard rule.


      4. **Specific Data (Hypothetical)**: Without specific and up-to-date population

      1. **Identify the locations**: Safety Beach is a suburb located on the Mornington
      Peninsula in Victoria, Australia. Nala, on the other hand, seems to be less
      commonly referenced, but for the sake of this question, we will consider it
      as a location in Nepal.


      2. **Understand the context of "less populous"**: This term refers to the population
      size of each location. To compare, we need to consider the number of inhabitants
      in Safety Beach, Victoria, and Nala, Nepal.


      3. **Find population data for Safety Beach, Victoria**: As of my last update,
      specific population figures for Safety Beach might not be readily available
      without current census data. However, it''s known that Safety Beach is a part

      sake of comparison, let''s acknowledge that Safety Beach, being part of a suburban
      area in a developed country, likely has a structured community with a notable
      number of residents.


      4. **Find population data for Nala, Nepal**: Without specific details on Nala,
      Nepal, it''s challenging to determine its exact population. Nepal has both densely
      populated urban areas and very rural, less populated regions. Without current
      census data or more specific information about Nala, it''s difficult to accurately
      assess its population size.


      5. **Make an educated comparison**: Generally, suburban areas in developed countries
      like Australia tend to have more defined and possibly larger populations compared
      to rural or less commonly referenced areas in developing countries like Nepal.
      However, this is a broad generalization and may not apply in every case.


      6. **Conclusion**: Without exact population figures, it''s challenging to definitively
      answer the question. However, considering the general trend that suburban areas
      in developed countries might have more population than rural areas in developing
      countries, one might lean towards Safety Beach, Victoria, being more populous
      than Nala, Nepal. But, this is speculative without concrete data.

      181,451.


      2. **Identify the Population of Suyeong District**: Next, we need to find out

      United States, and Suyeong District is a district in Busan, South Korea.


      2. **Find the population of Vanderburgh County, Indiana**: According to the
      2020 United States Census, the population of Vanderburgh County is approximately
      180,136.


      3. **Find the population of Suyeong District**: As of my last update, Suyeong
      District in Busan, South Korea has a population, but I need the most current
      and accurate figure. Assuming the population figures are available and noting
      that Suyeong is one of the smaller districts in Busan, let''s proceed with the
      understanding that specific population figures might be needed for a precise
      comparison.


      4. **Compare the populations**: Without the exact, up-to-date population figure
      for Suyeong District, we can''t directly compare. However, knowing that many
      districts in large cities like Busan can have populations ranging significantly,
      we need to consider if Vanderburgh County''s population of about 180,000 is
      less than, equal to, or more than Suyeong''s.


      Given the lack of specific, current population data for Suyeong District in

      Yet, without the precise population figure for Suyeong District, this step involves
      acknowledging the need for specific data to make an accurate comparison.

      2. **Find population data for Vanderburgh County, Indiana**: According to the
      2020 United States Census, Vanderburgh County has a population of approximately
      181,451 people.


      3. **Find population data for Suyeong District**: As of my last update, Suyeong
      District in Busan, South Korea, has a population. However, I need the most current
      or specific population figure for Suyeong District to compare accurately. Assuming
      access to the necessary data, let''s proceed with a hypothetical population
      figure for Suyeong District. If we don''t have the exact figure, we can consider
      that Busan is a large city and its districts typically have significant populations.


      4. **Compare the populations**: Without the exact figure for Suyeong District,
      we can still consider the context. Busan is the second-largest city in South
      Korea, with a population of over 3.4 million. If we divide this population by
      its districts (Busan has 15 districts and 1 county), the average population
      per district would be roughly 220,000 to 250,000, not accounting for the varying
      sizes and populations of each district. Given this, Suyeong District, being
      one of the districts, could potentially have a population larger than Vanderburgh
      County''s, depending on its specific population.


      5. **Conclusion based on available data**: Without the precise population of
      Suyeong District, we must rely on general knowledge. Given that districts within
      major cities like Busan tend to have substantial populations, it''s plausible
      that Suyeong District could have a population comparable to or larger than that
      of Vanderburgh County, Indiana.


      However, since I need to give a definitive YES or NO answer and considering
      the steps and the nature of the question, I must decide based on likely population
      comparisons and the understanding that specific district populations can vary
      widely.


      Given these considerations, the answer would lean towards YES, considering the
      potential population size of a district within a large city like Busan compared
      to a county in the United States. However, without the exact population figure

      1. **Identify Population of Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands**: Coral Bay is a
      small town on the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The U.S. Virgin
      Islands have a total population, but specific numbers for Coral Bay can be harder

      5. **Comparison**: Given the information, Coral Bay, being part of a slightly
      larger island community, likely has a population that could be in the hundreds
      or slightly more, while Attunga has a very small population, likely fewer than
      200 residents.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information, it appears that Attunga,
      New South Wales, might have a very small population, potentially comparable
      to or even smaller than Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands. However, without exact
      figures for Coral Bay, it''s challenging to definitively say which is smaller.
      Given the general trend of small village populations and the context provided,
      it seems plausible that Coral Bay could have a population that is not significantly
      smaller than Attunga''s, or it could be smaller, depending on the exact numbers.


      Given the steps and the information available, it seems there might be an inclination
      to say YES, Coral Bay could be less populous, but the lack of precise population
      figures for Coral Bay introduces uncertainty. However, the essence of the question
      and the typical sizes of such locations suggest a lean towards Coral Bay being
      potentially less populous or at least not significantly more populous than Attunga.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'

      Islands, with that of Attunga, New South Wales.


      1. **Identify Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands**: Coral Bay is a bay and a community
      on the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It''s known for its natural
      harbor and is a popular spot for sailing and snorkeling.


      2. **Identify Attunga, New South Wales**: Attunga is a small village in New
      South Wales, Australia. It is located near the city of Tamworth.


      3. **Population of Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands**: The U.S. Virgin Islands
      have a total population, but specific population figures for smaller communities
      like Coral Bay might not be readily available. However, we know that St. John,
      where Coral Bay is located, has a relatively small population compared to the
      other islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The 2020 census reported the population
      of St. John to be approximately 5,364, but this number is for the whole island,

    94225ae9-879a-49e2-9db3-f4a7eb7730d5: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Hardin County, Kentucky, is a county in the United
      States, specifically in the state of Kentucky. Zenica, on the other hand, is
      a city located in Bosnia and Herzegovina.


      2. **Determine the population of Hardin County, Kentucky**: According to the
      2020 United States Census, the population of Hardin County, Kentucky, is approximately
      110,702.


      3. **Determine the population of Zenica**: As of the last available census data
      (which may vary but typically refers to data around 2013 or later), the city
      of Zenica has a population of around 73,751 in the urban area and about 115,493
      in the municipality.


      4. **Compare the populations**: The urban population of Zenica (73,751) is less
      than that of Hardin County, Kentucky (110,702). However, the municipal population
      of Zenica (115,493) is slightly larger than that of Hardin County.


      Given these steps and focusing on the question which asks if Hardin County,
      Kentucky, is less populous than Zenica, we need to clarify which population
      figure for Zenica is being considered. Since the question does not specify,
      we can look at both:


      - If comparing the urban area of Zenica, Hardin County, Kentucky, is more populous.

      - If comparing the municipal area of Zenica, Hardin County, Kentucky, is less
      populous.


      However, the question seems to seek a straightforward comparison without specifying
      the type of area (urban vs. municipal), and typically, when comparing such geographical
      entities, the total or municipal population might be considered for consistency.
      Therefore, considering the municipal population of Zenica for a more direct
      comparison:


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'

      areas.


      2. **Identify Aungban**: Aungban is a town in Shan State, Myanmar (Burma). It
      is relatively small and not as widely known globally as some other towns or

      3. **Population of Maspeth, Queens**: The exact population of Maspeth can be
      difficult to determine because it is a neighborhood within Queens and not a
      separately incorporated city or town. However, according to the 2020 United
      States Census, the population of Queens is approximately 2.405 million. Maspeth
      itself, being a smaller neighborhood, would have a fraction of this population.
      For the sake of comparison, let''s consider that neighborhoods in Queens can

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Maspeth, Queens,
      and Aungban are. Maspeth is a neighborhood in the borough of Queens in New York
      City, USA. Aungban is a town in Shan State, Myanmar (Burma).


      2. **Population of Maspeth, Queens**: The population of Maspeth, Queens, can
      vary depending on the source and the year, but according to the 2020 United
      States Census, the population of Queens as a whole is approximately 2.4 million
      people. Maspeth itself, being a smaller neighborhood within Queens, would have
      a significantly smaller population. For the sake of estimation, let''s consider
      that Maspeth might have a population in the range of tens of thousands, but
      the exact number can vary.


      3. **Population of Aungban**: Finding the exact population of Aungban, a town
      in Shan State, Myanmar, can be challenging due to the availability of up-to-date
      census data. However, towns in Myanmar, especially those outside of major urban
      areas like Yangon or Mandalay, tend to have smaller populations, often in the
      range of thousands to tens of thousands.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact numbers, it''s difficult to make a precise
      comparison. However, considering the urban nature of Maspeth, Queens, being
      part of one of the largest cities in the United States, and Aungban being a
      smaller town in a less densely populated region of Myanmar, one might initially
      assume Maspeth could have a larger or comparable population due to its location
      within New York City.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific population figures for both locations
      and considering the context provided, it''s challenging to definitively say
      which is less populous without current, precise data. However, based on the
      general understanding that neighborhoods in major U.S. cities like New York

      3. **Population of Aungban**: Finding the exact population of Aungban can be
      challenging due to the availability of data. However, Aungban is known to be
      a small town in Shan State, Myanmar. The population of such towns in Myanmar

      City, USA. Aungban is a town in Shan State, Myanmar (Burma).


      2. **Population of Maspeth, Queens**: To compare the populations, we first need
      an estimate of Maspeth''s population. As of my last update, Maspeth, Queens,
      is part of New York City, one of the most populous cities in the world. According
      to the 2020 census data, the population of Queens is approximately 2.4 million,
      but to get the population of Maspeth specifically, we need more detailed data.
      According to the 2010 census, the Maspeth area (which might be defined slightly
      differently depending on the source) has a population of around 30,000 to 40,000
      people. However, this number might have changed since the last census.


      3. **Population of Aungban**: Next, we need to find out the population of Aungban,
      Myanmar. Finding exact population figures for smaller towns in Myanmar can be
      challenging due to the availability of data. However, Aungban is known to be
      a significant town in Shan State, which is one of the largest states in Myanmar
      by area, but it''s not as densely populated as the urban areas like Yangon or
      Mandalay. Without specific data, it''s hard to give an exact figure, but we
      can say that Aungban serves as a township capital and has a certain level of
      infrastructure and population to support its administrative role.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact figures, comparing the populations directly
      is difficult. However, considering that Maspeth is a neighborhood within one
      of the most densely populated cities in the world (New York City), it''s reasonable
      to infer that Maspeth has a significant population, likely in the tens of thousands.
      Aungban, being a town in a less densely populated region of Myanmar, might have
      a smaller population compared to a neighborhood in New York City, but without
      exact figures, this is an assumption.


      Given these considerations and the lack of precise, up-to-date population figures

      census data (which might be from 2020 or before), Maspeth''s population is not
      explicitly stated as a separate entity from Queens, but we can consider Queens''
      total population for context. Queens has approximately 2.4 million people. While
      Maspeth''s specific population isn''t separately listed in many sources, for
      the sake of comparison, let''s assume it has a population in the tens of thousands,

      is known for being a significant marketplace and trading center in the region.


      4. **Population of Aungban**: The population of Aungban is not as widely documented
      as larger cities or towns in more developed countries. However, considering
      it''s a town in a rural area of Myanmar, its population is likely to be significantly
      smaller than that of a neighborhood in New York City. For many towns in similar
      contexts, populations can range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of
      people.


      Given these considerations:


      - Maspeth, being part of New York City, one of the most populous urban areas

      it still contributes to the overall large population of Queens.


      3. **Determine the population of Aungban**: Aungban is a smaller town in Myanmar.
      Without the most current data, it''s challenging to provide an exact figure,

      1. **Identify the locations**: Zihuatanejo de Azueta is a municipality in the
      Mexican state of Guerrero, and Port Louis District is not a commonly recognized
      administrative division but could be confused with Port Louis, which is the
      capital of Mauritius, an island nation in the Indian Ocean.


      2. **Find population data for Zihuatanejo de Azueta**: As of the last available
      census, Zihuatanejo de Azueta has a population of around 104,609 people (data
      might vary depending on the source and year).


      3. **Find population data for Port Louis District or Port Louis**: The population
      of Port Louis, the capital city of Mauritius, was approximately 149,194 as of
      the last census. Mauritius is divided into districts for administrative purposes,
      but population figures are often reported for the city or the whole country
      rather than these districts specifically. Assuming "Port Louis District" refers
      to the urban area or district of Port Louis, its population would be similar
      to or the same as that of the city.


      4. **Compare the populations**: With Zihuatanejo de Azueta having around 104,609
      inhabitants and Port Louis having about 149,194 inhabitants, we can conclude
      that Zihuatanejo de Azueta is indeed less populous than Port Louis.

      Given the lack of precise data for Clifton and considering the general population
      sizes of such areas, it''s reasonable to infer that Clifton might have a population
      comparable to or possibly larger than Comacchio''s, especially if we consider

      \ for the sake of argument, let's consider that the Colombo district has a population\
      \ of over 752,993, and Maharagama, being a notable suburb, would have a substantial\
      \ portion of this, likely in the tens of thousands but less than the total district\
      \ population.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - Without the exact population of Maharagama,\
      \ a direct comparison is challenging. However, given that Riffa has a population\
      \ of over 121,000, if Maharagama's population is significantly lower than this,\
      \ the answer would be NO (Riffa is not less populous). If Maharagama's population\
      \ is higher or comparable, the answer could be YES.\n\nGiven the lack of precise\
      \ data for Maharagama and considering the need for a clear YES or NO answer,\
      \ the most reasonable approach is to look for any available data that might\
      \ suggest the population size of Maharagama. Assuming Maharagama could have\
      \ a population in the range of tens of thousands (which is a reasonable assumption\

      2. **Understand the question context**: The question is asking which location
      is less populous between Gama, Federal District, and Cisarua.


      3. **Find population data**: To answer this question, we need the population
      figures for both locations. However, without current, specific data provided

      4. **Gama, Federal District population**: As of my last update, the population
      of Gama is not specified, but it''s known that the Federal District in Brazil

      with the understanding that we''re comparing a part of the Federal District

      population compared to a typical town in Indonesia.

      specific population figures and relies on general assumptions about urban and

      which serves as the capital district. Cisarua, on the other hand, is a town
      in West Java, Indonesia.


      2. **Population Data**: We need to find the population figures for both locations.
      As of my last update, Gama, Federal District has a population of approximately
      278,000 people. Cisarua has a population, but the exact figure might vary depending

      Given the steps and assuming we have the necessary data:

      - Gama, Federal District: approximately 278,000 people.

      - Without the exact figure for Cisarua, we cannot directly compare. However,

      widely but often are less than or comparable to smaller cities or administrative
      regions in Brazil.


      Given the lack of specific data for Cisarua in this scenario, I would typically
      look for the most recent census or population estimate. However, since the question
      requires a definitive YES or NO answer and assuming the comparison is based
      on available data (which I don''t have access to real-time), I must rely on
      general knowledge.


      If Cisarua''s population is significantly smaller, which is plausible for a
      town compared to a larger administrative region like Gama, Federal District,
      the answer would lean towards NO, Gama is not less populous. But without exact
      figures, this is speculative.


      Based on the information typically available and the nature of Brazilian administrative
      regions versus Indonesian towns, a reasonable assumption might be that Gama,

      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population data, we can compare
      the sizes. Gama, being part of the Federal District of Brazil, might have a
      significant population due to its proximity to Brasilia, the capital city. On
      the other hand, Cisarua, being a smaller town in Indonesia, might have a smaller
      population compared to urban or metropolitan areas in Brazil.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Without exact numbers, we can make

      to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the general understanding
      that areas near capital cities tend to have larger populations than smaller
      towns in other countries, one might lean towards saying that Gama is likely
      more populous than Cisarua. But since the question asks if Gama is "less populous"
      than Cisarua, the logical deduction based on typical population sizes would
      lead to a "NO" answer, assuming Gama has a larger population due to its location
      near Brasilia.

      \ taluk specifically might have around 400,000 to 500,000 people, but this is\

      \ Given the approximate numbers, Loja Province has around 488,000 people, and\
      \ if we estimate Hosdurg taluk to have around 450,000 (a rough estimate for\
      \ the purpose of this comparison), then Loja Province would be slightly more\
      \ populous. However, if the actual number for Hosdurg taluk is closer to or\
      \ exceeds 500,000, then Hosdurg taluk could be more populous.\n\nGiven the estimates\
      \ and acknowledging that these numbers can fluctuate:\n- If Hosdurg taluk has\
      \ less than 488,000 people, then Loja Province is more populous.\n- If Hosdurg\
      \ taluk has more than 488,000 people, then Hosdurg taluk is more populous.\n\
      \nSince the question asks if Loja Province is less populous than Hosdurg taluk,\
      \ and considering the estimates provided:\n- **YES** if Hosdurg taluk's population\
      \ exceeds that of Loja Province.\n- **NO** if Loja Province's population is\
      \ greater or roughly equal.\n\nBased on rough estimates and without the most\
      \ current, precise data, it seems the populations could be comparable, but if\
      \ forced to decide based on potentially outdated estimates, one might lean towards\
      \ saying Loja Province could be slightly more populous than Hosdurg taluk, suggesting\
      \ the answer could be **NO**. However, this answer requires more precise and\
      \ up-to-date population figures to be definitive. Given the nature of the question\
      \ and typical expectations for such queries, I will provide a direct answer\
      \ based on the assumption that more precise data might slightly favor Hosdurg\

      the information needed step by step:


      1. **Identify Loja Province**: Loja Province is located in Ecuador, South America.
      It is one of the 24 provinces of Ecuador.


      2. **Identify Hosdurg taluk**: Hosdurg taluk is a part of Kasaragod district
      in the state of Kerala, India. A taluk is a subdivision of a district in India.


      3. **Population of Loja Province**: As of my last update, the population of
      Loja Province in Ecuador is approximately 488,000 people.


      4. **Population of Hosdurg taluk**: The exact population of Hosdurg taluk can
      vary, but according to the 2011 census, the population of Kasaragod district
      (which includes Hosdurg taluk among other taluks) was about 1,302,600. However,
      to find the specific population of Hosdurg taluk, we need more precise data.
      Assuming Hosdurg taluk''s population is a fraction of the district''s total,
      without the exact figure, it''s hard to directly compare. However, considering
      the total population of the district, if we were to estimate, Hosdurg taluk''s
      population could potentially be less than the entire Loja Province if it constitutes
      a small fraction of the district''s population.


      5. **Comparison**: Without the exact population of Hosdurg taluk, we can''t
      directly compare. However, considering that the entire Kasaragod district has
      a population significantly higher than Loja Province, and Hosdurg taluk is just
      one part of this district, it''s reasonable to infer that Hosdurg taluk''s population
      could be less than that of Loja Province, depending on its size relative to
      the district.


      Based on the available information and the fact that we''re comparing a province
      in Ecuador to a taluk in India, without the precise population of Hosdurg taluk,
      the most reasonable inference based on typical population distributions would
      suggest that Loja Province might indeed be more populous than Hosdurg taluk,
      given the taluk''s status as a subdivision of a larger district. However, without
      exact numbers for Hosdurg taluk, this comparison involves some degree of estimation.

      \ Veneto, located about 90 kilometers west of Venice and about 15 kilometers\
      \ southwest of Verona.\n\n2. **Population Data**:\n   - To compare, we need\
      \ population data for both locations. However, finding the exact population\
      \ can be challenging without specific data. Generally, Crofton Park, being part\
      \ of a larger metropolitan area (London), might be expected to have a significant\

      \ Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Locations**: First, we\
      \ need to identify where Crofton Park and Zevio are. Crofton Park is a suburb\
      \ in South London, England, UK. Zevio, on the other hand, is a comune (municipality)\

      \ Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both locations. As of\
      \ my last update, Crofton Park is part of the London Borough of Lewisham, and\
      \ while specific population figures for Crofton Park alone might be hard to\
      \ find, we can consider the broader context of London's population density and\
      \ size. The London Borough of Lewisham has a significant population, but Crofton\
      \ Park itself is a relatively small area within it.\n\n   Zevio, being a comune,\
      \ has its population data more readily available. As of the last available census,\
      \ Zevio has a population of around 15,000 inhabitants.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis**:\
      \ Given that Crofton Park is a small area within a larger, densely populated\
      \ city (London), and without exact figures for Crofton Park, it's challenging\
      \ to make a direct comparison. However, considering the scale, London's overall\
      \ population is vast, with over 8.9 million inhabitants. Even small areas within\
      \ London can have significant populations due to the city's high density.\n\n\
      \   Without the exact population of Crofton Park, we must consider the context.\
      \ If Crofton Park were significantly less populous than a small Italian comune\
      \ like Zevio, it would be unusual given London's overall population density.\
      \ However, it's also possible for specific areas within large cities to have\
      \ lower population densities or numbers, especially if they are not as built\
      \ up or are more residential.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific\
      \ population data for Crofton Park and considering the typical population densities\
      \ of areas within London, it's reasonable to assume that Crofton Park could\
      \ potentially have a population comparable to or larger than Zevio's, depending\

      \ comparison, the most logical conclusion would lean towards Crofton Park possibly\
      \ having a comparable or larger population than Zevio, given its location within\

      1. **Yonghe District**: This is a district in New Taipei City, Taiwan. As of
      my last update, it has a population of around 238,000 people.


      2. **Governador Island (Ilha do Governador)**: This is the largest island in
      the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and it is part of the Rio de Janeiro municipality.
      The population of Governador Island is not as straightforward to find because
      it''s not commonly referenced separately from the larger municipality or the
      city''s population figures. However, the island is known for being densely populated
      and is home to several neighborhoods. The entire city of Rio de Janeiro has
      a population of over 6.5 million people, but Governador Island itself, while
      significant, does not have a well-documented separate population figure. For
      the sake of comparison, if we consider that Governador Island is home to several
      large neighborhoods and is a significant part of Rio de Janeiro, its population
      could easily be in the hundreds of thousands, potentially exceeding Yonghe District''s
      population.


      Given the information and the reasoning:

      - Yonghe District has a population of around 238,000.

      - Governador Island''s population, while not precisely documented, could be
      in the hundreds of thousands and potentially larger than Yonghe District due
      to its size and the fact that it''s part of a large, densely populated city.


      Based on this analysis, the answer to whether Yonghe District is less populous
      than Governador Island would likely be **YES**, considering the potential scale
      of Governador Island''s population within the context of Rio de Janeiro''s overall
      population and urban density. However, please note that this answer relies on
      an estimate of Governador Island''s population, as specific figures are not
      provided.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Daviess County is located in the state of Kentucky,
      USA. Yuli County, on the other hand, is situated in a different part of the
      world. After research, it appears that Yuli County could refer to a county in
      Qinghai Province, China, or possibly another location, but for the sake of comparison,
      we''ll consider the Chinese context.


      2. **Population of Daviess County, Kentucky**: According to the 2020 United
      States Census, the population of Daviess County, Kentucky, is approximately
      103,801.


      3. **Population of Yuli County, Qinghai, China**: The population data for Yuli
      (or Yushu) County in Qinghai Province, China, may vary, but as of the last available
      census data (which might be from 2010 or other sources), Yuli County in Qinghai
      has a significantly smaller population compared to many counties in the United
      States. For example, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, where Yuli County
      is located, had a population of about 378,439 in 2020, with the prefecture covering
      a large area including multiple counties. The exact population of Yuli County
      itself would be a fraction of this total, likely in the tens of thousands.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that the entire Yushu Prefecture has a population of
      less than 400,000 and considering it encompasses several counties, the population
      of Yuli County alone would be significantly less than that of Daviess County,
      Kentucky, which has over 100,000 people.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis, the answer to whether Daviess County, Kentucky,

      103,312.


      3. **Population of Yuli County, China**: Finding the exact population of Yuli
      County in China requires the most recent census data. As of the last available
      census (which might be from 2020 or slightly earlier), Yuli County has a population,
      but the exact figure can vary. For the sake of comparison, let''s find a general

      1. **Identify Bari, India**: First, we need to identify if Bari is indeed a
      location in India. However, it''s possible that Bari might be confused with
      another city, as Bari is more commonly known as a city in Italy. Assuming there
      might be a less-known Bari in India or considering the possibility of a mix-up,
      let''s proceed with the assumption that we are comparing a Bari in India to
      Bossier City, Louisiana.


      2. **Population of Bari, Italy (for reference)**: The city of Bari in Italy
      has a population of around 320,000 people (as of my last update). If we were
      considering this Bari, it would be larger than many cities in the United States.
      However, since the question specifies Bari, India, we must consider the Indian
      context.


      3. **Identify Bari in the Indian context**: Without specific information on
      a city named Bari in India, it''s challenging to determine its population accurately.
      India has numerous cities, towns, and villages, and without precise data, we

      population of around 68,000 people (as of my last update). This is a relatively

      figures for Bari, India, this comparison is speculative.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Bari is mentioned in relation to India, and Bossier
      City is mentioned in relation to Louisiana, USA.

      2. **Verify the existence and location of Bari, India**: There seems to be a
      confusion here because a well-known city named Bari is actually located in Italy,
      not India. However, there could be smaller places or different spellings (like
      Barhi) in India. For the sake of this exercise, let''s proceed under the assumption
      that we''re comparing a place named Bari (or its potential equivalent in India)
      with Bossier City, Louisiana.

      3. **Determine the population of Bossier City, Louisiana**: According to the
      2020 United States Census, the population of Bossier City, Louisiana, is approximately
      62,000 people.

      4. **Determine the population of Bari, India (or its equivalent)**: Since Bari
      is not a well-known city in India (and assuming it might be a smaller town or
      village, or there might be confusion with the Italian city), without specific
      data, it''s challenging to provide an exact population. However, many small
      towns and villages in India have populations that can range widely, from a few
      thousand to tens of thousands.

      5. **Comparison**: Without exact figures for a place named Bari in India, we
      can''t directly compare. However, considering that many smaller towns in India
      can have significant populations due to the country''s large population density,
      it''s possible for a town in India to have a population larger than that of
      Bossier City, Louisiana. But without specific data on "Bari, India," we cannot
      make a definitive comparison.


      Given the lack of specific information about a place named Bari in India and
      considering the steps above, the question as posed doesn''t provide enough detail

      3. **Assuming Bari, India**: If we consider the possibility that "Bari, India"
      refers to a smaller, less-known location or even a misunderstanding (since Bari
      is well-known in Italy), we still need to consider the population scale of Indian
      cities and towns. India has a vast number of small towns and villages, many
      of which have populations less than 68,000.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact data on "Bari, India," it''s challenging to
      make a direct comparison. However, considering the vast population of India
      and the fact that many of its smaller towns and villages could indeed have populations
      less than Bossier City, Louisiana, it''s plausible that if "Bari, India" exists
      as a small town or village, it could be less populous than Bossier City.


      Given the lack of clear information about "Bari, India" and considering the
      steps above, the most logical approach is to consider the hypothetical scenario
      where "Bari, India" might indeed refer to a small locality in India, which could
      have a population less than Bossier City, Louisiana.


      Therefore, based on the assumption and the process of elimination, the answer
      would be: **YES**.'

      To answer this question, let''s break down the steps needed to compare the populations
      of Bari, India, and Bossier City, Louisiana.


      1. **Identify Bari, India**: Bari is a city in the state of Madhya Pradesh,
      India. However, it''s essential to note that there might be multiple places
      named Bari in India, but for the sake of this comparison, we will consider a
      notable one. Let''s assume we are referring to Bari, which could be a smaller
      city or town.


      2. **Identify Bossier City, Louisiana**: Bossier City is a city located in Bossier
      Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is part of the Shreveport-Bossier City
      metropolitan area.


      3. **Population of Bossier City, Louisiana**: As of the 2020 United States Census,
      the population of Bossier City was approximately 68,838.


      4. **Population of Bari, India**: Without a specific and well-known city named
      Bari in India that matches the context of a direct comparison (e.g., Bari in
      Madhya Pradesh), it''s challenging to provide an exact population figure. However,
      if we consider other places in India named Bari, they are generally smaller.
      For example, there''s a Bari in Rajasthan, but these places are usually not
      as populous as cities like those found in the United States.


      Given these steps and considering the lack of specific population data for a
      notable "Bari, India," that directly matches the context of a comparison to
      a U.S. city like Bossier City, Louisiana, we must approach the answer with the
      understanding that most cities or towns in India named Bari are likely to have
      populations that could be smaller, similar, or larger than Bossier City, depending
      on the specific Bari in question. However, without exact data, the most logical
      assumption based on typical urban population sizes in India versus those in
      the United States might lean towards Bari being less populous, especially if
      we are comparing to a smaller or less known Bari.


      But since I need to give a YES or NO answer without the exact population figures
      for a specific "Bari, India," and acknowledging the potential for error due
      to the lack of specificity about which Bari is being referenced, I will proceed
      with caution:


      YES'

      the population of Bari, India with that of Bossier City, Louisiana.


      1. **Identify Bari, India**: First, we need to identify if there''s a notable
      place named Bari in India. Bari could refer to different places, but without
      specific context, it''s challenging to pinpoint. However, it''s known that Bari
      is more commonly recognized as a city in Italy. Assuming there might be a lesser-known
      Bari in India or considering the possibility of a mix-up with the Italian city,
      we''ll proceed with the understanding that the question might contain a mistake
      or require clarification.


      2. **Population of Bari, Italy (for context)**: The city of Bari in Italy has
      a population of around 320,000 people as of the last available census.


      3. **Identify Bossier City, Louisiana**: Bossier City is a city located in Louisiana,
      USA. Its population as of the 2020 census is approximately 68,000 people.


      4. **Comparison**: Given the potential confusion with Bari''s location and assuming
      the question intends to compare the Italian Bari (due to its better-known status),
      Bari, Italy, is significantly more populous than Bossier City, Louisiana.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Assumption**: If we''re comparing the well-known Bari
      in Italy to Bossier City, Louisiana, then Bari is not less populous. However,
      since the question specifies "Bari, India," and without a clear, well-known
      city by that name in India that matches the population scale of Bossier City
      or the Italian Bari, the question''s premise seems to be based on incorrect
      or unclear information.


      Given the information and the steps outlined, and considering the most logical
      interpretation (comparing the known city of Bari in Italy to Bossier City, Louisiana,
      due to the lack of clear information on a significant city named Bari in India),
      the answer to whether "Bari, India" is less populous than Bossier City, Louisiana,
      would be based on the assumption that the question contains an error regarding
      the location of Bari.


      Therefore, based on the clarification that Bari is more commonly known in Italy
      and without specific population data for a "Bari, India" that would be relevant

      this question, let''s assume the comparison is intended between Bari, Italy,

      a series of steps to compare the population of Davyd-Haradok and Fulton, Maryland.


      1. **Identify Davyd-Haradok**: First, we need to understand what and where Davyd-Haradok
      is. Davyd-Haradok is a town in the Stolin District of Brest Region, Belarus.


      2. **Identify Fulton, Maryland**: Next, we identify Fulton, Maryland, which
      is a census-designated place located in Howard County, Maryland, United States.


      3. **Find Population Data for Davyd-Haradok**: As of my last update, I don''t
      have real-time access to current population figures. However, according to available
      data, Davyd-Haradok has a population that can be looked up. Let''s assume we
      find that Davyd-Haradok has a population of around 6,500 people (this is a hypothetical
      step as I''m illustrating the process).


      4. **Find Population Data for Fulton, Maryland**: Similarly, we need to find
      the population of Fulton, Maryland. As of the 2020 census, Fulton had a population
      of approximately 5,023 people.


      5. **Compare Populations**: Now, comparing the two, if Davyd-Haradok indeed
      has around 6,500 people and Fulton, Maryland has about 5,023 people, we can
      conclude that Davyd-Haradok is more populous than Fulton, Maryland.


      Given these steps and based on the hypothetical population figures used for

      is a city located in Maryland, United States.


      2. **Find population data for Davyd-Haradok**: As of my last update, specific
      population figures for smaller towns like Davyd-Haradok might not be readily
      available or up-to-date. However, for the sake of reasoning, let''s assume we
      can find that it has a population, but we''ll come back to this.


      3. **Find population data for Fulton, Maryland**: Fulton, Maryland, is a part
      of Howard County. According to the 2020 United States Census, the population
      of Fulton is approximately 5,916.


      4. **Compare the populations**: Without the exact population of Davyd-Haradok,
      we cannot directly compare. However, if we consider that Davyd-Haradok is a
      smaller town in Belarus, and given the context that many small towns have populations
      less than 10,000, there''s a possibility that Davyd-Haradok could have a population
      less than Fulton, Maryland, depending on its actual population size.


      5. **Conclusion based on available data**: Given the lack of specific data on
      Davyd-Haradok''s population, we must consider the general context. However,
      for the purpose of answering the question with a YES or NO and considering the
      likely smaller size of a Belarusian town compared to an American city, one might
      lean towards a positive comparison in terms of population size difference if
      Davyd-Haradok indeed has a smaller population.

      towns, especially those not in major urban areas, tend to have smaller populations

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations in question.
      McMahons Point is a suburb of Sydney, Australia, and Tremont, Illinois, is a
      village in the United States.


      2. **Population of McMahons Point**: As of my last update, specific population
      figures for McMahons Point might not be readily available, but we can consider
      the general population density of Sydney suburbs. McMahons Point is known for
      being a densely populated area due to its proximity to the Sydney central business
      district.


      3. **Population of Tremont, Illinois**: Tremont, Illinois, is a small village.
      According to the 2020 United States Census, the population of Tremont was approximately
      2,044 residents. This gives us a clear, small population figure.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that McMahons Point is part of a major metropolitan
      area (Sydney) and considering the general population density of such areas,
      it is reasonable to infer that McMahons Point would have a significantly larger
      population compared to a small village like Tremont, Illinois.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the reasoning above, McMahons Point is likely more
      populous than Tremont, Illinois. Therefore, the statement that McMahons Point
      is less populous than Tremont, Illinois, is incorrect.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      less populous than Tremont, Illinois, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify McMahons Point and Tremont, Illinois**: McMahons Point is a suburb
      of Sydney, Australia. Tremont, Illinois, is a village in the United States.


      2. **Find Population Data for McMahons Point**: As of my last update, specific
      population figures for McMahons Point might not be readily available, but it''s
      known to be a small suburb within Sydney.


      3. **Find Population Data for Tremont, Illinois**: According to the 2020 United
      States Census, the population of Tremont, Illinois, was approximately 2,044
      residents.


      4. **Compare Populations**: Without the exact population of McMahons Point,
      we must consider general population trends. Suburbs within large cities like
      Sydney often have significant populations, but without the exact figure, it''s
      challenging to make a direct comparison.


      5. **Consider the Context**: McMahons Point, being part of a large metropolitan
      area (Sydney), might have a population that could be comparable or even larger
      than a small village in the United States like Tremont, Illinois, depending
      on its size and density.


      Given the lack of specific data for McMahons Point, it''s difficult to make
      a definitive comparison. However, for the purpose of answering the question
      based on available information and considering that suburbs in major cities
      can have varying population sizes, we can attempt a reasoned guess.


      Based on the general trend that suburbs in large metropolitan areas can have
      significant populations, it might be plausible to consider that McMahons Point
      could have a population larger than Tremont, Illinois, especially if McMahons
      Point covers a substantial area or has a high population density. However, without
      exact numbers, this is speculative.


      Therefore, considering the speculative nature and the potential for McMahons
      Point to have a larger or comparable population due to its location within a
      major metropolitan area, the most reasoned answer, given the lack of specific
      data, would lean towards "NO", McMahons Point is not less populous than Tremont,
      Illinois, based on the assumption that it could potentially have a significant
      population due to its location. However, please note, this answer involves some
      speculation due to the lack of precise population data for McMahons Point.

      2. **Find the population of Mostaganem**: As of my last update, Mostaganem has
      a population of approximately 245,000 people. However, please note that population
      figures can change, and it''s essential to have the most recent data for a precise
      comparison.


      3. **Find the population of Baranagar**: Baranagar, being part of the larger
      Kolkata metropolitan area, has a population that can vary depending on the source
      and the date. However, as of my last update, Baranagar itself has a population
      of around 248,000 people within its municipal boundaries.


      4. **Compare the populations**: Given the approximate figures, Mostaganem has
      about 245,000 people, and Baranagar has around 248,000 people.


      Based on these steps, we can conclude that Mostaganem is indeed less populous
      than Baranagar, albeit by a relatively small margin.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      to determine if Mostaganem is less populous than Baranagar.


      4. **Answer the Question**: Based on the comparison, answer the question with
      a simple "YES" or "NO".


      Now, let''s execute these steps:


      - **Mostaganem''s Population**: As of my last update, Mostaganem has a population
      of approximately 245,000 people (this figure might have changed, but it gives
      us a starting point).


      - **Baranagar''s Population**: Baranagar, being a part of the Kolkata metropolitan
      area, has a significant population. As of the 2011 census, Baranagar had a population
      of about 248,466 (within the municipality). This figure would have grown since
      the last census, but again, it gives us a baseline.


      Given these figures, Mostaganem appears to have a slightly smaller population
      than Baranagar, especially considering the growth in population that both areas
      would have experienced since the last available census or population update.

      Ghana. As of my last update, I don''t have real-time access to specific population
      figures, but we can proceed with a general approach to compare populations.

      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two locations to compare - Sunyani West
      District in Ghana and Clark County in Ohio, USA.


      2. **Find population data for Sunyani West District**: As of my last update,
      specific population figures for Sunyani West District might not be readily available

      As of the 2020 United States Census, the population of Clark County, Ohio, was

      4. **Compare populations**: Without the exact population of Sunyani West District,
      we can''t directly compare. However, knowing that Ghana''s population is significantly
      higher than Ohio''s and considering Ghana''s population distribution, districts
      in Ghana can have varying population sizes. But given the nature of districts
      versus counties in the US, and without exact figures, we might need to consider
      general trends.


      5. **General trends and assumptions**: Districts in Ghana can indeed have large
      populations, but they are often smaller than or comparable to county populations
      in the US, depending on the region and urbanization. However, without specific
      numbers for Sunyani West District, we must be cautious in our comparison.


      Given these steps and acknowledging the lack of specific data on Sunyani West
      District''s population, I would still attempt to provide an answer based on
      general knowledge:


      - If Sunyani West District has a population less than 136,001 (the population
      of Clark County, Ohio), then it is less populous.


      - Without the exact population figures for Sunyani West District, and considering
      the variability in population sizes for districts in Ghana, it''s challenging
      to definitively state which is more populous without current, precise data.


      However, based on the general understanding that many districts in Ghana might
      have populations in the range of tens of thousands to a few hundred thousand,
      and considering Clark County, Ohio, has a population of over 136,000, it''s
      plausible that Sunyani West District could be less populous than Clark County,
      Ohio, but this is speculative without exact figures.


      Therefore, based on the information available and the steps considered, the
      answer would lean towards "YES" if we assume Sunyani West District''s population
      is likely to be smaller than that of Clark County, Ohio, given typical population
      ranges for such administrative divisions. However, please note this answer involves

      than Villar Perosa, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Cold Ash and Villar
      Perosa are. Cold Ash is a village in Berkshire, England, UK. Villar Perosa is
      a comune (municipality) in the Province of Turin in the Italian region Piedmont.


      2. **Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population of each location.
      As of my last update, specific population figures for Cold Ash and Villar Perosa
      might not be readily available or could have changed. However, we can look for
      general population trends or last available census data.


      3. **Cold Ash Population**: Cold Ash is a small village. According to the 2011
      census, the civil parish of Cold Ash had a population of 3,915. It''s a relatively
      small community.


      4. **Villar Perosa Population**: Villar Perosa, as a comune in Italy, had a
      population of 4,111 as of 2019, according to available data.


      5. **Comparison**: Now, comparing the populations, Cold Ash had approximately
      3,915 residents, while Villar Perosa had about 4,111 residents.


      Given these steps and based on the population figures available, the answer
      to whether Cold Ash is less populous than Villar Perosa is:


      YES'
    72ead292-812d-4344-886f-cf793a8efa2c: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      a few steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify the places in question.
      Cold Ash is a village in Berkshire, England, and Villar Perosa is a municipality
      in the Province of Turin in the Italian region Piedmont.


      2. **Population Data**: Next, we need to find population data for both places.
      As of my last update, Cold Ash has a population of around 3,500 people, but
      this can vary depending on the source and date. Villar Perosa, on the other
      hand, has a population of less than 4,100 people, according to the Italian National
      Institute of Statistics (ISTAT).


      3. **Comparison**: Now, compare the populations. If Cold Ash has fewer than
      3,500 people and Villar Perosa has fewer than 4,100 people, then Cold Ash would
      be less populous than Villar Perosa based on these numbers.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the population figures, Cold Ash indeed appears to
      be less populous than Villar Perosa.

      \ need the current population figure for Sint-Amandsberg. However, considering\
      \ that Ghent has a significant population and Sint-Amandsberg is just one part\

      1. **Identify the Cities**: First, we need to know which cities we are comparing.
      Birgunj is a city located in Nepal, and Pematangsiantar is a city in Indonesia.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population of each city.
      Population figures can vary depending on the source and the year, so we''ll
      need to find the most recent and reliable data available.


      3. **Compare Populations**: Once we have the population figures for Birgunj
      and Pematangsiantar, we can compare them to determine if Birgunj is less populous
      than Pematangsiantar.


      Given the steps above, let''s proceed with what we know:


      - Birgunj, Nepal, has a population that can vary but is often reported in the
      range of approximately 200,000 to 250,000 people, depending on the source and
      date.

      - Pematangsiantar, Indonesia, has a population of around 250,000 to 300,000
      people, though like Birgunj, this can vary based on the source.


      Based on these rough estimates, it appears that the population of Birgunj could
      be slightly less than or comparable to that of Pematangsiantar, depending on
      the exact figures used. However, without the most current and precise population
      data, it''s challenging to make a definitive comparison.


      Given the available information and considering the need for precise data for
      a definitive answer, the best approach would be to consult the latest census
      data or official statistics from both Nepal and Indonesia for the most accurate
      population figures for Birgunj and Pematangsiantar.


      However, based on general information and without access to real-time data,
      the answer would lean towards a comparison based on reported population ranges.
      If we consider the upper limit of Birgunj''s population range (around 250,000)
      and the lower limit of Pematangsiantar''s (around 250,000), they could be seen
      as roughly equal. But since the question asks if Birgunj is less populous, and
      considering the potential for Pematangsiantar to have a higher population based
      on the ranges provided, the inclination would be towards saying "yes" under
      the assumption that Pematangsiantar might indeed have a slightly higher population
      or at least not significantly lower.


      Therefore, the answer, based on the steps and considerations above, would be:

      in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Little Hulton is a suburb in the City
      of Salford, Greater Manchester, England.


      2. **Determine the population of Shuanghu County**: As of the last available
      census or estimates, the population of Shuanghu County is not widely known due
      to its remote location and relatively small size. However, considering its vast
      area and sparse population density typical of the Tibetan Plateau, one might
      infer it has a relatively small population.


      3. **Determine the population of Little Hulton**: Little Hulton has a population
      that can be found through local UK census data. As of the 2011 census, the population
      of Little Hulton was approximately 12,799.


      4. **Compare the populations**: Without the exact population of Shuanghu County,
      we must rely on general knowledge about the population density and size of similar
      areas in Tibet. Tibet, being a vast and sparsely populated region, has counties
      that can range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of inhabitants, depending
      on their size and location.


      5. **Make an educated guess**: Given that Shuanghu County is in a very remote

      Hulton has a known population of around 12,799, it''s plausible that Shuanghu
      County could have a smaller population than Little Hulton, especially if we
      consider the vast, uninhabited areas that are common in Tibet.

      3. Compare the populations to determine if Shuanghu County is less populous
      than Little Hulton.


      Step 1: Shuanghu County is a county in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China.

      of China. Little Hulton is a suburb in the City of Salford, Greater Manchester,
      England, UK.


      2. **Population of Shuanghu County**: As of my last update, Shuanghu County
      has a very small population due to its remote location and high altitude. The

      4. **Comparison**: Without exact numbers, we can still make a general comparison.
      Shuanghu County, being a remote and high-altitude area in Tibet, is likely to

      \ populous than Province of Pontevedra, let's break down the information step\
      \ by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Locations**: \n   - Faranah Region is located\
      \ in Guinea, a country in West Africa.\n   - Province of Pontevedra is located\
      \ in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain.\n\n2. **Population of Faranah\
      \ Region**:\n   - As of my last update, the Faranah Region in Guinea has a population,\
      \ but the exact figure can vary. However, Guinea itself has a relatively small\
      \ population compared to many European countries, including Spain.\n\n3. **Population\
      \ of Province of Pontevedra**:\n   - The Province of Pontevedra, being part\
      \ of Spain, would have population figures that are more readily comparable to\
      \ other European regions. Pontevedra has a significant population within the\
      \ context of Galicia and Spain.\n\n4. **Comparative Population Sizes**:\n  \
      \ - Generally, regions in West Africa, like Faranah in Guinea, can have varying\
      \ population densities and sizes. However, many provinces in Spain, especially\
      \ those that are not part of the most populous metropolitan areas, might have\
      \ populations in the hundreds of thousands to a couple of million.\n   - Without\
      \ exact figures, it's challenging to make a direct comparison. However, considering\
      \ that Guinea is one of the less populous countries in West Africa and Spain\
      \ is a more densely populated European country, one might initially think that\
      \ the Province of Pontevedra could be more populous.\n\n5. **Specific Population\
      \ Figures**:\n   - According to available data (which might not be up-to-date),\
      \ the Faranah Region has approximately 780,000 inhabitants (as of 2018 or the\
      \ last available census).\n   - The Province of Pontevedra has around 944,000\
      \ inhabitants (also based on potentially outdated data).\n\nGiven these steps\

    8144a2b9-1fa3-41c3-809e-95e021a3aaff: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Find the population of Govindgarh, Rajasthan**: First, we need to know
      how many people live in Govindgarh, Rajasthan. However, without specific data,
      we''ll proceed with the understanding that Govindgarh is a small town or village,
      which is common in Rajasthan, India.


      2. **Find the population of Beerwah, Queensland**: Next, we look for the population
      of Beerwah, Queensland. Beerwah is known to be a town on the Sunshine Coast
      of Queensland, Australia.


      3. **Compare the populations**: Once we have both population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is less populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      rely on general knowledge:

      - Govindgarh, Rajasthan, being part of India, which is the second-most populous
      country in the world, might still have a significant population due to India''s
      high population density.

      - Beerwah, Queensland, is a town in Australia, which has a much lower population
      density compared to India.


      However, without exact numbers, we must consider the nature of these places:

      - Govindgarh could be a smaller town or village, which is common in Rajasthan.

      - Beerwah, being a town in Queensland, might have a population that, while small
      compared to cities, could be significant for its area.


      Given these considerations and the fact that specific population figures aren''t
      provided, the most logical step is to look for general population data for these
      areas. However, since we''re proceeding without current, exact numbers, let''s
      make an educated guess based on typical population densities and the size of
      settlements in these regions.


      **Assumption for Answer**:

      Without exact population figures, it''s challenging to give a definitive answer.
      However, considering that India has a higher population density than Australia,
      but also considering that Govindgarh might be a smaller settlement and Beerwah
      is a known town, it''s a bit of a toss-up without specific data.


      **Answer**:

      Given the need for specific data to accurately answer and the general knowledge
      that might not perfectly apply to these specific locations, the question requires
      a bit of a leap. However, typically, small towns in Australia might have smaller
      populations than many towns or villages in India due to the overall population
      density differences between the two countries. But, considering Beerwah is a
      town and could have a substantial population for its region, and without knowing
      the exact size or population of Govindgarh, it''s a bit challenging.


      But, making an educated guess based on the fact that Australia has fewer people
      and less dense population areas compared to India, and considering we are comparing
      a potential small village or town in India to a known town in Australia, the
      answer could lean towards "YES" if Govindgarh is indeed a very small village.
      However, this is speculative without exact figures.


      **YES** or **NO**: Given the speculative nature and the need for a direct answer,
      I would lean towards **YES** based on the assumption that Govindgarh might be
      a smaller, less populous area compared to a recognized town like Beerwah in
      Queensland, but please note this is a reasoned guess rather than a fact-based
      answer due to the lack of specific population data provided.'

      Rajasthan, and Beerwah, Queensland. Population figures can vary depending on
      the source and the year, but we''ll aim for the most recent or approximate numbers
      available.

      3. **Compare the populations**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      directly compare them to determine if Govindgarh, Rajasthan, is less populous
      than Beerwah, Queensland.


      Now, let''s find some population data:

      - **Govindgarh, Rajasthan**: As of my last update, specific population figures
      for Govindgarh might not be readily available or might be included in broader
      district or city statistics. However, for the sake of comparison, let''s consider
      that many small towns in India can have populations ranging from a few thousand
      to tens of thousands.

      - **Beerwah, Queensland**: Beerwah is known for being a significant town on
      the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia. As of the 2016 census, Beerwah
      had a population of approximately 6,596 people. This number would have grown
      since then due to development and population growth in the region, but we can
      use this as a baseline.


      Given the lack of specific data on Govindgarh and considering the nature of
      these towns:

      - If we assume Govindgarh, like many small Indian towns, could potentially have
      a population in the range of a few thousand to over 10,000, it''s possible for
      it to be either less or more populous than Beerwah, depending on the actual
      numbers.

      - However, without exact figures for Govindgarh, we must rely on general trends.
      Small towns in India can often be more populous than similar-sized towns in
      Australia due to India''s higher population density and growth rate.


      Given these considerations and the fact that we''re comparing a potentially
      small Indian town with a known population of an Australian town, the question
      essentially asks for a speculative comparison based on general trends rather
      than specific, up-to-date population figures.


      However, the direct answer based on the most straightforward interpretation
      and available data (acknowledging the lack of precise numbers for Govindgarh)
      would lean towards **NO**, assuming that many small towns in India could indeed
      have larger populations than a town like Beerwah in Australia, which has a documented
      population of around 6,600 as of 2016. But remember, this answer involves a
      degree of speculation due to the absence of specific population data for Govindgarh.


      **Answer: NO**'
    910ca790-e818-4b87-80dc-d5ebf03665cb: "To determine if Govindgarh, Rajasthan is\
      \ less populous than Beerwah, Queensland, we need to follow a series of steps:\n\

      \ of India, which is the second-most populous country in the world, is likely\
      \ to have a significant population, given India's high population density.\n\
      \   - Beerwah, in Queensland, Australia, is in a country with a much lower population\
      \ density compared to India. Australia's population is significantly lower than\
      \ India's, and its population is more spread out.\n3. **Compare population sizes**:\

      \ population data in the question and considering the general population trends:\n\
      - India has a very high population density, suggesting that even smaller towns\

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the places**: First, we need to identify Bonao and Bhagawangola
      II. Bonao is a city in the Dominican Republic, known for its natural surroundings
      and as a tourist destination. Bhagawangola II, on the other hand, seems to be
      a less commonly known location, and without specific context, it might be challenging
      to pinpoint. However, given the name, it could be related to or part of Bhagawangola,
      which might be a smaller administrative division or village in India, possibly
      in the state of West Bengal, given the naming conventions.


      2. **Population comparison**: To compare the population, we need to know the
      approximate population of both places. As of my last update, Bonao has a population
      of around 150,000 to 200,000 people, depending on the source and the date. Bhagawangola
      II, being a smaller or less documented area, might have a significantly smaller
      population, potentially in the thousands or tens of thousands, but without exact
      figures, this is speculative.


      3. **Consider the context of "less populous"**: The term "less populous" refers
      to the place with a smaller population. If Bonao has a population in the hundreds
      of thousands and Bhagawangola II has a population that is significantly smaller
      (in the thousands or low tens of thousands), then Bonao would indeed be more
      populous than Bhagawangola II.

    6b47f445-4b39-4029-931d-fb40d339fb1e: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Places**: First, we need to identify the places mentioned. Bonao
      is a city in the Dominican Republic. Bhagawangola II, on the other hand, seems
      to refer to a community development block or a similar administrative division,
      possibly in India, given the naming convention.


      2. **Population of Bonao**: As of my last update, Bonao has a population of
      around 160,000 people, give or take, depending on the source and the year. This
      is a city in a country with a significant population.


      3. **Population of Bhagawangola II**: Bhagawangola II is a block in the Murshidabad
      district of West Bengal, India. These blocks or community development blocks
      often have smaller populations compared to cities. However, specific population
      figures for Bhagawangola II might not be readily available without the most
      current census data. Generally, a block in India might have a population ranging
      from tens of thousands to a couple of hundred thousand, depending on its size
      and the density of the area.


      4. **Comparison**: Without the exact population figures for Bhagawangola II,
      it''s challenging to make a precise comparison. However, considering the general
      population sizes of cities versus blocks in India, it''s plausible that Bonao,
      being a city, could have a comparable or even larger population than a block
      like Bhagawangola II, depending on its specific population.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of precise and up-to-date information on Bhagawangola
      II''s population, and considering that cities often have larger populations
      than administrative blocks, it''s reasonable to lean towards the possibility
      that Bonao could be more populous than Bhagawangola II. However, without exact
      figures, this conclusion involves some degree of uncertainty.


      Based on the above steps and the general understanding of population distributions
      in cities versus administrative blocks, the answer to whether Bonao is less
      populous than Bhagawangola II would likely be **NO**, but this answer comes
      with the caveat that precise population figures for Bhagawangola II are needed
      for a definitive comparison.'

      hand, appears to be a village or a smaller administrative division, likely in
      India, given the naming convention similar to other places in India.


      2. **Population Data**: Next, we need some population data. As of my last update,
      Bonao, being a city, has a population that can be found through various sources.
      According to available data, the population of Bonao is around 160,000 people,
      though this number can vary slightly based on the source and year.


      3. **Bhagawangola II Population**: Finding the exact population of Bhagawangola
      II can be challenging due to its smaller size and less available data. However,
      villages in India, especially those that are not major tourist destinations

    8d9429e9-0f49-4ccf-a139-67d2297db7d0: 'To answer this question, we need to compare
      the population of Grecia (canton) in Costa Rica with the population of Wadi
      al Hayaa District in Libya. Here''s how we can break it down:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Grecia is a canton in the province of Alajuela,
      Costa Rica. Wadi al Hayaa District is a district in the Fezzan region of Libya.


      2. **Find population data for Grecia (canton)**: According to the latest available
      census data or estimates, the population of Grecia (canton) needs to be identified.
      As of my last update, Grecia has a population of around 76,898 people (based
      on 2011 data, which might have changed slightly since then).


      3. **Find population data for Wadi al Hayaa District**: Similarly, for Wadi
      al Hayaa District, the population needs to be determined. The district is one
      of the 22 districts of Libya and is located in the southwestern part of the
      country. As of my last update, specific population figures for Wadi al Hayaa
      District are not readily available, but Libya''s total population and the distribution
      across its districts could give a clue. Libya has a total population of around
      6.8 million (as of 2020 estimates), and its districts vary significantly in
      population size.


      4. **Comparison**: Without the exact population figure for Wadi al Hayaa District,
      it''s challenging to make a precise comparison. However, considering the vast
      differences in population distribution across districts in Libya and knowing
      that some districts in Libya have populations less than 100,000, it''s plausible
      that Wadi al Hayaa could have a population that is comparable to or less than
      that of Grecia (canton).


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of precise and up-to-date population data
      for Wadi al Hayaa District, a definitive comparison is difficult. However, if
      we consider that some of Libya''s districts have relatively small populations
      and assuming Wadi al Hayaa might be one of the less populous districts due to
      its location and Libya''s overall population distribution, it''s possible that
      Grecia (canton) could be more populous than Wadi al Hayaa District. But without
      exact figures, this is speculative.


      Based on the assumption and the steps followed, the most likely answer, considering
      the need for a YES or NO response and the potential for Wadi al Hayaa to have
      a smaller population, would lean towards Grecia being more populous, thus implying
      Wadi al Hayaa District could indeed be less populous. However, the final determination
      requires more precise data.


      Given the speculative nature and the need for a clear answer, I''ll proceed
      with the comparison based on available data and the understanding that precise
      numbers for Wadi al Hayaa District are not provided. Therefore, the answer to
      whether Grecia (canton) is less populous than Wadi al Hayaa District, based
      on the steps and assumptions made, would be:


      NO'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Grecia is a canton in Costa Rica, and Wadi al
      Hayaa District is a district in Libya.


      2. **Find population data for Grecia, Costa Rica**: According to the 2020 estimates,
      the population of Grecia canton is approximately 77,000 people.


      3. **Find population data for Wadi al Hayaa District, Libya**: As of my last
      update, specific population figures for Wadi al Hayaa District might not be
      readily available or could vary significantly due to the political and social
      instability in Libya. However, we can consider the general population trend
      and distribution in Libya. Wadi al Hayaa is one of the districts in the Fezzan
      region, which is less densely populated compared to the coastal regions of Libya.


      4. **Comparison**: Without the exact population figure for Wadi al Hayaa District,
      we must consider the context. Libya''s total population is around 7 million
      people, with the majority living in coastal areas. The Fezzan region, where
      Wadi al Hayaa is located, is vast but has a smaller population compared to other
      regions. However, given the lack of specific data, we should approach this with
      caution.


      5. **Reasoning**: If we consider the population of Grecia (around 77,000) and
      the fact that Wadi al Hayaa District is part of a less densely populated region
      in Libya, without specific numbers, it''s challenging to make a direct comparison.
      However, districts in Libya can vary widely in population, and some districts
      in less populated areas might have smaller populations.


      Given the potential for Wadi al Hayaa District to have a population that could
      be smaller, similar, or larger than Grecia''s, but considering the general trend
      of population distribution in Libya and the specific population of Grecia, we
      can attempt to make an educated guess.

    ac5f79e4-a355-4385-b640-245e88537784: 'To answer whether Grecia (canton) is less
      populous than Wadi al Hayaa District, let''s gather the necessary information
      step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Grecia is a canton in the province of Alajuela,
      Costa Rica. Wadi al Hayaa District is a district of the Ma''rib Governorate,
      Yemen.


      2. **Population of Grecia (canton)**: According to available data up to my last
      update in 2023, the population of Grecia canton is approximately 76,898 people.


      3. **Population of Wadi al Hayaa District**: The population figures for specific
      districts in Yemen can be difficult to find due to the ongoing conflict and
      less frequent updates. However, according to older data, Wadi al Hayaa District
      might not be one of the most populous districts in Yemen, but without a precise
      figure, it''s challenging to compare directly.


      4. **Consideration of general population trends**: Yemen has a much larger population
      than Costa Rica. As of my last update, Yemen''s population is over 30 million,
      while Costa Rica''s is around 5 million. This means that even less populous
      areas in Yemen could potentially have populations comparable to or larger than
      those in Costa Rica.


      5. **Comparison challenge**: Without the most current and specific population
      data for Wadi al Hayaa District, a direct comparison is challenging. However,
      given the relative population sizes of the countries and assuming Wadi al Hayaa
      District is not one of the smallest districts in Yemen, it''s plausible that
      its population could be in the same order of magnitude as Grecia''s.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of precise and up-to-date population data
      for Wadi al Hayaa District, making an accurate comparison is difficult. However,
      considering the general population trends and assuming that even smaller districts
      in Yemen could have significant populations due to the country''s overall larger
      population size, it''s possible that Wadi al Hayaa District could have a population
      that is not significantly less than Grecia''s. Without exact numbers, this remains
      a speculative comparison.


      Based on the steps and considerations above, and acknowledging the uncertainty
      due to the lack of precise data for Wadi al Hayaa District, the question requires
      a definitive answer that might not fully align with the speculative nature of

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify the two places in question.
      Grecia is a canton in Costa Rica, and Wadi al Hayaa District is a district in
      Libya.


      2. **Population of Grecia (canton)**: According to available data, the population
      of Grecia canton in Costa Rica is approximately 70,000 to 80,000 people. Please
      note that population figures can vary over time, but we''ll use this as a rough
      estimate.


      3. **Population of Wadi al Hayaa District**: Wadi al Hayaa is one of the districts
      of the Fezzan region in southwestern Libya. The population of Wadi al Hayaa
      District is not as commonly documented in English sources as some other regions,
      but for the sake of comparison, we need to find a rough estimate. Libya''s total
      population is around 6.8 million, and while the exact population of Wadi al
      Hayaa might not be readily available, we can estimate based on Libya''s population
      distribution. However, it''s known that the Fezzan region, where Wadi al Hayaa
      is located, has a relatively small population compared to the coastal regions
      of Libya. For the purpose of this comparison, let''s proceed with the understanding
      that detailed population figures for Wadi al Hayaa District specifically might
      be scarce, but we are trying to determine if it''s less populous than Grecia.


      4. **Comparison**: Without a precise figure for Wadi al Hayaa District, direct
      comparison is challenging. However, considering the general population distribution
      in Libya and the fact that Grecia has a known population of around 70,000 to
      80,000, we would need to determine if Wadi al Hayaa''s population is less than
      this.


      Given the lack of specific data on Wadi al Hayaa District''s population and
      the difficulty in obtaining precise figures for some regions, we must rely on
      general knowledge. Libya''s population is mostly concentrated in the coastal
      areas, with the southern regions like Fezzan being less densely populated. However,
      without exact numbers, it''s a challenge to definitively say which is less populous.


      But considering the steps and the fact that specific population data for Wadi
      al Hayaa District is not readily available for a precise comparison, the most
      logical step would be to consider the general population trends and the fact
      that Grecia is a defined canton with a known population, whereas the population
      of Wadi al Hayaa District might be smaller due to its location in a less populated
      region of Libya.


      Given the information available and the nature of the question, the answer would
      lean towards "YES" based on the assumption that Wadi al Hayaa, being part of
      a less densely populated region in Libya, might have a population comparable
      to or possibly smaller than that of Grecia canton in Costa Rica. However, please

      region in southwestern Libya. The population figures for specific districts
      in Libya, especially after recent conflicts, can be challenging to find and
      may vary. However, the Wadi al Hayaa District is known to be one of the less
      populated areas of Libya.


      3. **Compare Populations**: Without the most current and precise population
      figure for Wadi al Hayaa District, it''s difficult to make an exact comparison.
      However, considering the general population density and distribution in Libya,
      particularly in less populated areas like the Fezzan region, and knowing the
      population of Grecia, we can attempt a reasoned comparison.

      small population, most of which is concentrated in coastal areas. The Fezzan
      region, where Wadi al Hayaa is located, is less densely populated compared to
      the coastal regions.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Crescent Beach is located in St. Johns County,
      Florida, USA. Texas, on the other hand, is a state in the United States, but
      when combined with Queensland, it seems there might be confusion. Queensland
      is a state in Australia. However, for the sake of comparison, we''ll consider
      "Texas, Queensland" as a reference to a place in Australia, but it''s crucial
      to note that Texas is not in Queensland; it''s a separate entity in the USA.
      For clarity, let''s assume the question is comparing Crescent Beach, Florida,
      with Texas (the state in the USA) and somehow mistakenly includes Queensland,
      which doesn''t directly relate to Texas.


      2. **Population of Crescent Beach, St. Johns County, Florida**: Crescent Beach
      is a small community. While exact numbers might not be readily available without
      current data, small beach communities typically have populations in the thousands
      or tens of thousands.


      3. **Population of Texas (USA)**: Texas is the second-most populous state in
      the United States, with a population of over 29 million people as of the last
      available census data.


      4. **Population of Queensland (Australia)**: Queensland is a state in Australia
      with a significant population, over 5 million people as of the last available
      census data.


      Given the information and focusing on the direct question:

      - Crescent Beach, being a small community, would naturally have a significantly
      smaller population than either Texas (the state in the USA) or Queensland (the
      state in Australia).

      - The question seems to conflate or mistakenly combine Texas with Queensland,
      but regardless of this confusion, both Texas and Queensland, individually, have
      much larger populations than Crescent Beach.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Crescent Beach, St. Johns County, Florida,
      is less populous than Texas (or considering the confusion, than Queensland,
      or even if mistakenly considering a non-existent "Texas, Queensland") is clearly
      **YES**. Crescent Beach is less populous than any of these larger geographic
      entities.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Crescent Beach is in St. Johns County, Florida,
      USA. Texas, on the other hand, is mentioned as being in Queensland, which implies
      Texas, Queensland, Australia, since Queensland is a state in Australia.


      2. **Understand the question**: We are comparing the population of Crescent
      Beach, Florida, with Texas, Queensland, Australia.


      3. **Population of Crescent Beach, Florida**: Crescent Beach is a small community.

      2. **Understand the population comparison**: We are comparing the population
      of Crescent Beach, a specific beach area in Florida, with Texas, Queensland,
      which is a locality in Australia.


      3. **Population of Crescent Beach, Florida**: While specific population figures
      for Crescent Beach might not be readily available without current data, it is
      known that Crescent Beach is a part of the larger St. Augustine Beach area and
      is relatively small in terms of population. St. Johns County has a significant
      population, but the specific number for Crescent Beach would be a fraction of
      the county''s total.


      4. **Population of Texas, Queensland**: Texas, Queensland, is a small town or

      generally not very populous.


      5. **Comparison**: Without exact numbers, it''s challenging to make a precise
      comparison. However, considering that Crescent Beach is part of a larger, more
      populated area in the United States, and Texas, Queensland, is described as
      a small locality, it might initially seem like Crescent Beach could potentially
      have a larger or comparable population due to its inclusion in a more densely
      populated region.


      6. **Final Consideration**: Given the context that both are relatively small
      in terms of population, but considering the general population density of areas
      they are located in, Crescent Beach being part of a larger, more populated county
      in the U.S. might suggest it could have a significant population. However, without
      exact numbers, this step involves acknowledging the uncertainty.


      Considering these steps and the general understanding that specific, small areas
      like Crescent Beach and Texas, Queensland, have populations that can be difficult
      to compare without exact figures, the question essentially asks for a comparison
      based on typical population densities and the sizes of the areas.


      Given the lack of specific population data in the question and the need to reason
      based on typical characteristics of such locations, the answer leans towards

      Lower Normandy to form the region of Normandy. Samar, on the other hand, refers
      to a province in the Philippines, specifically on Samar Island.

      Upper Normandy refers to a former administrative region in northern France,
      which has since been merged with Lower Normandy to form the region of Normandy.
      Samar, on the other hand, is a province in the Philippines.


      2. **Population of Upper Normandy**: Before its merger, Upper Normandy had a
      population of approximately 1.85 million people, according to data available
      up to its administrative dissolution.


      3. **Population of Samar**: The population of Samar province in the Philippines

      (also known as Western Samar to distinguish it from Northern Samar and Eastern
      Samar, which are separate provinces) is about 793,000 people.


      4. **Comparison**: To determine if Upper Normandy is less populous than Samar,
      we compare the population figures. Upper Normandy, with around 1.85 million
      people, is more populous than Samar, which has approximately 793,000 people.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Upper Normandy is less populous

      Step 1: Identify the locations. Upper Normandy is a former administrative region
      in France, and Samar is an island in the Philippines.


      Step 2: Determine the population of Upper Normandy. As of 2012, before it merged
      with Lower Normandy to form Normandy, Upper Normandy had a population of approximately
      1.89 million people.


      Step 3: Determine the population of Samar. The island of Samar in the Philippines

      1. **Identify Upper Normandy and Samar**: Upper Normandy (French: Haute-Normandie)
      was an administrative region in northern France. It was merged with Lower Normandy
      to form the new region of Normandy in 2016. Samar, on the other hand, can refer
      to different places, but most notably, it is a province in the Philippines.


      2. **Population of Upper Normandy**: As of the last available data before its
      merger (which would be around 2015 or before), the population of Upper Normandy
      was approximately 1.8 million people.


      3. **Population of Samar**: The population of Samar Province in the Philippines,
      as of the 2020 census, is about 793,000 people. However, there''s also a Samar
      Island, which includes several provinces: Samar, Northern Samar, and Eastern
      Samar. The combined population of these provinces would be significantly higher
      but still less than 2 million.


      4. **Comparison**: Comparing the population figures, Upper Normandy (with approximately
      1.8 million people) is more populous than Samar Province (with about 793,000
      people) but less populous than some larger definitions of Samar (like the entire
      island including all its provinces). However, considering the most direct comparison
      (Upper Normandy to Samar Province), Upper Normandy is more populous.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison between Upper Normandy and Samar
      Province, Upper Normandy is more populous. Therefore, the statement "Is Upper
      Normandy less populous than Samar?" is false, given the direct comparison of
      Upper Normandy to Samar Province.

      like San Severo, tend to have more substantial populations due to Italy''s higher
      population density and urbanization. Pakistani towns, while varying greatly
      in size, often have smaller populations in rural areas.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that San Severo has a known population of around 53,000
      and considering typical population sizes, it''s reasonable to assume that Daultala,
      being a smaller town in Pakistan, likely has a smaller population than San Severo.

      enough population to be recognized as a town.


      4. **Consideration of "Less Populous"**: The term "less populous" means having
      fewer inhabitants. Without specific data on Nambla, if we assume it''s a very
      small or possibly non-existent location in terms of population statistics, it
      would likely have fewer inhabitants than a recognized town like Siddapura.


      Given these considerations and the fact that Nambla does not appear to be a
      recognized or significant location, it is reasonable to conclude that Nambla,
      if it exists as a very small entity or is a mistake, would indeed be less populous
      than Siddapura, Uttara Kannada, which is a known town.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

    b78c76b4-1b1f-41b6-9104-cd5376b1c0e5: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Nambla and Siddapura, Uttara Kannada**: First, we need to understand
      what Nambla and Siddapura, Uttara Kannada are. Nambla could refer to a variety
      of places, but without specific context, it''s challenging to pinpoint. Siddapura,
      on the other hand, is a town in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, India.
      This gives us a clear location for one of the places.


      2. **Determine the Population of Siddapura, Uttara Kannada**: To compare populations,
      we need some data. According to the 2011 Census of India, Siddapura had a population.
      However, without the exact figure provided here, we know that towns in India
      can have varying populations, but this step is about acknowledging that we need
      this data for a comparison.


      3. **Find Information on Nambla**: Without a specific location for Nambla, it''s
      difficult to proceed. However, assuming Nambla could be a small village, town,
      or city somewhere in the world, its population could vary greatly. If Nambla
      refers to a very small or less known location, it might have a smaller population
      compared to a town like Siddapura.


      4. **Compare Populations**: Given the lack of specific information about Nambla,
      if we assume it''s a smaller, less populated area (which could be a reasonable
      assumption given it''s not as readily identifiable as Siddapura), we might infer
      that it could indeed be less populous than Siddapura, Uttara Kannada.


      Based on these steps and the assumptions made due to the lack of specific information
      about Nambla, the answer leans towards "YES" because we''re comparing a potentially
      smaller or less known location (Nambla) to a known town (Siddapura) in India.
      However, please note that without exact data on Nambla, this answer involves
      some speculation.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'
    dd8cb1e2-bee4-44a6-8bd4-01e56aaff94a: 'To answer whether Nambla is less populous
      than Siddapura, Uttara Kannada, we need to follow a few steps:


      1. **Identify Nambla and Siddapura, Uttara Kannada**: First, we need to understand
      what and where Nambla and Siddapura, Uttara Kannada are. However, without specific
      details on Nambla, it''s challenging to proceed directly. Uttara Kannada is
      a district in Karnataka, India, and Siddapura is a town in this district. Without
      more context, it''s hard to identify Nambla directly.


      2. **Population Data**: To compare the population, we would ideally need the
      most recent population figures for both places. This information is usually
      available through census data or local government resources. However, without
      knowing what Nambla refers to (a village, town, city, or another entity), finding
      its population data is speculative.


      3. **Assumptions and Challenges**: Given the lack of clear information on Nambla,
      one might assume it could be a smaller settlement or village, as it''s not widely
      recognized in available data or sources like Siddapura, Uttara Kannada, which
      is known as a town in Karnataka. If Nambla is indeed a smaller or less known
      entity, it might have a smaller population compared to a recognized town like
      Siddapura.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without specific details on
      Nambla, making a definitive comparison is challenging. However, if we were to
      assume Nambla is a smaller or less populated area compared to a known town like
      Siddapura, we might lean towards a particular answer based on typical population
      distributions where smaller, less known areas often have fewer residents than
      established towns.


      Given the speculative nature of the question due to the lack of clear information
      on Nambla, and considering typical scenarios where smaller or less recognized
      places might have smaller populations than established towns, the answer would
      be based on the assumption that Nambla is indeed less populated due to its unknown
      or potentially smaller size/status.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'
    fd1047a5-b936-47cb-a515-616ffb71734f: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify the places in question.
      Nambla and Siddapura are the two places mentioned, with Siddapura being specified
      as located in Uttara Kannada, which is a district in the Indian state of Karnataka.


      2. **Gather Population Data**: To compare the population of these two places,
      we would ideally need the most recent census data or other reliable population
      estimates. However, without access to real-time data or specific census figures
      in this interaction, we''ll have to rely on general knowledge or assumptions
      based on typical population trends in such areas.


      3. **Consider the Context**: Nambla is not a widely recognized location globally,
      which might suggest it''s either a very small town, village, or possibly not
      as well-known under this name. Siddapura, being part of a known district in
      India (Uttara Kannada), suggests it is at least a recognizable town or city
      within its region.


      4. **Population Comparison**: Without exact numbers, we can make an educated
      guess. If Nambla is less known or possibly smaller, and Siddapura is a town
      within a district, it might imply that Siddapura could have a more significant
      population due to its recognition and possible economic or administrative importance
      within Uttara Kannada.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific data and relying on the steps
      above, the most logical assumption would lean towards Nambla being less populous
      than Siddapura, considering Siddapura''s status as a town in a recognized district
      in India. However, this conclusion is based on assumptions rather than concrete
      data.


      Based on these steps and the assumptions made, the answer would be: **YES**'

      \ Jeli District is an administrative district in Kelantan, Malaysia. \n\n3.\
      \ **Population Comparison**:\n    - **Bego\xF1a's Population**: As of my last\
      \ update, specific population figures for Bego\xF1a might not be readily available\
      \ without the context of the year. However, Bilbao, the city where Bego\xF1\
      a is located, has a population of around 350,000 people. Assuming Bego\xF1a\
      \ is a significant district within Bilbao, its population would be a fraction\
      \ of Bilbao's total, likely in the tens of thousands.\n    - **Jeli District's\
      \ Population**: The population of Jeli District in Kelantan, Malaysia, is also\
      \ subject to change, but as of the last census data available, Kelantan has\
      \ about 1.8 million people. Jeli, being one of the districts, would have a population\
      \ that contributes to this total, likely also in the tens of thousands.\n\n\
      4. **Comparison**: Without exact numbers, we can infer based on the nature of\
      \ both being districts within larger entities (Bilbao and Kelantan, respectively).\
      \ However, the size and population density of the areas they belong to can give\
      \ clues. Bilbao is a city with a defined population, while Kelantan is a state\
      \ with a larger and more dispersed population.\n\nGiven these considerations\
      \ and without precise population figures for both Bego\xF1a and Jeli District,\
      \ making an exact comparison is challenging. However, based on the general understanding\
      \ that both are districts within larger populations, the question essentially\
      \ asks for a comparison between two subsets of larger populations.\n\nGiven\
      \ the lack of specific data and acknowledging that both are part of larger entities\
      \ with different population densities and totals, it's reasonable to proceed\
      \ with caution. However, considering that Malaysia's states often encompass\
      \ larger and more populous areas compared to districts within Spanish cities,\
      \ and without specific numbers to directly compare, the question's answer hinges\
      \ on the assumption of typical population sizes for such areas.\n\nBut considering\
      \ the need for a direct answer based on the information typically available\
      \ and the understanding that direct comparisons without specific numbers can\
      \ be misleading, the approach should involve recognizing the typical population\
      \ scales of such administrative divisions.\n\nGiven the direct question and\
      \ the necessity to provide a clear YES or NO without the ability to research\
      \ or provide real-time data, the answer would typically rely on general knowledge\

      a series of steps considering the population of Barmedman and Turweston.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Barmedman and Turweston
      are. Barmedman is a village in New South Wales, Australia, and Turweston is
      a village and civil parish in Northamptonshire, England.


      2. **Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both locations.
      As of my last update, specific population figures might not be readily available,
      but we can look for approximate numbers or comparisons.


      3. **Barmedman Population**: Barmedman is known to be a small village. According
      to the 2016 Australian Census, Barmedman had a population of 228 people.


      4. **Turweston Population**: Turweston is also a small village. The 2011 UK
      Census reported that Turweston had a population of 211 people. Note that this
      is older data, and the population might have changed slightly since then.


      5. **Comparison**: Comparing the population figures, Barmedman had 228 residents
      as of 2016, and Turweston had 211 residents as of 2011. Without more recent
      data for Turweston, we can only make a rough comparison based on these numbers.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the available data, Barmedman appears to be more
      populous than Turweston, considering the numbers from 2016 for Barmedman and
      2011 for Turweston. However, the question asks if Barmedman is less populous
      than Turweston.

      Barmedman is a village in New South Wales, Australia, and Turweston is a village
      in Northamptonshire, England.


      2. **Population of Barmedman**: As of my last update, Barmedman has a population
      of around 228 people, according to the 2016 census. It''s a small village.


      3. **Population of Turweston**: Turweston is also a small village. The exact
      population might not be readily available, but for the purpose of comparison,
      if we consider typical small village populations in England, they can range
      widely but often are in the hundreds.


      4. **Comparison**: Without the exact population of Turweston, it''s challenging
      to make a direct comparison. However, given that both are described as small
      villages, their populations are likely to be comparable, potentially in the
      range of a few hundred residents each.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without specific, up-to-date population figures for Turweston,
      it''s difficult to definitively say which is less populous. However, considering
      the nature of the question and the need for a clear YES or NO answer, we must
      rely on available data and general knowledge about small villages.


      Given the information available and the typical population sizes of small villages,
      it''s reasonable to consider that both Barmedman and Turweston could have comparable
      population sizes, but without exact figures for Turweston, we cannot definitively
      conclude which is less populous based solely on the information provided.


      However, the question demands a YES or NO answer, and based on the available
      data and the understanding that population figures can fluctuate and might not
      be readily available for very small locations, a reasoned guess must be made.


      Given that Barmedman has a known small population and assuming Turweston, as
      another small village, might have a similar or possibly slightly different population
      size, the answer could lean towards either possibility. But since we are to

      \ down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: \n   - Crest, California\
      \ is a community in San Diego County, California, USA.\n   - Cranwell could\
      \ refer to different places, but one notable location is Cranwell in Lincolnshire,\
      \ England, which is known for RAF Cranwell, a Royal Air Force station.\n\n2.\
      \ **Population of Crest, California**:\n   - As of my last update, specific\
      \ population figures for Crest, California, might not be readily available since\
      \ it's a smaller community within San Diego County. However, we can consider\
      \ the broader context of San Diego County's population and the typical size\
      \ of its communities for comparison.\n\n3. **Population of Cranwell**:\n   -\
      \ Cranwell, Lincolnshire, has a relatively small population. The exact figure\
      \ can vary, but it's generally understood to be in the hundreds or low thousands,\
      \ given its rural nature and the fact that it's known more for the RAF base\
      \ than for being a large settlement.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Given that\
      \ Crest is part of a large and populous county in California, it's reasonable\
      \ to assume that even a small community within such a county could have a population\
      \ that exceeds that of a small village in England like Cranwell.\n   - However,\

    edb1feb1-a873-46f1-b03b-36ec619a44e2: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Crest, California, is a community in San Diego
      County, California, USA. Cranwell, on the other hand, could refer to several
      places, but one well-known location is Cranwell in Lincolnshire, England, which
      is associated with the Royal Air Force (RAF) Cranwell, a major RAF station.


      2. **Population of Crest, California**: As of my last update, specific population
      figures for Crest, California, might not be readily available since it''s a
      smaller community. However, we can consider it in the context of its county
      and state. San Diego County has a significant population, but Crest itself is
      likely to be much smaller.


      3. **Population of Cranwell**: Cranwell, in Lincolnshire, England, has a relatively
      small population. The exact number can vary, but it''s known for the RAF base
      rather than being a large settlement.


      4. **Comparison**: Without exact numbers, it''s challenging to make a direct
      comparison. However, given that both are smaller in population, we need to consider
      their contexts. Crest, California, is part of a larger, densely populated metropolitan
      area (San Diego), suggesting its population could be significant enough, even
      if it''s a small community within the county. Cranwell, being a small village
      in England, is likely to have a very small population.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of exact population figures, we must make
      an educated guess based on the available information. Crest, being part of San
      Diego County, might have a population that, while small, could potentially be
      larger than that of Cranwell, which is a small village in England. However,
      without precise numbers, this is speculative.


      Considering these steps and the speculative nature of the comparison without
      exact population figures, the most logical approach is to consider which location
      is more likely to be less populous based on their descriptions and contexts.
