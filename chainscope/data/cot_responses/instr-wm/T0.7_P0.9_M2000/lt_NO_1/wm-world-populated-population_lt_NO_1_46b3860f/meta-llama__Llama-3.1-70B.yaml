      \ considering that Bheemunipatnam is part of the larger Visakhapatnam urban\
      \ area, which has a significant population (over 2 million as of the last available\
      \ census data), it's reasonable to infer that even a small portion of this urban\
      \ area could potentially have a population comparable to or larger than that\
      \ of Columbus County, North Carolina.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the potential\
      \ size and population density of areas within Visakhapatnam, including Bheemunipatnam,\
      \ and comparing it with the known population of Columbus County, North Carolina,\
      \ it seems plausible that Bheemunipatnam, or at least the area it represents\
      \ within Visakhapatnam, could have a population that is not significantly less\
      \ populous than Columbus County. However, without exact figures for Bheemunipatnam,\
      \ this comparison relies on assumptions about its population size relative to\
      \ the broader urban area it is part of.\n\nGiven the available information and\
      \ the nature of the question, the most accurate answer based on the steps of\
      \ reasoning and the known population figures would be:\n\nYES"

      1. **Identify Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands**: Coral Bay is a town located

      look up the population of Crofton Park and Zevio.


      Crofton Park is a district in the London Borough of Lewisham, England. According
      to available data, the population of Crofton Park is around 13,000-15,000 people,
      depending on the source.


      Zevio, on the other hand, is a town in the Province of Verona, Italy. According
      to the latest census data, Zevio has a population of around 14,000 people.


      Now, comparing the two populations: Crofton Park has around 13,000-15,000 people,
      and Zevio has around 14,000 people. This means Crofton Park''s population range
      overlaps with Zevio''s population.


      Since the population range of Crofton Park (13,000-15,000) includes values both
      lower and higher than the population of Zevio (around 14,000), we can conclude
      that in some cases, Crofton Park might be less populous, but in others, it might
      be more populous. However, considering the question asks for a general comparison,
      we must consider if the maximum or minimum population of Crofton Park is less
      than Zevio.


      Given that the lowest estimate for Crofton Park (13,000) is indeed less than
      Zevio''s population (14,000), the answer to whether Crofton Park is less populous

      the population of the broader Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which was about
      25.85 million as of 2020.


      3. **Population Comparison**: Given the lack of specific population data for

      \ in the state of Perak, Malaysia. Population data for Hulu Perak District might\
      \ be challenging to find because it is part of a larger administrative division.\
      \ For the sake of comparison, we'll need to consider the population of the broader\
      \ Perak state or compare it with the nearest available population data.\n\n\
      3. **Population Comparison**: Without the most current and specific population\
      \ data for Hulu Perak District, it's difficult to make a direct comparison.\
      \ However, considering that Hulu Perak District is part of the broader Perak\
      \ state, which has a significant population (over 2.4 million as of the last\
      \ available census data), it's reasonable to infer that even a small portion\
      \ of this state could potentially have a population comparable to or larger\
      \ than that of Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the potential\
      \ size and population density of areas within Perak, including Hulu Perak District,\
      \ and comparing it with the known population of Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, it seems\
      \ plausible that Hulu Perak District, or at least the area it represents within\
      \ Perak, could have a population that is not significantly less populous than\
      \ Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre. However, without exact figures for Hulu Perak District,\
      \ this comparison relies on assumptions about its population size relative to\
      \ the broader state it is part of.\n\nGiven the available information and the\
      \ nature of the question, the most accurate answer based on the steps of reasoning\
      \ and the known population figures would be:\n\nYES"
