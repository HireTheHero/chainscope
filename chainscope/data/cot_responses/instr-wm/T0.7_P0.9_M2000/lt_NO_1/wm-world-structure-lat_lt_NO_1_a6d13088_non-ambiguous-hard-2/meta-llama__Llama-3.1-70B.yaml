      Based on these steps, I can conclude that Hampstead Heath railway station is
      not located south of Kulekhani Reservoir. Instead, it''s located north of Kulekhani
      Reservoir.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      \ \n   - O'Reilly Theater is also in the northern hemisphere, but in North America.\n\
      3. **Compare latitudes**: \n   - Latitude is a measure of how far north or south\
      \ a location is from the equator. \n   - Since both locations are in the northern\
      \ hemisphere, their latitudes will be positive. \n   - London, where East Brixton\
      \ railway station is located, has a latitude of approximately 51.51\xB0N. \n\
      \   - Pittsburgh, where O'Reilly Theater is located, has a latitude of approximately\
      \ 40.44\xB0N.\n4. **Determine the direction**: \n   - If a location has a higher\
      \ latitude, it means it's further north. \n   - Since London has a higher latitude\
      \ than Pittsburgh, it means East Brixton railway station is located north of\
      \ O'Reilly Theater.\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the comparison of latitudes,\
      \ East Brixton railway station is not located south of O'Reilly Theater. It's\

      2. **Cherokee Lake Location**: Cherokee Lake is located in Tennessee, United
      States.

      3. **Sai Ying Pun Community Complex Location**: Sai Ying Pun Community Complex
      is located in Hong Kong.

      4. **Determine the Geographic Relationship**: To determine if Cherokee Lake
      is south of Sai Ying Pun Community Complex, we need to consider their geographic
      locations relative to each other.

      5. **Compare Latitudes**: Since both locations are identified, comparing their
      latitudes will help determine their north-south relationship. Hong Kong is generally
      closer to the equator and is south of the United States.

      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Hong Kong (where Sai Ying Pun Community Complex
      is located) is south of the United States (where Cherokee Lake is located),
      it means Cherokee Lake is north of Sai Ying Pun Community Complex.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Cherokee Lake is located south of
      Sai Ying Pun Community Complex is: **NO**'

      these steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to know where Lake Glenville and
      Casa de Segunda are located.

      2. **Lake Glenville Location**: Lake Glenville is located in North Carolina,
      USA. It is a reservoir created by the damming of the West Fork Tuckasegee River.

      3. **Casa de Segunda Location**: Casa de Segunda is located in Quezon City,
      Metro Manila, Philippines. It is a historic house that was the official residence
      of the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines.

      4. **Determine the Geographic Relationship**: To determine if Lake Glenville
      is south of Casa de Segunda, we need to consider their geographic locations
      relative to each other.

      5. **Compare Latitudes**: Since both locations are identified, comparing their
      latitudes will help determine their north-south relationship. The Philippines
      is generally closer to the equator and is south of the United States.

      6. **Conclusion**: Given that the Philippines (where Casa de Segunda is located)
      is south of the United States (where Lake Glenville is located), it means Lake
      Glenville is north of Casa de Segunda.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Lake Glenville is located south
      of Casa de Segunda is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where Inner City Bypass,
      Brisbane and South Gippsland Freeway are located.

      2. **Inner City Bypass, Brisbane Location**: This is a road located in Brisbane,
      Queensland, Australia. It''s a major road that connects the northern and southern
      suburbs of Brisbane.

      3. **South Gippsland Freeway Location**: This is a freeway located in Victoria,
      Australia. It connects the city of Melbourne with the Gippsland region in the
      southeastern part of the state.

      4. **Determine the Geographic Relationship**: To determine if Inner City Bypass,
      Brisbane is south of South Gippsland Freeway, we need to consider their geographic
      locations relative to each other.

      5. **Compare Latitudes**: Since both locations are identified, comparing their
      latitudes will help determine their north-south relationship. Brisbane is generally
      closer to the equator and is north of Melbourne.

      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Brisbane (where Inner City Bypass is located)
      is north of Melbourne (where South Gippsland Freeway is located), it means Inner
      City Bypass, Brisbane is north of South Gippsland Freeway.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Inner City Bypass, Brisbane is located
      south of South Gippsland Freeway is: **NO**'

      Park is south of the Church of St. Joseph, we need to consider their geographic
      locations relative to each other.

      5. **Compare Latitudes**: Since both locations are identified, comparing their
      latitudes will help determine their north-south relationship. The United States
      is generally at a higher latitude (further north) than Ireland.

      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Ireland (where Arklow Bank Wind Park is located)
      is at a lower latitude (further south) than the United States (where the Church
      of St. Joseph is located), it means Arklow Bank Wind Park is south of the Church
      of St. Joseph.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Arklow Bank Wind Park is located
      south of the Church of St. Joseph is: **YES**'

      4. **Determine the Geographic Relationship**: To determine if Turnham Green
      tube station is south of Mirani Dam, we need to consider their geographic locations
      relative to each other.

      5. **Compare Latitudes**: Since both locations are identified, comparing their
      latitudes will help determine their north-south relationship. Pakistan is generally
      closer to the equator and is south of the United Kingdom.

      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Pakistan (where Mirani Dam is located) is south
      of the United Kingdom (where Turnham Green tube station is located), it means
      Turnham Green tube station is north of Mirani Dam.

    dc8d533e-cf4e-44c9-b927-74fd61015ad2: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      a few steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to know where Bratsk Reservoir
      and Tomb of the King of Boni are located.

      2. **Bratsk Reservoir Location**: Bratsk Reservoir is located in Irkutsk Oblast,
      Russia. It''s a man-made reservoir created by the Bratsk Dam on the Angara River.

      3. **Tomb of the King of Boni Location**: The Tomb of the King of Boni is located
      in Mada''in Saleh, Saudi Arabia. It''s an archaeological site and part of the
      Hegra Archaeological Site.

      4. **Determine the Geographic Relationship**: To determine if Bratsk Reservoir
      is south of the Tomb of the King of Boni, we need to consider their geographic
      locations relative to each other.

      5. **Compare Latitudes**: Since both locations are identified, comparing their
      latitudes will help determine their north-south relationship. Russia (where
      Bratsk Reservoir is located) is generally north of Saudi Arabia (where the Tomb
      of the King of Boni is located).

      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Russia (where Bratsk Reservoir is located) is
      north of Saudi Arabia (where the Tomb of the King of Boni is located), it means
      Bratsk Reservoir is not south of the Tomb of the King of Boni.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Bratsk Reservoir is located south
      of the Tomb of the King of Boni is: **NO**'

      \ in the city center of Madrid.\n   - **Morena Dam**: This is a dam located\
      \ in the state of Baja California, Mexico. It's known for being a major hydroelectric\
      \ power source and is located near the city of Tecate.\n4. **Geographical Comparison**:\
      \ \n   - Casa de Cisneros is in Madrid, Spain, which is in Europe.\n   - Morena\
      \ Dam is in Baja California, Mexico, which is in North America.\n5. **Determine\
