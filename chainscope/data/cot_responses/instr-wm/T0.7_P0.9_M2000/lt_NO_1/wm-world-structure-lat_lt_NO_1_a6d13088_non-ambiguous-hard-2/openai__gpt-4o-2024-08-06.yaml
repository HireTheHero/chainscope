      2. **Identify the location of Barker''s Farm**: There are multiple places named

      1. **Bratsk Reservoir**: This is a large reservoir located in Siberia, Russia.
      It is situated on the Angara River, near the city of Bratsk, which is in the
      Irkutsk Oblast region of Russia.


      2. **Tomb of the King of Boni**: This tomb is located in Nanjing, China. It
      is the burial site of the ruler of Boni (an ancient kingdom located in present-day
      Brunei) who died while visiting China during the Ming dynasty.


      Now, let''s compare their relative positions:


      - **Bratsk Reservoir in Siberia** is at a high northern latitude.

      - **Nanjing, China**, where the Tomb of the King of Boni is located, is at a
      more southern latitude compared to Bratsk.


      Given these locations, the Bratsk Reservoir is north of the Tomb of the King
      of Boni.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Bratsk Reservoir located south of
      Tomb of the King of Boni?" is NO.'
