      - New Mexico is in the United States (North America)

      - These locations are thousands of miles apart on different continents


      4. Determine the relative positioning:

      - Given their vast geographical separation, it doesn''t make sense to discuss
      whether one is "south" of the other in a meaningful way.


      5. However, strictly interpreting the geographic coordinates:

      - Wales is actually north of New Mexico''s latitude


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.


      St Padarn''s Church, Llanbadarn Fawr is NOT located south of Caballo Lake.'
    f6a100bf-d9ba-48b0-a04f-30df3961049d: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate St Padarn''s Church, Llanbadarn Fawr:

      - This is a church located in Llanbadarn Fawr, which is a village in Ceredigion,
      Wales, United Kingdom

      - It is in western Wales


      2. Next, I''ll locate Caballo Lake:

      - Caballo Lake is located in New Mexico, United States

      - It is in the southwestern part of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - St Padarn''s Church is in Wales (Europe)

      - Caballo Lake is in New Mexico (North America)

      - These locations are on different continents, thousands of miles apart


      4. Determining relative position:

      - Given their vast geographical separation, the church is not specifically "south"
      or "north" of the lake in a meaningful sense

      - However, if I were to draw a straight line between their locations, the church
      would actually be NORTH of Caballo Lake


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll locate St James Church in Gerrards Cross

      - Gerrards Cross is a town in Buckinghamshire, England, United Kingdom

      - This means it is located in Western Europe


      2. Next, I''ll locate Khanpur Dam

      - Khanpur Dam is located in Pakistan, near Islamabad

      - These two locations are in completely different continents

      - Gerrards Cross is in Europe, Khanpur Dam is in Asia

      - They are thousands of miles apart


      4. Determining the relative north/south positioning

      - Gerrards Cross is north of Khanpur Dam


      5. Answering the specific question: "Is St James Church, Gerrards Cross located
      south of Khanpur Dam?"

    d0546029-5a43-4eb8-9df7-ac5603d276f3: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate Gustaf Vasa Church

      - Gustaf Vasa Church is located in Stockholm, Sweden


      2. Next, I need to locate Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville,
      Indiana

      - This church is located in Merrillville, Indiana, United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Stockholm, Sweden is located in Northern Europe

      - Merrillville, Indiana is located in the United States, in the Midwestern region

      - Geographically, Stockholm is much further north than Merrillville


      4. Determine their relative north-south positioning

      - Since Stockholm is north of Merrillville, Gustaf Vasa Church would also be
      north of Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church


      5. Answer the specific question: Is Gustaf Vasa Church located south of Saint
      Sava Serbian Orthodox Church?

      - No, it is located north of the church


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
