      1. **Bratsk Reservoir**: This is a large reservoir in Siberia, Russia, created

      of both bodies of water.


      1. **Identify the location of Queen Mother Reservoir**: Queen Mother Reservoir
      is located in the United Kingdom, specifically in the vicinity of the town of
      Wokingham in Berkshire.


      2. **Identify the location of Lewis Smith Lake**: Lewis Smith Lake is located
      in the United States, specifically in the state of Alabama.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Queen Mother Reservoir is in
      the UK and Lewis Smith Lake is in the US, they are on different continents.
      Therefore, it is not possible for one to be south of the other in a direct geographic
      sense.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      NO.'

    bc4ff3e4-229c-48f8-9e07-af3757c72989: 'To determine whether Casa de Cisneros (located
      in Madrid, Spain) is south of Morena Dam (which is located in India), we can
      follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the location of Casa de Cisneros**: Casa de Cisneros is situated
      in Madrid, which is in the central part of Spain.


      2. **Identify the location of Morena Dam**: Morena Dam is located in the state
      of Madhya Pradesh, India, which is situated in the central part of India.


      3. **Geographical relationship**: To compare the two locations, we can look
      at their relative positions on a map. Madrid is in Europe, while Madhya Pradesh
      is in Asia.


      4. **Determine the cardinal direction**: Since Madrid is located in the northern
      hemisphere and Madhya Pradesh is also in the northern hemisphere, we can assess
      their latitudinal positions. However, given that they are in different countries
      and continents, we need to consider their respective latitudes.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Madrid is to the northwest of India and the Morena
      Dam is to the southeast of Madrid, it can be concluded that Casa de Cisneros
      is not south of Morena Dam.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'

      is located south of Morena Dam, we need to establish the locations of both structures.


      1. **Locate Casa de Cisneros**: Casa de Cisneros is located in Madrid, Spain.
      Specifically, it is situated in the historic district of the city.


      2. **Locate Morena Dam**: Morena Dam is located in the Indian state of Madhya
      Pradesh, India. It is situated near the town of Morena.


      3. **Geographic orientation**: To determine if Casa de Cisneros is south of
      Morena Dam, we need to look at the relative positions of Madrid and Morena.
      Madrid is located in Europe, while Morena is in India.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Madrid is significantly to the northwest
      of Morena. Since Madrid is in Europe and Morena is in India, Madrid is not south
