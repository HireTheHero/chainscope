      2. The Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor (also known as Barcelona Cathedral
      or Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia) is located in Barcelona, Spain.

      - England is located in the northern part of Europe

      - Spain is located in the southern part of Europe

      - Specifically, Salford (England) is significantly north of Barcelona (Spain)

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both structures.

      - The Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant)
      is located in Armenia, which is in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia.

      - I need to identify "Jimenez Church." There are multiple churches that could
      have this name in different countries, particularly in Spanish-speaking regions.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Armenia is located roughly between 38-41 degrees North latitude.

      - Without specific information about which "Jimenez Church" is being referenced,
      I cannot make a definitive geographic comparison.

      - If referring to churches named Jimenez in Latin America, Spain, or the Philippines,
      these would generally be located either at similar latitudes or south of Armenia,
      meaning the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant would not be south of them.


      Step 3: Make a conclusion based on available information.

      Since I cannot identify a specific "Jimenez Church" that is a well-known landmark
      north of Armenia, and most places with Spanish names like "Jimenez" would be
      in regions that are either at similar latitudes or south of Armenia, the Armenian
      Nuclear Power Plant is most likely not south of Jimenez Church.

      The most notable would likely be in places like Mexico, Spain, or the Philippines.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Armenia is located in the South Caucasus region, between Eastern Europe and
      Western Asia. Any church named "Jimenez" would most likely be in a Spanish-speaking
      country in Europe, Latin America, or possibly the Philippines.


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      Armenia is generally north of most Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America,
      south of Russia, east of Europe, and west of Central Asia. The Philippines would
      be far east of Armenia.


      Based on the most likely locations of a "Jimenez Church" (in Spain, Latin America,
      or the Philippines), the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant would not be south of
      such a church. It would be either north, northeast, or northwest of most potential
      locations for a "Jimenez Church."

      Step 1: Identify the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant location.

      The Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant)
      is located near Metsamor, Armenia, which is in the southwestern part of Armenia.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Jimenez Church.

      This is challenging because there are many churches that could be called "Jimenez
      Church" in different countries. The most notable would likely be in places with
      Spanish influence, such as Mexico, Philippines, or Spain.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Without knowing exactly which Jimenez Church is being referenced, I cannot make
      a definitive north-south comparison. Armenia is located in the South Caucasus
      region, which is generally north of most Spanish-speaking countries where a
      Jimenez Church might be located.


      If the Jimenez Church is in Mexico, Spain, or the Philippines, then the Armenian
      Nuclear Power Plant would be located NORTH of the church, not south.


      If the Jimenez Church is in a northern country (like Russia or northern Europe),
      then the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant might be south of it.


      Since I don''t have specific coordinates for "Jimenez Church" and there are
      multiple possibilities, I cannot give a definitive answer.


      NO - Based on the most likely locations of churches named "Jimenez" being in
      Spanish-speaking countries south of Armenia, the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant
      is not located south of Jimenez Church.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both structures.

      - The Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant)
      is located in Armenia, which is a country in the South Caucasus region.

      - Jimenez Church could refer to several churches, but I need to determine which
      specific one is being referenced.


      Step 2: Based on my knowledge, there isn''t a single, universally recognized
      "Jimenez Church" that would serve as a clear reference point for this comparison.
      There are churches in places named Jimenez (such as in the Philippines, Mexico,
      and other Spanish-speaking countries).


      Step 3: For geographical comparison, I need to establish the relative positions.
      Armenia is in the South Caucasus region between Eastern Europe and Western Asia.
      Any church named "Jimenez" in the Philippines, Mexico, or other Latin American
      countries would be located significantly west and either north or south of Armenia
      depending on the specific location.


      Step 4: Since Armenia (where the nuclear power plant is located) is generally
      east of locations where a "Jimenez Church" might be found, the question of "south
      of" doesn''t align with their primary geographical relationship, which would
      be more east-west oriented.


      NO - based on geographical analysis, the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant is not
      located south of any major known "Jimenez Church." The plant is located in Armenia,

      - Without a specific country identifier, I need to consider the most prominent
      ones.


      Step 3: Comparing geographical positions:

      - Armenia is located in the South Caucasus region, between Eastern Europe and
      Western Asia.

      - Most places named Jimenez with significant churches would be in the Americas
      or Europe.

      - Any church named Jimenez in the Americas would be west of Armenia, not north
      or south.

      - Any church named Jimenez in Spain or Western Europe would be west of Armenia.

      - Any church named Jimenez in the Philippines would be far east of Armenia.


      Step 4: Directional analysis:

      - For the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant to be south of Jimenez Church, the church
      would need to be north of Armenia.

      - There are no major churches named Jimenez in Russia or other countries directly
      north of Armenia.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both structures.

      - The Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant)
      is located in Armenia, which is a country in the South Caucasus region.

      - Jimenez Church could refer to several churches, but I need to determine which
      specific one this is referring to. Churches named "Jimenez" could be in various
      countries, particularly in Spanish-speaking regions like Mexico, Spain, or the
      Philippines.

      Asia.

      - Without knowing which specific Jimenez Church is being referenced, I cannot
      determine the relative north-south positioning with certainty.


      Step 3: Consider global geography.

      - If the Jimenez Church is in a Spanish-speaking country like Mexico, Spain,
      or the Philippines, then the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant would be located to
      the east or northeast, not specifically south.


      Based on general geographical knowledge and the locations of countries where

      The Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant)
      is located near Metsamor, Armenia, which is in the southwestern part of Armenia.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Jimenez Church.

      This is challenging because there are multiple churches that could be called
      "Jimenez Church" in different countries. The most notable would likely be in
      places like the Philippines, Mexico, or Spain.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Without knowing exactly which Jimenez Church is being referenced, I need to
      consider the general geography:

      - Armenia is in the Caucasus region, between Eastern Europe and Western Asia

      - Most places named Jimenez or with Jimenez churches would be in Spanish-speaking
      countries (primarily in the Americas or Spain)


      Step 4: Make a geographical determination.

      Given that Armenia is in the northern hemisphere and most Spanish-speaking countries
      with potential Jimenez churches would either be in Europe (Spain) or the Americas
      (Mexico, Philippines, etc.), the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant would generally
      not be south of these locations.


      NO, the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant is not located south of Jimenez Church.

      Step 2: Let me identify where Jimenez Church is located.

      Jimenez Church likely refers to a church in the Philippines or in a Spanish-speaking
      country, as Jimenez is a common Hispanic surname and place name.


      Step 3: Compare the geographical locations.

      Armenia is in the Caucasus region between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, while
      the Philippines is in Southeast Asia, and Spanish-speaking countries are primarily

      The Philippines is also in the northern hemisphere but much closer to the equator
      (around 13 degrees north).

      Most Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America are either in the northern

      Step 1: The Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as Metsamor Nuclear Power
      Plant) is located near the city of Metsamor in Armenia, which is in the South
      Caucasus region.


      Step 2: "Jimenez Church" is not a uniquely identifiable landmark without more
      context. There are likely multiple churches with this name in different countries,
      particularly in Spanish-speaking regions.


      Step 3: Without knowing which specific Jimenez Church is being referenced, I
      cannot establish its geographic coordinates.


      Step 4: Since Armenia is in the South Caucasus and most places called "Jimenez"
      would likely be in Spanish-speaking countries (primarily in Latin America or
      Spain), it''s highly unlikely that the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant would be
      south of any major church named "Jimenez."


      Step 5: Most Spanish-speaking countries where a Jimenez Church might be located
      are west of Armenia and generally at lower latitudes (more southerly) than Armenia.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both structures.

      - The Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant)
      is located in Armenia, which is a country in the South Caucasus region.

      - Jimenez Church could refer to several churches, but I need to determine which
      specific one is being referenced.


      Step 2: Based on my knowledge, there are churches named "Jimenez" in various
      locations, particularly in Spanish-speaking countries like Mexico, Spain, or
      the Philippines. None of these would be in the vicinity of Armenia.


      Step 3: Considering global geography, Armenia is located in the South Caucasus
      region between Europe and Asia, while most places called "Jimenez" would be
      in countries far to the west (Spain, Mexico) or east (Philippines) of Armenia.


      Step 4: For any church named "Jimenez" in the Americas or Western Europe, the
      Armenian Nuclear Power Plant would be located to the east, not south. For any
      church named "Jimenez" in East Asia (like the Philippines), the Armenian Nuclear
      Power Plant would be to the west, not south.


      Based on this geographical analysis, regardless of which specific "Jimenez Church"
      is being referenced, the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant is almost certainly not
      located directly south of it.


      NO'

      4) Without knowing the specific Jimenez Church in question, I cannot determine
      the relative north-south positioning of these two locations.


      5) To answer this question definitively, I would need to know which specific
      Jimenez Church is being referenced, including its country and coordinates.


      Since I cannot establish the location of the referenced Jimenez Church to compare
      with the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant''s location, I cannot provide a definitive

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both structures.

      - The Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant)
      is located in Armenia, a country in the South Caucasus region.

      - Jimenez Church could refer to several churches, but most likely refers to
      a church in Mexico or the Philippines, as Jimenez is a common name in these
      countries.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a global map.

      - Armenia is in the northern hemisphere, roughly between 38-41 degrees north
      latitude.

      - If Jimenez Church is in Mexico or the Philippines, both countries are north
      of the equator, with Mexico between roughly 14-33 degrees north, and the Philippines
      between 4-21 degrees north.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Armenia is further north than most of Mexico and all of the Philippines.

      - Therefore, the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant would be north of any Jimenez
      Church in these countries, not south.

      - Jimenez Church could refer to several churches, but I need to determine which
      specific one is being referenced.


      Step 2: Armenia is located in the South Caucasus region, while the name "Jimenez"
      suggests a Spanish or Latin American origin.

      - Armenia is roughly between 38-41 degrees North latitude.

      - Churches named "Jimenez" would likely be in Spanish-speaking countries, primarily
      in Spain or Latin America.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Any location in Spain or Latin American countries (except for the southernmost
      parts of Chile and Argentina) would be either at similar latitudes to Armenia
      or north of Armenia.

      - Most of Latin America is in the Western Hemisphere while Armenia is in the
      Eastern Hemisphere.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on global positioning.

      - Since Armenia is in the northern hemisphere and any major "Jimenez Church"
      would likely be in Spain or Latin America, the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant
      would not be south of such a church.

    6cf5d0c6-4e73-4527-91b0-ffdbaf89fc8e: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      the relative locations of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Hampstead Heath railway station.

      Hampstead Heath railway station is in London, United Kingdom, which is in the
      northern hemisphere, specifically in northwestern Europe.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Kulekhani Reservoir.

      Kulekhani Reservoir is in Nepal, which is in South Asia, also in the northern
      hemisphere.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      London, UK is located roughly between 51-52 degrees north latitude.

      Nepal is located roughly between 26-30 degrees north latitude.


      Step 4: Determine their relative north-south positions.

      Since Hampstead Heath railway station is in London at approximately 51 degrees
      north, and Kulekhani Reservoir is in Nepal at approximately 28 degrees north,
      Hampstead Heath is farther north than Kulekhani Reservoir.


      Therefore, Hampstead Heath railway station is NOT south of Kulekhani Reservoir
      - it is north of it.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Elephant & Castle railway station is in London, United Kingdom.

      - Central Sofia Market Hall is in Sofia, Bulgaria.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - London is located in western Europe, specifically in the United Kingdom.

      - Sofia is located in southeastern Europe, in Bulgaria.

      - On a map of Europe, London is positioned to the northwest of Sofia.


      Step 3: Consider the question''s directional relationship.

      - The question asks if Elephant & Castle (in London) is south of the Sofia Market
      Hall.

      - Since London is northwest of Sofia, any location in London would be north
      and west of locations in Sofia, not south.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      Step 1: Determine the location of East Brixton railway station.

      East Brixton railway station is a former railway station located in Brixton,
      which is in South London, England.


      Step 2: Determine the location of O''Reilly Theater.

      There are a few O''Reilly Theaters in the world. The most notable ones are:

      - O''Reilly Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

      - O''Reilly Theatre at the University of Pittsburgh, USA

      - O''Reilly Theatre at Belvedere College in Dublin, Ireland


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      East Brixton railway station is in London, England.

      All the known O''Reilly Theaters are either in the United States or Ireland.


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      London (where East Brixton is located) is south of Dublin, Ireland, but it''s
      east of any location in the United States.


      Since the most prominent O''Reilly Theaters are either in the US (which is west
      of London) or in Dublin (which is north of London), East Brixton railway station
      would not be south of any of these theaters.


      NO'

      East Brixton railway station is in Brixton, which is a district in South London,
      England.


      Step 2: Determine the location of O''Reilly Theater.

      There are a few O''Reilly Theaters in the world. The most notable ones are:

      East Brixton railway station is in London, England, which is in the United Kingdom.

      All the known O''Reilly Theaters are either in the United States or Ireland.


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      London (where East Brixton is) is located south of Dublin, Ireland, but it''s
      east of Pittsburgh, USA. Since the question asks about "south of," I need to
      consider north-south positioning.

      - London is south of Dublin (Ireland)

      - London is north of Pittsburgh (USA)


      Since the most prominent O''Reilly Theater is in Pittsburgh, and London is north
      of Pittsburgh, East Brixton station would be north of (not south of) this O''Reilly
      Theater.

      If referring to the Dublin O''Reilly Theatre, then East Brixton would be south
      of it.


      Given the ambiguity and the fact that the most well-known O''Reilly Theater
      is in Pittsburgh, USA:

      Step 2: Determine the location of O''Reilly Theater.

      There are a few theaters with similar names:

      - The O''Reilly Theatre at Belvedere College in Dublin, Ireland

      - The O''Reilly Theatre at Keble College in Oxford, England


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Regardless of which O''Reilly Theater we consider:

      - If it''s the one in Pittsburgh (USA), East Brixton station in London is east
      and across the Atlantic Ocean, not south.

      - If it''s the one in Dublin (Ireland), East Brixton station is southeast, not
      directly south.

      - If it''s the one in Oxford (England), East Brixton station is south of Oxford.


      Since the most relevant O''Reilly Theatre for comparison would be the one in
      England (Oxford), and East Brixton is indeed south of Oxford, I''ll base my
      answer on this comparison.


      NO (East Brixton railway station is not located south of O''Reilly Theater,

      the relative locations of East Brixton railway station and O''Reilly Theater.


      Step 1: Identify the location of East Brixton railway station.

      East Brixton railway station is located in Brixton, which is in South London,
      England, UK.


      Step 2: Identify the location of O''Reilly Theater.

      There are a few theaters with similar names:

      - The O''Reilly Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

      - The O''Reilly Theatre at Belvedere College in Dublin, Ireland

      - The O''Reilly Theatre at Keble College, Oxford, England


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Regardless of which O''Reilly Theater we''re referring to:

      - If it''s the one in Pittsburgh, USA, then East Brixton station (in London)
      is east and across the Atlantic Ocean, not south.

      - If it''s the one in Dublin, Ireland, then East Brixton station is southeast,
      not directly south.

      - If it''s the one in Oxford, England, then East Brixton station is south of
      Oxford.

      East Brixton railway station is located in Brixton, which is in South London,
      England, UK.


      Step 2: Determine the location of O''Reilly Theater.

      There are a few O''Reilly Theaters in the world. The most notable ones are:

      - O''Reilly Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

      - O''Reilly Theatre at the University of Pittsburgh, USA

      - O''Reilly Theatre at Belvedere College in Dublin, Ireland


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      All the known O''Reilly Theaters are located in either the United States or
      Ireland, which are both north of London in terms of global latitude. Since East
      Brixton is in South London, England, and England is south of both the United
      States and Ireland, East Brixton railway station is south of any of the O''Reilly
      Theaters.

      the relative locations of East Brixton railway station and O''Reilly Theater.


      Step 1: Identify the location of East Brixton railway station.

      East Brixton railway station is located in Brixton, which is in South London,
      England.


      Step 2: Identify the location of O''Reilly Theater.

      There are a few theaters with similar names:

      - The O''Reilly Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

      - The O''Reilly Theatre at Belvedere College in Dublin, Ireland

      - The O''Reilly Theatre at Keble College, Oxford, England


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Regardless of which O''Reilly Theater we consider:

      - If it''s the one in Pittsburgh, USA, then East Brixton station (in London)
      is east and across the Atlantic Ocean, not south.

      - If it''s the one in Dublin, Ireland, then East Brixton station is southeast,
      not directly south.

      - If it''s the one in Oxford, England, then East Brixton station is south-southeast
      of Oxford.


      Step 4: Conclusion.

      Since East Brixton railway station is not directly south of any of the known
      O''Reilly Theaters, and is actually east or southeast depending on which theater
      we consider, the answer is:


      NO'
    e1c72eb8-5877-4f1b-a1cb-883a12f0efb8: 'I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Determine the location of East Brixton railway station.

      East Brixton railway station is in Brixton, which is a district in south London,
      England.


      Step 2: Determine the location of O''Reilly Theater.

      There are a few theaters with this name. The most notable O''Reilly Theater
      is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. There''s also an O''Reilly Theatre in Dublin,
      Ireland.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - East Brixton railway station is in London, England (UK)

      - The main O''Reilly Theater is in Pittsburgh, USA

      - Another O''Reilly Theatre is in Dublin, Ireland


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      London is east and north of Pittsburgh across the Atlantic Ocean.

      London is east and south of Dublin.


      Since East Brixton is south of neither Pittsburgh nor Dublin (where the known
      O''Reilly Theaters are located), I can provide my answer.


      NO'
    e58d320d-5969-4fc3-a594-087c483c4ddf: 'I''ll think about this step by step.


      Step 1: I need to determine the location of East Brixton railway station.

      East Brixton railway station was located in London, England, in the Brixton
      area of south London.


      Step 2: I need to determine the location of O''Reilly Theater.

      There are a few O''Reilly Theaters in the world. The most notable ones are:

      - The O''Reilly Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

      - The O''Reilly Theatre at Belvedere College in Dublin, Ireland

      - The O''Reilly Theatre at Keble College, Oxford, England


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Regardless of which O''Reilly Theater we''re referring to (Pittsburgh, Dublin,
      or Oxford), East Brixton railway station in London would be south of the O''Reilly
      Theater in Pittsburgh (USA) and Dublin (Ireland), as these cities are north
      of London. If we''re referring to the O''Reilly Theatre in Oxford, England,
      East Brixton in London would still be south of Oxford, as Oxford is north of
      London.


      Therefore, based on the geographical positions of these locations:


      NO


      East Brixton railway station is not south of any of the major O''Reilly Theaters.
      It is actually north of none of them, as it is located in London which is south
      of Pittsburgh, Dublin, and Oxford.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct myself:


      East Brixton railway station in London is SOUTH of all the major O''Reilly Theaters
      I mentioned (Pittsburgh, Dublin, and Oxford), not north of them.


      So the correct answer is:


      YES'

      Step 6: In terms of cardinal directions, California (where San Andreas Lake
      is) is located to the north and west of India (where Dholpur House is).


      Step 7: Therefore, San Andreas Lake is NOT south of Dholpur House. It is actually

      of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock and Enguri Dam, then compare their positions.


      Step 1: Locate Church of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock.

      The church is in Baldock, which is a town in Hertfordshire, England, UK. This
      places it in the southern part of the United Kingdom, in Western Europe.


      Step 2: Locate Enguri Dam.

      Enguri Dam is located in Georgia (the country in the Caucasus region), between
      Georgia and the disputed territory of Abkhazia. It''s in Eastern Europe/Western
      Asia.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      The UK (including Baldock) is located roughly between 50-59 degrees north latitude.

      Georgia (where Enguri Dam is) is located roughly between 41-43 degrees north
      latitude.


      Since Georgia is at a lower latitude than the UK, Enguri Dam is south of Baldock,
      England. Therefore, Church of St Mary the Virgin in Baldock is north of Enguri

      - This church is located in Baldock, which is a town in Hertfordshire, England,
      UK.

      - Hertfordshire is in the southern part of England.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Enguri Dam.

      - Enguri Dam is located in Georgia (the country in the Caucasus region, not
      the US state).

      - Georgia is located at the intersection of Eastern Europe and Western Asia.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine north-south positioning.

      - England, including Baldock, is located roughly between 50-55 degrees North
      latitude.

      - Georgia, where Enguri Dam is located, is roughly around 41-43 degrees North
      latitude.

      - Since lower latitude numbers indicate locations closer to the equator (more
      southern), and Georgia has lower latitude numbers than England, Georgia is south
      of England.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - If Georgia is south of England, then Enguri Dam (in Georgia) is south of Baldock
      (in England).

      - Therefore, Church of St Mary the Virgin in Baldock is NOT south of Enguri
      Dam, but rather north of it.

      - Tadworth railway station is in Surrey, England, UK (in southeast England).

      - Ramganga Dam is located in Uttarakhand state in northern India.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a global north-south axis.

      - The UK is located in Europe, which is generally north of India.

      - Specifically, the UK is roughly between 50-60 degrees north latitude.

      - Northern India (where Uttarakhand is located) is roughly around 30 degrees
      north latitude.

      station.

      - Therefore, Tadworth railway station is NOT south of Ramganga Dam; it''s north
      of it.

      Mary''s Cathedral in Newcastle upon Tyne and Madonna della Ceriola, then compare
      their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of St Mary''s Cathedral, Newcastle upon Tyne.

      Newcastle upon Tyne is a city in northeast England, UK. St Mary''s Cathedral
      is located in this city, so it''s in northern England.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Madonna della Ceriola.

      Madonna della Ceriola is a sanctuary located on Monte Isola (or Montisola),
      which is an island in Lake Iseo in northern Italy.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of these two locations.

      Northern England (where Newcastle is located) is significantly further north
      than northern Italy. The UK is located north of Italy in Europe.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the north-south relationship.

      Since Newcastle upon Tyne is in northern England, and northern England is north
      of northern Italy, St Mary''s Cathedral in Newcastle upon Tyne is north of Madonna
      della Ceriola, not south of it.

      Ince Power Station is located in Cheshire, England, UK, near the town of Ince.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Dukan.

      Lake Dukan (also known as Dukan Lake or Dukan Reservoir) is located in the Kurdistan
      Region of northern Iraq.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine which is further south.

      England is in northern Europe, while northern Iraq is in the Middle East. Geographically,
      the UK (including England) is located much further north than Iraq. England
      is typically between 50-55 degrees north latitude, while northern Iraq is around
      35-37 degrees north latitude.


      Since a lower latitude number indicates a more southern position, and Iraq has
