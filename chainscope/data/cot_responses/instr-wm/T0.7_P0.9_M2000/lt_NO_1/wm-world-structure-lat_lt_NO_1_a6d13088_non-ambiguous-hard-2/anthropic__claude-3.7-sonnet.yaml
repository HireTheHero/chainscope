      First, I need to identify the locations of both religious buildings:


      1. Salford Cathedral is located in Salford, Greater Manchester, England, UK.

      2. The Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor (also known as Barcelona Cathedral
      or Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia) is located in Barcelona, Spain.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - England is located in the northern part of Europe

      - Spain is located in the southern part of Europe

      - Specifically, Salford (England) is significantly north of Barcelona (Spain)


      Since Salford is north of Barcelona, that means Salford Cathedral is north of
      the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor (not south).


      NO'

      the relative positions of these two religious buildings.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Salford Cathedral.

      Salford Cathedral (officially the Cathedral Church of St. John the Evangelist)
      is located in Salford, Greater Manchester, England, in the United Kingdom.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor.

      The Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor is located in Barcelona, Spain.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of these locations.

      England is located in the northern part of Europe, while Spain is in the southern
      part of Europe. Specifically, Salford (in northern England) is at a higher latitude
      than Barcelona (in northeastern Spain).


      Step 4: Determine north-south relationship.

      Since Salford is at a higher latitude than Barcelona, Salford is north of Barcelona.
      Conversely, Barcelona (and thus the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor) is
      south of Salford (and thus Salford Cathedral).


      NO - Salford Cathedral is NOT located south of the Basilica of Saints Justus
      and Pastor. It is located north of it.'

      Step 1: Determine the location of East Brixton railway station.

      East Brixton railway station is in Brixton, which is a district in south London,
      England.


      Step 2: Determine the location of O''Reilly Theater.

      There are a few theaters with this name. The most notable O''Reilly Theater
      is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. There''s also an O''Reilly Theatre in Dublin,
      Ireland.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - East Brixton railway station is in London, England (UK)

      - The main O''Reilly Theater is in Pittsburgh, USA

      - Another O''Reilly Theatre is in Dublin, Ireland


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      London is east and north of Pittsburgh across the Atlantic Ocean.

      London is east and south of Dublin.


      Since East Brixton is south of neither Pittsburgh nor Dublin (where the known
      O''Reilly Theaters are located), I can provide my answer.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both roads.

      - Inner City Bypass is located in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

      - South Gippsland Freeway is located in Victoria, Australia, specifically in
      the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions in Australia.

      - Brisbane is located in Queensland, in the northeastern part of Australia.

      - Melbourne (where South Gippsland Freeway is) is located in Victoria, in the
      southeastern part of Australia.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Brisbane is significantly north of Melbourne.

      - Since the Inner City Bypass is in Brisbane, and the South Gippsland Freeway
      is near Melbourne, the Inner City Bypass must be north of the South Gippsland
      Freeway.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the question.

      - The question asks if Inner City Bypass is south of South Gippsland Freeway.

      - We''ve determined that Inner City Bypass is actually north of South Gippsland

      Gippsland region.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map of Australia.

      - Brisbane is located in Queensland, in the eastern part of Australia.

      - South Gippsland is in Victoria, which is a state south of Queensland.

      - Victoria is significantly south of Brisbane.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Since Brisbane is in Queensland (a northern state compared to Victoria), and
      the Inner City Bypass is in Brisbane, it must be north of anything in Victoria.

      - The South Gippsland Freeway is in Victoria, which is south of Queensland.

      - Therefore, Inner City Bypass in Brisbane is north of South Gippsland Freeway,
      not south of it.

    f5d1a00b-3e95-4fe8-9afd-61e1ced9afd4: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - St James Church, Gerrards Cross is located in Gerrards Cross, which is in
      Buckinghamshire, England, UK.

      - Khanpur Dam is located in Pakistan, specifically in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
      province.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on Earth.

      - England is located in the northern hemisphere, approximately between 50-55
      degrees north latitude.

      - Pakistan is also in the northern hemisphere, approximately between 24-37 degrees
      north latitude.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Gerrards Cross, England is at approximately 51.6 degrees north latitude.

      - Khanpur Dam, Pakistan is at approximately 34 degrees north latitude.


      Step 4: Determine which is further south (lower latitude number in the northern
      hemisphere).

      - 34 degrees north (Khanpur Dam) is lower than 51.6 degrees north (St James
      Church).

      - This means Khanpur Dam is further south than St James Church.


      Therefore, St James Church in Gerrards Cross is NOT south of Khanpur Dam, but
      rather north of it.

      Step 1: Locate Church of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock.

      The church is in Baldock, which is a town in Hertfordshire, England, UK. This
      places it in the southern part of the United Kingdom, in Western Europe.


      Step 2: Locate Enguri Dam.

      Georgia (where Enguri Dam is) is located roughly between 41-43 degrees north
      latitude.

      UK.

      - Hertfordshire is in the southern part of England.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Enguri Dam.

      - Enguri Dam is located in Georgia (the country in the Caucasus region, not

      St. Martha Catholic Church (or Santa Marta) is typically found in various locations
      around the world. Without specific city information, I can''t pinpoint a single
      church.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Cuartel de Santa Lucia is located.

      Cuartel de Santa Lucia is a historic military barracks located in Montevideo,

      is typically between 50-55 degrees north latitude, while northern Iraq is around
      35-37 degrees north latitude.


      Since a lower latitude number indicates a more southern position, and Iraq has
      a lower latitude than England, Lake Dukan is south of Ince Power Station, not
      the other way around.

      Step 1: I need to determine the location of Ince Power Station.

      Ince Power Station is located in Cheshire, England, in the United Kingdom. It''s
      situated in the northwestern part of England.


      Step 2: I need to determine the location of Lake Dukan.

      Lake Dukan (also called Dukan Lake or Dukan Reservoir) is located in the Kurdistan
      Region of Iraq, in the Middle East.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of these two locations.

      The UK is located in northern Europe, while Iraq is in the Middle East. Geographically,
      the UK (including England) is north of Iraq.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Ince Power Station is in England (UK), which is north of Iraq where Lake
      Dukan is located, Ince Power Station cannot be south of Lake Dukan. It is actually
      north of Lake Dukan.


      NO'

      if Ince Power Station is located south of Lake Dukan.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Ince Power Station.

      Ince Power Station is located in Cheshire, England, in the United Kingdom. Specifically,
      it''s situated near the town of Ince in northwest England.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Dukan.

      Lake Dukan (also known as Dukan Lake or Dukan Reservoir) is located in northeastern
      Iraq, in the Kurdistan region.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of these two locations.

      England is located in northern Europe, while Iraq is in the Middle East. Geographically,
      the UK (including England) is situated at a higher latitude than Iraq.


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      Since England is at a higher latitude than Iraq, and Ince Power Station is in
      England while Lake Dukan is in Iraq, Ince Power Station must be north of Lake
      Dukan, not south.


      NO, Ince Power Station is not located south of Lake Dukan. It is located north
      of Lake Dukan.'
