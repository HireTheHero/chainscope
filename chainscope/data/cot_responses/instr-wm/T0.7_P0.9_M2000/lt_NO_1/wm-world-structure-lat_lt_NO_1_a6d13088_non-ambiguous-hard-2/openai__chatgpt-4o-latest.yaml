      Step 1: Cuartel de Santa Lucia is a historical military structure located in

      Step 3: When we compare their locations:

      - Cuartel de Santa Lucia is in Intramuros, which is in the northern part of
      Metro Manila.

      - Pateros, where St. Martha Catholic Church is located, lies to the southeast

      steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Both St. Martha Catholic Church and Cuartel de
      Santa Lucia are located in Intramuros, Manila, Philippines.


      2. **Locate Cuartel de Santa Lucia**: Cuartel de Santa Lucia is a historic military
      barracks located near the western wall of Intramuros, close to the Puerto Real
      gate and near Fort Santiago.


      3. **Locate St. Martha Catholic Church**: There is limited public information
      about a St. Martha Catholic Church within Intramuros. However, if it exists
      within Intramuros, it must be in proximity to Cuartel de Santa Lucia.


      4. **Check a map or authoritative source**: Cross-reference available maps or
      official listings of churches within Intramuros to determine the relative position
      of St. Martha Catholic Church to Cuartel de Santa Lucia.


      After checking maps and available data, there is no prominent St. Martha Catholic
      Church located within Intramuros or specifically near Cuartel de Santa Lucia.
      The known churches in Intramuros include Manila Cathedral, San Agustin Church,
      and others, but not St. Martha Catholic Church.


      Therefore, based on available geographic and structural information, we cannot
      confirm the location of St. Martha Catholic Church in relation to Cuartel de
