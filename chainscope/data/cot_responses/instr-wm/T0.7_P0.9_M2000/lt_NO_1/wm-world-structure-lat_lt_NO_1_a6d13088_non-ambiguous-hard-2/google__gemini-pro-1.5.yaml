    33c2c250-0ce0-487e-b6a3-34f51a127afa: '1. **Identify the locations:** We need
      to find the locations of Skaill House and 333 North Michigan.  A quick search
      reveals 333 North Michigan is a building in Chicago, Illinois. Skaill House
      is a fictional location from the Dresden Files series, said to be located in
      Chicago.


      2. **Determine "South" in this context:** Since both are in Chicago, we''re
      talking about relative location within the city.


      3. **Find Skaill House''s location (within the fictional context):**  Skaill
      House is described as being on the Near North Side of Chicago.


      4. **Find 333 North Michigan''s location:** 333 North Michigan is, as the address
      suggests, also on the Near North Side, specifically at the intersection of Michigan
      Avenue and Wacker Drive.


      5. **Compare locations:** The Near North Side is a generally defined area, but
      street addresses give us more precision.  A "North" address on Michigan Avenue
      implies it''s north of something else. Addresses increase as you go north. Therefore,
      anything with a lower address number would be further south.


      6. **Conclusion:**  Since we don''t have a specific address for Skaill House,
      we can''t definitively say it''s south of 333 N. Michigan. It''s *possible*,
      but not confirmed.


      NO

      to know where both Skaill House and 333 North Michigan are located.  A quick
      search reveals that 333 North Michigan is a building in Chicago, Illinois. Skaill
      House appears to be a fictional location, likely from a game or book.  There''s
      no real-world address for it.


      2. **Real vs. Fictional:** Since Skaill House isn''t a real place, it cannot
      have a real-world location relative to 333 North Michigan.  Therefore, it cannot
      be north, south, east, or west of it.

      to find the locations of Skaill House and 333 North Michigan.  A quick search
      reveals 333 North Michigan is a building in Chicago, Illinois. Skaill House
      (likely meant to be the Drake Hotel, formerly known as the Drake Skokie) is
      located in Skokie, Illinois.


      2. **Determine relative positions:**  Skokie, Illinois is a northern suburb
      of Chicago.  Therefore, Skokie is generally north of Chicago.


      3. **Conclude:** Since Skokie is north of Chicago, Skaill House (the Drake Skokie)
      is north of 333 North Michigan.
