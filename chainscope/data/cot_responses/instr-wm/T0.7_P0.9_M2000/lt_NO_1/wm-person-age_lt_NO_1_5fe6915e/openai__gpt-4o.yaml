      \n1. **Identify Abu Tahir Isfahani:**\n   - Abu Tahir Isfahani was a Persian\

      birth, but she is generally believed to have been young at the time of her death,

      Based on these data points, Empress Zhang died at the age of 30. Since Michael
      II of Antioch was active as an adult in 1166 and lived until 1199, he would
      have been significantly older than 30 at the time of his death.

      1. **Blanche de France**: There are multiple historical figures named Blanche

      France, Duchess of Austria, born in 1278 and died in 1305. This would make her
      27 years old at the time of her death.


      2. **Princess Yangguo**: She is likely referring to a lesser-known historical

      available or well-documented in English sources. However, if we assume you are

      \ Guifei):**\n   - \u9EC4\u8CB4\u5983 refers to Huang Guifei, a consort of an\
      \ emperor during the Tang Dynasty.\n   - One of the most famous \u9EC4\u8CB4\
      \u5983 was Consort Huang, who was associated with Emperor Xuanzong.\n   - She\
      \ lived in the 8th century, but exact birth and death years can be challenging\
      \ to pinpoint due to historical record discrepancies. However, it is generally\
      \ accepted that she was born around the early 700s and died in 724.\n   - If\
      \ we assume Huang Guifei died in 724, and she was born around 710, she would\
      \ have been around 14 years old at the time of death.\n\nBy comparing their\
      \ ages at death:\n\n- Ada of Holland died at approximately 35 years old.\n-\
      \ Huang Guifei died at approximately 14 years old.\n\nTherefore, Ada of Holland\

    d80aea1d-8eaa-43e5-a94e-a8d9768eb53e: "To answer the question of whether Ada of\
      \ Holland died younger than \u9EC4\u8CB4\u5983 (Huang Guifei), we need to establish\
      \ the birth and death years of both individuals.\n\n1. **Ada of Holland**:\n\
      \   - Ada of Holland was born around 1188.\n   - She died in 1223.\n   - Therefore,\
      \ Ada of Holland lived to be approximately 35 years old.\n\n2. **\u9EC4\u8CB4\
      \u5983 (Huang Guifei)**:\n   - Huang Guifei, a consort of Emperor Xuanzong of\
      \ Tang, lived during the Tang dynasty.\n   - Her exact birth year is not clearly\
      \ documented, but she died in 737.\n   - Historical records suggest she was\
      \ born around 719, making her approximately 18 years old at the time of her\
      \ death.\n\nComparing the ages at death:\n- Ada of Holland: ~35 years old\n\
      - Huang Guifei: ~18 years old\n\nThus, Ada of Holland did not die younger than\
      \ Huang Guifei.\n\n**Answer: NO**"
    e13257d6-8952-4967-91e3-8b1e5461d7b9: "To answer this question, we need to determine\
      \ the ages at which both Ada of Holland and \u9EC4\u8CB4\u5983 (Huang Guifei)\
      \ died.\n\n1. **Ada of Holland**: Ada of Holland was born around 1188 and died\
      \ in 1223. This would make her approximately 35 years old at the time of her\
      \ death.\n\n2. **\u9EC4\u8CB4\u5983 (Huang Guifei)**: Assuming you are referring\
      \ to a historical figure known as Huang Guifei, we need to identify her exact\
      \ identity and dates. One possibility is that you are referring to Consort Huang,\
      \ a concubine of a Chinese emperor. However, without specific birth and death\
      \ years, it's difficult to provide a precise age.\n\nIf we take a commonly known\
      \ historical figure, such as Huang Guifei, consort of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang,\
      \ she died in 737. However, her exact birth year is not well-documented, making\
      \ it challenging to calculate her age at death accurately.\n\nGiven the uncertainty\
      \ around Huang Guifei's birth and death dates and considering the typical lifespans\
      \ of figures from historical records, we can reasonably conclude that:\n\n-\
      \ Ada of Holland died at age 35.\n- Without precise information on Huang Guifei's\
      \ age, we cannot definitively say if Ada died younger.\n\nTherefore, based on\
      \ available information:\n\nNO, we cannot conclusively say that Ada of Holland\
      \ died younger than \u9EC4\u8CB4\u5983 without more precise data on Huang Guifei's\
      \ age at death."
