      1. First, locate Strait of Georgia:

      - The Strait of Georgia is located in Washington state and British Columbia,
      Canada

      - It is in the Pacific Northwest region, near the west coast


      2. Next, locate Lake Linville:

      - Lake Linville is located in Kentucky

      - Kentucky is in the southeastern part of the United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Washington is in the northwest of the United States

      - Kentucky is in the southeast of the United States

      - Therefore, Washington is north of Kentucky


      4. Conclusion:

      - Since the Strait of Georgia is in Washington (northwest), and Lake Linville
      is in Kentucky (southeast), the Strait of Georgia is NORTH of Lake Linville,
      not south.

      1. First, let''s locate Boise Mountains:

      - Boise Mountains are located in Idaho, in the western United States

      - They are situated near Boise, Idaho, in the northwestern part of the state


      2. Next, let''s locate Lake Monroe:

      - Lake Monroe is located in Florida, in the eastern United States

      - Specifically, it''s in central Florida, near Sanford


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Idaho is in the northwest of the United States

      - Florida is in the southeast of the United States

      - This means Idaho is significantly north and west of Florida


      4. Determining relative position:

      - Since Boise Mountains are in Idaho (northwest) and Lake Monroe is in Florida
      (southeast), Boise Mountains are NOT south of Lake Monroe

      - These mountains are located in northwestern Utah, near the Utah-Idaho border

      - They are in the western part of the United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate Lake Verret, LA (Louisiana):

      - Lake Verret is located in southeastern Louisiana

      - It is in the southern part of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Raft River Mountains are in northwestern Utah

      - Lake Verret is in southeastern Louisiana

      - These locations are quite far apart, in different regions of the country


      4. Determining relative north/south positioning:

      - Raft River Mountains are significantly north of Lake Verret

      - The mountains are not south of the lake


      5. Therefore, the answer is: NO.


      NO, Raft River Mountains, UT is NOT located south of Lake Verret, LA.'

    49845f8a-5bdb-4d4b-a8cf-3e69f761e755: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Bridger Range is a mountain range located in southwestern Montana, near Bozeman.


      2. Joe Pool Lake is a reservoir located in Texas, southwest of Dallas.


      3. Montana is a state in the northwestern United States.


      4. Texas is a state in the southern United States.


      5. Montana is geographically north of Texas.


      6. Therefore, the Bridger Range is located north of Joe Pool Lake.


      7. The question asks if the Bridger Range is south of Joe Pool Lake.


      8. Since the Bridger Range is actually north of Joe Pool Lake, the answer is
      NO.

      1. Boundary Bay is located in Washington state, near the US-Canada border in
      the northwest part of Washington.


      2. Eastman Lake is located in California''s Central Valley region, specifically
      in Madera County.


      3. Washington is north of California on the map of the United States.


      4. Therefore, Boundary Bay (in Washington) is located NORTH of Eastman Lake
      (in California).


      5. The question asks if Boundary Bay is south of Eastman Lake.


      6. Since Boundary Bay is actually north of Eastman Lake, the answer is NO.
