      - It''s located in Tuolumne County

      - It''s in the Sierra Nevada foothills


      2. Next, I''ll locate Twitchell Reservoir

      - Twitchell Reservoir is also in California

      - It''s located in Santa Barbara County

      - It''s near the California coast

      - Tuolumne County is in inland California

      - The California coast is west of the Sierra Nevada


      4. Therefore, since Twitchell Reservoir is near the coast and Don Pedro is in
      the Sierra Nevada foothills, Twitchell must be west of Don Pedro.

    dca5c12f-aef2-450a-ad93-c50984a2ebca: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Sarang Community Church of Southern California would be located in Southern
      California, likely in the Los Angeles/Orange County area.


      2. Little Goose Dam is located on the Snake River in Washington state.


      3. Looking at a map of the United States:

      - Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest

      - Southern California is significantly south of Washington

      - Both locations are on the West Coast

      - Little Goose Dam is inland from the coast

      - Southern California churches would also be inland but much further south


      4. When comparing east-west positions:

      - Southern California is generally further west than inland Washington

      - Little Goose Dam, being on the Snake River in eastern Washington, is quite
      far inland

      - Any location in the Los Angeles area would be further west


      Therefore: YES, Sarang Community Church of Southern California is located west

      1. Holy Trinity Church (Manhattan) is located at 316 East 88th Street in the
      Upper East Side of Manhattan.


      2. 75 Rockefeller Plaza is located in Midtown Manhattan between 51st and 52nd
      Streets, near Fifth Avenue.


      3. In Manhattan, locations can be compared east-west using their position relative
      to Fifth Avenue:

      - East of Fifth Avenue is considered "East Side"

      - West of Fifth Avenue is considered "West Side"


      4. Holy Trinity Church has "East" in its address (316 East 88th Street), meaning
      it''s on the East Side.


      5. 75 Rockefeller Plaza is slightly west of Fifth Avenue.


      6. Therefore, Holy Trinity Church is east of 75 Rockefeller Plaza, not west.
