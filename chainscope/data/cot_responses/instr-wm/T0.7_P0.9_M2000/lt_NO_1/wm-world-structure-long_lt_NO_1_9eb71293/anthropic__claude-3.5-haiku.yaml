      4. Answering the specific question: "Is Chislehurst railway station located
      west of Kings Arms, Woolwich?"

      - Since Chislehurst is west of Woolwich, the Kings Arms would be to the east

      - Therefore, Chislehurst railway station is NOT west of Kings Arms, Woolwich

      2. Then, I''ll locate the Cathedral of Saint Patrick in Charlotte, North Carolina.

      3. I''ll determine their relative positions (east/west) to each other.

      2. Next, locate the Great Wall of China:

      - The Great Wall stretches across northern China

      - Different sections of the wall run through multiple provinces

      - Some sections are west of Tianjin, some are east


      3. Specifically for the section near Tianjin:

      - The Huangyaguan section of the Great Wall is northeast of Tianjin

      - This means it is not west of Tianjin


      4. Checking the specific geographical relationship:

      - The Great Wall is actually east/northeast of Tianjin, not west


      5. Therefore, the Great Wall is NOT west of Tianjin Modern City Office Tower.

    f2578dc0-8cc6-4c7d-9ac9-8f29c6e289a0: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll recall the locations of Uppsala Castle and Uppsala Cathedral
      in Uppsala, Sweden.


      2. Uppsala Castle is located on a hill to the west of the city center.


      3. Uppsala Cathedral is located in the central part of Uppsala, in the old city
      area.


      4. Given the castle''s location to the west and the cathedral''s location in
      the city center, the castle would actually be west of the cathedral.


      5. Therefore, the answer is: YES, Uppsala Castle is located west of Uppsala
      Cathedral.

      2. Then I''ll locate the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant in Pakistan

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Bala Hissar is located in Peshawar, which is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province
      in northwestern Pakistan.


      Chashma Nuclear Power Plant is located in Mianwali District, Punjab province,
      which is in central/eastern Pakistan.


      Comparing their locations:

      - Peshawar is in the northwest

      - Chashma Nuclear Power Plant is in the central/eastern part of Pakistan


      Therefore, Bala Hissar, Peshawar is WEST of Chashma Nuclear Power Plant.


      The answer is: YES.'

      Bala Hissar is located in Peshawar, which is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province

      The Chashma Nuclear Power Plant is located in the Mianwali District of Punjab

      Geographically, Peshawar is northwest of Mianwali, so Bala Hissar would also
      be northwest of the nuclear plant.

      plant, this technically means it is west of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant.

      3. Without being able to confidently verify their relative positions, I cannot
      responsibly claim whether Hill Place is west or not west of Manydown.
