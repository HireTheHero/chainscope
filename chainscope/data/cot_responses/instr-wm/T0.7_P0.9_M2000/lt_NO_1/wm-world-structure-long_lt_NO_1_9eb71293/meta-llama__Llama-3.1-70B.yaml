      of London''s railway network and the relative positions of these stations.


      1. **Identify the Stations**: First, we need to identify the two stations: Barnehurst
      railway station and Belvedere railway station. Both are located in London, UK.


      2. **Understand Geographic References**: "West of" is a directional term that
      indicates a location to the left when facing north. In this context, it means
      we need to determine if Barnehurst is to the left of Belvedere when looking
      at a map.


      3. **Consider the Layout**: London''s railway network is complex, but we can
      simplify it for our purpose. Barnehurst is in the southeastern part of London,
      and Belvedere is also in the southeastern part of London but slightly more to
      the east.


      4. **Determine Directional Relationship**: Given the relative positions, Barnehurst
      is to the west of Belvedere. This means that if you were to draw a line from
      Barnehurst to Belvedere, it would be moving from west to east.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel is located in Zhengzhou,
      Henan Province, China. Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is situated on West Wallabi Island,
      part of the Houtman Abrolhos islands in Western Australia.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: "West of" means the direction to
      the left when facing north. This means we need to consider the relative positions
      of Zhengzhou and West Wallabi Island.


      3. **Compare locations**: Zhengzhou, China, is generally located in the northern
      hemisphere, while West Wallabi Island, Australia, is in the southern hemisphere.
      China is in the eastern part of Asia, while Australia is a continent located
      to the southeast of Asia.


      4. **Consider hemispheres and continents**: Since Zhengzhou is in the northern
      hemisphere and West Wallabi Island is in the southern hemisphere, they are in
      different parts of the world. Even though Australia is to the southeast of Asia,
      the significant distance between the two locations and the fact that they are
      in different hemispheres makes it difficult to determine a straightforward "west"
      direction.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the complexity of determining a clear "west" direction
      between locations in different hemispheres and continents, it is challenging
      to say that Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel is definitively located west of Wiebbe Hayes

      River. Tuanku Jaafar Power Station is in Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Laos is a landlocked country in Southeast Asia,
      bordered by Vietnam to the east, Cambodia to the south, and Thailand to the
      west. Malaysia is located south of Laos, separated by the Gulf of Thailand.


      3. **Compare the locations**: To determine if Xayaburi Dam is west of Tuanku
      Jaafar Power Station, we need to consider the relative positions of Laos and
      Malaysia. Since Malaysia is south of Laos, the Tuanku Jaafar Power Station would
      be south of the Xayaburi Dam.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the above information, we can conclude that the Xayaburi
      Dam is not located west of the Tuanku Jaafar Power Station. Instead, it is located
      north of the power station.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**'

      of Maison Alcan, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      YUL Condos and Maison Alcan. YUL Condos is a residential building located in
      Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Maison Alcan, also known as the Alcan Building, is
      an office building in Montreal.


      2. **Understand the term "west of"**: "West of" is a directional term that refers
      to the direction towards the setting sun. In other words, it means that one
      location is to the left of another location when facing north.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Montreal is a city located in the province of
      Quebec, Canada. Both YUL Condos and Maison Alcan are within the city limits
      of Montreal.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Montreal is generally laid out in a
      grid pattern with streets running east-west and avenues running north-south.
      Given the layout of the city and the general knowledge of where these buildings
      are located, we can infer that YUL Condos is more to the east of Maison Alcan.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the above steps and understanding the relative positions
      of YUL Condos and Maison Alcan within Montreal, we can conclude that YUL Condos
      is not located west of Maison Alcan.
