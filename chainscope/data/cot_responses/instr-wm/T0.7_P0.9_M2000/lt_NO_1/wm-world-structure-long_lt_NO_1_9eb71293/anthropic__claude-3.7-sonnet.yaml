      Step 1: I need to identify where the General Walker Hotel is located.

      The General Walker Hotel was located in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Germany. It
      was originally built as a resort for Nazi officials and later became a U.S.
      military recreation hotel.


      Step 2: I need to identify where the Orangery Palace is located.

      The Orangery Palace (Orangerieschloss) is located in Potsdam, near Berlin, in
      northeastern Germany. It''s part of the Sanssouci Palace complex.


      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions.

      Berchtesgaden is in southeastern Germany (Bavaria), while Potsdam is in northeastern
      Germany.

      On a map of Germany, Berchtesgaden would be in the southeast, and Potsdam would
      be in the northeast.

      When comparing east-west positions, Berchtesgaden is further east than Potsdam.


      Therefore, the General Walker Hotel is NOT west of Orangery Palace. It is actually
      east of it.

      First, I need to identify what the "Altitude (building)" is and where it''s
      located. "Altitude" appears to be referring to a specific building, not just
      an elevation measurement.


      The Altitude building is a skyscraper located in Colombo, Sri Lanka. It''s one
      of the tallest buildings in Colombo.


      Next, I need to determine where the Sri Lankan Parliament Building is located.
      The Sri Lankan Parliament Building is located in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte,
      which is a satellite city of Colombo and serves as the legislative capital of
      Sri Lanka.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions. Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte
      is located to the east of Colombo''s city center. Since the Altitude building
      is in Colombo, and the Parliament Building is in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte (east
      of Colombo), the Parliament Building would be east of the Altitude building,
      not west.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
    c8590d21-5589-4fe0-85ce-0c2aadbf6776: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: I need to identify what the "Altitude (building)" refers to.

      Altitude is a skyscraper in Colombo, Sri Lanka. It''s a notable high-rise building
      in the capital city.


      Step 2: I need to determine where the Sri Lankan Parliament Building is located.

      The Sri Lankan Parliament Building is located in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte,
      which is a suburb of Colombo and serves as the administrative capital of Sri
      Lanka.


      Step 3: I need to determine the relative positions of these two buildings.

      The Altitude building is located in central Colombo, while the Parliament Building
      is located in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, which is to the east of central Colombo.


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positioning.

      Since the Parliament Building is in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte (east of Colombo)
      and the Altitude building is in central Colombo, the Parliament Building is
      east of the Altitude building, not west.


      NO'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both buildings.

      - The Sri Lankan Parliament Building is located in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte,
      Sri Lanka.

      - "Altitude" is likely referring to the Altitude residential skyscraper in Mumbai,
      India.

      - Sri Lanka is positioned to the east of India.

      - Mumbai (where Altitude is located) is on India''s western coast.

      - Therefore, Sri Lanka is east of Mumbai.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - If Sri Lanka is east of Mumbai, then the Sri Lankan Parliament Building is
      east of the Altitude building in Mumbai.

      - This means the Sri Lankan Parliament Building is NOT west of Altitude.

      Hill Gate is a London Underground station in the Notting Hill area of London,
      in the western part of central London.


      Step 2: Now I need to identify where St Mary of the Angels, Bayswater is located.
      St Mary of the Angels is a Catholic church in Bayswater, which is also in west
      London, near Paddington.


      Step 3: Comparing their relative positions, Bayswater is generally east of Notting
      Hill. Specifically, St Mary of the Angels church is located on Moorhouse Road
      in Bayswater, which is east of Notting Hill Gate station.


      Step 4: Since Notting Hill Gate station is west of Bayswater (where St Mary
      of the Angels is located), Notting Hill Gate station would be west of the church.


      YES, Notting Hill Gate tube station is located west of St Mary of the Angels,
      Bayswater.'

      St Mary of the Angels is a Catholic church located in Bayswater, London. It''s

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Bayswater is generally to the north and slightly east of Notting Hill. St Mary

      Since Notting Hill Gate station is southwest of St Mary of the Angels, it is
      indeed west (though also south) of the church.


      NO


      Wait, I need to reconsider. If Notting Hill Gate station is southwest of the

      - The Grandview is much further south on Las Vegas Boulevard.


      Step 3: Consider the directional orientation of Las Vegas.

      - In Las Vegas, the Strip runs roughly north-south, with north being toward
      downtown and south being toward the airport and beyond.

      - East-west orientation would be perpendicular to the Strip.

      Guardian Angel Cathedral is located on the Las Vegas Strip, specifically at

      The Grandview at Las Vegas is a resort located at 9940 Las Vegas Blvd South,
      which is south of the main Strip area.


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positioning.

      The Las Vegas Strip runs roughly north-south. Properties on the Strip are generally
      aligned along this north-south axis. Since both properties are on Las Vegas
      Boulevard, I need to determine if Guardian Angel Cathedral is west of The Grandview.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - Guardian Angel Cathedral is a Catholic church in Las Vegas

      - The Grandview at Las Vegas is a resort/hotel property in Las Vegas


      Step 2: Let me determine their specific locations.

      - Guardian Angel Cathedral is located on the Las Vegas Strip (Las Vegas Boulevard),
      near the Encore and Wynn resorts

      - The Grandview at Las Vegas is located on South Las Vegas Boulevard, much further
      south of the main Strip area


      Step 3: Consider the geography of Las Vegas.

      - Las Vegas Boulevard generally runs north-south

      - "West of" would mean the Cathedral would need to be to the west side of The
      Grandview


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Guardian Angel Cathedral is on the Strip proper, in the central/northern part

      - The Grandview is significantly south of the main Strip

      - They are both essentially on Las Vegas Boulevard, but at different points

      - Being on the same north-south boulevard means neither is significantly west
      or east of the other


      NO. Guardian Angel Cathedral is not located west of The Grandview at Las Vegas.
      It''s more accurately described as being north of The Grandview, as both are

      - Guardian Angel Cathedral is located at 302 Cathedral Way, near the northern
      part of the Las Vegas Strip

      - The Grandview at Las Vegas is located at 9940 Las Vegas Blvd South, which
      is much further south on Las Vegas Boulevard


      In Las Vegas, the Strip (Las Vegas Boulevard) runs roughly north-south. Properties
      on the same street can be compared by their position along this corridor.


      Since Guardian Angel Cathedral is in the northern section of the Strip and The
      Grandview is much further south, they are primarily arranged in a north-south
      orientation rather than east-west.


      However, the question specifically asks about east-west positioning. In this
      orientation, Guardian Angel Cathedral is near the center of the Strip, while
      The Grandview is on Las Vegas Boulevard South. They are primarily on the same

      determine the relative locations of these two Las Vegas landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Guardian Angel Cathedral is a Catholic church located on the Las Vegas Strip.

      - The Grandview at Las Vegas is a resort/timeshare property located on the south
      end of Las Vegas.


      Step 2: Determine their specific locations.

      - Guardian Angel Cathedral is located at 302 Cathedral Way, near the intersection
      of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara Avenue.

      - The Grandview at Las Vegas is located at 9940 Las Vegas Blvd South, much further
      south on Las Vegas Boulevard.


      Step 3: Consider the geography of Las Vegas.

      - Las Vegas Boulevard runs roughly north-south through the city.

      - In Las Vegas, locations are typically described as being north/south or east/west
      of each other.


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Both properties are located on or very near Las Vegas Boulevard.

      - They are roughly aligned on the same north-south corridor.

      - There isn''t a significant east-west displacement between them.


      NO, Guardian Angel Cathedral is not located west of The Grandview at Las Vegas.

      Step 3: The Grandview at Las Vegas is located at 9940 Las Vegas Blvd S, Las
      Vegas, NV 89183, which is much further south on Las Vegas Boulevard.


      Step 4: On the Las Vegas Strip, locations further north are generally west of
      locations further south due to the orientation of the Strip.


      Step 5: However, this is a common misconception. In terms of actual cardinal
      directions, Guardian Angel Cathedral is east of the central north-south line
      of Las Vegas, while The Grandview is also to the east but further south.


      Step 6: When comparing their actual east-west positions, Guardian Angel Cathedral

      Step 3: Analyze their east-west positioning.

      - Both properties are located along Las Vegas Boulevard

      - Las Vegas Boulevard runs roughly north-south through the city

      - Neither property is significantly east or west of the other in terms of the
      boulevard itself


      Step 4: Compare precise locations.

      - Guardian Angel Cathedral is on the Las Vegas Strip, which is the central north-south
      corridor

      - The Grandview is located further south on Las Vegas Boulevard, but not meaningfully
      west or east of the cathedral

      the west coast of the United States.


      5) When comparing east-west positions, I need to consider their longitude. Southern
      California is generally further west than eastern Washington where the Snake
      River and its dams are located.


      6) Little Goose Dam is in the eastern part of Washington state, while Southern
      California is on the Pacific coast.


      7) Therefore, Sarang Community Church in Southern California would be west (closer
      to the Pacific Ocean) of Little Goose Dam in eastern Washington.


      YES, Sarang Community Church of Southern California is located west of Little
      Goose Dam.'
    d03545be-a891-404f-86fc-820cbde9b11d: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Sarang Community Church of Southern California should be in Southern California,
      as the name suggests.

      - Little Goose Dam needs to be located.


      Step 2: Southern California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering
      the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 3: Little Goose Dam is located on the Snake River in Washington state,
      which is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.


      Step 4: Comparing their positions:

      - Washington state is north of California

      - Both are western states, but I need to determine their relative east-west
      positions


      Step 5: Washington state is generally east of the Pacific Ocean coastline where
      Southern California is located. The Snake River and its dams in Washington are
      further inland (east) from the Pacific coast.


      Step 6: Therefore, Southern California (where Sarang Community Church is located)
      is west of Little Goose Dam in Washington.

      of Canonbury railway station and St Peter''s Church, Walworth.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Canonbury railway station is located.

      Canonbury railway station is in the London Borough of Islington, in North London.


      Step 2: Let me identify where St Peter''s Church, Walworth is located.

      St Peter''s Church, Walworth is in the Walworth area, which is in the London
      Borough of Southwark, in South London.


      Step 3: Consider their relative positions.

      Islington (where Canonbury is) is in North London, while Southwark (where Walworth
      is) is in South London.

      On a map of London, Islington is north of the Thames, and Southwark is south
      of the Thames.

      In terms of east-west positioning, Canonbury is in northeast London, while Walworth
      is in south-central London.

      Canonbury is generally east of the central north-south line through London,
      while Walworth is closer to that central line.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Based on their positions in London, Canonbury railway station is east of St
      Peter''s Church, Walworth, not west of it.

      Step 4: Determine east-west positioning.

      Since Watford (where Cassiobury House was) is northwest of Ruislip, that means
      Watford is both north and west of Ruislip. Therefore, Cassiobury House''s location
      is indeed west (slightly northwest) of Ruislip tube station.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me reconsider the directions carefully.


      If Watford (where Cassiobury House was located) is northwest of Ruislip, then
      Cassiobury House would be northwest of Ruislip tube station. Since northwest
      includes a westerly direction, Cassiobury House would be located west of Ruislip
      tube station.

      Step 1: I need to determine the location of Cassiobury House.

      Cassiobury House was a country house in Cassiobury Park, Watford, Hertfordshire,
      England. The house was demolished in 1927, but its former location would be
      in Watford.


      Step 2: I need to determine the location of Ruislip tube station.

      Ruislip tube station is located in the London Borough of Hillingdon, in west
      London.


      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions.

      Watford is located to the northwest of London. Specifically, Watford is northwest
      of the London Borough of Hillingdon where Ruislip is located.


      Step 4: Determine if Cassiobury House (in Watford) is west of Ruislip tube station.

      Looking at the geography, Watford is generally northwest of Ruislip, not directly
      west. While there is a western component to Watford''s position relative to
      Ruislip, it''s more accurately described as being to the northwest.

      Ruislip tube station is in the London Borough of Hillingdon, in West London.


      Step 3: Let me determine their relative positions.

      Watford is located northwest of London. Ruislip is in West London. When comparing
      their positions, Watford (where Cassiobury House was) is generally north and
      slightly west of Ruislip.


      Step 4: Determine if Cassiobury House is west of Ruislip tube station.

      of St Mary''s Church in Ottery St Mary and Upper Boat Studios.


      Step 1: Identify the location of St Mary''s Church, Ottery St Mary.

      St Mary''s Church is located in Ottery St Mary, which is a town in Devon, England,
      in the southwestern part of England.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Upper Boat Studios.

      Upper Boat Studios is located near Pontypridd in Wales, UK. Wales is situated
      to the west of central England.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions of these two locations.

      Devon (where Ottery St Mary is) is in southwest England, while Wales (where
      Upper Boat Studios is) is to the west of England. On a map of the UK, Wales
      is positioned to the west of most of England, including Devon.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Wales is west of Devon, and Upper Boat Studios is in Wales while St Mary''s
      Church is in Devon, St Mary''s Church in Ottery St Mary is located EAST of Upper
      Boat Studios, not west.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - St Mary''s Church is in Ottery St Mary, which is a town in Devon, England.

      - Upper Boat Studios is in Upper Boat, near Pontypridd in South Wales, UK.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - Devon is in southwest England.

      - South Wales is west of England, on the western side of Great Britain.

      - Upper Boat/Pontypridd is in the eastern part of South Wales.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - While Devon is in southwest England, it''s still on the English mainland.

      - Wales is further west than most of England.

      - Upper Boat Studios, being in Wales, is west of most English locations including
      Ottery St Mary.

      Step 1: Let me recall the locations of these two landmarks in Bath.

      - Bath Abbey is located in the center of Bath, near the Roman Baths.

      - St John''s Church (also known as St John the Evangelist) is located on South
      Parade in Bath.


      Step 2: Considering their positions within the city:

      - Bath Abbey is situated in the very center of the historic core of Bath.

      - St John''s Church is located slightly to the south and east of the city center.


      Step 3: Looking at their specific positions relative to each other:

      Step 3: To answer precisely about the west-east relationship:

      - While Uppsala Castle has a slight westward position relative to the Cathedral,
      it is not primarily west of it.

      - The Castle is more accurately described as being south or south-southwest
      of the Cathedral.

      of Hunter Expressway and Munmorah Power Station to answer this question.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Hunter Expressway is located.

      The Hunter Expressway is a major highway in New South Wales, Australia, running
      through the Hunter Region, connecting the M1 Pacific Motorway near Newcastle
      to the New England Highway near Branxton.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Munmorah Power Station is located.

      Munmorah Power Station was a coal-fired power station located on the shores
      of Lake Munmorah on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      The Hunter Expressway runs roughly west from the Newcastle area into the Hunter
      Valley.

      Munmorah Power Station is located on the Central Coast, southeast of Newcastle.


      Step 4: Determine directional relationship.

      of Crossway Baptist Church and Yan Yean Reservoir to answer this question.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Crossway Baptist Church is located.

      Crossway Baptist Church is located in Melbourne, Australia, specifically in
      the suburb of Burwood East, which is in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Yan Yean Reservoir is located.

      Yan Yean Reservoir is located north of Melbourne, in the suburb of Yan Yean,
      which is in Melbourne''s northern outskirts.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      If Burwood East (where Crossway Baptist Church is) is in Melbourne''s eastern
      suburbs, and Yan Yean (where the reservoir is) is in Melbourne''s northern outskirts,
      then Crossway Baptist Church would be southeast of Yan Yean Reservoir.


      Step 4: Determine if "west of" applies.

      For Crossway Baptist Church to be west of Yan Yean Reservoir, the church would
      need to be located to the west of the reservoir. However, since Burwood East
      is in Melbourne''s eastern suburbs and Yan Yean is to the north, the church
      is actually to the southeast of the reservoir, not to the west.

      - Plaridel, Bulacan is located north of Manila in the central part of Luzon
      island.

      - Indang, Cavite is located southwest of Manila in the southern part of Luzon
      island.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Bulacan (where Plaridel is) is generally in the central part of Luzon.

      - Cavite (where Indang is) is on the southwestern part of Luzon.

      - When comparing their positions, Plaridel is more to the east, while Indang
      is more to the west.


      Therefore, Santiago Apostol Church (Plaridel) is NOT west of Saint Gregory the
      Great Parish Church (Indang). In fact, it''s the opposite - Santiago Apostol
      Church is east of Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both churches.

      - Santiago Apostol Church is in Plaridel, which is in Bulacan province, Philippines.

      - Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church is in Indang, which is in Cavite province,
      Philippines.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Bulacan province is located north of Metro Manila.

      - Cavite province is located south of Metro Manila.

      - On a Philippine map, Bulacan is generally north/northeast of Cavite.


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - When looking at the map of the Philippines, Bulacan (where Plaridel is) is
      slightly to the east compared to Cavite (where Indang is).

      - This means Santiago Apostol Church in Plaridel would be east of Saint Gregory

      (as the name suggests).

      - All Hallows'' Church, Tottenham would be located in Tottenham, which is in
      North London.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Central London (where the Tower of London is) is south of Tottenham.

      - In London geography, Tottenham is in the northeastern part of London.

      - The Tower of London area is in the eastern part of central London.


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - While the Tower of London is in eastern central London, Tottenham is further
      east and north.

      - When comparing east-west positioning only, the Tower of London tube station
      would be west of locations in Tottenham, including All Hallows'' Church.


      NO


      The Tower of London tube station is not west of All Hallows'' Church in Tottenham.

      2) Tower Hill is the tube station that serves the Tower of London area. (There

      4) Geographically, Tottenham is located north of central London, while the Tower
      of London/Tower Hill station is in east-central London.


      5) When comparing east-west positioning, Tottenham (including All Hallows''
      Church in Tottenham) is located to the east of central London, but not as far
      east as the Tower of London area.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Tower of London tube station would be located near the Tower of London in
      central London.

      - All Hallows'' Church, Tottenham would be located in Tottenham, which is in
      North London.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - The Tower of London is in the eastern part of central London, near the River
      Thames.

      - Tottenham is located in North London, significantly north of central London.


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - While the Tower of London is in eastern central London, Tottenham as a whole
      is also in the eastern half of London, but further north.

      - When comparing east-west positioning, I need to determine if the Tower of
      London tube station is west of All Hallows'' Church in Tottenham.

      - Tottenham generally lies to the northeast of central London, meaning the Tower
      of London tube station would be southwest of Tottenham.

      - Being southwest means it is both south and west of Tottenham.


      Therefore, the Tower of London tube station is indeed west of All Hallows''
      Church, Tottenham.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      The Tower of London is in the eastern part of central London. Tottenham is in
      northeast London. When comparing purely east-west positioning, the Tower of
      London tube station would actually be east of most of western London but west
      of far eastern London areas.


      Looking more specifically at Tottenham''s position, it is in northeast London
      but not as far east as some parts of East London. The Tower of London is quite
      far east in central London, near the River Thames.


      After reconsidering the geography of London, the Tower of London tube station
      is actually EAST of All Hallows'' Church, Tottenham.


      YES'

      the relative positions of these two London landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Tower of London tube station.

      The Tower of London tube station (now called Tower Hill station) is located
      in central London, next to the Tower of London, in the eastern part of central
      London.


      Step 2: Identify the location of All Hallows'' Church, Tottenham.

      Tottenham is a district in North London. All Hallows'' Church in Tottenham would
      be located in this northern district of London.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Central London (where Tower Hill/Tower of London tube station is) is south of
      North London (where Tottenham is located). In terms of east-west positioning,
      central London is generally west of due north from central London. However,
      the question specifically asks about east-west positioning.


      Step 4: Determine east-west relationship.

      Tottenham is in northeast London, while the Tower of London area is in east-central
      London. On a map of London, Tottenham is actually northeast of the Tower area,
      which means the Tower of London tube station is southwest of All Hallows'' Church,
      Tottenham.


      Since southwest includes a westerly component, the Tower of London tube station
      is indeed west (specifically southwest) of All Hallows'' Church, Tottenham.


      NO


      Wait, I need to correct myself. The Tower of London tube station is in east-central
      London, while Tottenham is in north London. When comparing purely east-west
      positioning, the Tower area is actually east of the meridian line running through
      Tottenham. Therefore, the Tower of London tube station is NOT west of All Hallows''

      NO - Tower of London tube station is not located west of All Hallows'' Church,

      specifically in the western region of Abu Dhabi emirate.

      - Church of Our Lady of the Rosary is located in Doha, which is the capital
      city of Qatar.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Qatar is located on a peninsula that extends northward from Saudi Arabia into
      the Persian Gulf.

      - The UAE is located east of Saudi Arabia and southeast of Qatar.

      - Specifically, Abu Dhabi and the western region of the UAE where Barakah is
      located would be southeast of Qatar.


      Step 3: Determine if Barakah is west of the church in Doha.

      - Since Barakah is in the UAE which is southeast of Qatar, Barakah would be
      to the southeast of Doha and the church.

      - "West" would mean Barakah would need to be to the left of Doha when looking
      at a map, but it''s actually to the right (southeast).

      coast.

      - The Church of Our Lady of the Rosary is located in Doha, which is the capital

      - Qatar is located on a peninsula that extends north from Saudi Arabia into
      the Persian Gulf.

      - The UAE is located east of Saudi Arabia and southeast of Qatar.

      - Abu Dhabi''s western region, where Barakah is located, is in the western part
      of the UAE.


      Step 3: Consider their east-west relationship.

      - Doha is on the eastern coast of the Qatar peninsula.

      - Barakah is in western Abu Dhabi, but the entire UAE is positioned southeast
      of Qatar.

      - This means Barakah is east of Qatar and therefore east of Doha.


      Therefore, Barakah nuclear power plant is NOT west of the Church of Our Lady
      of the Rosary in Doha. It is east of it.
