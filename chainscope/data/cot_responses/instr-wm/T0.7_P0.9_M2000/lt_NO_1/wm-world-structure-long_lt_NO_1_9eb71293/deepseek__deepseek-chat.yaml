      Hendersonville, North Carolina. It is situated to the southeast of Hendersonville.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Kanuga Conference Center is in
      Hendersonville and Saluda Lake is southeast of Hendersonville, Saluda Lake is
      **east** of Kanuga Conference Center, not west.

    ecda4153-84af-46a6-b074-ed85fc85778c: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Locate Saluda Lake**: Saluda Lake is a reservoir located in Greenville
      County, South Carolina, USA. It is situated near the town of Travelers Rest.


      2. **Locate Kanuga Conference Center**: Kanuga Conference Center is a retreat
      and conference center located in Hendersonville, North Carolina, USA. It is
      situated near the town of Hendersonville, which is northwest of Greenville,
      South Carolina.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Greenville, South Carolina (where Saluda
      Lake is located), is southwest of Hendersonville, North Carolina (where Kanuga
      Conference Center is located). Therefore, Saluda Lake is to the southwest of
      Kanuga Conference Center.


      4. **Answer the question**: Since Saluda Lake is southwest of Kanuga Conference
      Center, it is indeed west of it.

      \ to gather information about the locations of both places and then compare\
      \ their positions relative to each other.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\
      \n**Sarang Community Church of Southern California:**\n- **Location:** Southern\
      \ California, USA\n- **Specific Area:** Likely in a city like Los Angeles, Anaheim,\
      \ or another major city in Southern California.\n\n**Little Goose Dam:**\n-\
      \ **Location:** Washington State, USA\n- **Specific Area:** Located on the Snake\
      \ River, near the town of Starbuck.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Geographical\
      \ Positions\n\nTo determine if one is west of the other, we need to look at\
      \ their longitudinal positions on a map.\n\n**Southern California:**\n- Generally\
      \ lies to the west in the United States.\n- Longitude: Approximately between\
      \ 114\xB0W and 120\xB0W.\n\n**Washington State:**\n- Located in the Pacific\

      \ places are in the western part of the United States, we need to see which\
      \ one is further west.\n\n- **Sarang Community Church:** Assuming it's in Los\
      \ Angeles, the longitude is around 118.2\xB0W.\n- **Little Goose Dam:** Located\
      \ near Starbuck, WA, with a longitude of approximately 118.5\xB0W.\n\n### Step\
      \ 4: Determine Which is Further West\n\nA lower longitude number indicates a\
      \ position further west. Comparing the two:\n\n- Sarang Community Church: ~118.2\xB0\
      W\n- Little Goose Dam: ~118.5\xB0W\n\nSince 118.2\xB0W is a lower number than\
      \ 118.5\xB0W, Sarang Community Church is slightly further west than Little Goose\
      \ Dam.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitudinal positions:\n\n\

      1. **Locate Sant''Andrea della Valle**: This church is situated in the Piazza
      Vidoni, near the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, in the historic center of Rome.
      It is close to the Pantheon and the Tiber River.


      2. **Locate Sant''Agostino**: This church is also in the historic center of
      Rome, near Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. It is located on the Via della Scrofa.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Both churches are in the same general area of
      Rome, but Sant''Andrea della Valle is slightly further south and east compared
      to Sant''Agostino. Specifically, Sant''Agostino is located northwest of Sant''Andrea
      della Valle.

      reasoning:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Mustafa Castle and Asan Barrage are both located
      in Pakistan. Mustafa Castle is a well-known landmark in Islamabad, while Asan
      Barrage is a dam located near the town of Asan in the Attock District of Punjab.


      2. **Determine their positions**: Islamabad, where Mustafa Castle is located,
      is situated northeast of Attock District, where Asan Barrage is located.


      3. **Compare their relative positions**: Since Mustafa Castle is northeast of
      Asan Barrage, it cannot be west of it.

      1. **Locate Haldia Energy Power Station**: The Haldia Energy Power Station is
      a thermal power plant located in Haldia, West Bengal, India. Haldia is an industrial
      city situated near the confluence of the Haldi River and the Hooghly River (a
      distributary of the Ganges).


      2. **Locate Raichak**: Raichak is a small town in West Bengal, India, located
      on the banks of the Hooghly River. It is known for its scenic views of the river
      and is situated downstream of Kolkata.


      3. **Determine their relative positions**: Haldia is located to the **south**
      of Raichak along the Hooghly River. Since the Hooghly River flows southward,
      Haldia is downstream of Raichak. Therefore, Haldia is **not west** of Raichak
      but rather to the south.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, the Haldia Energy Power
      Station is **not** located west of Raichak on the Ganges.
