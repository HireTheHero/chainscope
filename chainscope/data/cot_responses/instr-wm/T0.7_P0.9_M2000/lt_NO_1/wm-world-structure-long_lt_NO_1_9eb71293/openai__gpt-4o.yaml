      1. **Orangery Palace**: The Orangery Palace is located in Potsdam, Germany.
      It is part of the Sanssouci Park, situated in the eastern part of the park.


      2. **General Walker Hotel**: The General Walker Hotel was located in Obersalzberg,
      near Berchtesgaden in Bavaria, Germany. However, it was demolished in 2001.


      Now, let''s consider their relative locations:


      - Orangery Palace is in Potsdam, which is in the northeastern part of Germany,
      near Berlin.

      - Obersalzberg, where the General Walker Hotel was located, is in Bavaria, in
      the southeastern part of Germany.


      Given these locations, the General Walker Hotel in Obersalzberg is southeast

      is located in Laeken, which is a northern suburb of Brussels, Belgium. Geographically,
      it is situated in the northern part of the city.

      China is located west of the Tianjin Modern City Office Tower, let''s break
      it down:


      1. **Location of the Great Wall of China**: The Great Wall extends across northern
      China, from the east to the west. Its easternmost sections are near the Bohai
      Sea, while the western sections reach into the deserts of Gansu Province.


      2. **Location of Tianjin Modern City Office Tower**: This tower is located in
      Tianjin, a major city in northern China. Tianjin is situated southeast of Beijing
      and closer to the Bohai Sea.


      3. **Relative Positioning**: Since the Great Wall runs across northern China

      the London Underground''s Northern line. These plans were never realized, so
      Brockley Hill does not have an operational tube station. However, if we consider

      3. **Comparing the two locations**: Since Kew Bridge is in West London and Brockley
      Hill (the proposed station) would have been in North London, Kew Bridge is geographically
      west of where Brockley Hill station would have been.
