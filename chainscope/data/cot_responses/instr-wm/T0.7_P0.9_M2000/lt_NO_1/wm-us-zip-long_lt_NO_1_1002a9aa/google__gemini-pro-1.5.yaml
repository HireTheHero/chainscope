      and PA is Pennsylvania.

      2. **General US geography:** Virginia is south of Pennsylvania.  West and east
      become relevant within a state, but because we are comparing across states,
      the primary directional difference is north/south.

      3. **Specific geography:** While Virginia is generally south of Pennsylvania,
      western Virginia does extend further west than eastern Pennsylvania.  Therefore,
      it IS possible for a Virginia zip code to be west of a Pennsylvania zip code.
      We need to look up the locations.

      4. **Lookup Zip Codes (optional but recommended for accuracy):** A quick online
      search shows that 24416 (Monterey, VA) is significantly west of 16214 (Brookville,
      PA).

      2. **General US Geography:** Virginia is generally south-west of Pennsylvania.

      3. **West vs. South-West:** While Virginia is south-west of Pennsylvania,  a
      location in Virginia *could* still be west of a location in Pennsylvania, especially
      if the Pennsylvania location is in the western part of the state and the Virginia
      location is in the eastern part of the state.  We need more specific location
      information than just the states.

      4. **Look up Zip Codes (or use general knowledge):**  24416 (Bridgewater, VA)
      is in the western part of Virginia, and 16214 (Brockway, PA) is in western Pennsylvania.

      5. **Compare Longitudes:**  Since we are looking at East/West, longitude is
      the relevant measure.  A quick search shows Bridgewater, VA is at approximately
      -79.0 degrees longitude, and Brockway, PA is at approximately -78.7 degrees
      longitude.

      6. **Interpret Longitude:**  More western locations have a *larger negative*
      longitude value.


      Therefore, 24416, VA is west of 16214, PA.

      2. **Consider the zip code numbering system:** Lower numbered zip codes tend
      to be in the East, and higher numbered zip codes tend to be in the West.


      3. **Compare zip codes within states**: Since 24416 is in VA and 16214 is in
      PA, the lower zip code in PA (further east) suggests it''s further east than
      the location in VA. Also, since VA is south of PA, 24416 is likely to be southwest
      of 16214.


      4. **West implies strictly west:** While 24416, VA is likely southwest of 16214,
      PA, southwest is not strictly west.

      (Brockway, PA) is located at approximately -78.77 longitude.

      location in Massachusetts is generally west of a location in New Hampshire.


      4. **Specific Zip Codes Don''t Matter:**  Given the general geographic relationship
      between the two states, the specific zip codes within those states don''t change
      the overall east/west relationship.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

      states:** Florida (FL) is generally east of South Carolina (SC).

      2. **Consider the zip codes within the states:**  Zip codes generally increase
      from east to west.  So, a lower zip code in South Carolina would be more easterly
      than a higher one.  Conversely, a lower zip code in Florida would be more westerly
      than a higher one.

      4. **Final determination:** Since Florida is east of South Carolina, and the
      zip code in Florida is relatively far west within Florida, and the zip code

      west.


      Using an online zip code lookup:


      * 44131 (Ohio) is approximately -81.68 longitude.

      * 25314 (West Virginia) is approximately -81.06 longitude.

      are in Washington (WA) and Oregon (OR).

      2. **General US Geography:** Washington is north of Oregon and the Pacific Ocean
      is to the west of both states.  Generally, locations further north will have
      a higher longitude, and locations further west will have a lower longitude.
      Therefore, the question is asking if a location in WA has a lower longitude
      than a location in OR.

      3. **Specific Geography:** While Washington is mostly north of Oregon, a small
      portion of Washington extends further south than some parts of Oregon.

      4. **Need for more precise information:**  Simply knowing the states isn''t
      enough to be certain. We need more specific location data related to these zip
      codes (like longitude or city names).  Without looking up the precise locations
      of these zip codes, we cannot definitively answer.


      However, since the question demands a YES/NO answer, and given that a small
      portion of WA is further south than parts of OR, it''s possible that 98569,
      WA *could* be west of 97459, OR.  A definitive answer requires looking up the
      locations.


      **Answer (with the caveat that it''s an educated guess without looking up the
      zip codes):**  YES (possible, but not certain)

      2. **General US Geography:** Washington is located north of Oregon.  The border
      between them runs roughly east-west.

      3. **West/East relationship:**  Since Washington is north of Oregon, a location
      in Washington being "west" of a location in Oregon would generally imply it''s
      significantly northwest. Simply being in Washington doesn''t guarantee it''s
      west.

      4. **Consider longitude:**  Westward locations have lower longitude values.  We
      need to determine if 98569 has a lower longitude than 97459. However, zip codes
      themselves don''t directly tell us longitude. We need to look up the locations.

      5. **Lookup locations (if possible):**  98569 corresponds to Rochester, WA.
      97459 corresponds to Pleasant Hill, OR.  Rochester is significantly west of
      Pleasant Hill.

      2. **Consider the zip codes within the states:** Zip codes increase from east

      within PA, and a higher zip code in VA suggests a more westerly location within

      3. **Need more specific location information:**  Zip codes give a more precise
      location. We need to look up the longitude of each zip code to definitively
      determine which is further west.

      4. **(Hypothetical look-up):**  Assume we look up 28546 (NC) and find its longitude
      is X.  We look up 20165 (VA) and find its longitude is Y.

      5. **Compare Longitudes:** If X is less than Y, then 28546 (NC) is west of 20165
      (VA).  If X is greater than Y, then 28546 (NC) is east of 20165 (VA).
