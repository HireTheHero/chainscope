      Step 1: Understand the zip code format. US zip codes are 5-digit numbers where
      the first digit represents a group of states, the next two digits represent
      a regional area within that group, and the last two digits represent a specific
      post office or area within that region.


      Step 2: Compare the first three digits of both zip codes. The first three digits
      of 32818 are 328, and the first three digits of 32776 are 327. Since 328 is
      greater than 327, the area represented by 32818 is generally southeast or east
      of the area represented by 32776, considering Florida''s geography and how zip
      codes are typically assigned from west to east.


      Step 3: Consider Florida''s geography. Florida is a long, narrow state that
      stretches from east to west, with the eastern part bordering the Atlantic Ocean
      and the western part bordering the Gulf of Mexico. Given this geography, a higher
      first three-digit number in a zip code typically indicates a location that is
      more to the east or southeast within the state.

      \   - To determine if 44131, OH is west of 25314, WV, we need to consider their\
      \ longitudes. Without exact longitude values, we rely on general knowledge that\
      \ Ohio is to the northwest of West Virginia. However, \"west\" specifically\

      \n6. **Conclusion based on geographical position**:\n   - Given that Ohio is\
      \ generally northwest of West Virginia, and without precise longitude values\
      \ for these zip codes, the question seems to hinge on the specific longitudes\
      \ of Cleveland, OH (44131), and Charleston, WV (25314). However, considering\
      \ typical US geography, locations in Ohio are generally not far west of locations\

      \ However, knowing that Cleveland, OH, and Charleston, WV, are not vastly different\
      \ in their east-west positioning but rather in their north-south positioning,\
      \ it suggests that 44131, OH, might not be significantly west of 25314, WV.\n\
      \nGiven these steps and the general geography of the United States, the answer\
      \ to whether 44131, OH, is located west of 25314, WV, would be based on the\
      \ understanding that while Ohio is to the northwest of West Virginia, the specific\
      \ westward positioning can depend on the exact locations within those states.\
      \ However, generally speaking, Cleveland, OH, is not significantly west of Charleston,\
      \ WV, in terms of longitude; it's more north.\n\nANSWER: NO"

      \ a zip code in Tennessee.\n\n2. **General Geographic Location**:\n   - Michigan\

      \ Like with Michigan, without specific knowledge, we assume it could be anywhere\
      \ in Tennessee, but given the state's geography, it's likely more to the east\
      \ than the west compared to Michigan.\n\n5. **Determine West/East Relationship**:\n\
      \   - To be west of 37853, TN, 48130, MI would need to be at a lower longitude\
      \ (since west means lower longitude in the Northern Hemisphere).\n   - Michigan\
      \ and Tennessee's longitudes overlap somewhat, but generally, the western parts\
      \ of Tennessee are at a similar or slightly higher longitude than the eastern\
      \ parts of Michigan.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without exact longitude and\
      \ latitude, we use general geographic knowledge. Michigan is generally north\
      \ and slightly east of Tennessee. Given this, it's unlikely that a random zip\

      \   Both zip codes start with \"853\", which indicates they are in the same\
      \ regional area within Arizona.\n\n3. **Determining Relative Location**:\n \
      \  - Since the first three digits (\"853\") are the same for both zip codes,\

      \ - For 85395, the last two digits are \"95\".\n   - For 85338, the last two\
      \ digits are \"38\".\n\n   Generally, as the last two digits increase, the location\
      \ moves eastward or in a direction that is not strictly westward. However, without\
      \ specific knowledge of how zip codes are sequenced in Arizona, this step might\
      \ not directly answer the question.\n\n4. **Specifics of Arizona Zip Codes**:\n\
      \   - Arizona's zip codes are generally sequenced from west to east, but there\

      \ \n   - 27299 is located in North Carolina (NC).\n   - 32962 is located in\
      \ Florida (FL).\n\n2. **General Geographic Location**:\n   - North Carolina\
      \ is generally located northwest of Florida.\n\n3. **Specific Locations**:\n\
      \   - To understand the specific locations, we need to consider the general\
      \ geographic areas where these zip codes are found.\n   - 27299 is associated\
      \ with the area around Burlington, NC.\n   - 32962 is associated with the area\
      \ around Kennedy Space Center/Cocoa, FL, on the eastern coast of Florida.\n\n\
      4. **Longitudinal Comparison**:\n   - Since we're comparing east-west locations,\
      \ we need to consider the longitude of these two points.\n   - North Carolina's\
      \ eastern edge (where 27299 would be) is at a longitude roughly around 75.5\xB0\

      1. **Identify the states and general regions:**\n   - 27299 is located in North\
      \ Carolina (NC).\n   - 32962 is located in Florida (FL).\n\n2. **Understand\
      \ the general geography of the United States:**\n   - North Carolina is located\

      of 63111, MO, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how they
      relate to geographic locations.


      1. **Understanding US Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are 5-digit numbers
      that are divided into three parts. The first digit represents a group of states,
      the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last
      two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.


      2. **Analyzing the Zip Codes**: Both 63113 and 63111 start with "631", which
      means they are in the same regional area. The difference lies in the last two
      digits: "13" for 63113 and "11" for 63111.


      3. **Geographic Implication**: Generally, as you move west, the zip code numbers
      decrease. However, this is a broad rule and can have exceptions, especially
      within the same city or metropolitan area where zip codes are assigned based
      on post office areas rather than strict geographic sequencing.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Without specific geographic knowledge of the St.
      Louis, MO area (since both zip codes are located in Missouri), one might assume
      that because "13" is greater than "11", 63113 could be located east of 63111.
      However, zip code assignments do not strictly follow a linear geographic pattern,
      especially within urban areas.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the information and typical patterns of zip code assignment,
      it''s reasonable to infer that 63113, MO is likely not west of 63111, MO based
      solely on the numerical sequence. However, for an accurate determination, specific
      knowledge of the St. Louis area''s zip code layout is necessary.


      Given these steps and understanding that zip codes don''t strictly determine
      east-west orientation within the same city or area, the most informed answer
      based on typical zip code patterns would be:

      \ the steps needed to determine if 63113, MO is located west of 63111, MO.\n\
      \n1. **Understanding US Zip Codes**: US zip codes are geographic codes used\
      \ by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to identify specific locations.\
      \ They are usually 5 digits long but can have an additional 4 digits to further\
      \ specify locations within a zip code area. For our purposes, we are focusing\

      \ digit of a zip code represents a group of states. For Missouri, where both\
      \ zip codes are located, the first digit begins with \"6\". The next two digits\
      \ narrow down the geographical area within the state, often corresponding to\
      \ a specific regional post office or area. The final two digits further pinpoint\
      \ the location within that area, such as a small town or a specific part of\
      \ a larger city.\n\n3. **Location of 63111 and 63113**: Both of these zip codes\
      \ are located in Missouri. Specifically:\n   - 63111 is associated with Saint\
      \ Louis, MO.\n   - 63113 is also associated with Saint Louis, MO.\n\n4. **Determining\
      \ Geographic Location**: \n   - Without specific geographic coordinates, we\
      \ cannot directly determine their relative positions (east/west) solely based\
      \ on the zip codes. However, knowing they are both in Saint Louis, we can look\
      \ at their geographical layout within the city.\n   - Saint Louis, MO, is a\
      \ city where zip codes are somewhat organized by geographic location, but without\
      \ looking at a detailed map or database of zip code boundaries, it's challenging\
      \ to determine their exact spatial relationship.\n\n5. **Using Additional Resources**:\

      \ that shows the boundaries of these zip codes within Saint Louis, MO.\n   -\
      \ Without access to such specific information in this format, I would typically\
      \ rely on geographic knowledge or lookup tools.\n\nGiven the constraints of\

      1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are 5-digit numbers where
      the first digit represents a group of states, the next two digits represent
      a regional area within that group, and the final two digits represent a specific
      post office or area within that region. For zip codes that start with "63",
      they are located in the state of Missouri.


      2. **Comparing Zip Codes**: When comparing two zip codes to determine their
      geographical relationship, it''s essential to look at the last two digits, as
      these indicate more specific locations within a region. The first three digits
      (in this case, "631" for both) indicate a broader area and are the same for
      both zip codes, meaning both are in the same general region of Missouri.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Generally, as you move west in the United States,
      the zip code numbers tend to increase. However, this is not a strict rule for
      determining the geographical orientation of two zip codes, especially within

      of 63111, MO, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how they
      relate to geographic locations.


      1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are 5-digit numbers where
      the first digit represents a group of states, the next two digits represent
      a regional area within that group, and the last two digits represent a specific
      post office or area within that region.


      2. **Geographic Location Indication**: Generally, as you move west, the zip
      code numbers tend to increase. However, this is not a strict rule and can vary
      significantly, especially when considering zip codes within the same city or
      metropolitan area.


      3. **Specific Zip Codes - 63113 and 63111**: Both of these zip codes are in
      the 631xx series, indicating they are in the same regional area, specifically
      in Missouri. The differences in the last two digits (13 vs. 11) suggest they
      are relatively close to each other but represent different specific areas or
      post offices.


      4. **Determining Direction**: Without a detailed map or specific knowledge of
      St. Louis, MO''s zip code layout, one might assume that a higher number could
      indicate a location further west, following the general principle of zip code
      numbering. However, this assumption does not always hold true, especially within
      urban areas where zip code assignments can be more complex and based on various
      factors including postal routes, population density, and geographic features.


      5. **Local Knowledge or Reference**: For an accurate determination, one would
      ideally refer to a map or a local source that outlines the specific boundaries
      of these zip codes. Given the proximity of their numbers, they are likely to
      be in the same general area, possibly even adjacent or very close to each other.


      Given the above considerations and without specific local knowledge or reference
      to detailed maps, the most accurate approach to answering this question would
      be to consult a reliable source such as the US Postal Service''s zip code lookup
      tool or a detailed map of St. Louis, MO. However, since the question demands
      a YES or NO answer based on general reasoning:


      The final answer is: NO'

      west of 63111, MO, we need to understand how US zip codes are structured and
      then apply that understanding to the specific zip codes in question.


      1. **Understanding US Zip Codes**: US zip codes are 5-digit codes that are used
      by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to identify specific geographic locations.
      The first digit of a zip code represents a group of states, the next two digits
      represent a regional area within that group, and the final two digits represent
      a specific post office or area within that region.


      2. **Analyzing the Given Zip Codes**: The zip codes provided are 63113 and 63111,
      both in Missouri (MO). The first three digits (631) are the same for both, indicating
      they are in the same regional area. The difference lies in the last two digits:
      13 for 63113 and 11 for 63111.


      3. **Determining Geographic Location**: Generally, as you move west, the zip
      code numbers decrease. However, this is not a strict rule, especially within
      the same city or metropolitan area, as zip code assignments can be based on
      various factors including postal routes and population density rather than strictly
      geographical location.


      4. **Specific Location of 63113 and 63111**: Both 63113 and 63111 are located
      in St. Louis, Missouri. Without specific geographic knowledge of St. Louis,
      one might assume that because 13 is greater than 11, 63113 could be east of
      63111, following the general principle that zip codes increase as you move east.
      However, actual locations can depend on the specifics of how zip codes were
      assigned in the area.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without direct knowledge of the layout of St. Louis or specific
      information on how these zip codes are arranged geographically, the general
      rule of thumb about zip codes increasing as you move east might suggest that
      63113 is east of 63111. However, for a definitive answer, one would typically
      need to consult a map or database that shows the exact boundaries of these zip
      codes.


      Given the information and typical patterns of zip code assignment, but without
      specific knowledge of St. Louis''s zip code geography, the most informed guess
      based on the general principle would be "NO", 63113 is not located west of 63111,
      assuming the typical eastward increase in zip code numbers. However, this is
      a reasoned guess rather than a certainty without specific geographic data.

      \ The difference lies in the last two digits: \"57\" for one and \"70\" for\
      \ the other.\n\n3. **Geographic Relationship**: Generally, as you move west\
      \ in the United States, the zip code numbers decrease because the zip code system\
      \ was designed to facilitate mail sorting and delivery from east to west and\

      \n3. **Zip Code Location**: To determine if 03057 is west of 03070, we need\
      \ to understand the general geographic layout of zip codes in New Hampshire.\
      \ The \"03\" in both zip codes indicates they are in New Hampshire. The next\
      \ two digits, \"05\" and \"07\", can give us a clue about their relative locations\

      \ codes increase as you move west or south in a state, but this is not a hard\
      \ and fast rule, as the assignment of zip codes also depends on the establishment\
      \ of post offices and population centers. However, within a specific range (like\

    a7452269-e884-418f-94de-07737dd5eead: 'To determine if 03057, NH is located west
      of 03070, NH, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how they
      relate to geographical locations.


      1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are five-digit codes where
      the first digit represents a group of states, the next two digits represent
      a regional area within that group, and the last two digits represent a specific
      post office or area within that region.


      2. **Geographical Representation**: Generally, as you move west in the United
      States, the first digit of the zip code increases (starting from the east coast).
      However, once you''re within a specific regional area (defined by the first
      three digits), the last two digits can give more specific location information
      within that area, but this doesn''t always follow a straightforward east-west
      pattern. Instead, it often reflects the order in which post offices were established
      or other geographical features.


      3. **Analyzing the Given Zip Codes**: Both 03057 and 03070 start with "030",
      which means they are in the same regional area. The differences are in the last
      two digits: "57" for the first zip code and "70" for the second.


      4. **Determining Location**: Without specific knowledge of each zip code''s
      location, one might assume that a lower number could be east or south and a
      higher number could be west or north, based on common mapping practices. However,
      zip code assignments do not strictly follow geographical order in a linear fashion,
      especially at the local level.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Given that both zip codes share the
      same first three digits ("030"), they are in the same general area. To determine
      their relative east-west positions without specific geographical data or a detailed
      map of New Hampshire''s zip code layout, we cannot make a definitive conclusion
      based solely on the numbers.

      \   - Next, we need to understand the geographic positions of these locations\
      \ relative to each other, specifically in terms of east-west orientation.\n\
      \   - Scarsdale, NY (10583) is in Westchester County, which is north of New\

      \   - Jamaica, NY (11439) is in Queens, which is one of the boroughs of New\
      \ York City, located on Long Island.\n\n3. **Compare east-west positions**:\n\
      \   - To determine if 10583 (Scarsdale) is west of 11439 (Jamaica), we need\

      \ (NE).\n\n2. **General Geographic Location**:\n   - Oklahoma is generally located\
      \ in the south-central part of the United States.\n   - Nebraska is located\
      \ in the Midwestern United States, north of Oklahoma.\n\n3. **Relative Positions**:\n\
      \   - Since Nebraska is north of Oklahoma, we need to consider their relative\
      \ east-west positions.\n   - Nebraska is east of the Rocky Mountains and part\
      \ of the Great Plains, as is Oklahoma.\n\n4. **Specific Locations**:\n   - Oklahoma\

      1. **Identify the States**: The first step is to identify the states associated
      with each zip code. The zip code 74868 is located in Oklahoma (OK), and the
      zip code 68516 is located in Nebraska (NE).


      2. **General Geographical Location of States**: Oklahoma is generally located

      the Midwestern part of the country, north of Oklahoma.


      3. **East-West Orientation**: To determine if one is west of the other, we need

      \ Zip Codes**: US zip codes are geographic indicators used by the United States\
      \ Postal Service (USPS) to route mail. Generally, the first digit of a zip code\
      \ represents a group of states, the next two digits represent a regional area\
      \ within that group, and the final two digits represent a specific post office\
      \ or area within that region.\n\n2. **Location of Zip Codes**: \n   - **60046,\
      \ IL**: This zip code is located in Illinois. The \"600\" prefix indicates it\
      \ is in the northern part of Illinois, close to Chicago.\n   - **60137, IL**:\
      \ This zip code is also in Illinois and, like 60046, it falls under the \"600\"\

      \ the same general area of the country (Illinois).\n   - **Regional Area Comparison**:\
      \ The next digit (\"0\" for 60046 and \"1\" for 60137) can indicate a more specific\

      \ might be moving westward in the state of Illinois, given the geographic layout\
      \ of zip code assignments.\n   - **Specific Area Comparison**: The final two\

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, I need to identify the locations associated
      with the zip codes 53597 and 53705 in Wisconsin.

      2. **Determine the cities**: Zip code 53597 is associated with the city of Waunakee,
      Wisconsin, and zip code 53705 is associated with the city of Madison, Wisconsin.

      3. **Understand the geography**: Waunakee is located just north of Madison,
      Wisconsin.

      4. **Consider the direction**: Since Waunakee is north of Madison, it is not
      west of Madison.

      \ to each other is what matters.\n   - Given the general geography, most of\
      \ Washington state is north of Oregon, not necessarily west. The coastal regions\
      \ of both states border the Pacific Ocean to the west.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Without precise locations, one might initially think that a location in\
      \ Washington could be west of a location in Oregon due to their north-south\
      \ alignment. However, considering the question asks specifically about being\
      \ west of, and knowing both states border the Pacific to their west, the critical\
      \ factor is the specific longitude of these zip codes.\n   - Upon closer inspection\
      \ or research, one would find that 98569 (Rochester, WA) and 97459 (Noti, OR)\
      \ are both near the Pacific coast but the determining factor is their longitude.\n\
      \nGiven the nature of the question and without specific tools to look up the\
      \ exact longitudes of these zip codes in this format, we rely on the understanding\
      \ that both locations are near the western edge of the United States. However,\
      \ since Washington is generally north of Oregon and considering the coastal\
      \ nature of both, the question essentially asks if one coastal or near-coastal\
      \ location is west of another, which simplifies to comparing their longitudes.\n\
      \n**Direct Answer**: \nGiven the simplification above and without direct longitude\
      \ comparison available in this response, the most straightforward step is acknowledging\
      \ that both states are on the west coast, and their specific zip codes' east-west\
      \ relationship depends on their exact longitudes. For a precise YES or NO, one\
      \ would need to compare the longitudes of 98569 and 97459 directly.\n\nHowever,\
      \ acknowledging the need for a direct answer based on typical geographic understanding\
      \ and without the ability to directly compare longitudes here, I must simplify\
      \ the response to fit the required format, which may not fully capture the nuanced\
      \ geographic comparison intended by the question.\n\nYES"

      \ zip code 98569 is located in the state of Washington (WA), and the zip code\
      \ 97459 is located in the state of Oregon (OR).\n\n2. **General geographical\
      \ knowledge**: Washington and Oregon are both located in the Pacific Northwest\

      \ Given that both zip codes are near the Pacific coast, the primary factor in\
      \ determining which is west is not applicable since both are coastal. However,\

      \ to each other. Oregon and Washington share a border, with Washington to the\
      \ north and Oregon to the south. \n\n5. **Conclusion**: The question asks if\
      \ 98569, WA (Washington) is located west of 97459, OR (Oregon). Considering\
      \ the geography, both states are roughly at the same longitude along their coastal\
      \ areas because they share a north-south border. However, since the question\
      \ is about being west, and considering the general layout of the states, the\
      \ difference in longitude between these two points is minimal, and the question\
      \ essentially becomes one of comparing the longitudinal positions of two points\
      \ that are relatively close in terms of east-west positioning.\n\nGiven the\
      \ nature of the question and without precise longitudinal data for each zip\
      \ code, one might initially think the difference could be negligible or that\

      \ However, understanding that both locations are coastal and near the same longitudinal\
      \ line in the Pacific Northwest, the actual determination of which is \"west\"\
      \ depends on specific longitudinal coordinates rather than state boundaries\
      \ alone.\n\nUpon reflection, since both locations are on the Pacific coast and\
      \ essentially at the same longitude (with variations being very minimal and\
      \ dependent on the specific location within the zip code area), the concept\
      \ of one being significantly \"west\" of the other based on state lines alone\

      \ WA is indeed east** of 97459, OR, because it is at a lower longitude value\

      \ is located in the Midwestern United States, more towards the central part\
      \ of the country but north of Texas.\n\n3. **Compare the locations in terms\
      \ of longitude (east-west)**:\n   - Since Texas is to the south and somewhat\
      \ to the west of Nebraska but significantly south, we need to consider if its\
      \ western position relative to Nebraska is what determines its location as \"\
      west\" in this context.\n\n4. **Determine the longitudinal relationship**:\n\
      \   - Nebraska (NE) is generally at a higher longitude (more to the east) compared\
      \ to Texas when considering the U.S. as a whole, but since Texas stretches quite\
      \ far west and Nebraska does not extend as far west as some parts of Texas,\
      \ we have to consider the specific longitudes of these zip codes.\n\n5. **Consider\
      \ the specific zip codes**:\n   - 75169, TX refers to a location in Texas. Texas\
      \ spans a significant amount of longitude, from approximately 93.5\xB0W to 106.6\xB0\
      W.\n   - 68152, NE refers to a location in Nebraska, which spans from about\
      \ 95.3\xB0W to 104.0\xB0W.\n\n6. **Direct comparison**:\n   - Without the exact\
      \ longitudes for each zip code, we can't make a precise comparison. However,\
      \ considering the general westward extent of Texas compared to Nebraska, it's\
      \ plausible that parts of Texas could be west of parts of Nebraska.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Given the information and the fact that Texas extends further west than\
      \ Nebraska, if the specific zip code 75169 is indeed west of the longitude of\
      \ 68152, then the answer would be yes. However, without exact coordinates, this\
      \ step requires acknowledging that the comparison depends on the specific longitudes\
      \ of these zip codes.\n\nBased on general geographical knowledge and without\
      \ exact coordinates for these zip codes, the most informed answer considering\
      \ typical geographical locations would lean towards the possibility that 75169,\
      \ TX could indeed be located west of 68152, NE, given Texas's broader westward\
      \ reach compared to Nebraska. However, for a definitive answer, precise longitude\

    c179af0a-ab7e-42e4-b965-b4eaa6560fa5: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      a few steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of the
      two zip codes given. The zip code 53406 is located in Wisconsin (WI), and the
      zip code 60525 is located in Illinois (IL).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Next, we need a basic understanding of the
      geography of the United States, particularly the relative locations of Wisconsin
      and Illinois. Wisconsin is located to the north of Illinois.


      3. **Determine the specific locations**: The zip code 53406 corresponds to Racine,
      Wisconsin, which is on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The zip code 60525
      corresponds to La Grange, Illinois, which is also near the western shore of
      Lake Michigan but in Illinois.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Knowing that both locations are near the western
      shore of Lake Michigan, we can determine their relative east-west positions.
      Since Wisconsin is north of Illinois and both zip codes are near the lake, the
      key factor is their latitude rather than their longitude (east-west position)
      because they are relatively close in terms of east-west positioning due to their
      proximity to the same body of water (Lake Michigan).


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that the question is about whether 53406, WI is located
      west of 60525, IL, and considering that both locations are essentially on the
      same east-west line along the western shore of Lake Michigan, the determining
      factor would be any slight difference in their longitudes. However, without
      precise longitude values, we rely on general geographic knowledge. Generally,
      Wisconsin and Illinois, being adjacent states with Wisconsin to the north, do
      not have a significant east-west offset in their borders. Thus, the question
      hinges on the specific longitudes of Racine, WI, and La Grange, IL.


      Given the general east-west alignment of the two states along the western shore
      of Lake Michigan and without precise longitude data provided in the question,
      the decision comes down to the specific geographic locations of these zip codes.
      Racine, WI (53406), and La Grange, IL (60525), are both near Lake Michigan,
      but La Grange is slightly west of Racine when considering their positions relative
      to the lake and the general geography of the area.


      Therefore, based on the general geography and without precise data, the answer
      would lean towards **YES**, considering La Grange, IL, is west of Racine, WI,
      in terms of their relative positions near Lake Michigan. However, it''s crucial
      to note that this answer assumes a general understanding and might not reflect
      precise geographic measurements.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

    05c8f1d5-1735-424f-8360-ade7cafb0187: "To answer whether 89506, NV is located\
      \ west of 89509, NV, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding ZIP Codes**:\
      \ ZIP codes are postal codes used in the United States to help sort and distribute\
      \ mail more efficiently. They are typically 5-digit codes, with the first digit\
      \ representing a group of states, the next two digits representing a regional\
      \ area within that group, and the last two digits representing a specific post\
      \ office or delivery area within that region.\n\n2. **Geographical Location\
      \ of ZIP Codes**: Generally, ZIP codes are assigned in a way that they increase\
      \ as you move east and north. However, there isn't a strict rule that applies\
      \ universally across all areas, especially considering geographical features,\
      \ urban planning, and historical reasons for assignment.\n\n3. **Specific ZIP\
      \ Codes - 89506 and 89509**: Both of these ZIP codes are located in Nevada,\
      \ with the \"895\" prefix indicating they are in the Reno area. To determine\
      \ their relative locations, we need to consider their specific geographical\
      \ placement within Reno, NV.\n\n4. **Researching the Locations**: \n   - 89506,\
      \ NV corresponds to the Reno, NV area, more specifically to parts of the city\
      \ that could be considered central or slightly west-central.\n   - 89509, NV\
      \ is also in Reno but represents areas that are more towards the north or northeast\
      \ parts of the city.\n\n5. **Determining West of**: To say one location is west\
      \ of another means it is situated to the west on the map. Given the general\
      \ layout of Reno and without precise mapping, we might infer from the ZIP code\
      \ structure that lower numbers could potentially represent areas to the west\
      \ (given the general rule that ZIP codes increase as you go east). However,\
      \ this is not a hard and fast rule, especially within the same city where geographical\
      \ and logistical considerations play a significant role in ZIP code assignment.\n\
      \n6. **Conclusion**: Based on a general understanding and without precise geographical\
      \ data, it might be tempting to make an educated guess. However, ZIP codes within\
      \ the same city area do not strictly follow the east-west rule due to the reasons\
      \ mentioned above. For an accurate determination, consulting a detailed map\
      \ of Reno, NV, that includes ZIP code boundaries would be necessary. Given that\
      \ 89506 and 89509 are both in Reno and considering typical urban ZIP code layouts,\
      \ it's reasonable to assume they could be relatively close, but the exact directional\
      \ relationship (west of) would depend on their specific locations within the\
      \ city.\n\nGiven the above steps and without a map to provide definitive proof,\
      \ the most informed answer based on logical deduction and understanding of ZIP\
      \ code structures would still be speculative. However, if we consider general\
      \ trends and the fact that both ZIP codes serve the Reno area, the likelihood\
      \ of one being strictly west of the other might depend more on the specific\
      \ layout of Reno's ZIP code assignments rather than a straightforward application\
      \ of the increasing ZIP code rule.\n\nThus, based on logical deduction and the\
      \ understanding that ZIP codes don't always follow a straightforward geographical\
      \ pattern within a city, the answer to whether 89506, NV is located west of\
      \ 89509, NV, would require specific geographical information to confirm accurately.\
      \ \n\nHowever, for the purpose of this exercise, and considering a need for\
      \ a definitive YES or NO answer without access to detailed mapping at this moment,\
      \ I must rely on general principles which may not perfectly apply here.\n\n\

    79efa64b-8b62-4cc4-903c-1988d55762c6: 'To determine if 89506, NV is located west
      of 89509, NV, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how they
      relate to geographic locations.


      1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The
      first digit represents a group of states, the next two digits represent a regional
      area within that group, and the final two digits represent a specific post office
      or area within that region.


      2. **Analyzing the Given Zip Codes**: Both 89506 and 89509 start with "895",
      which means they are in the same regional area. The difference lies in the last
      two digits, "06" and "09", which indicate specific post offices or areas within
      the region.


      3. **Geographic Implication**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way that
      increments in the last two digits often correspond to moving west or south in
      a region, but this is not a hard rule and can vary significantly by location.
      However, without specific knowledge about the zip code assignments in Nevada,
      we might assume a general principle that higher numbers could indicate a location
      further in a particular direction (e.g., west or south) within the same broader
      geographic area.


      4. **Nevada Specifics**: Knowing that Reno, Nevada, uses zip codes in the 895
      range, and assuming these zip codes follow a somewhat logical geographic distribution
      (which is not always the case), we would need specific information about how
      these zip codes are laid out in relation to each other.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Logic Alone**: Without access to a specific map or
      database of zip code areas, and considering that zip code assignments do not
      strictly follow geographic rules but rather are based on postal service routes
      and areas, we can''t definitively say which direction 89506 is located relative
      to 89509 based solely on the numbers. However, for the sake of providing an
      answer based on the typical assumption that higher numbers might indicate moving
      in a specific direction (and acknowledging this is a weak assumption without
      more data), one might guess that 89509 could be west of 89506 if we follow an
      increasing-number-means-moving-west assumption, which is not a reliable method
      for determining directions between zip codes.


      Given the lack of precise information about the layout of these specific zip
      codes and acknowledging that my reasoning is speculative without actual geographic
      data, I would still attempt to provide an answer based on the most logical deduction
      possible from the question itself, recognizing that this approach is flawed
      without specific knowledge of Nevada''s zip code geography.

      \ to look at the zip code itself. The first three digits (182 and 179) are important\
      \ for this comparison because they narrow down the geographic area within Pennsylvania.\n\
      \   - Generally, within a state, lower numbers can indicate areas that are more\

      \ step is to compare the second and third digits, which represent more specific\
      \ regional areas within the northeast. \n   - For 18202, the \"82\" suggests\
      \ it is located in eastern Pennsylvania.\n   - For 17961, the \"79\" suggests\
      \ it is located in a different part of Pennsylvania, potentially more central\
      \ or western compared to the \"82\" area.\n\n4. **Determining East/West Location**:\n\
      \   - Generally, as you move west in the United States, the zip code numbers\
      \ increase within a specific regional prefix (the first three digits). \n  \
      \ - Given that 18202 has a higher second and third digit (\"82\") compared to\
      \ 17961 (\"79\"), it suggests that 18202 is located west of 17961 within Pennsylvania.\n\

    e456d12c-5bba-4383-aec2-34969ee45d94: 'To determine if 28081, NC is located west
      of 43938, OH, let''s break it down:


      1. **Identify the states and their general locations**: North Carolina (NC)
      is located in the southeastern United States, and Ohio (OH) is in the eastern
      United States, north of West Virginia and east of Indiana.


      2. **Understand the general geography**: In the United States, as you move from
      east to west, you are essentially moving from the Atlantic coast towards the
      Pacific coast. Therefore, to be west of a location means you are further towards
      the Pacific Ocean relative to that location.


      3. **Consider the relative positions of NC and OH**: North Carolina is directly
      east of Ohio since NC is along the Atlantic coast and OH is inland but still
      east of the majority of the U.S.


      4. **Specific zip codes**: Without knowing the exact locations of these zip
      codes within their states, we can still infer based on the states'' positions.
      The zip code 28081 is in North Carolina, and 43938 is in Ohio.


      Given that NC is generally east of OH, it''s unlikely that a location in NC
      (28081) would be west of a location in OH (43938), considering their respective
      states'' positions relative to each other.


      **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical relationship between North Carolina
      and Ohio, with NC being to the east of OH, it is unlikely that 28081, NC would
      be west of 43938, OH. Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'

      Step 1: Identify the general geographic location of each zip code.


      - 28516, NC: This zip code is located in North Carolina. North Carolina is on
      the east coast of the United States.

      - 21252, MD: This zip code is located in Maryland. Maryland is also on the east
      coast of the United States, north of North Carolina.


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these locations.


      Given that both zip codes are on the east coast, we need to consider their north-south

      of 60466, IL, let''s break down the process step by step:


      1. **Understand the Basics of US Zip Codes**: US zip codes are numeric and typically
      represent specific geographic areas. The first digit represents a group of states,
      the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the final
      two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.


      2. **Identify the Region**: Both zip codes (60406 and 60466) start with "604",
      which means they are in the same regional area, specifically in Illinois.


      3. **Compare the Last Two Digits**: To determine the relative locations, we
      need to compare the last two digits of each zip code. The zip code 60406 has
      "06" as its last two digits, and 60466 has "66".


      4. **Apply Geographic Knowledge of Zip Code Patterns**: Generally, as you move
      west in the United States, zip codes increase in their last two digits within
      the same prefix (first three digits). This is because the US postal system assigned
      zip codes from east to west.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Patterns**: Since 66 is greater than 06, and assuming
      the pattern holds true for these specific zip codes, 60466 would be located
      west of 60406.


      Given this reasoning, the answer to whether 60406, IL is located west of 60466,

      \ Holland (60406), but the difference is not significantly west to categorically\
      \ state one is definitively west of the other without precise geographical data.\
      \ However, for the purpose of this comparison and considering the general layout\
      \ of zip codes, we are looking for a clear westward positioning.\n\nGiven the\
      \ steps above and acknowledging the complexity of zip code geography, the question\
      \ asks for a definitive yes or no regarding whether 60406, IL is located west\
      \ of 60466, IL. Based on the general understanding and without precise geographical\

      of 77075, TX, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how they
      relate to geographic locations.


      1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are 5-digit codes that
      are used by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to identify specific geographic
      areas. The first digit represents a group of states, the next two digits represent
      a regional area within that group, and the final two digits represent a specific
      post office or area within that region.


      2. **Location of Zip Codes**: The zip codes in question, 77029 and 77075, start
      with "770", which indicates they are both located in Texas, specifically in
      the Houston area. The next two digits, "29" and "75", further narrow down their
      locations within the city or metropolitan area.


      3. **Determining Geographic Location**: Without specific geographic knowledge,
      one might assume that lower numbers could potentially be located to the east
      or in a more central area of a city or region, while higher numbers could be
      to the west, based on how postal areas are often divided. However, this is a
      simplification and not a hard rule, as actual locations are determined by the
      USPS based on postal routes, population density, and geographic features.


      4. **Specific Locations of 77029 and 77075**: To accurately determine their
      locations, we would ideally refer to a map or database of US zip codes. However,
      based on general knowledge, both zip codes are in the Houston, Texas area. Without
      specific details, we can''t directly infer their relative east-west positions
      solely from the zip codes.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Since we don''t have explicit
      geographic locations or a detailed map to reference, and given the complexities
      of how zip codes are assigned, we cannot definitively conclude the relative
      east-west positions of 77029 and 77075 based solely on their zip codes without
      additional geographic data.


      However, for the purpose of this exercise and acknowledging the instruction
      to provide a YES/NO answer after reasoning, and considering that typically,
      the assignment of zip codes doesn''t strictly follow a linear geographic pattern
      but rather a combination of geographic and logistical considerations, we should
      ideally look up the exact locations. Given the constraint, I will proceed to
      the final answer based on typical assumptions and the understanding that a precise
      determination requires specific geographic information.

      of 40213, KY, we need to consider the general geographic locations of Michigan
      (MI) and Kentucky (KY) in relation to each other and then more specifically,
      the locations of the zip codes within those states.


      1. **General State Location**: Michigan is located in the northern United States,
      bordering the Great Lakes. Kentucky is situated more to the southeast. Generally,
      Michigan is north and slightly west of Kentucky, but we need to consider the
      specific locations within these states.


      2. **Zip Code Location - 49337, MI**: This zip code is located in the western
      part of Michigan. Michigan''s western edge borders Lake Michigan, one of the
      Great Lakes. Given its position in western Michigan, 49337 would be relatively
      west within the state.


      3. **Zip Code Location - 40213, KY**: This zip code is located in Louisville,
      Kentucky, which is in the northern part of the state. Louisville is not as far
      west as the western edge of Kentucky but is central to the state''s northern
      region.


      4. **Comparison**: Considering the geography, western Michigan (where 49337,
      MI is located) is generally north and slightly west of northern Kentucky (where
      40213, KY is located). However, the question is specifically about the east-west
      axis. Given that Michigan is generally north of Kentucky and considering the
      specific locations, 49337, MI would indeed be north of 40213, KY. However, when
      comparing their longitudinal positions (east-west), 49337, MI is more westward
      than 40213, KY because Michigan extends further west than Kentucky does.


      Therefore, based on the geographic locations of these zip codes within their
      respective states, the answer to whether 49337, MI is located west of 40213,
      KY is: **YES**.'

      \ United States.\n   - Arkansas (AR) is located in the southern United States.\n\

      \ given:**\n   - 61462 is in Illinois. Given Illinois' location in the Midwest,\
      \ it's relatively central in the US but leans towards the eastern part of the\
      \ country.\n   - 72401 is in Arkansas. Arkansas is located to the south and\

      \ of 97223, OR, we need to understand the general geographical locations associated\
      \ with these zip codes and the states they are in.\n\n1. **Identify the States**:\
      \ \n   - 98349 is located in the state of Washington (WA).\n   - 97223 is located\
      \ in the state of Oregon (OR).\n\n2. **General Geographical Location of States**:\n\
      \   - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United\
      \ States.\n   - Oregon is also in the Pacific Northwest but generally to the\
      \ south of Washington.\n\n3. **Relative Positions**:\n   - Given that both states\
      \ are in the Pacific Northwest, we need to consider their relative east-west\
      \ positions. Generally, the western parts of both states border the Pacific\
      \ Ocean, and their eastern parts extend towards the interior of North America.\n\

      \   - Considering the geographical layout, both zip codes are on the western\
      \ side of their respective states, but Washington state (where 98349 is located)\
      \ is generally north of Oregon (where 97223 is located). The question of being\

      \ their latitudinal positions. However, given that both are near the Pacific\
      \ coast and the question essentially asks about their relative longitudinal\
      \ positions, the distinction comes down to their specific locations within their\
      \ states and the shape of the states themselves.\n\nGiven these considerations,\

      \ positions and the fact that both are coastal states with the question essentially\

      \ the steps needed to determine if 98349, WA is located west of 97223, OR.\n\
      \n1. **Identify the locations**: \n   - 98349, WA refers to a zip code in the\
      \ state of Washington.\n   - 97223, OR refers to a zip code in the state of\
      \ Oregon.\n\n2. **Determine the geographical positions**:\n   - Washington state\
      \ is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.\n   - Oregon\
      \ is also in the Pacific Northwest, directly south of Washington.\n\n3. **Consider\
      \ the relative positions of Washington and Oregon**:\n   - Since Washington\
      \ is north of Oregon, the question becomes whether the specific locations within\
      \ these states (as indicated by the zip codes) could be west or east of each\
      \ other based on their geographical positions.\n\n4. **Analyze the longitude**:\n\
      \   - To be west of something, an area must have a higher longitude (in the\
      \ context of the United States, where westward means increasing longitude).\n\
      \   - However, given that both states are relatively close in terms of longitude\
      \ and both are in the western United States, the determining factor will be\
      \ their specific longitudes rather than their state-wide positions.\n\n5. **Look\
      \ at the specific zip codes**:\n   - 98349, WA is associated with the town of\
      \ Lacey or Olympia area, which is in the western part of Washington state, near\
      \ the coast.\n   - 97223, OR is associated with Portland, Oregon, which is also\
      \ in the western part of Oregon but more inland and slightly east compared to\
      \ the coastal regions of Washington.\n\n6. **Conclusion based on geographical\
      \ knowledge**:\n   - Given the coastal nature of 98349, WA and its position\
      \ relative to 97223, OR, which is more inland and slightly to the east, we can\
      \ reason about their relative positions.\n\nBased on the above steps, considering\
      \ the general geography of the region and without precise longitude values for\
      \ each zip code, one might infer that a coastal area of Washington could indeed\
      \ be west of an area in Oregon that is more inland. However, to give a definitive\
      \ answer, we should consider the actual longitudes:\n- The longitude of Lacey,\
      \ WA (associated with 98349) is around 122.8\xB0 W.\n- The longitude of Portland,\
      \ OR (associated with 97223) is around 122.6\xB0 W.\n\nGiven that 122.8\xB0\

      \ located to the west of the majority of the United States.\n\n4. **Specific\
      \ locations**:\n   - Without specific city knowledge, we can consider that both\

      \ Oregon, specifically the west side of Portland.\n\n6. **East-West Comparison**:\n\
      \   - Portland, OR (97223) is generally east of the Willamette Valley's western\
      \ edge and closer to the Cascade Range than Port Orchard, WA (98349) is to the\
      \ similar geological feature in Washington state.\n   - However, considering\
      \ the longitudinal aspect (east-west positioning), we note that both locations\
      \ are close to the Pacific coast. The key is their relative position to each\
      \ other.\n\n7. **Longitudinal Position**:\n   - Washington state, where 98349\
      \ is located, is at a higher latitude and slightly west or very close in longitude\
      \ to Oregon, where 97223 is located, considering their coastal positions.\n\n\
      Given these considerations, to directly answer the question without accessing\
      \ specific longitude data for these zip codes, we rely on the understanding\
      \ that the difference in longitude (east-west position) between two points so\
      \ close in latitude (north-south position) and both being near the coast might\
      \ not significantly differ in terms of being \"west\" of each other based on\

    065e8cf4-b0da-4770-9046-a80ab2df11f0: 'To answer this question, let''s analyze
      the zip codes provided and their locations relative to each other.


      1. **Understanding Zip Codes**: US zip codes are postal codes used by the United
      States Postal Service (USPS) to identify specific geographic locations. The
      first digit of a zip code represents a group of states, the next two digits
      represent a regional area within that group, and the final two digits represent
      a specific post office or area within that region.


      2. **Analyzing the Given Zip Codes**: The zip codes given are 85745 and 85746,
      both located in Arizona (AZ). Since the first three digits (857) are the same
      for both zip codes, they are in the same general area.


      3. **Determining Location**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way that
      they increase as you move east or north within a region. However, the exact
      location (east-west or north-south) can depend on the specific area and how
      the zip codes were assigned.


      4. **Specifics of Tucson, AZ**: Tucson, AZ, where these zip codes are located,
      has its zip codes generally increasing as you move north. However, the specific
      orientation (whether increasing zip codes move east or west) can vary based
      on the area''s layout and how the USPS assigned the codes.


      5. **Direct Comparison**: Without specific geographic knowledge of the area,
      one might assume that since 85746 is a higher number than 85745, it could be
      located to the east or north, following the general principle of zip code assignment.
      However, this is not always a reliable method for determining the exact location,
      as local geography and the history of postal service development can influence
      zip code assignments.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Geographic Knowledge**: Knowing that these zip codes
      are in Tucson, AZ, and considering the general principle that higher numbers
      often (but not always) indicate a location further east or north, we would still
      need specific knowledge of the area to definitively say which direction 85746
      is from 85745.


      Given the complexity and the need for specific local knowledge, the most accurate
      way to determine if 85745, AZ is located west of 85746, AZ would be to consult
      a detailed map of Tucson''s zip code areas or use geographic information systems
      (GIS) that provide the exact boundaries of these zip codes.


      However, based on general principles and without specific knowledge of the Tucson
      area''s zip code layout, it''s reasonable to consider that higher numbered zip
      codes could indicate a location to the east or north, but this does not provide
      a clear answer to the question without further information.


      **Given the above analysis and without specific local knowledge, I must rely
      on general principles which may not apply perfectly in this case. Therefore,

    37e0731d-6d56-493f-a785-d4c57f3d32c0: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Understanding Zip Codes**: US zip codes are geographic codes used by the
      United States Postal Service (USPS) to identify specific areas within the country.
      Generally, the first digit of a zip code represents a group of states, and as
      you move east to west, the numbers increase. However, once you are within a
      state, the spatial relationship between zip codes is not as straightforward
      and doesn''t strictly follow a linear east-west or north-south pattern. Instead,
      zip codes can be assigned based on postal routes, population density, and other
      logistical considerations.


      2. **Zip Code Structure**: A standard US zip code consists of five digits. The
      first three digits represent the sectional center facility (SCF), which is a
      central mail processing facility. The last two digits represent a specific post
      office or delivery area within that SCF.


      3. **Analyzing the Given Zip Codes**: The zip codes provided are 85745, AZ,
      and 85746, AZ. Both are in Arizona. The difference in the last digit (5 vs.
      6) indicates they are likely adjacent or very close to each other in terms of
      postal delivery areas but does not directly imply a specific east-west relationship
      without further context.


      4. **Geographic Location**: Without specific geographic knowledge or a database
      of zip code locations, one might assume that because the numbers are close,
      the locations are also close. However, the question of whether 85745 is west
      of 85746 requires actual geographic data or knowledge of the specific area in
      Arizona.


      5. **Researching the Specific Area**: Tucson, Arizona, is the city associated
      with the 85745 and 85746 zip codes. Detailed geographic information or a map
      would be necessary to determine the exact locations of these zip codes relative
      to each other.


      Given the proximity of these zip codes and without specific geographic data,
      one might be tempted to guess. However, in reality, zip code assignments can
      be quite specific and do not always follow simple geographic patterns. The actual
      locations can depend on how the postal service has divided the area for delivery
      purposes.


      **To Answer the Question**: Without access to current and detailed geographic
      information about these specific zip codes at the moment, I would typically
      need to look up their exact locations to give an accurate answer. However, the
      nature of the question suggests that there might be an expectation of a straightforward
      geographic relationship based on the zip code numbers alone, which is not necessarily
      how zip codes work.

      on typical expectations rather than actual geographic data:

    7772a0d4-6957-4491-b6de-857c6cf002b8: 'To determine if 85745, AZ is located west
      of 85746, AZ, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Understand Zip Code Structure**: US zip codes are 5-digit numbers that
      identify specific geographic locations. The first digit represents a group of
      states, the next two digits represent a regional area within those states, and
      the last two digits represent a post office or a specific area within that region.


      2. **Identify the Location**: Both 85745 and 85746 are zip codes in Arizona
      (AZ), as indicated. The first three digits "857" are the same for both, indicating
      they are in the same general area.


      3. **Compare the Last Two Digits**: The last two digits, which are "45" for
      the first zip code and "46" for the second, help to pinpoint the location more
      precisely. Generally, as the numbers increase, the location moves eastward or
      in a specific pattern determined by the postal service, but this is not a hard
      and fast rule as zip code assignments can be irregular.


      4. **Geographic Relationship**: Without specific geographic knowledge or a map,
      it''s challenging to determine the exact relationship based solely on the zip
      code numbers. However, in many cases, lower numbered zip codes can be west or
      southwest of higher numbered ones in the same prefix, but this is not universally
      true and depends on how the zip codes were assigned in that particular area.


      5. **Specific Knowledge of Tucson, AZ**: Recognizing that both zip codes are
      in Tucson, Arizona, and knowing the specific layout of Tucson''s zip codes is
      crucial. Generally, in Tucson, zip codes increase as you move from west to east.
      This means that a lower zip code number (like 85745) would typically be located
      west of a higher zip code number (like 85746) in the same prefix.


      Based on these steps, especially considering the general rule that lower numbered
      zip codes in the same prefix area tend to be west of higher numbered ones in
      regions like Tucson, Arizona, we can reason that 85745, AZ is indeed located
      west of 85746, AZ.

    b7712b45-86f2-4e1f-bf44-33f4a8ab0f83: 'To determine if 85745, AZ is located west
      of 85746, AZ, let''s break down the process:


      1. **Understanding Zip Codes**: US zip codes are geographic codes used by the
      United States Postal Service (USPS) to identify specific areas in the country.
      The first digit represents a group of states, the next two digits represent
      a regional area within that group, and the last two digits represent a specific
      post office or area within that region. Sometimes, the last two digits are sequential
      for areas that are close to each other.


      2. **Zip Code Structure**: The structure of zip codes doesn''t inherently indicate
      geographic direction (north, south, east, west) but rather is based on the postal
      service''s need to efficiently route mail. However, within a specific geographic
      area, sequential zip codes can sometimes indicate proximity.


      3. **Specific Zip Codes**: The zip codes in question, 85745 and 85746, are both
      located in Arizona (as indicated by "AZ"). To determine their relative locations,
      we can look at a map or use geographic information that correlates zip codes
      with their locations.


      4. **Geographic Location**: Without specific geographic information readily
      available, one might assume that because these zip codes are sequential (85745
      and 85746), they could be close to each other. However, the exact direction
      (north, south, east, west) between them cannot be determined solely by the zip
      code numbers.


      5. **Research**: To accurately answer the question, one would typically need
      to consult a map or a database that correlates zip codes with geographic locations.
      However, for the sake of this exercise, let''s consider general knowledge about
      zip code assignments. In some areas, zip codes are assigned in a pattern that
      can reflect the geographic layout, but this is not a hard and fast rule, especially
      in urban areas where new developments and postal needs can lead to non-intuitive
      assignments.


      Given the information typically available and without specific knowledge about
      the layout of these zip codes in Arizona, the most straightforward approach
      would be to look at a map. However, based on the sequential nature of the zip
      codes and without additional context or information, it''s tempting to make
      an educated guess. But, it''s essential to remember that zip code sequences
      do not reliably indicate direction.


      Therefore, without access to a specific map or database that details the exact
      locations of these zip codes, the best answer would be based on the understanding
      that zip code sequences don''t inherently indicate geographic directions. But
      since I need to provide a YES or NO answer and given that typically sequential
      zip codes can be near each other but not necessarily in a specific direction,
      I must rely on external knowledge or mapping data which I don''t have access
      to in this format.


      Given the constraints and the need for a direct answer, I would caution that
      my response is not based on specific geographic data but rather on the process
      of reasoning about zip codes. Thus, my ability to provide an accurate YES or
      NO is limited by the information provided and the nature of zip code assignments.

      sequential nature of the zip codes and acknowledging the limitations:

    092be99e-740f-4889-a10a-187c3ffa48b9: 'To determine if 08026, NJ is located west
      of 08867, NJ, we need to understand what the numbers in a US zip code represent
      and then compare the locations based on those numbers.


      US zip codes are typically 5 digits and can give us an idea of the general location
      of a place within a state. The first digit represents a group of states, the
      next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last two
      digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.


      For New Jersey (NJ), zip codes starting with "08" and "07" or "08" generally
      represent the southern part of the state, while codes starting with "08" specifically
      can be more towards the southwestern or southern areas. Codes starting with
      "088" can represent areas more towards the central or north-central parts of
      the state.


      Given the zip codes:

      - 08026, NJ

      - 08867, NJ


      We can break them down as follows:

      - The "080" in 08026 suggests it is in the southern part of New Jersey.

      - The "088" in 08867 suggests it is more towards the central part of New Jersey.


      Generally, central New Jersey is located west of southern New Jersey when considering
      the state''s geography from east to west. However, without exact longitude and
      latitude, we rely on the general geographic layout of New Jersey and the typical
      distribution of zip codes.


      Therefore, considering the general geography and the typical distribution of
      zip codes in New Jersey, 08026 (southern NJ) would likely be east of 08867 (central
      NJ), given that the southern part of the state is closer to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east) and the central part moves more inland (west).


      Based on this reasoning, 08026, NJ is not located west of 08867, NJ.

      \ code is for Pittstown, NJ.\n\n4. **Determine geographic locations**:\n   -\
      \ Glassboro, NJ (08026) is located in Gloucester County, which is in the southern\
      \ part of New Jersey.\n   - Pittstown, NJ (08867) is located in Hunterdon County,\

      \ County.\n\n5. **Compare locations**:\n   - Given their locations, Pittstown\
      \ (08867) is generally northwest of Glassboro (08026), but since the question\
      \ asks specifically about being west, we need to consider the primary directional\
      \ difference. Pittstown is indeed more to the west than Glassboro.\n\nBased\
      \ on these steps, the answer to whether 08026, NJ is located west of 08867,\

      \ of 08867, NJ, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the zip codes**:\
      \ We have two zip codes - 08026 and 08867, both in New Jersey (NJ).\n\n2. **Understand\
      \ zip code structure**: US zip codes are structured to generally increase as\
      \ you move east and north. The first digit represents a group of states, the\
      \ next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      3. **Compare the zip codes**:\n   - 08026 starts with \"08\", indicating it's\
      \ in the same regional area as other \"08\" zip codes.\n   - 08867 starts with\
      \ \"08\" as well, placing it in the same broad regional area as 08026.\n\n4.\
      \ **Determine the specific location**:\n   - For a more precise comparison,\
      \ we look at the next two digits:\n     - 08026 has \"02\" as its next two digits.\n\
      \     - 08867 has \"86\" as its next two digits.\n   - Generally, the higher\
      \ the number in the zip code (after the first digit), the farther east or north\
      \ the location is within a state or region.\n\n5. **Apply geographical knowledge\
      \ of New Jersey**:\n   - New Jersey is a relatively small state located in the\
      \ northeastern United States.\n   - Knowing the general layout of New Jersey,\
      \ we can consider that areas with higher numbers in their zip codes tend to\
      \ be more towards the eastern part of the state, given the state's geography\
      \ and how zip codes are allocated.\n\n6. **Conclusion based on zip code comparison**:\n\
      \   - Since \"86\" is greater than \"02\", this suggests that 08867 is located\
      \ east of 08026, given the general structure of the US zip code system and considering\
      \ New Jersey's layout.\n\nBased on these steps, the answer to whether 08026,\
      \ NJ is located west of 08867, NJ is: **YES**"

      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the final\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      3. **Compare the Zip Codes**:\n   - **08026**: The first digit \"0\" represents\
      \ the Northeastern states. The next two digits \"80\" can be associated with\
      \ New Jersey. The last two digits \"26\" specify the area.\n   - **08867**:\
      \ Similarly, \"0\" represents the Northeast, \"88\" is associated with New Jersey,\
