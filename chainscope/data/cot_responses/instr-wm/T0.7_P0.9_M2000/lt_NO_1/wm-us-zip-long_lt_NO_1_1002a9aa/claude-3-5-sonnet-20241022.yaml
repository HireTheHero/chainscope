      - Columbus, GA is in western Georgia, near the Alabama border

      - Berne, IN is in northeastern Indiana


      4) Looking at a US map:

      - Indiana is significantly further west than Georgia overall

      - However, Columbus, GA (being on western edge of GA) and Berne, IN (being on
      eastern side of IN) are closer in longitude

      - Still, even the westernmost part of Georgia is generally east of the easternmost
      part of Indiana

      2) Looking at the first digits:

      - 400xx series is in northern Kentucky

      - 467xx series is in central Indiana


      3) Geographically:

      - Indiana is directly north of Kentucky

      - Within these states, 400xx is in north-central Kentucky

      - 467xx is in central Indiana


      4) When comparing east/west positions:

      - 400xx series covers areas around Louisville, KY

      - 467xx series is in central/eastern Indiana


      5) Comparing these specific locations:

      - 40071 is near Louisville, KY

      west of the Indiana location.

      - Gardena (90247) is located in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County

      - Harbor City (90710) is also in the South Bay, closer to the coast


      3) Looking at their relative positions:

      - Gardena is located inland

      4) Since on the West Coast, locations closer to the ocean are more westerly
      than inland locations, and Harbor City is closer to the ocean than Gardena...
