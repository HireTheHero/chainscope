      2. **Understand the general geography**: Missouri is a state located in the
      Midwestern United States. It is bordered by eight states: Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky,
      Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska.

      3. **Specific locations**: Without specific city names, we can still infer based

      close as well. In this case, the zip codes 63113 and 63111 are very close, suggesting

      4. **Compare the positions**: Since we don''t have specific city names, we can''t
