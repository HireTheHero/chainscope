      is located west of Coldwater Lake, WA, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: La Poudre Pass Lake is located in Colorado (CO),
      and Coldwater Lake is located in Washington (WA).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Colorado is generally located in the western
      part of the United States, while Washington is located in the northwestern part.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Washington is located further west than
      Colorado, any location in Washington, like Coldwater Lake, would be west of
      any location in Colorado, including La Poudre Pass Lake.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether La Poudre Pass Lake, CO, is located
      west of Coldwater Lake, WA, is: NO

      1. **Identify the locations**: Camel''s Hump is located in Vermont (VT), and
      Shanty Hollow Lake is in Kentucky (KY).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Vermont is located in the northeastern part

      Colorado are located west of Boca Reservoir in California, we need to consider
      their relative positions on the map.


      1. **Identify the locations**: La Garita Mountains are located in Colorado (CO),
      and Boca Reservoir is in California (CA).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Colorado is generally located in the central
      part of the United States, while California is on the western coast.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since California is to the west of Colorado, any
      location in Colorado (like La Garita Mountains) would be east of locations in
      California (such as Boca Reservoir).


      Based on these steps, since California is west of Colorado, La Garita Mountains
