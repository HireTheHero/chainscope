      Michigan''s Lower Peninsula


      3. Now I''ll compare their geographic locations

      - New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States

      - Michigan is located in the midwestern United States

      - New Hampshire is east of Michigan


      4. Reasoning about their relative positions

      - Since New Hampshire is east of Michigan, any location in New Hampshire (like
      Mount Franklin) would be east of any location in Michigan (like Walloon Lake)


      5. Therefore, Mount Franklin is NOT west of Walloon Lake, but east of it.


      The answer is: NO.'

      - New Hampshire is east of Michigan

      - So Mount Franklin will be east of Walloon Lake, not west

    aceb5656-f7de-4f34-85ff-c94c34cfd53b: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Great Salt Plains Lake in Oklahoma

      - This is a lake located in northwestern Oklahoma, in Alfalfa County


      2. Next, locate the San Jacinto Mountains

      - These mountains are in southern California, near Palm Springs and Riverside


      3. Determine their geographic relationship

      - Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - These two locations are in different states, quite far from each other


      4. Check the specific location relative to each other

      - Great Salt Plains Lake is east of California

      - San Jacinto Mountains are in California

      - Therefore, Great Salt Plains Lake is NOT west of San Jacinto Mountains


      5. Conclusion: The statement is false

      1. Luna Lake is located in Arizona, specifically in the eastern part of the
      state near the New Mexico border.


      2. The Calapooya Mountains are located in Oregon, in the western part of that
      state.


      3. These two locations are in completely different states - Arizona and Oregon.


      4. Given their geographic locations, Luna Lake (in Arizona) is east of the Calapooya

      - The Ortiz Mountains are in central New Mexico, southwest of Santa Fe

      - They are located in Santa Fe and Sandoval Counties


      2. Next, I''ll locate Upper Klamath Lake in Oregon

      2. Gun Lake is located in Barry County, western Michigan.


      3. Marston Lake is located in Colorado (though I don''t know its exact location).


      4. Michigan is east of Colorado.


      5. Therefore, Gun Lake (in Michigan) is east of Marston Lake (in Colorado).


      6. The question asks if Gun Lake is west of Marston Lake.


      7. Since Gun Lake is actually east of Marston Lake, the answer is NO.
