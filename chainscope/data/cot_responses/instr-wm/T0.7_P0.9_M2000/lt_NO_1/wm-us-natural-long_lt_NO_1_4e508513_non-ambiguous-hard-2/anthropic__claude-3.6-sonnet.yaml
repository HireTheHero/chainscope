      on a map:

      - Canandaigua Lake is in western NY, but NY is an eastern state

      - Minnesota is significantly further west than New York state

      - Red Lake is in Minnesota, so it must be further west than any point in NY

      - Lake Inman is in Kansas

      - New York is in the northeastern US

      - Kansas is in the central US


      2. To determine which is further west, I need to compare their relative positions:

      - New York state lies entirely east of Kansas

      - Therefore, any lake in New York must be east of any lake in Kansas


      3. Since Canada Lake is in New York and Lake Inman is in Kansas:

      - Canada Lake must be east of Lake Inman

      - Not west of it

      1) First, let me recall the general locations:

      - Black Mountains (NC) are in western North Carolina

      - Carancahua Bay (TX) is on the Gulf Coast of Texas


      2) For east-west comparison:

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast of the US

      - Texas is in the south-central US, extending from the center of the country
      to the Gulf Coast

      - Texas is significantly west of North Carolina


      3) Therefore, any point in North Carolina, including the Black Mountains, must
      be EAST of any point in Texas, including Carancahua Bay.


      NO'

      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Black Mountains (NC) is in western North Carolina

      - Carancahua Bay (TX) is on the Gulf Coast of Texas


      2) For east-west positioning:

      - North Carolina is on the eastern coast of the US

      - Texas extends from the central US to the Gulf Coast

      - All of Texas is west of North Carolina


      3) Therefore:

      - Since Carancahua Bay is in Texas, and Texas is entirely west of North Carolina

      - And Black Mountains is in North Carolina

      - Black Mountains must be EAST of Carancahua Bay, not west


      NO'
