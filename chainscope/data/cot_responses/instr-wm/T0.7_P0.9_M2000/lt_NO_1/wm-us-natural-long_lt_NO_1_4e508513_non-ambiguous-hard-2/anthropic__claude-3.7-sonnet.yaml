      - The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are located in southern Colorado (and extend
      into New Mexico).

      - The Temblor Range is located in California, specifically in the southern part
      of the state.

      - Colorado is located inland, east of California, with Nevada and Utah between
      them.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Any location in Colorado would generally be east of most locations in California.

      - The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are in the eastern part of Colorado.

      - The Temblor Range is in California, which is entirely west of Colorado.

      - Canandaigua Lake is in western New York state, in the Finger Lakes region.

      - Red Lake is in northern Minnesota.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - New York is on the eastern side of the United States.

      - Minnesota is in the upper Midwest region, significantly west of New York.


      Step 3: Compare their approximate longitudes.

      - All of New York state, including the western portions where Canandaigua Lake
      is located, lies east of Minnesota.

      - Red Lake in Minnesota would be several hundred miles west of any point in
      New York state.


      Therefore, Canandaigua Lake in NY is located EAST of Red Lake in Minnesota,
      not west of it.

      - Montana is a western state that borders Canada, located in the Rocky Mountain
      region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Since Montana is significantly west of Wisconsin, and these lakes are within
      their respective states, Grinnell Lake (in Montana) must be west of Lake Namakagon
      (in Wisconsin).


      Step 4: Verify the conclusion.

      - Even accounting for the specific locations within each state, the entire state
      of Wisconsin is east of Montana, so Lake Namakagon must be east of Grinnell

      Step 1: Let me identify the general locations of these two places.

      - Delaware Bay is on the east coast of the United States, between New Jersey
      and Delaware.

      - Cass Lake is in northern Minnesota, which is in the upper Midwest of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions in terms of longitude (east-west positioning).

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast, which is on the eastern side of the United
      States.

      - Minnesota is in the interior of the country, significantly west of the Atlantic
      coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - States on the Atlantic coast (like New Jersey) are generally east of interior
      states like Minnesota.

      - Delaware Bay would be even further east within New Jersey, as it''s on the
      eastern border of the state.

      - Cass Lake would be somewhere in the interior of Minnesota, but regardless
      of its exact position, Minnesota as a whole is west of New Jersey.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on east-west positioning.

      - Since Delaware Bay is on the east coast and Cass Lake is in Minnesota (which
      is much further west), Delaware Bay must be east of Cass Lake.

      - If Delaware Bay is east of Cass Lake, then it cannot be west of Cass Lake.

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region, much further inland from
      the East Coast.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations.

      - Delaware Bay is on the eastern coast of New Jersey, where the Delaware River
      meets the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Cass Lake is in northern Minnesota.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - States on the East Coast (like New Jersey) are generally east of inland states
      (like Minnesota).

      - Delaware Bay, being on the Atlantic coast of New Jersey, is significantly
      east of any point in Minnesota.

      - Cass Lake in Minnesota is much further west as Minnesota is several states
      away from the East Coast.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Guadalupe Mountains is in Texas, near the border with New Mexico in western
      Texas.

      - Walker Lake is in Nevada, in the western part of that state.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States.

      - Nevada is in the western United States, between California and Utah.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Nevada is significantly west of Texas on the map of the United States.

      - Even western Texas (where Guadalupe Mountains is located) is still east of
      Nevada.

      - Walker Lake, being in Nevada, would be west of any point in Texas.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Walker Lake is in Nevada (a western state) and Guadalupe Mountains is
      in Texas (a more central/eastern state), Walker Lake must be west of Guadalupe
      Mountains.

      - Therefore, Guadalupe Mountains cannot be west of Walker Lake.


      NO, Guadalupe Mountains, TX is not located west of Walker Lake, NV. It is east
      of Walker Lake.'

      - Lake Phalen is in the eastern part of Minnesota, near St. Paul.

      - The Hueco Mountains are in the far western tip of Texas, near El Paso and
      the Mexico border.


      Step 4: Comparing their longitudes:

      - Minnesota generally lies east of the western part of Texas.

      - However, Texas extends very far west, and the Hueco Mountains are in that
      western extremity.

      - The Hueco Mountains are much further west than Lake Phalen.

      - Utah locations are typically around 110-114 degrees west longitude.

      - The greater the west longitude number, the further west the location.

      - Since Utah has higher longitude numbers, it is west of Texas.


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison.

      - Lake Travis, TX would be in central Texas, roughly around 97-98 degrees west.

      - The Wellsville Mountains in northern Utah would be roughly around 111-112
      degrees west.

      - Since the Wellsville Mountains have a higher west longitude, they are west

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes is in Maine (ME), which is in the northeastern
      United States.

      - Kingsley Lake is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of Maine and Florida.

      - Maine is located on the East Coast of the United States, at the northeastern
      corner.

      - Florida is also on the East Coast, but much further south.

      - When comparing east-west positions, Maine and Florida are roughly aligned
      along the same north-south coastal region.


      Step 3: Consider more specific geography.

      - Maine is slightly east of Florida in general, as the East Coast curves eastward
      as you move north.

      - Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes is in north-central Maine.

      - Kingsley Lake is in northeastern Florida.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Given the curvature of the East Coast, locations in Maine tend to be further
      east than locations in Florida.

      - Therefore, Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes in Maine is likely east of Kingsley
      Lake in Florida, not west.

      British Columbia, Canada. While the question mentions "WA" (Washington state),
      the Strait of Georgia is primarily in Canadian waters, though its southern portion
      does connect to Washington''s waters.


      Step 2: Consider their east-west positions.

      - Colorado is located in the interior western United States.

      - The Strait of Georgia is on the Pacific coast of North America.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Washington state and the Pacific coast are significantly further west than
      Colorado.

      - The Rocky Mountains in Colorado, including Park Range, are east of the Pacific
      coastal areas where the Strait of Georgia is located.


      Therefore, Park Range in Colorado is located EAST of the Strait of Georgia,
      not west of it.

      - The Pacific coast, including the Strait of Georgia, forms the western edge
      of North America.

      - Colorado, while in the western United States, is still inland from the Pacific
      coast.

      - Locations on the Pacific coast will generally be further west (have a more
      western longitude) than inland locations like those in Colorado.

      Step 3: Since California is west of Texas, generally any location in California
      would be west of any location in Texas.


      Step 4: However, I need to be careful about specific locations within these
      states. California extends quite far east, and Texas is a large state. Let me
      consider the specific locations:

      - Delaware Mountains are in western Texas, near the border with New Mexico

      - Briones Reservoir is in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, which is
      on the western side of California


      Step 5: Even the westernmost parts of Texas are still east of the San Francisco
      Bay Area in California.

    d51400cd-919a-4be5-b61e-00ac70937b49: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Black Mountains (North Carolina) is a mountain range in western North Carolina

      - Carancahua Bay is a bay along the Gulf Coast of Texas


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - North Carolina is on the eastern side of the United States, along the Atlantic
      coast

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States, with its southern border
      along the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      - Texas is significantly west of North Carolina

      - Any location in North Carolina would be east of most locations in Texas

      - Carancahua Bay, being on the Gulf Coast of Texas, is in the eastern part of
      Texas, but still well west of North Carolina


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Black Mountains is in western North Carolina, and Carancahua Bay is
      in eastern Texas, the Black Mountains would be east of Carancahua Bay, not west.

    ddc523dc-42e2-44a4-b16b-b79eb834ebea: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Black Mountains (North Carolina) is a mountain range in western North Carolina.

      - Carancahua Bay is a bay located on the Gulf Coast of Texas.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - North Carolina is on the eastern side of the United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.

      - Texas is in the south-central United States, with its southern border along
      the Gulf of Mexico.

      - States west of Texas include New Mexico, Colorado, etc., while states east
      of Texas include Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and eventually the
      Carolinas.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - North Carolina is located significantly east of Texas on a U.S. map.

      - Since Black Mountains is in North Carolina, and Carancahua Bay is in Texas,
      the Black Mountains must be east of Carancahua Bay.


      NO, Black Mountains (North Carolina) is NOT located west of Carancahua Bay,
      Texas. It is located east of it.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Black Mountains (North Carolina) are located in western North Carolina, in
      the eastern United States.

      - Carancahua Bay is located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map of the United States.

      - North Carolina is on the eastern side of the United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean.

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States, with its southern
      border on the Gulf of Mexico.

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Texas is significantly west of North
      Carolina.


      Step 3: Make the specific comparison between these two locations.

      - Since Black Mountains are in western North Carolina, and North Carolina as
      a whole is east of Texas, the Black Mountains must be east of any point in Texas,
      including Carancahua Bay.

      - Therefore, Black Mountains (NC) cannot be west of Carancahua Bay (TX).
