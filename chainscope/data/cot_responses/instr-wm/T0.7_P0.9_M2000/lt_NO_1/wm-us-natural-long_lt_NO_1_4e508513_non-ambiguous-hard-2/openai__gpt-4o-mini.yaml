      of both places.


      1. **Location of Canandaigua Lake, NY**: Canandaigua Lake is located in the
      Finger Lakes region of New York. It is situated to the southeast of Rochester,
      NY.


      2. **Location of Red Lake, MN**: Red Lake is located in northern Minnesota.
      It is notably situated to the northwest of Minneapolis.


      3. **Comparative Position**: To find out if Canandaigua Lake is west of Red

      northeastern part of the United States, while Red Lake is in the north-central
      part of the country.


      4. **Geographical Orientation**: When looking at a map, we can see that New
      York (where Canandaigua Lake is located) is east of Minnesota (where Red Lake

      4. **Relative Positioning**: Since "west of" implies that one location is positioned
      to the left (west) of another on a map, and given that Mount Monroe is to the

      west of the Ouachita Mountains.

      1. **Identify the location of Luna Lake, AZ**: Luna Lake is situated in the
      eastern part of Arizona, near the town of Show Low.


      2. **Identify the location of the Calapooya Mountains, OR**: The Calapooya Mountains
      are located in the western part of Oregon, specifically in the central part
      of the state, near the Cascade Range.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Arizona is located south of Oregon,
      and within Arizona, Luna Lake is in the eastern part of the state. The Calapooya
      Mountains, being in western Oregon, are situated to the northwest of Luna Lake.


      Now, to answer the question:


      Since Luna Lake is in the eastern part of Arizona and the Calapooya Mountains
      are in the western part of Oregon, Luna Lake is not located west of the Calapooya
      Mountains.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'
