      down step by step:


      1. **Location of Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO**: The Sangre de Cristo Mountains
      are located primarily in southern Colorado, extending into northern New Mexico.
      They are part of the Rocky Mountains.


      2. **Location of Temblor Range, CA**: The Temblor Range is located in California.
      It runs in a north-south direction along the western edge of the San Joaquin
      Valley, which is part of the Coast Ranges of California.


      3. **Relative Position**: To determine whether the Sangre de Cristo Mountains
      are west or east of the Temblor Range, we need to consider their positions relative
      to each other. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains, being in Colorado, are generally
      east of the central part of California where the Temblor Range is located.


      Based on these steps, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO are located east of
      the Temblor Range, CA.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: NO.'

      1. **Identify the location of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains:** These mountains
      are primarily located in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. They are
      part of the Rocky Mountains.


      2. **Identify the location of the Temblor Range:** The Temblor Range is located
      in California, west of the San Joaquin Valley, and east of the Coast Ranges.


      3. **Determine their relative positions:** The Sangre de Cristo Mountains, being
      in Colorado, are situated more to the east compared to the Temblor Range, which
      is in California.


      Therefore, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are east of the Temblor Range.


      The answer is: NO.'

      1. **Mummy Range, CO**: This is a mountain range located in the Rocky Mountains
      of northern Colorado, specifically in the northern part of Rocky Mountain National
      Park.


      2. **Rattlesnake Lake, WA**: This is a lake located in King County, Washington,
