      located west of Lake Noquebay, WI, we need to analyze their relative geographic
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Spednic Lake, ME.

      - Spednic Lake is located on the eastern edge of Maine, near the border with
      New Brunswick, Canada. This puts it in far eastern Maine, one of the easternmost
      parts of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Noquebay, WI.

      - Lake Noquebay is located in Marinette County in northeastern Wisconsin. Wisconsin
      is located in the Midwest region of the United States, which is geographically
      west of Maine.


      Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions.

      - Maine is the easternmost state in the continental US.

      - Wisconsin is significantly west of Maine.

      locations of both places.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Misquah Hills.

      - Misquah Hills is located in northeastern Minnesota, in the United States.

      - Specifically, it is part of the Superior National Forest and is situated near
      the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Sierra Madre Range.

      - The Sierra Madre Range is located in southern Wyoming and extends into Colorado.

      - It is part of the Rocky Mountains.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Minnesota is in the central northern part of the United States.

      - Wyoming is located to the west of Minnesota.

      - Therefore, Sierra Madre Range in Wyoming is west of Misquah Hills in Minnesota.


      Step 4: Determine the answer to the question:

      - The question asks if Misquah Hills is located west of Sierra Madre Range.

      - Since Minnesota is east of Wyoming, Misquah Hills is east of Sierra Madre

      Step 1: Identify the general location of each lake.


      - **Catahoula Lake**, Louisiana: Located in central-eastern Louisiana.

      - **Alturas Lake**, Idaho: Located in central Idaho, in the Sawtooth National
      Recreation Area.


      Step 2: Consider the longitudes.


      - Louisiana is in the southeastern region of the United States, generally east
      of the Rocky Mountains.

      - Idaho is in the northwestern United States.


      When comparing longitude, the farther west the location, the higher the degrees
      west (closer to the Pacific Ocean). Idaho is west of Louisiana in terms of geography.


      Therefore, **Alturas Lake, ID is west of Catahoula Lake, LA**.


      So, the answer to the question "Is Catahoula Lake, LA located west of Alturas
      Lake, ID?" is:

      \ by step:\n\n1. **Identify the location of Lake Minnetonka, MN:**\n   - Lake\
      \ Minnetonka is in the state of Minnesota, located just west of Minneapolis.\n\
      \   - Minneapolis is in the eastern part of Minnesota but still generally in\
      \ the northern-central United States.\n   - The approximate longitude of Lake\
      \ Minnetonka is around 93.6\xB0W.\n\n2. **Identify the location of Saguaro Lake,\
      \ AZ:**\n   - Saguaro Lake is located in Arizona, northeast of Phoenix.\n  \
      \ - Arizona is in the southwestern region of the United States.\n   - The approximate\
      \ longitude of Saguaro Lake is around 111.5\xB0W.\n\n3. **Compare the longitudes:**\n\
      \   - A lower longitude number (in degrees west) means the location is farther\
      \ east.\n   - 93.6\xB0W (Lake Minnetonka) is east of 111.5\xB0W (Saguaro Lake).\n\
      \nTherefore, Lake Minnetonka is east of Saguaro Lake.\n\n**Answer: NO**."

      \ is located west of Saguaro Lake, AZ, we need to compare the longitudes of\
      \ both locations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Lake Minnetonka,\
      \ MN**:  \n   - Lake Minnetonka is located in Minnesota, just west of Minneapolis.\n\
      \   - Approximate coordinates: 44.93\xB0 N latitude, 93.65\xB0 W longitude.\n\
