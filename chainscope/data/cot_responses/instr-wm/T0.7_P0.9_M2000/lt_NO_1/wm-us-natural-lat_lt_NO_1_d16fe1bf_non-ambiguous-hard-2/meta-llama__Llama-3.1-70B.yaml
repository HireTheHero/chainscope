      2. **Understand the geography**: Washington is in the Pacific Northwest region
      of the United States, while New Mexico is in the Southwest.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the further south you go, the lower
      the latitude. New Mexico has a lower latitude than Washington, meaning it is
      more to the south.

      4. **Conclusion based on state locations**: Since Washington is north of New
      Mexico, any point in Washington, including Lake Chelan, would be north of any
      point in New Mexico, including Williams Lake.


      Therefore, based on the geographical locations of Washington and New Mexico,
      Lake Chelan, WA is not south of Williams Lake, NM.


      The answer is: NO

      States, while Texas is in the South.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the further south you go, the lower
      the latitude. Texas has a lower latitude than Michigan, meaning it is more to
      the south.

      4. **Conclusion based on state locations**: Since Michigan is north of Texas,
      any point in Michigan, including Higgins Lake, would be north of any point in
      Texas, including Llano Uplift.


      Therefore, based on the geographical locations of Michigan and Texas, Higgins
