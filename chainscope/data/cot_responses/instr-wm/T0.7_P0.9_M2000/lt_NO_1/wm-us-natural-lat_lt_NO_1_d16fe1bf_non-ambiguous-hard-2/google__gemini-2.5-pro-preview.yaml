      1.  **Swiftcurrent Lake, MT:** This lake is located in Glacier National Park,
      Montana. Glacier National Park is in the northern part of Montana, very close
      to the Canadian border.


      2.  **Ritter Range, CA:** This mountain range is part of the Sierra Nevada in
      California. It''s located in the central part of the Sierra Nevada, east of
      Yosemite National Park and near Mammoth Lakes.


      3.  **Comparison:** Montana is a state located significantly north of California.
      Therefore, a location in northern Montana (Swiftcurrent Lake) will be north
      of a location in central California (Ritter Range).


      So, Swiftcurrent Lake, MT is *north* of Ritter Range, CA.

      \  *   To be more precise:\n        *   Lost Lake, Santiam Pass, Oregon is at\
      \ approximately 44.4\xB0 N latitude.\n        *   The Christmas Mountains in\
      \ Texas are at approximately 29.4\xB0 N latitude.\n\n5.  **Compare the Latitudes:**\n\
      \    *   44.4\xB0 N (Lost Lake, OR) is a higher latitude than 29.4\xB0 N (Christmas\
      \ Mountains, TX). Higher positive latitudes mean further north.\n\n6.  **Answer\
      \ the Question:**\n    *   The question asks: Is Lost Lake (Oregon) located\
      \ *south* of Christmas Mountains (Texas)?\n    *   Based on the latitudes, Lost\

      West Texas, very close to the Mexican border.

      3.  **Compare their relative north-south positions:** South Dakota is significantly
      north of Texas. Therefore, anything in South Dakota is north of anything in
      Texas.


      So, Lake Thompson, SD is located *north* of the Chisos Mountains, TX.
