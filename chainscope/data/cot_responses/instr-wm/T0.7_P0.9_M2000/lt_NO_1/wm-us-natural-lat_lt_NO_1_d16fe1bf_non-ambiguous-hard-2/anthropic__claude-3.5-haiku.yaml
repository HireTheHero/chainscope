      1. First, I''ll locate Pine Lake in Washington state

      2. Then, I''ll locate Lake Overholser in Oklahoma

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Pine Lake, Washington

      - Located in Washington state

      - Specific location would help, but the state is clear


      Step 2: Lake Overholser

      - Located in Oklahoma

      - Near Oklahoma City


      Step 3: Relative Positions

      - Washington is a northwestern state

      - Oklahoma is a south-central state

      - Washington is significantly north of Oklahoma


      Therefore, Pine Lake (Washington) is NORTH of Lake Overholser (Oklahoma), not
      south.

      1. First, I''ll locate Raft River Mountains, UT:

      - These mountains are located in northwestern Utah, near the Utah-Idaho border

      - They are in Box Elder County, Utah


      2. Next, I''ll locate Prien Lake, LA:

      - Prien Lake is located in southwestern Louisiana, near Lake Charles in Calcasieu
      Parish


      3. Compare their geographical locations:

      - Raft River Mountains are in northwestern Utah

      - Prien Lake is in southwestern Louisiana

      - These locations are in different states and quite far apart


      4. Determine relative north/south positioning:

      - Utah is generally north of Louisiana

      - So a location in Utah would typically be NORTH of a location in Louisiana


      5. Therefore, Raft River Mountains is NORTH of Prien Lake, not south.
