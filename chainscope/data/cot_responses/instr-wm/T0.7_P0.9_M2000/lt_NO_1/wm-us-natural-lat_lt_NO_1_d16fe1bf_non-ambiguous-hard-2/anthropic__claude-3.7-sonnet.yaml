      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Lake Osakis is located in Minnesota (MN), which is in the northern United
      States.

      - Lake DeFuniak is located in Florida (FL), which is in the southern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south geography of the United States.

      - Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada.

      - Florida is the southernmost state in the contiguous US.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Any lake in Minnesota would be located north of any lake in Florida due to
      the states'' positions.

      - Therefore, Lake Osakis in Minnesota must be north of Lake DeFuniak in Florida.


      Step 4: Determine if Lake Osakis is south of Lake DeFuniak.

      - Since Lake Osakis is north of Lake DeFuniak (not south), the answer is no.

      the relative positions of these two natural places.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is in Montana (MT), specifically in Glacier National Park
      in the northwestern part of the state.

      - Ritter Range is in California (CA), located in the Sierra Nevada mountains.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate latitudes.

      - Montana is generally north of California in the United States.

      - Glacier National Park (containing Swiftcurrent Lake) is near the Canadian
      border in the northernmost part of Montana.

      - The Ritter Range is in the central/eastern Sierra Nevada of California.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake in northern Montana is significantly farther north than
      any point in California.

      - The Ritter Range in California must therefore be south of Swiftcurrent Lake.


      Step 4: Verify the relationship.

      - Since Swiftcurrent Lake is in northern Montana and Ritter Range is in California,
      Swiftcurrent Lake cannot be south of Ritter Range.


      NO, Swiftcurrent Lake, MT is not located south of Ritter Range, CA. It is located
      north of it.'

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is located in Glacier National Park in Montana (MT).

      - Ritter Range is located in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California (CA).


      Step 2: Determine their relative north-south positions.

      - Montana is a northern state, bordering Canada.

      - California is further south, bordering Mexico.

      - Within these states, Glacier National Park is in northern Montana, very close
      to the Canadian border.

      - The Ritter Range is in the central Sierra Nevada mountains in California.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake in northern Montana would be at a much higher latitude (further
      north) than the Ritter Range in California.

      - Therefore, Swiftcurrent Lake is NOT south of Ritter Range. It is north of
      it.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations by state.

      - Wallowa Lake is in Oregon (OR), which is in the northwestern United States.

      - The Magdalena Mountains are in New Mexico (NM), which is in the southwestern
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the north-south relationship.

      - Oregon is significantly north of New Mexico on a map of the United States.

      - Since Wallowa Lake is in Oregon, and the Magdalena Mountains are in New Mexico,
      Wallowa Lake must be north of the Magdalena Mountains.


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      - If Wallowa Lake is north of the Magdalena Mountains, then it cannot be south
      of them.

      - Lost Lake is located at Santiam Pass in Linn County, Oregon, in the northwestern
      United States.

      - Christmas Mountains are located in Texas, in the southern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Oregon is in the northern part of the contiguous United States, bordering
      Washington state and Canada is further north.

      - Texas is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico to its south.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Oregon is significantly further north in the United States compared to Texas.

      - Lost Lake in Oregon would have a higher latitude (more northern position)
      than the Christmas Mountains in Texas.

      - Since "south of" means having a lower latitude, Lost Lake cannot be south
      of the Christmas Mountains.

      To solve this problem, I need to determine the relative positions of these two
      locations on a north-south axis.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. The Oregon Coast Range is a mountain range in Oregon, which is a state in
      the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.

      2. Oregon is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering Washington
      state to the north and California to the south.

      3. Trinity Bay is located in Texas, which is in the southern United States along
      the Gulf of Mexico.

      4. Texas is significantly further south than Oregon.

      5. Since Oregon is in the northern US and Texas is in the southern US, the Oregon
      Coast Range must be north of Trinity Bay.

      NO (the Oregon Coast Range is not south of Trinity Bay; it is north of it)'

      - Idaho is located significantly north of Arizona on a map of the United States.

      - Therefore, Lake Pend Oreille in Idaho would be north of Topock Gorge in Arizona.


      Step 3: Determine the answer to the specific question.

      - The question asks if Lake Pend Oreille is south of Topock Gorge.

      - Since Lake Pend Oreille is north of Topock Gorge (not south), the answer is
      NO.

      Step 2: Consider the general locations within their states.

      Since Oregon as a whole is north of Arizona as a whole, a lake in Oregon (Henry

      Step 3: Check if there are any unusual geographic circumstances.

      There are no unusual circumstances that would place a part of Oregon south of
      Arizona, as they are not adjacent states and are separated by California and

      - Spirit Lake (Washington) is located in Washington state, near Mount St. Helens
      in the southwestern part of the state.

      - Diamond Valley Lake is located in Southern California, in Riverside County.

      - Spirit Lake, being in Washington, must be north of any location in California.

      - Diamond Valley Lake, being in Southern California, is south of Washington

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the northern part of the
      United States.

      - The Sans Bois Mountains are in Oklahoma (OK), which is in the south-central
      part of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - Minnesota is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      - Oklahoma is located much further south, in the south-central United States.

      - Any location in Minnesota would be north of Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion about their relative positions.

      - Since Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota, and Minnesota is north of Oklahoma,
      Big Sandy Lake must be north of the Sans Bois Mountains.

      - Therefore, Big Sandy Lake is NOT south of the Sans Bois Mountains.
