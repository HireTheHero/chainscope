      \ (CA). Since Soap Lake is in a northern state (WA) and Ivanpah Lake is in a\
      \ southern state (CA), Soap Lake is located *north* of Ivanpah Lake. Therefore,\
      \ Soap Lake is *not* located south of Ivanpah Lake.\n\n11. **State the final\
      \ YES/NO answer:** Based on the reasoning, the answer is NO.\n\n*   Soap Lake\
      \ is in Washington (northern US).\n*   Ivanpah Lake is in California (southern\
      \ US).\n*   Washington is north of California.\n*   Therefore, Soap Lake is\
      \ north of Ivanpah Lake.\n*   The question asks if Soap Lake is *south* of Ivanpah\
      \ Lake.\n*   The answer is NO.\n\nStep 1: Identify the states where each lake\
      \ is located. Soap Lake is in Washington (WA). Ivanpah Lake is in California\
      \ (CA).\nStep 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of the states Washington\
      \ and California within the US. Washington is a northern state on the west coast.\
      \ California is a southern state on the west coast, located directly south of\
      \ Oregon, which is south of Washington.\nStep 3: Since Washington is geographically\
      \ north of California, any location within Washington will generally be north\
      \ of any location within California, barring extreme exceptions near state borders\
      \ (which is not the case here).\nStep 4: Therefore, Soap Lake, WA is located\
      \ north of Ivanpah Lake, CA.\nStep 5: The question asks if Soap Lake, WA is\
      \ located *south* of Ivanpah Lake, CA. Since it is located *north* of Ivanpah\
      \ Lake, the answer is the opposite of the question posed.\n\nNO"

      to compare the latitude of Angle Lake, Washington, and the latitude of the Hieroglyphic
      Mountains, Arizona.

      2.  **Determine the latitude of Angle Lake, WA:** Angle Lake is near Seattle.
      Seattle''s latitude is approximately 47.6 degrees North. Angle Lake is slightly
      south of central Seattle, so its latitude is also around 47.5-47.6 degrees North.

      3.  **Determine the latitude of the Hieroglyphic Mountains, AZ:** The Hieroglyphic
      Mountains are northwest of Phoenix. Phoenix''s latitude is approximately 33.4
      degrees North. The Hieroglyphic Mountains are just north of Phoenix, so their
      latitude is also around 33.6-33.8 degrees North.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** Angle Lake, WA is at approximately 47.5 degrees
      North latitude. The Hieroglyphic Mountains, AZ are at approximately 33.7 degrees
      North latitude.

      5.  **Interpret the comparison:** A higher North latitude means a location is
      further north. 47.5 is greater than 33.7. Therefore, Angle Lake, WA is significantly
      further north than the Hieroglyphic Mountains, AZ.

      6.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Angle Lake, WA is *south*
      of the Hieroglyphic Mountains, AZ. Since Angle Lake is *north* of the Hieroglyphic
      Mountains, the answer is no.

      3.  **Determine the general location of the Ortiz Mountains:** The Ortiz Mountains
      are a mountain range in New Mexico. New Mexico is located in the southwestern
      United States.

      4.  **Compare the latitude of the two locations:** Washington is a northern
      state, bordering Canada. New Mexico is a southern state, bordering Mexico. States
      further north have higher latitudes (closer to the North Pole), while states
      further south have lower latitudes (closer to the Equator).

      5.  **Relate latitude to "north" and "south":** A location is south of another
      if it has a lower latitude. A location is north of another if it has a higher
      latitude.

      6.  **Compare the relative latitudes:** Since Washington is north of New Mexico,
      the Strait of Georgia (in Washington) is located at a higher latitude than the
      Ortiz Mountains (in New Mexico).

      7.  **Formulate the conclusion based on the comparison:** Because the Strait
      of Georgia is at a higher latitude than the Ortiz Mountains, it is located *north*
      of the Ortiz Mountains.

      8.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if the Strait of Georgia
      is located *south* of the Ortiz Mountains. Our conclusion is that it is located
      *north*. Therefore, the answer is no.

      Step 2: Determine the location of Rainbow Lake, AZ.

      Rainbow Lake is located in Navajo County, Arizona. Arizona is in the southwestern
      United States.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of Oregon and Arizona.

      Oregon is located at higher latitudes than Arizona. A higher latitude means
      further north.


      Step 4: Conclude whether Henry Hagg Lake, OR is south of Rainbow Lake, AZ.

      Since Oregon is geographically north of Arizona, any location within Oregon
      will be north of any location within Arizona (ignoring very specific and unlikely
      edge cases near the border, which are not the case here). Therefore, Henry Hagg
      Lake, OR is north of Rainbow Lake, AZ.


      Step 5: Answer the question. The question asks if Henry Hagg Lake, OR is located
      *south* of Rainbow Lake, AZ. Based on the previous steps, it is located *north*.
