      To answer this question, we need to understand the geographic location of Boundary
      Bay, WA and the San Emigdio Mountains, CA, and then determine the direction
      in which travel between the two places would take place.

      Boundary Bay is located in Washington State, USA, and the San Emigdio Mountains
      are located in California, USA. The two places are separated by approximately
      1,200 miles of land and water.

      If we assume that travel between Boundary Bay and the San Emigdio Mountains

      are located to the west of Boundary Bay.

      If we assume that travel between the two places would be by water, then the

      \ of proximity?\n\nI don't know the exact coordinates of Wellsville Mountains,\
      \ UT, but I do know the coordinates of Lake Travis, TX.\n\nThe distance between\
      \ Lake Travis, TX and Wellsville Mountains, UT can be estimated by using the\
      \ distance formula:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nwhere d is the\
      \ distance, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n\
      If we assume that the coordinates of Lake Travis, TX are (30\xB046'42.50\"N,\
      \ 97\xB049'37.34\"W) and the coordinates of Wellsville Mountains, UT are (36\xB0\

      \ the two points.\n\nThe proximity between two points is a measure of how close\
      \ they are in terms of their relative position. It takes into account both distance\
      \ and direction.\n\nTo determine the proximity between Lake Travis, TX and Wellsville\
      \ Mountains, UT, we need to calculate the angle between them.\n\nThe angle between\
      \ two points can be calculated using the Haversine formula:\n\nA = acos(sin(lat1)\
