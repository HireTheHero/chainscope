      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Chelan is located in the state of Washington
      (WA), and Williams Lake is in the state of New Mexico (NM).


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Washington state is in
      the Pacific Northwest, which is in the northern part of the United States. New
      Mexico, on the other hand, is in the Southwest, which is generally more south
      than Washington.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Without needing the exact latitudes, we can infer
      from their positions within the United States that Washington state is north
      of New Mexico. This is because the U.S. is often divided into broad geographic
      regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, West Coast), with the West Coast (where
      Washington is located) being north of the Southwest (where New Mexico is located).


      4. **Conclusion based on general knowledge**: Given that Lake Chelan is in Washington
      and Williams Lake is in New Mexico, and knowing that Washington is generally
      north of New Mexico, we can conclude that Lake Chelan is located north of Williams
      Lake.


      Therefore, considering the question asks if Lake Chelan is **south** of Williams

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations mentioned.
      Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes is located in the state of Maine (ME), and Bristol
      Lake is in California (CA).


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine the general geographic
      positions of these states. Maine is located in the northeastern corner of the
      United States, while California is on the west coast.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Since Maine is in the northeast and California is
      on the west coast, Maine is generally east and possibly somewhat north of California,
      depending on the specific locations within the states.


      4. **Consider North-South Alignment**: To determine if Pemadumcook Chain of
      Lakes in Maine is south of Bristol Lake in California, we need to consider their
      latitudes. Given that Maine is significantly north of California in general
      terms, it''s unlikely that any part of Maine would be south of any part of California.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic positions, it is highly improbable
      that Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes in Maine is south of Bristol Lake in California,
      given the significant difference in their latitudes due to their locations within
      their respective states.

      States. Arizona, on the other hand, is in the southwestern part of the United
      States but is generally south of Washington state.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Without needing the exact latitudes, we know that
      Washington state is north of Arizona due to their positions in the country.


      Given these steps, since Washington state (where Angle Lake is located) is north
      of Arizona (where Hieroglyphic Mountains are located), Angle Lake (Washington),
      WA is not south of Hieroglyphic Mountains, AZ.


      The answer is: NO'
    3fa98afb-d803-4898-bda1-16db2c60de07: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two locations to consider - Angle Lake
      in Washington state and the Hieroglyphic Mountains in Arizona.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Angle Lake is located in the state of Washington,
      which is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. The Hieroglyphic
      Mountains are in Arizona, which is in the southwestern part of the United States.


      3. **Consider the general geography of the US**: Washington state is generally
      north of Arizona. The entire state of Washington is located at a higher latitude
      than Arizona, meaning everything in Washington is north of everything in Arizona
      when considering their geographical positions in the United States.


      4. **Apply this understanding to the specific locations**: Since Angle Lake
      is in Washington and the Hieroglyphic Mountains are in Arizona, and given that
      Washington is north of Arizona, Angle Lake must be north of the Hieroglyphic
      Mountains.


      5. **Conclude based on the question**: The question asks if Angle Lake is located
      south of the Hieroglyphic Mountains. Given our understanding that Angle Lake
      is north of the Hieroglyphic Mountains, the answer to the question is NO.


      The final answer is: NO'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Wallowa Lake is located in Oregon (OR), and the
      Magdalena Mountains are in New Mexico (NM).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Oregon is in the Pacific Northwest region of
      the United States, while New Mexico is in the Southwest.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, as you move south in the United States,
      the latitude decreases. Oregon is at a higher latitude than New Mexico because
      it is farther north.


      4. **Apply this to the question**: Since Oregon (where Wallowa Lake is located)
      is north of New Mexico (where the Magdalena Mountains are located), Wallowa
      Lake cannot be south of the Magdalena Mountains.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations and their relative positions

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two locations to consider - Woman Lake
      in Minnesota (MN) and Kern Lake in Kern County, California (CA).


      2. **Determine the general geographical positions of MN and CA**: Minnesota
      is located in the northern United States, often considered part of the Midwest.
      California is on the West Coast and is generally south of Minnesota.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within the states**: Woman Lake is in Minnesota,
      which we''ve established is more north. Kern Lake, being in California, is more
      south, especially since California is a large state that spans a significant
      portion of the western U.S. coastline and extends fairly far south.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Minnesota is north of California, and without
      needing the exact latitudes of Woman Lake and Kern Lake, we can deduce that
      Woman Lake in Minnesota is north of Kern Lake in California, simply based on
      the general geography of the United States.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Woman Lake, MN is located south of Kern Lake
      (Kern County), CA is: **NO**.'

      because it is located farther north.

      4. **Conclusion based on latitude**: Since New Hampshire is north of Texas,
      any location in New Hampshire, including Franconia Range, would be north of
      any location in Texas, including Sabine Lake.

      1. The Strait of Georgia is located in the state of Washington. Specifically,
      it is a body of water between the U.S. state of Washington and the Canadian
      province of British Columbia.


      2. The Ortiz Mountains are located in the state of New Mexico.

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two locations to consider - Kettle River
      Range, WA, and Buena Vista Lake, CA. The Kettle River Range is in Washington
      state, and Buena Vista Lake is in California.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Washington state is located in the Pacific
      Northwest region of the United States, while California is located to the south,
      along the West Coast. This means that generally, locations in Washington are
      north of locations in California.


      3. **Consider specific locations**: Without needing the exact coordinates, we
      can infer based on the states that Kettle River Range, being in Washington,
      is likely north of Buena Vista Lake in California, given the general north-south
      relationship between the two states.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the typical geography and the relationship between
      the states of Washington and California, Kettle River Range, WA, would be north
      of Buena Vista Lake, CA, rather than south.


      Therefore, based on this reasoning, the answer to whether Kettle River Range,
      WA, is located south of Buena Vista Lake, CA, is: **NO**.'

      \ - Echo Lake in Montana would be relatively north, given Montana's northern\
      \ position in the U.S.\n   - Diaz Lake in California, considering California's\
      \ long north-south geography, could be anywhere from the northern to the southern\
      \ part of the state.\n\n4. **Compare latitudes**:\n   - Without exact coordinates,\
      \ we can still make an educated guess. Montana, being one of the northern states,\
      \ likely has most of its geography north of the majority of California's geography.\n\
      \   - However, California spans a significant north-south distance. For Echo\

      \ say yes or no. However, considering that Montana is generally north of most\
      \ of California, for Echo Lake (MT) to be south of Diaz Lake (CA), Diaz Lake\
      \ would have to be in a relatively northern part of California, and Echo Lake\
      \ would have to be in a relatively southern part of Montana. \n\nGiven the broad\
      \ geographical context and without precise locations or latitudes, it seems\
      \ unlikely but not impossible that Echo Lake (MT) is south of Diaz Lake (CA),\
      \ depending on their exact locations within their respective states.\n\nHowever,\
      \ to provide a definitive YES or NO based on the likely geographical positions:\n\
      - Montana is generally north of California, suggesting that most of Montana,\
      \ including Echo Lake, would be north of most of California, including Diaz\
