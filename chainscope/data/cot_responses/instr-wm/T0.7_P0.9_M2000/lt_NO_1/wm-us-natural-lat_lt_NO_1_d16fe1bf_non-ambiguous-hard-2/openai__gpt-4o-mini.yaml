      in Montana (MT) are located south of the Black Mountains in North Carolina (NC),
      let''s break it down:


      1. **Locate the Bears Paw Mountains**: The Bears Paw Mountains are in north-central
      Montana, specifically near the Bear Paw Battlefield, which is part of the Nez
      Perce National Historical Park.


      2. **Locate the Black Mountains**: The Black Mountains are a mountain range
      in western North Carolina, part of the Appalachian Mountains, located to the
      east of Asheville, NC.


      3. **Compare their latitudes**: The Bears Paw Mountains are situated at a latitude
      that is significantly further north compared to the Black Mountains. Montana,
      where the Bears Paw Mountains are located, is known for being in the northern
      part of the United States, while North Carolina is further south.


      4. **Assess their relative positions**: Since the Bears Paw Mountains are located
      in Montana, which is north of North Carolina, it follows that they cannot be
      south of the Black Mountains in North Carolina.

      in the northeastern United States.


      2. **Locate Water Ranch Lake, AZ**: Water Ranch Lake is located in Gilbert,

      3. **Determine the relative positions**: To find out if the Mahoosuc Range is
      south of Water Ranch Lake, we compare their latitudes. Maine is significantly
      farther north than Arizona, meaning that Mahoosuc Range, being in Maine, is
      positioned to the north of Arizona.

      1. **Location of Anaconda Range**: The Anaconda Range is a mountain range located

      1. **Locate Ten Mile Lake**: Ten Mile Lake is situated in Cass County, Minnesota.
      Minnesota is located in the northern part of the United States.


      2. **Locate Harris Lake**: Harris Lake is located in New Hill, North Carolina.
      North Carolina is situated in the southeastern part of the United States.


      3. **Compare their latitudes**: Minnesota (where Ten Mile Lake is) is generally
      at a higher latitude than North Carolina (where Harris Lake is). This indicates
      that Minnesota is further north.


      4. **Determine relative positions**: Since Ten Mile Lake is in a northern state
      (Minnesota) and Harris Lake is in a southern state (North Carolina), it follows
      that Ten Mile Lake cannot be south of Harris Lake.

      1. **Quaboag Pond, MA**: This pond is located in the state of Massachusetts

      we can infer their relative positions.


      4. **Relative Locations**: Since Massachusetts is north of Texas, Quaboag Pond
      must be north of Inks Lake.


      Based on this reasoning, Quaboag Pond, MA cannot be located south of Inks Lake,
      TX.

      located in North Carolina and Tennessee, not Idaho. There is no prominent "Smoky

      1. **Locate Big Sandy Lake, MN**: Big Sandy Lake is situated in northeastern
      Minnesota, near the town of McGregor.


      2. **Locate Sans Bois Mountains, OK**: The Sans Bois Mountains are located in

      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Minnesota is north of Oklahoma. Specifically,
      northeastern Minnesota (where Big Sandy Lake is) is significantly farther north
      than eastern Oklahoma (where the Sans Bois Mountains are located).


      Given that Big Sandy Lake is in Minnesota (north) and the Sans Bois Mountains
