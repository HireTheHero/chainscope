      2. **Ortiz Mountains, NM**: The Ortiz Mountains are located in north-central
      New Mexico, near Santa Fe. This places them at a latitude of approximately 35

      Since 48 to 49 degrees north is higher (further north) than 35 to 36 degrees
      north, the Strait of Georgia is indeed located north of the Ortiz Mountains.

      1. **Location of Packwood Lake, WA**: Packwood Lake is located in Washington
      State, which is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is
      generally situated at a higher latitude, meaning it is further north.


      2. **Location of Lake Maumelle, AR**: Lake Maumelle is located in Arkansas,
      which is in the southern region of the United States, specifically in the central
      part of the state.


      3. **Comparing Latitudes**: Washington State, where Packwood Lake is located,
      is generally much further north than Arkansas, where Lake Maumelle is located.
