      - Montana is in the northern part of the United States

      - Alabama is in the southern part of the United States


      3) Compare their locations:

      - Montana shares a border with Canada, making it one of the northernmost states

      - Alabama is near the Gulf of Mexico, making it one of the southernmost states

      - Any point in Montana would be north of any point in Alabama

      - Sapphire Mountains are in Montana (MT)

      - White Oak Lake State Park is in Arkansas (AR)


      2) Now, let''s consider their positions on a map:

      - Montana is in the northern part of the United States

      - Arkansas is in the southern part of the United States


      3) Montana shares a border with Canada, while Arkansas is several states south

      1) Owasco Lake is one of the Finger Lakes located in New York state

      2) The Finger Lakes region is in central/western New York

      3) Lake Washington is located in Brevard County, Florida

      4) Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental US

      5) New York is one of the northernmost states in the continental US

      6) Therefore, any lake in New York must be north of any lake in Florida


      NO - Owasco Lake is NOT located south of Lake Washington, FL. It is located
      north of it.'

      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Owasco Lake is in New York state

      - Lake Washington is in Florida


      2) Since one lake is in NY and one is in FL, I can compare their general locations
      based on states:

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States


      3) When comparing north-south positions:

      - New York state is located much further north than Florida

      - Therefore, any lake in NY would be north of any lake in FL


      4) Since Owasco Lake is in NY and Lake Washington is in FL:

      - Owasco Lake must be north of Lake Washington

      - It cannot be south of it
