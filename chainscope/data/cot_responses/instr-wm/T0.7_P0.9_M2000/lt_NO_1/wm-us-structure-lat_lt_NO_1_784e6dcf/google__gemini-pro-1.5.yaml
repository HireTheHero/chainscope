    4102920c-05ba-440f-bcf2-80ee82949bfc: '1. **Identify the states:** Riverside Theater
      is in Wisconsin (WI), and Riviera Theatre is in New York (NY).


      2. **General US Geography:** Wisconsin is west of New York.  Latitude lines
      run east-west.  Therefore, simply being west doesn''t tell us about north/south
      positioning.


      3. **More specific geography:**  While Wisconsin is generally west of New York,
      a small portion of Wisconsin extends slightly *east* of a small portion of *western*
      New York.  So being in Wisconsin doesn''t automatically mean being west of something
      in New York. We need more specific locations.


      4. **Consider Milwaukee vs. North Tonawanda:** Milwaukee is a major city on
      the western shore of Lake Michigan. North Tonawanda is near Buffalo, NY, at
      the eastern end of Lake Erie.  Lake Erie is almost directly south of Lake Michigan.


      5. **Conclusion:** Milwaukee (and therefore Riverside Theater) is significantly
      north of North Tonawanda (and therefore Riviera Theatre).

      northern midwestern state, considerably east of Oregon.  Anything in Oregon
      will be significantly south of Michigan.
