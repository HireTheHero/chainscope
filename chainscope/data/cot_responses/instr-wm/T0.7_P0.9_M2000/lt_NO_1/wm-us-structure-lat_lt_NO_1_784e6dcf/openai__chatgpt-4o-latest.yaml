      is) is geographically *west* and *slightly north* of Trinity Dam.

      5. Since we are specifically asked about whether Carson Mansion is *south* of
      Trinity Dam, we must determine if Eureka is located south of Trinity Dam.


      After confirming their locations, Carson Mansion (Eureka) is actually *north*
