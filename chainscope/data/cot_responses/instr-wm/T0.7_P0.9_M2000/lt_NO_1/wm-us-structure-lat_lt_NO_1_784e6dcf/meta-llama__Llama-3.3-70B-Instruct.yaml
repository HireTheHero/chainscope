      the steps required to determine if the Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon is
      located south of the Mission Theater and Pub in Oregon.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Charles E. Nelson House and the Mission Theater and Pub in Oregon. The Charles
      E. Nelson House is a historic house, and its location can be found through historical
      or architectural records. The Mission Theater and Pub is also in Oregon, and
      its exact location can be determined through online directories or maps.


      2. **Determine Geographic Coordinates or Addresses**: To compare the locations,
      we need to find the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) or the exact
      addresses of both structures. This information can typically be found online
      through mapping services like Google Maps or through local historical and tourism
      websites.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the coordinates or addresses, we can
      compare them to determine their relative positions. If the latitude of the Charles
      E. Nelson House is less than that of the Mission Theater and Pub, it would generally
      indicate that the house is located south of the theater, considering that latitude
      increases as you move north.


      Given the specific nature of the question and without direct access to a search
      engine or database to find the exact locations of the Charles E. Nelson House
      and the Mission Theater and Pub in Oregon, I will provide a general approach
      to how one would answer this question:


      - If the Charles E. Nelson House is in a location with a lower latitude than
      the Mission Theater and Pub, the answer would be YES.

      - If the Charles E. Nelson House is in a location with a higher latitude than
      the Mission Theater and Pub, the answer would be NO.


      Without the specific coordinates or addresses, I must rely on the general approach.

      \nGiven the information available up to my last update in 2023, the Charles\

      \nGiven that both locations are within the same general area (Northwest District\

    f725e00c-2d74-4365-83a3-958164fda5fc: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed to determine if the Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon is located
      south of the Mission Theater and Pub in Oregon.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Charles E. Nelson House and the Mission Theater and Pub in Oregon. The Charles
      E. Nelson House is a historic house, and its location should be verifiable through
      historical or architectural registers. The Mission Theater and Pub is presumably
      in Portland, Oregon, given that Portland is known for its historic theaters
      and pubs, and the name suggests a connection to the city''s Alberta Arts District
      or another historic area.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Once the specific locations are identified,
      the next step is to understand their geographical orientation relative to each
      other. This involves determining the latitude or the general north-south orientation
      of each location.


      3. **Compare Locations**: With the specific locations identified and their geographical
      orientations understood, the final step is to compare these to determine if
      the Charles E. Nelson House is indeed south of the Mission Theater and Pub.


      Given the lack of specific details on the locations in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - The Charles E. Nelson House is in Portland, Oregon.

      - The Mission Theater and Pub is also in Portland, Oregon.


      Without exact addresses or more detailed information, we can''t directly compare
      their locations. However, assuming the question implies both are in Portland
      and considering typical urban layouts, we would need to know their exact neighborhoods
      or street addresses to definitively say one is south of the other.


      Since the question asks for a straightforward YES or NO answer without providing
      specific addresses or locations beyond the state, and without further information,
      we must rely on general knowledge or assumptions.


      Based on the assumption that both locations are in Portland and without precise
      locations, a definitive answer cannot be provided with absolute certainty. However,
      for the purpose of this exercise and acknowledging the lack of specific details,
      I will provide an answer based on the most likely scenario given typical inquiries
      about Portland''s geography:


      The final answer is: YES'

      \ to focus on a direct north-south comparison.\n\nHowever, the question specifically\
      \ asks if the Basilica of St. John is **south** of the Cathedral of the Holy\
      \ Angels. Given their nearly identical latitudes (41.6\xB0N), the Basilica of\
      \ St. John in Des Moines, Iowa, is not south of the Cathedral of the Holy Angels\

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the exact locations of
      both Calvary Church of Santa Ana, CA, and Wayfarers Chapel, CA. Calvary Church
      is in Santa Ana, which is in Orange County, California. Wayfarers Chapel is
      located in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, which is in Los Angeles County.


      2. **Determine the geographical relationship**: Next, we need to understand

      not provided, we''ll rely on general knowledge. Santa Ana is a city located
      in the southern part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area but in Orange County.
      Rancho Palos Verdes is a city in Los Angeles County, situated on the Palos Verdes
      Peninsula, which is also in the southern part of Los Angeles County but generally
      north of Orange County.


      Given the general north-south relationship between Los Angeles County and Orange
      County, and without exact coordinates but knowing the cities'' locations within

      relationship between Texas and Arizona. Arizona is located west of Texas in
      the United States.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Then, we consider the north-south

      Texas when comparing their overall positions within the United States.

      \ in a way that would place the entire state of Texas south of Arizona, the\

      \ specific latitudes.\n\n5. **Final Consideration**: The precise answer depends\
      \ on the exact latitudes of Panther Creek Wind Farm and Sahuarita Lake. If Panther\

      \ part of the United States.\n\n3. **Comparing Locations**: \n   - Nebraska\

      \ The exact location within Massachusetts isn't specified, but we know Massachusetts\
      \ is a state in the northeastern United States.\n\n2. **Understand geographic\

      \ United States.\n   - Massachusetts is in the Northeastern United States.\n\
      \n3. **Compare the general locations**:\n   - Generally, Michigan (where Detroit\

      \ to the west than directly south or north in terms of overall U.S. geography.\n\
      \n4. **Specific comparison**:\n   - Detroit, Michigan, is at a latitude of approximately\

      \ the general nature of this question and without specific addresses or coordinates,\
      \ a definitive answer requires knowing the exact locations of both the Cathedral\
      \ of Saint Mary and the Raleigh Hotel. However, considering typical layouts\
      \ and the fact that \"south\" refers to a direction rather than a significant\
      \ geographical separation in this context, we can make an educated guess:\n\n\
      - If the Cathedral of Saint Mary is in a part of Miami that is south of the\
      \ latitude of the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach, then yes. But without exact\
      \ locations, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the information typically available\

    82546461-6198-42eb-a79d-60715d7dc490: 'To determine if the Cathedral of Saint
      Mary in Miami, FL is located south of the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach, FL,
      we need to follow a few steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The Cathedral of Saint Mary is in Miami, and
      the Raleigh Hotel is in Miami Beach. Both are in Florida but in different municipalities.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Miami and Miami Beach are adjacent to each
      other, with Miami Beach being an island connected by bridges. Miami is on the
      mainland, and Miami Beach is to the east, separated by Biscayne Bay.


      3. **Determine the direction**: Generally, Miami Beach is east of Miami, not
      necessarily north or south in a direct line, due to the geography of the area.
      However, considering the layout and the fact that Miami Beach is a barrier island,
      we can consider the relative positions based on their names and common understanding.
      Miami Beach is often considered to be "across" from Miami, rather than directly
      north or south.


      4. **Specific locations**: The Cathedral of Saint Mary in Miami and the Raleigh
      Hotel in Miami Beach need to be considered in their exact locations. Without
      specific addresses, we rely on general knowledge. The Cathedral of Saint Mary
      is presumably in a central or downtown area of Miami, given the nature of such
      landmarks. The Raleigh Hotel is in South Beach, Miami Beach, which is at the
      southern end of Miami Beach.


      5. **Conclusion**: Considering Miami Beach (where the Raleigh Hotel is located)
      is generally at a similar latitude to Miami (where the Cathedral of Saint Mary
      is located) or slightly south due to its elongated shape, and the Raleigh Hotel
      being in South Beach, which is at the southern tip of Miami Beach, we must consider
      the relative positions based on the cities'' layouts. However, the critical
      factor here is the geography and the relative positioning within their respective
      areas. Since the Raleigh Hotel is in South Beach, it''s reasonable to infer
      that the Cathedral of Saint Mary, being in Miami, could be north or at a similar
      latitude, but not necessarily south of the Raleigh Hotel, given the general
      layout of the area.


      Based on the steps of reasoning and considering the general geography of the
      area, the answer would be **NO**, as the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Miami is
      likely not south of the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach, given the typical layout
      and understanding of the area. However, without exact addresses or a map, this
      conclusion is based on general knowledge of the region''s geography.'
    92b63075-225f-4f93-ada8-a416ceae7fb4: 'To answer this question, we need to establish
      the locations of both the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Miami, FL, and the Raleigh
      Hotel in Miami Beach, FL, and then compare their positions relative to each
      other.


      1. **Identify the Location of Cathedral of Saint Mary (Miami), FL**: The Cathedral
      of Saint Mary is located in Miami, Florida. Miami is a city located on the mainland.


      2. **Identify the Location of Raleigh Hotel (Miami Beach), FL**: The Raleigh
      Hotel is situated in Miami Beach, Florida. Miami Beach is a barrier island east
      of Miami, connected to the mainland by bridges.


      3. **Compare the Locations**: Since Miami Beach, where the Raleigh Hotel is
      located, is east of Miami (where the Cathedral of Saint Mary is located), and
      given that both are relatively close but on opposite sides of Biscayne Bay,
      we must consider their latitudinal positions to determine if one is south of
      the other.


      4. **Determine the Latitudinal Relationship**: Both Miami and Miami Beach are
      at similar latitudes because they are adjacent to each other, with Miami Beach
      being slightly east rather than significantly north or south of Miami. However,
      the question of whether one location is south of the other depends on their
      exact positions relative to each other.


      Given the close proximity and similar latitude, without exact coordinates, one
      might initially think it''s a close call. However, knowing that Miami Beach
      extends from approximately the same latitude as Miami to slightly north (due
      to its elongated shape), and considering that the Raleigh Hotel is on Miami
      Beach, which does not extend significantly south of Miami''s latitude, we can
      infer that the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Miami would likely be at a similar
      latitude or slightly south of some parts of Miami Beach, depending on the exact
      locations within these areas.


      Given the above steps, and acknowledging the complexity of determining exact
      positions without specific coordinates or a detailed map, we must recognize
      that Miami Beach (where the Raleigh Hotel is located) does not extend significantly
      south of the mainland Miami area (where the Cathedral of Saint Mary is located).
      Therefore, considering typical geography and the relative positions of these
      locations, the answer leans towards the fact that the Cathedral of Saint Mary
      in Miami is likely not significantly south of the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach,
      given their close proximity and the geography of the area.


      However, since the question asks for a definitive YES or NO answer regarding
      whether the Cathedral of Saint Mary is south of the Raleigh Hotel, and considering
      the potential for slight variations in latitude within these areas, the most
      direct way to answer without specific GPS coordinates would be to consider the
      general geographic relationship between Miami and Miami Beach.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'

      3. **Determine the relative positions:** Both locations are within the downtown
      area of Nashville, but to answer whether TPAC is south of the Downtown Presbyterian
      Church, we need more specific directional information. However, given that both
      are in the downtown area, they are relatively close to each other.


      4. **Use geographical knowledge of Nashville:** Downtown Nashville is not extremely
      large, and both of these locations are within walking distance of each other.
      The Downtown Presbyterian Church is on 5th Avenue North, and TPAC is near the
      Tennessee State Capitol, which is somewhat central to downtown.


      5. **Specific directional analysis:** Without exact coordinates, we can still
      reason generally. If the Downtown Presbyterian Church is on 5th Avenue North,
      and considering the layout of downtown Nashville, TPAC''s location near the
      state capitol building would generally place it in a central position. Downtown
      Nashville''s grid system means that "north" and "south" can be determined by
      the avenue numbers, with lower numbers being more south and higher numbers more
      north.


      6. **Conclusion based on available information:** Given the central location
      of both within downtown Nashville and without precise directional information
      or coordinates, it''s reasonable to infer based on typical grid patterns that
      TPAC could be considered south of the Downtown Presbyterian Church if we consider
      the general layout of Nashville''s downtown area and the fact that "downtown"
      encompasses a relatively small geographic area. However, the precise answer
      would depend on the exact addresses and the specific grid layout of downtown
      Nashville.


      Based on the step-by-step analysis and considering the need for a definitive
      YES or NO answer without exact coordinates or a detailed map:


      YES.'

      Arts Center (TPAC) is located south of Downtown Presbyterian Church in Nashville,
      TN, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Tennessee Performing Arts Center (TPAC) and the Downtown Presbyterian Church
      in Nashville, TN.


      2. **Tennessee Performing Arts Center (TPAC)**: TPAC is located in downtown
      Nashville. Its address is 505 Deaderick Street, Nashville, TN 37243.


      3. **Downtown Presbyterian Church**: The Downtown Presbyterian Church is also
      located in downtown Nashville. Its address is 154 5th Ave N, Nashville, TN 37219.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To understand if TPAC is south of the Downtown Presbyterian
      Church, we need to compare their relative positions in downtown Nashville.


      5. **Geographical Orientation**: Generally, in Nashville, the numbered avenues
      (like 5th Ave N) run north-south, with numbers increasing as you go north. Deaderick
      Street, where TPAC is located, runs east-west and is situated south of the area
      where 5th Ave N is located.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the addresses and the general layout of downtown
      Nashville, TPAC (on Deaderick Street) is south of the area where the Downtown
      Presbyterian Church (on 5th Ave N) is located.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether the Tennessee Performing Arts Center,
      TN is located south of Downtown Presbyterian Church (Nashville), TN is: **YES**.'

      in Dallas, Texas. Kalita Humphreys Theater is also located in Dallas, Texas.


      2. **Understand the Question**: The question asks if White Rock Lake is located
      south of Kalita Humphreys Theater. To answer this, we need to know the relative
      positions of these two locations within Dallas.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Kalita Humphreys Theater is situated in the Turtle
      Creek area of Dallas, which is closer to the downtown area. White Rock Lake,
      on the other hand, is located east of downtown Dallas but is generally considered

      near the Oak Lawn area, which is southwest of White Rock Lake.

      5. **Determine if White Rock Lake is south of Kalita Humphreys Theater**: Based
      on their relative positions within Dallas, White Rock Lake is northeast of the

      1. **Identify the locations**: White Rock Lake is a lake located in Dallas,
      Texas. The Kalita Humphreys Theater is also located in Dallas, Texas.


      2. **Specific locations within Dallas**: White Rock Lake is situated in the
      east part of Dallas. The Kalita Humphreys Theater is located at 3636 Turtle
      Creek Blvd, Dallas, TX 75219, which places it in the Turtle Creek area of Dallas.


      3. **Relative positions**: Knowing that White Rock Lake is in the east part
      of Dallas and considering the city''s layout, the Turtle Creek area (where the
      Kalita Humphreys Theater is located) is more towards the central part of Dallas
      but leans towards the north-central part when considering the entire city map.


      4. **North-South orientation**: Given the layout of Dallas, with White Rock
      Lake to the east and the Kalita Humphreys Theater more centrally located but
      to the north of many parts of the city, including some areas south of White
      Rock Lake, we must consider their exact positions relative to each other.


      5. **Final determination**: Since White Rock Lake is to the east and the Kalita
      Humphreys Theater is more central-north, the key factor is their relative east-west
      and north-south positions. White Rock Lake spans a significant area, but its
      southern parts are indeed south of some areas of Dallas, including potentially
      the area where the Kalita Humphreys Theater is located.


      Given these considerations, without exact GPS coordinates or a detailed map
      to reference at this moment, the general understanding would be that White Rock
      Lake, being a large body of water in eastern Dallas, has parts that could be

      the lake one is referencing. However, the question seems to ask for a more general
      comparison.


      Therefore, based on general knowledge and without precise location data, the
      answer would lean towards the possibility that parts of White Rock Lake could
      indeed be south of the Kalita Humphreys Theater, given the lake''s size and

    94ea3ca6-e4f4-42b7-a3ef-d0d9d34cc2bc: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed to determine the location of White Rock Lake in relation to
      the Kalita Humphreys Theater, both in Texas.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where both White Rock
      Lake and Kalita Humphreys Theater are located. White Rock Lake is a lake located
      in Dallas, Texas. The Kalita Humphreys Theater is also located in Dallas, Texas.


      2. **Specific Addresses**: To understand their relative positions, it''s helpful
      to know their specific addresses or areas within Dallas. White Rock Lake is
      generally in the eastern part of Dallas. The Kalita Humphreys Theater is located
      at 3636 Turtle Creek Blvd, Dallas, TX 75219, which places it in the Turtle Creek
      area of Dallas.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Knowing that both are in Dallas, we need to understand
      their relative positions. The Turtle Creek area, where the Kalita Humphreys
      Theater is located, is in the Uptown area of Dallas, which is more towards the
      central part of the city but leaning towards the north. White Rock Lake, being
      in the eastern part of Dallas, can be both north and south of the theater depending
      on the specific point of reference on the lake, but generally, it stretches
      more to the east and slightly south of the city''s central areas.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that the Kalita Humphreys Theater is in a more central-north
      location (Uptown Dallas) and White Rock Lake is more to the east and can extend
      slightly south of the central areas, parts of White Rock Lake could indeed be
      south of the Kalita Humphreys Theater, depending on the exact points of comparison.


      Based on these steps and understanding that geographical locations can have
      varying interpretations based on the exact points of reference, the most straightforward
      answer considering the general locations provided would be:


      YES'

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of White
      Rock Lake and Kalita Humphreys Theater. White Rock Lake is a lake located in
      Dallas, Texas. Kalita Humphreys Theater is also located in Dallas, Texas.


      2. **Relative Positions**: Next, we determine their relative positions within
      Dallas. White Rock Lake is situated in the northeast part of Dallas. Kalita
      Humphreys Theater, on the other hand, is located in the Turtle Creek area of
      Dallas, which is more central but slightly to the south and west of White Rock
      Lake.


      3. **Directional Analysis**: Given their locations, we can analyze their directional
      relationship. If White Rock Lake is northeast of the city center and Kalita
      Humphreys Theater is more centrally located but to the south and west of the
      lake, then White Rock Lake is not south of Kalita Humphreys Theater. Instead,
      it is generally north and east.

      \ NY is located south of Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City), NY, we need\

      \ Brick Presbyterian Church is located at 62 East 92nd Street, New York, NY\
      \ 10128.\n\n2. **Identify the Location of 257 Central Park West**: Next, we\
      \ find the location of 257 Central Park West. This address is on the west side\
      \ of Central Park, which runs north-south through Manhattan.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ Locations**: \n    - Central Park West is a street that borders the west side\
      \ of Central Park.\n    - The church is located on the Upper East Side at East\
      \ 92nd Street.\n    - Central Park West addresses are generally west of the\
      \ park, while the church is east of the park.\n\n4. **Determine North-South\
      \ Relationship**:\n    - To be south of the church, 257 Central Park West would\
      \ need to be at a lower latitude (or further south) than the church's location\
      \ at 92nd Street.\n    - Central Park itself spans from 59th Street to 110th\
      \ Street. Given that 257 Central Park West would be somewhere around the 70s\
      \ to 80s streets (as the park's west side addresses correspond roughly to the\
      \ cross-streets), this puts it potentially north of the church's east side location,\
      \ depending on the exact cross-street.\n\nHowever, without the precise cross-street\
      \ for 257 Central Park West (since Central Park West addresses don't directly\
      \ correlate to a specific cross-street without additional context), we must\
      \ consider the general area:\n- If 257 Central Park West is around the 70s or\
      \ 80s streets, it could indeed be north of the church's location at 92nd Street.\n\
      - But to answer if it's south, we consider if any part of Central Park West\
      \ could be south of 92nd Street, given the park's layout and the fact that the\
      \ church is at 92nd Street.\n\nGiven that Central Park's southern boundary is\
      \ at 59th Street and the church is at 92nd Street, any location within the park\
      \ or immediately adjacent to it on Central Park West that is below 92nd Street\
      \ could be considered south of the church in a broader sense. However, the specific\
      \ question of whether 257 Central Park West is south of the church hinges on\
      \ its exact location relative to 92nd Street.\n\n**Conclusion**: Without the\
      \ exact latitude or cross-street for 257 Central Park West, we might initially\
      \ think it's necessary to know more. However, considering the general layout\
      \ and that Central Park West addresses span the length of the park, if 257 Central\
      \ Park West is at a lower street number than 92nd (which is likely, given the\
      \ park's layout and the fact that lower street numbers are further south in\
      \ Manhattan), it would indeed be south of the church.\n\n**YES**"

      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two main locations to consider - the
      Dal-Tex Building in Texas (TX) and Lake Martin in Alabama (AL).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Texas is located in the southwestern part of
      the United States, while Alabama is in the southeastern part.


      3. **Consider Lake Martin''s location**: Lake Martin is a lake located in Alabama.
      Given Alabama''s position relative to Texas, we know that Alabama is east of
      Texas.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Texas is west of Alabama, and
      considering the general layout of the United States, anything in Texas would
      be west of anything in Alabama.


      5. **North-South orientation**: The question asks if the Dal-Tex Building is
      south of Lake Martin. Texas and Alabama span across different latitudes, but
      generally, parts of Texas can be both north and south of parts of Alabama due
      to their geographical spread. However, the key here is the specific location
      of the Dal-Tex Building in relation to Lake Martin.


      6. **Dal-Tex Building''s location**: The Dal-Tex Building is located in Dallas,
      Texas. Dallas, Texas, is at a latitude that is roughly similar to or slightly
      north of many parts of Alabama, including Lake Martin.


      7. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical positions, the Dal-Tex Building in
      Dallas, Texas, is not south of Lake Martin, Alabama, in the traditional sense
      of being directly south. However, considering just the north-south axis without
      accounting for east-west differences, parts of Texas can indeed be south of
      parts of Alabama. But specifically, Dallas, Texas, is west and slightly north
      of Lake Martin, Alabama.

      the steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Camanche
      Reservoir, CA, and Guist Creek Lake, KY. Camanche Reservoir is located in California,
      which is on the West Coast of the United States. Guist Creek Lake is located
      in Kentucky, which is in the eastern part of the United States.


      2. **Understand Geographic Terms**: Understanding that "south" refers to a direction,
      we need to determine if California is south of Kentucky. Generally, California
      is considered to be southwest of Kentucky, given the layout of the United States.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Given the vast distance between California and Kentucky
      and knowing their general positions in the U.S., we can deduce their relative
      north-south positions. California is generally south and west of Kentucky.


      4. **Consider Specific Locations Within States**: While the general trend is
      that California is southwest of Kentucky, specific locations within each state
      (like Camanche Reservoir in California and Guist Creek Lake in Kentucky) need
      to be considered. However, given the significant difference in latitude between
      the two states, it''s likely that most points in California are south of most
      points in Kentucky.

      it''s reasonable to conclude that Camanche Reservoir, CA, is indeed located
      south of Guist Creek Lake, KY, without needing the exact latitudes of these
      specific locations.

      (Washington, D.C.), DC is located south of St. Augustine Catholic Church (Washington,
      D.C.), DC, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations of
      both All Souls Church, Unitarian, and St. Augustine Catholic Church in Washington,
      D.C. This usually involves finding their addresses or geographic coordinates.


      2. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations, we compare them to determine
      their relative positions. This can be done by looking at a map or using a geographic
      information system (GIS) tool.


      3. **Determine Direction**: After comparing the locations, we determine if one
      is south of the other. This involves understanding the layout of Washington,
      D.C., and the orientation of streets and landmarks.


      Given the lack of specific addresses or coordinates in the question, let''s
      proceed with a general approach based on known locations:


      - **All Souls Church, Unitarian** is located at 1500 Harvard Street NW, Washington,
      DC 20009.

      - **St. Augustine Catholic Church** is located at 1419 V Street NW, Washington,
      DC 20009.


      Both churches are in the Northwest (NW) quadrant of Washington, D.C. To determine
      if one is south of the other, we need to understand that in Washington, D.C.,
      streets generally run north-south and east-west, with avenues radiating from
      the center.


      Given their addresses:

      - **Harvard Street NW** (All Souls) is north of **V Street NW** (St. Augustine)
      because ''V'' comes before ''Harvard'' alphabetically, indicating it is closer
      to the start of the alphabetically ordered street names, which generally run
      east-west in D.C.


      Therefore, since All Souls Church is on a street that is alphabetically after
      and thus likely physically north of where St. Augustine Catholic Church is,

      \ a series of steps to determine the relative locations of All Souls Church,\
      \ Unitarian, and St. Augustine Catholic Church in Washington, D.C.\n\n1. **Identify\
      \ the Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations of both churches.\
      \ This involves finding their addresses or geographic coordinates.\n\n2. **Compare\
      \ Locations**: Once we have the locations, we compare them to determine their\
      \ relative positions in terms of cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).\n\
      \n3. **Determine Latitude**: A key factor in determining if one location is\
      \ south of another is comparing their latitudes. The location with the lower\
      \ latitude is south of the location with the higher latitude.\n\nWithout specific\
      \ addresses or coordinates provided in the question, I will proceed with a general\
      \ approach to how one would find this information:\n\n- **All Souls Church,\
      \ Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)**: Let's assume its location is found to be around\
      \ 16th Street and Harvard Street NW, which is in the Columbia Heights neighborhood.\n\
      \n- **St. Augustine Catholic Church (Washington, D.C.)**: Let's assume its location\
      \ is found to be around 15th Street and Massachusetts Avenue NW, which places\
      \ it in a area not far from the other church but slightly to the northwest due\
      \ to the grid layout of Washington, D.C.\n\nGiven these assumptions, and considering\
      \ the general layout of Washington, D.C.'s grid system:\n\n- If All Souls Church,\
      \ Unitarian, is in the Columbia Heights area, it might be at a slightly higher\
      \ latitude than St. Augustine Catholic Church if the latter is more towards\
      \ the downtown or central area.\n\nHowever, without exact coordinates or a detailed\
      \ map, the precise determination relies on the specific addresses or the geographic\
      \ coordinates of these churches.\n\n**Final Step: Conclusion Based on Hypothetical\
      \ Locations**\n\nIf All Souls Church, Unitarian, is indeed located in an area\
      \ that could be considered south or more southerly in latitude compared to St.\
      \ Augustine Catholic Church based on their addresses or geographic locations,\
      \ the answer would reflect that. However, given the general nature of the information\
      \ provided and without precise locations, it's challenging to definitively conclude\
      \ their relative positions solely based on the question's text.\n\nGiven this,\
      \ I must rely on typical geographic knowledge and the fact that without exact\
      \ coordinates, I'm making an educated guess based on common locations for these\
      \ types of landmarks in Washington, D.C.\n\n**YES or NO Answer**: \nBased on\
      \ the hypothetical locations and without exact addresses or coordinates to definitively\
      \ determine their relative positions, I would make an educated guess. However,\
      \ since I don't have the precise information to confidently determine their\
      \ locations relative to each other and considering the need for accuracy in\
      \ such determinations, the most appropriate approach would be to look up the\
      \ exact addresses or coordinates for a definitive answer.\n\nGiven the information\
      \ typically available and the layout of Washington, D.C., if one were to guess\
      \ based on common knowledge of the city's layout and assuming typical locations\
      \ for such institutions, one might lean towards a particular answer. However,\
      \ the correct approach is to verify the locations.\n\nTherefore, without specific\

      \ these states can vary significantly.\n\n5. **Specific Locations**: Lake Steilacoom,\

      \ if Lake Ellsworth is at the higher end of Oklahoma's latitude range.\n- However,\

      \ \n   - Lake Ellsworth, OK: A lake in Oklahoma.\n\n2. **Determine the geographical\
      \ positions**:\n   - California (CA) is generally located in the western United\
      \ States.\n   - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the central United States, more\
      \ towards the south but significantly east of California.\n\n3. **Compare the\
      \ latitudes**:\n   - To determine if Solar Star, CA is south of Lake Ellsworth,\
      \ OK, we need to compare their latitudes. \n   - California's latitude ranges\
      \ approximately from 32\xB0N to 42\xB0N.\n   - Oklahoma's latitude ranges approximately\
      \ from 33.5\xB0N to 37\xB0N.\n\n4. **Consider the specific locations**:\n  \
      \ - Solar Star, being in California, could potentially be at a latitude similar\

      \ within California.\n   - Lake Ellsworth, Oklahoma, is at a latitude of around\
      \ 35.3\xB0N.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without the exact latitude of Solar\
      \ Star, CA, we can still make an educated guess. Given that parts of California\
      \ (especially the southern parts) can be at latitudes lower than or comparable\
      \ to Oklahoma, it's possible for Solar Star to be south of Lake Ellsworth, especially\
      \ if it's located in the southern part of California.\n\nHowever, to give a\

      \ south of Lake Ellsworth, OK.\n- Given that California spans a significant\
      \ range of latitudes, and Oklahoma is more centrally located but towards the\
      \ south, the key factor is the specific latitude of Solar Star compared to Lake\
      \ Ellsworth.\n\nGiven these steps and without exact coordinates for Solar Star,\
      \ we must rely on general knowledge. However, it's known that the Solar Star\
      \ project is located in the Antelope Valley, which is in northern Los Angeles\
      \ County, California. This area is not as far south as the very southern tip\
      \ of California but is still in the southern part of the state. The Antelope\

    d044983c-3d87-4abd-8647-6e9886d05427: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Fitzgerald Theater and the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre
      in Minnesota (MN).


      2. **Fitzgerald Theater Location**: The Fitzgerald Theater is located in St.
      Paul, Minnesota. Specifically, its address is 10 East Exchange Street, St. Paul,
      MN 55101.


      3. **In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre Location**: This theatre
      is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Its address is 1500 East Lake Street,
      Minneapolis, MN 55407.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if the Fitzgerald Theater is south of
      the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre, we need to consider the
      general geography of the Twin Cities area. St. Paul is generally east of Minneapolis,
      and while there can be some variation in latitude, St. Paul is not consistently
      south of Minneapolis.


      5. **Latitude Comparison**: For a precise answer, comparing the latitudes of
      the two locations would be ideal. However, without specific latitude numbers
      provided here, we can make a general assumption based on the cities. Minneapolis
      and St. Paul are adjacent, with parts of Minneapolis being south of parts of
      St. Paul and vice versa due to their proximity and irregular boundaries.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the addresses, the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul is
      not definitively south of the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre
      in Minneapolis based solely on the city names, as both cities are adjacent and
      have complex boundaries. However, considering typical geography and assuming
      the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre''s location in Minneapolis
      is more northwestern compared to the Fitzgerald Theater''s location in St. Paul,
      it''s plausible that the Fitzgerald Theater could be southeast or east of the
      In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre, but not necessarily south
      in a strict directional sense.


      Given this analysis and without precise latitude and longitude comparisons,
      the answer would generally lean towards "NO" because the question implies a
      direct southward direction which might not accurately represent the geographical
      relationship between these two points in the Twin Cities area.


      ANSWER: NO'
    dddd0323-3b19-4550-beb0-ecf2d4dd017d: 'To answer this question, I''ll break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Fitzgerald Theater and the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre
      in Minnesota.


      2. **Fitzgerald Theater Location**: The Fitzgerald Theater is located in St.
      Paul, Minnesota. It''s a prominent venue for performing arts.


      3. **In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre Location**: This theatre
      is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It''s known for its unique puppetry and
      mask performances.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Now, we need to compare the locations of St. Paul
      and Minneapolis in terms of their geographical positions relative to each other.
      St. Paul is the capital of Minnesota and is located east of Minneapolis, but
      when considering the general layout, Minneapolis is generally northwest of St.
      Paul.


      5. **Determine Direction**: Given that Minneapolis is northwest of St. Paul,
      any location in Minneapolis would generally be north and west of locations in
      St. Paul.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographical relationship between Minneapolis
      and St. Paul, Minnesota, the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre
      in Minneapolis is north of the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul.


      Therefore, considering the question asks if the Fitzgerald Theater is located
      south of the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre, the answer would
      be **YES** because St. Paul (where the Fitzgerald Theater is located) is generally
      south of Minneapolis (where the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre
      is located).'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Nichols
      Hall, KS, and Mountaineer Wind Energy Center, WV. Nichols Hall is located in
      Kansas, and Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is in West Virginia.


      2. **Understand Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to understand the geographic
      relationship between Kansas and West Virginia. Kansas is located in the central
      United States, while West Virginia is in the eastern United States.


      3. **Determine Latitude**: To determine if Nichols Hall, KS, is south of Mountaineer
      Wind Energy Center, WV, we need to compare their latitudes. Generally, Kansas
      is south of West Virginia, considering their positions on the US map.


      4. **Consider Specific Locations**: Without exact addresses or coordinates,
      we rely on the general knowledge that Kansas is southwest of West Virginia.
      This suggests that most of Kansas, including Nichols Hall, would be south or
      southwest of locations in West Virginia, such as the Mountaineer Wind Energy
      Center.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand the locations of both
      Holy Name Church in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, and Triumph Church in Michigan.
      Massachusetts (MA) is a state on the East Coast of the United States, while
      Michigan (MI) is in the Great Lakes region, more towards the center of the northern
      U.S.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Generally, Massachusetts is southeast
      of Michigan. This is because Massachusetts is located in the Northeastern United
      States, while Michigan, although also in the northern part of the country, is
      more centrally located but still west and slightly north of Massachusetts.


      3. **Consider "South" Criterion**: The question asks if Holy Name Church (in
      Massachusetts) is located south of Triumph Church (in Michigan). Given the general
      geography, Michigan (where Triumph Church is located) is north and west of Massachusetts
      (where Holy Name Church is located).


      Based on these steps, since Massachusetts is generally southeast of Michigan,
      structures in Massachusetts would typically be south (and east) of structures
      in Michigan.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Holy Name Church (West Roxbury, Massachusetts)
      is located south of Triumph Church, MI, is: **YES**.'

      at 141 West 54th Street, New York, NY 10019. Times Square Church is located
      at 237 West 51st Street, New York, NY 10019.


      2. **Understand Directions**: Knowing that streets in Manhattan are laid out

      we can understand directions based on this grid. "South" means moving towards
      lower street numbers.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Given the addresses, the Ziegfeld Theatre is on West

      1. **Identify the Location of the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927), NY**: The Ziegfeld
      Theatre, historically known, was located in Manhattan, New York City. Specifically,
      it was situated on Sixth Avenue.


      2. **Identify the Location of Times Square Church, NY**: Times Square Church

      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Arrowhead Reservoir is located in California
      (CA), and DeGray Lake is located in Arkansas (AR).


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: California is on the West
      Coast, while Arkansas is in the southern part of the central United States.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, as you move south in the United States,
      the latitude decreases. We need to determine if Lake Arrowhead Reservoir (CA)
      is south of DeGray Lake (AR) by comparing their general locations rather than
      exact latitudes.


      4. **Consider California and Arkansas'' positions**: California is a western
      state, and Arkansas is more to the east but also significantly to the south
      of California when considering the U.S. as a whole. However, the key is comparing
      their north-south positioning.


      5. **Determine the relative north-south positions**: Arkansas is generally south
      of California. Lake Arrowhead Reservoir in California is at a higher latitude
      than DeGray Lake in Arkansas, given the states'' overall positions.


      6. **Conclusion based on relative positions**: Since California (where Lake

      on the Guadalupe River in Texas Hill Country, and Addicks Reservoir is a reservoir
      located near Houston, Texas.

      relative to each other. Canyon Lake is situated in the Texas Hill Country, which
      is generally west of Houston. Addicks Reservoir is located near Houston, which
      places it more to the east and southeast of Canyon Lake.

      we need to compare their latitudes. Houston (and thus Addicks Reservoir) is
      generally at a lower latitude than the Texas Hill Country where Canyon Lake

      without considering longitude, as two points can have the same latitude but
      be far apart horizontally.


      4. **Consider Longitudes and Overall Positioning**: Since Canyon Lake is west

      Canyon Lake is not directly south but rather southwest or west of Addicks Reservoir.
      The question asks specifically if Canyon Lake is south of Addicks Reservoir,
      which simplifies our comparison to a direct north-south relationship.

      exact locations or relative positions (north, south, etc.), we cannot make an
      accurate determination based solely on the information given.

      4. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Given that Cadle Tabernacle is on
      the west side and assuming the west side of Indianapolis extends both north
      and south of the downtown area, we cannot definitively conclude its position
      relative to BMO Plaza without more specific geographic information. However,
      considering typical layouts and assuming the question implies a comparison within
      the city, if Cadle Tabernacle is indeed on the part of the west side that is
      south of downtown, then it would be south of BMO Plaza.


      Given the steps and the need for a clear yes or no answer without specific geographic
      coordinates or further details, and assuming the implication that Cadle Tabernacle''s
      location on the west side might place it south of the downtown area where BMO
      Plaza is located:


      The final answer is: YES'
    ff06dbff-8c13-40f2-9ff6-776a27539eb4: 'To answer this question, I need to determine
      the locations of Cadle Tabernacle and BMO Plaza in Indiana and compare their
      positions relative to each other, specifically in terms of north-south orientation.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, I need to identify where Cadle Tabernacle
      and BMO Plaza are located in Indiana. Cadle Tabernacle is in Indianapolis, Indiana.
      BMO Plaza is also located in Indianapolis, Indiana.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Since both locations are in the same city,
      Indianapolis, the next step is to determine their relative positions within
      the city. Without specific addresses, this might seem challenging, but knowing
      that both are in Indianapolis helps to narrow down the comparison to a local
      level rather than a statewide level.


      3. **Use Geographical References**: In a typical urban setting, buildings and
      landmarks are often referenced by their intersections or proximity to well-known
      landmarks. Without specific geographical coordinates or addresses, I must rely
      on general knowledge that might not specify exact locations but can give an
      idea of their relative positions.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Given the information available and
      the fact that both structures are in Indianapolis, without precise locations
      (e.g., exact addresses or cross streets), it''s challenging to definitively
      say one is south of the other. However, considering typical queries of this
      nature are designed to test specific knowledge or reasoning based on available
      data, let''s proceed with the assumption that the question implies a comparison
      that can be made with general knowledge or research.


      Given the steps above and acknowledging that without specific addresses or a
      detailed map, the precise locations might not be clear, I must rely on the assumption
      that the question can be answered based on known information about these locations.
      However, as it turns out, Cadle Tabernacle and BMO Plaza are both in Indianapolis,
      but without exact locations, the direct comparison is challenging. For the sake
      of providing an answer based on the process of reasoning outlined:


      The final answer is: YES'

      church at West 41st Street.


      5. **Determine Direction**: Since 41st Street is south of 45th Street, the church

      \ general area of the city they are in.\n\n5. **Pittsburgh Layout**: Pittsburgh\
      \ has a complex layout due to its hilly terrain and the confluence of its three\
      \ rivers. However, without specific addresses or neighborhoods for these theaters,\
      \ we must rely on general knowledge or available data.\n\n6. **Research**: Upon\

    5a6bf95a-e0e4-48c8-9390-45e0ae6da5aa: 'To determine if Eighth & Main, ID is located
      south of Arrowrock Dam, ID, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Eighth & Main, ID, and Arrowrock Dam, ID. Eighth & Main refers to a specific
      address or intersection, likely in a city or town. Arrowrock Dam is a dam located
      on the Boise River.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Understanding that Arrowrock Dam is on the Boise
      River helps. The dam is known to be in a more remote area, used for water storage
      and recreation.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To say one location is south of another, it must
      be farther south in terms of latitude. Without specific coordinates, we rely
      on geographical knowledge of Idaho.


      4. **Research or Knowledge**: Since specific details about Eighth & Main, ID,
      are not provided (like the city it''s in), we''ll assume it could be in a major
      city like Boise, given the mention of Idaho and the proximity to Arrowrock Dam,
      which is near Boise.


      5. **Arrowrock Dam Location**: Arrowrock Dam is southeast of Boise, Idaho. If
      Eighth & Main is in or around Boise, considering Boise''s position relative
      to the dam is crucial.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Arrowrock Dam is southeast of Boise, and assuming
      Eighth & Main, ID, could be in Boise or a nearby area, the question becomes
      whether Boise (or the specific location of Eighth & Main) is south of Arrowrock
      Dam.


      Without the exact location of Eighth & Main, ID, but considering it might be
      in Boise or a similar latitude, and knowing Arrowrock Dam is southeast of Boise,
      the answer leans towards "NO" because Boise is generally north of the dam, not
      south.


      However, the precise answer depends on the exact location of Eighth & Main,
      ID, which isn''t specified. Assuming a typical scenario where Eighth & Main
      could be in a city like Boise, the answer based on reasoning would be:

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Eighth
      & Main, ID, and Arrowrock Dam, ID. Eighth & Main refers to a specific address
      or intersection in Boise, Idaho, which is the state capital. Arrowrock Dam is
      located on the Boise River, southeast of Boise.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      positions of these locations. Boise, where Eighth & Main is located, is situated
      in the southwestern part of Idaho. Arrowrock Dam, being southeast of Boise,
      also lies in the southwestern part of the state but in a more easterly and southerly
      direction compared to downtown Boise.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Comparing the positions, since Arrowrock Dam is southeast
      of Boise, and Eighth & Main is in Boise, it implies that Eighth & Main is north
      (and slightly west) of Arrowrock Dam.


      Based on the steps above, considering the relative positions:


      - **Eighth & Main, ID** is in Boise.

      - **Arrowrock Dam, ID** is southeast of Boise, which means it is generally south
      (and slightly east) of Boise.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles, California, and the Mark Taper
      Forum in California.


      2. **Immanuel Presbyterian Church Location**: Immanuel Presbyterian Church is
      located in Los Angeles, California. To proceed, we need its exact address or
      at least its general area. Let''s assume it''s in the central or Koreatown area
      of Los Angeles, as that''s where it''s generally known to be.


      3. **Mark Taper Forum Location**: The Mark Taper Forum is located in downtown
      Los Angeles, as part of the Los Angeles Music Center. This is on Grand Avenue,
      placing it in the heart of downtown LA.


      4. **Comparative Locations**: Knowing both are in Los Angeles, we compare their
      locations relative to each other. Downtown LA, where the Mark Taper Forum is,
      is generally south of the Koreatown area, where Immanuel Presbyterian Church
      is located.


      5. **Determine Direction**: Since Koreatown is north of downtown LA, any location
      in Koreatown (like Immanuel Presbyterian Church) would be north of a location
      in downtown LA (like the Mark Taper Forum).


      Based on this reasoning, Immanuel Presbyterian Church, being in Koreatown, is
      not south of the Mark Taper Forum in downtown LA. Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'

    e81c03e5-c48c-4bce-aa59-912425125676: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Saylorville Lake, IA, and the Main Building at the University
      of Notre Dame, IN, and then compare their positions relative to each other,
      specifically in terms of north-south orientation.


      1. **Identify the Location of Saylorville Lake, IA**: Saylorville Lake is located
      in Iowa, near the city of Des Moines. Specifically, it''s situated in the north-central
      part of the state.


      2. **Identify the Location of the Main Building (University of Notre Dame),
      IN**: The University of Notre Dame is located in Notre Dame, Indiana, which
      is in the north part of the state, near the city of South Bend.


      3. **Compare the Locations**: Iowa is located west of Indiana. Des Moines, Iowa
      (near Saylorville Lake), is generally at a similar latitude or slightly south
      of South Bend, Indiana (where the University of Notre Dame is located). However,
      the key factor here is the north-south orientation rather than east-west.


      4. **Determine North-South Orientation**: To say one location is south of another,
      it must be located at a lower latitude. Given the geography of the United States,
      both locations are in the northern part of the country, but we need to consider
      their specific latitudes.


      5. **Conclusion**: Considering the latitudes, Des Moines, Iowa (and by extension,
      Saylorville Lake), and South Bend, Indiana (where the University of Notre Dame
      is located), are at roughly similar latitudes, with Des Moines being slightly
      south. Therefore, Saylorville Lake, IA, is indeed south of the Main Building
      at the University of Notre Dame, IN.

      eastern side compared to Seattle.


      4. **Determining Direction**: Given that Banks Lake is more to the east and
      somewhat centrally located in Washington State, and Seattle (with Town Hall
      Seattle) is to the west, we can conclude that Banks Lake is generally east of
      Seattle, not south. The state''s geography and the layout of its major cities
      and landmarks indicate that moving from Seattle towards the central or eastern
      parts of the state involves moving eastward rather than southward.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether Banks Lake, WA, is located south
      of Town Hall Seattle, WA, is **NO**.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of both the
      Cathedral Basilica of St. James and Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral,
      specifically in relation to each other within Brooklyn, NY.


      2. **Cathedral Basilica of St. James location**: The Cathedral Basilica of St.
      James is located in the Downtown Brooklyn area. Its exact address is 2500 Jay
      St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, but for the purpose of this comparison, we note it is
      generally in the north part of Brooklyn, closer to the Brooklyn Bridge and the
      East River.


      3. **Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral location**: Our Lady of Lebanon
      Maronite Cathedral is located at 113 Remsen St, Brooklyn, NY 11201. This is
      also in the Downtown Brooklyn area, not far from the Cathedral Basilica of St.
      James.

      Anne Hotel is located, is in the northwestern part of the city but is positioned
      in such a way that it is west and slightly north of the Financial District.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given these positions, Belden Place (in the Financial District)
      would be east and possibly slightly south or at a similar latitude compared
      to the Queen Anne Hotel (in Pacific Heights), considering the general layout
      of San Francisco''s neighborhoods. However, the question asks if Belden Place
      is located south of the Queen Anne Hotel.


      Based on the relative positions within San Francisco, Belden Place is not significantly
      south of the Queen Anne Hotel; rather, it''s more eastward. Therefore, considering
      the general geography of San Francisco and the relative positions of these two
      locations, the answer to whether Belden Place is located south of Queen Anne
      Hotel would be **NO**.'

    cd666079-0a00-4815-a29e-4e35681d69d7: 'To answer this question, I need to follow
      a series of steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, I need to identify the locations of Belden
      Place and the Queen Anne Hotel in California. Belden Place is known to be in
      San Francisco, and the Queen Anne Hotel is also located in San Francisco.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Since both locations are in San Francisco,
      the next step is to determine their relative positions within the city. The
      Queen Anne Hotel is located at 1590 Sutter Street, which places it in the Pacific
      Heights neighborhood. Belden Place, on the other hand, is located in the Financial
      District.


      3. **Map Analysis**: To understand if Belden Place is south of the Queen Anne
      Hotel, I need to consider the layout of San Francisco. Generally, the city''s
      neighborhoods are arranged in a way that the Financial District is more to the
      southeast, while Pacific Heights (where the Queen Anne Hotel is located) is
      to the northwest of the Financial District.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the neighborhoods and general directions within San
      Francisco, Belden Place (in the Financial District) would typically be southeast
      of the Queen Anne Hotel (in Pacific Heights). Considering the cardinal directions,
      southeast is generally south (and slightly east) of northwest. Therefore, Belden
      Place is indeed south (and slightly east, but predominantly south in this context)
      of the Queen Anne Hotel.


      The final answer is: YES'
    e645561b-df2a-4f40-b4ff-c1c487f0c0e5: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Belden Place and Queen Anne Hotel in California.


      1. **Identify Belden Place, CA**: Belden Place is a small alley in San Francisco,
      California. It''s known for its European-style outdoor cafes and is located
      in the heart of the city''s financial district.


      2. **Identify Queen Anne Hotel, CA**: The Queen Anne Hotel is also located in
      San Francisco, California. It''s a historic hotel that has been in operation
      since the late 19th century.


      3. **Determine the relative locations**: Since both locations are in San Francisco,
      we need to understand their positions relative to each other. San Francisco
      is a city with a grid-like pattern of streets, which makes it somewhat easier
      to navigate and understand directions.


      4. **Belden Place Location**: Belden Place is situated near the intersection
      of Pine and Bush Streets in the financial district, which is towards the northeast
      part of San Francisco.


      5. **Queen Anne Hotel Location**: The Queen Anne Hotel is located on Sutter
      Street, near the intersection with Octavia Street, which places it more in the
      central part of San Francisco but slightly west and possibly south of Belden
      Place, depending on the exact block.


      6. **Comparison**: Given their locations, Belden Place is more towards the financial
      district (northeast part of San Francisco), while the Queen Anne Hotel is in
      a more central but slightly western area. Without exact coordinates, we can
      infer that Belden Place is likely not south of the Queen Anne Hotel but rather
      more to the east or northeast.


      7. **Conclusion**: Based on the general locations within San Francisco, it seems
      that Belden Place would not be south of the Queen Anne Hotel. The financial
      district, where Belden Place is located, is generally northeast of the area
      where the Queen Anne Hotel is situated.


      Given this step-by-step analysis, the answer to whether Belden Place, CA is
      located south of Queen Anne Hotel, CA is: **NO**.'

      2. **Understand NYC Grid System**: New York City''s street grid system is relatively
      straightforward. Avenues run north-south, and streets run east-west. The numbering
      of streets and avenues increases as you move north and east, respectively. Fifth
      Avenue is a major avenue that runs north-south through Manhattan.


      3. **Location of 834 Fifth Avenue**: The address 834 Fifth Avenue places it
      on Fifth Avenue, and the number "834" indicates it is located relatively far

      and the park itself spans from 59th to 110th Street. Given that 834 is above
      59th, it is likely in the Upper East Side, north of Central Park.


      4. **Location of 2 Columbus Circle**: Columbus Circle is located at the southwest
      corner of Central Park, at 59th Street and Eighth Avenue. Therefore, 2 Columbus
      Circle is essentially at the southern edge of Central Park.


      5. **Comparison**: Given the locations, 834 Fifth Avenue is significantly north

      \   - Generally, the western United States is south and west of the eastern\
      \ United States. However, to determine if one location is specifically south\
      \ of another, we need to consider their latitudes.\n   - Nevada's latitude ranges\

      \ from 38\xB0N to 40\xB0N.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Since Nevada's latitude\

      \ question becomes whether St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, specifically,\
      \ is south of Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church.\n\n5. **Specific Locations**:\n\
      \   - Without exact coordinates, we rely on general knowledge. However, given\
      \ that Nevada spans a significant north-south distance, and Maryland is relatively\

      \ give a definitive answer, we'd typically need more specific information about\
      \ the churches' locations.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Considering the general\
      \ geography and without exact locations, it's reasonable to deduce based on\
      \ the states' positions. However, the precise answer depends on the specific\
      \ latitudes of the two churches. Given the general knowledge that parts of Nevada\
      \ can indeed be south of parts of Maryland, and assuming St. Mary's in the Mountains\
      \ Catholic Church is in a southerly part of Nevada, it could be south of Brown\
      \ Memorial Presbyterian Church in Maryland.\n\nGiven these steps and the assumption\
      \ that St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church is in a part of Nevada that\

      of the region. Washington and Idaho are neighboring states in the Pacific Northwest
      region of the United States.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Riffe Lake is in southwestern Washington, and Dworshak
      Dam is in north-central Idaho.


      4. **Compare Positions**: To determine if Riffe Lake is south of Dworshak Dam,
      we need to compare their positions. Generally, Idaho is east of Washington,
      and the northern parts of Idaho are at a similar latitude to the southern parts
      of Washington.


      5. **Dworshak Dam''s Location**: Dworshak Dam is on the North Fork of the Clearwater
      River in Idaho, which places it relatively north within Idaho.


      6. **Riffe Lake''s Location**: Riffe Lake is in the Cascade Range of Washington,
      specifically on the Cowlitz River, which is in the southwestern part of the
      state.


      7. **Latitude Comparison**: Considering the latitudes, southwestern Washington
      (where Riffe Lake is) is generally at a lower latitude (further south) than
      north-central Idaho (where Dworshak Dam is).


      Based on this step-by-step analysis, considering the general geography and the
      specific locations of Riffe Lake, WA, and Dworshak Dam, ID, it appears that
      Riffe Lake is indeed located south of Dworshak Dam.

      the steps needed to determine the relative locations of Jim Chapman Lake and
      Wright Patman Lake in Texas.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify where both lakes are
      located. Jim Chapman Lake, previously known as Cooper Lake, is located in northeastern
      Texas. Wright Patman Lake is also situated in northeastern Texas.


      2. **Compare Locations**: Since both lakes are in the same general region (northeastern
      Texas), we need more specific information about their exact locations or relative
      positions to each other.


      3. **Geographical Details**: Wright Patman Lake is near Texarkana, Texas, which
      is close to the Texas-Arkansas border. Jim Chapman Lake (Cooper Lake) is located
      in Delta and Cooper counties, which puts it somewhat southeast of the Dallas-Fort
      Worth metro area but still within northeastern Texas.


      4. **South/North Determination**: Given that Wright Patman Lake is near Texarkana,
      which is in the northeastern corner of Texas, and Jim Chapman Lake is located
      more towards the central part of northeastern Texas but still south of Wright
      Patman Lake''s location relative to the state''s geography.


      Based on these steps and considering the geography of northeastern Texas, Jim
      Chapman Lake is located south of Wright Patman Lake.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Lake
      Accotink, VA, and Hardy Lake, IN. Lake Accotink is located in Virginia, and
      Hardy Lake is located in Indiana.


      2. **Understand Geography**: Next, we need a basic understanding of US geography,
      particularly the relative positions of Virginia and Indiana. Virginia is located
      in the southeastern part of the United States, while Indiana is in the Midwestern
      part of the country.


      3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Generally, Virginia is south of Indiana.
      This is because Virginia is situated below the Midwestern states, including
      Indiana, on the US map.


      4. **Apply to Specific Locations**: Since Lake Accotink is in Virginia and Hardy
      Lake is in Indiana, and given that Virginia is south of Indiana, it follows
      that Lake Accotink, VA, would be south of Hardy Lake, IN, considering their
      states'' general geographic positions.

      is south of Lake Galena in Pennsylvania, we need to understand the general geography
      of the northeastern United States. New Jersey and Pennsylvania share a border,
      with New Jersey to the east and southeast of Pennsylvania.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Princeton, New Jersey (where McCarter Theatre is
      located) is generally southeast of the area where Lake Galena, Pennsylvania,
      is located. Considering the geography and the relative positions of these locations,
      we can proceed to the final step.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Princeton, NJ, is southeast of the area around
      Lake Galena, PA, and considering the general layout of the region, McCarter
      Theatre in New Jersey would indeed be south (and slightly east) of Lake Galena
      in Pennsylvania.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      the steps to determine if the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C.
      is located south of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to know the exact locations of
      both the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and the United States Capitol. The United
      States Capitol is located at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington,
      D.C.


      2. **Determine the Location of Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium**: The Andrew W.
      Mellon Auditorium is situated in Washington, D.C. After researching, we find
      that it is located at 1301 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Knowing that the United States Capitol is at the eastern
      end of the National Mall and considering the address of the Andrew W. Mellon
      Auditorium (1301 Constitution Avenue NW), we must determine the relative positions.
      The National Mall runs east-west, and Constitution Avenue is north of the Mall.


      4. **North-South Orientation**: Given the address "NW" (Northwest) for the Andrew
      W. Mellon Auditorium, it suggests the auditorium is northwest of the city''s
      center, which includes the Capitol. However, we need to consider its position
      relative to the Capitol specifically in terms of north-south orientation.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Geography**: The United States Capitol is essentially
      at the center of Washington, D.C.''s layout. Given that the Andrew W. Mellon
      Auditorium is on Constitution Avenue NW, this places it north of the National
      Mall and, by extension, north (or at least not south) of the United States Capitol.


      Based on the steps above, considering the general layout of Washington, D.C.,

      Wheaton Bible Church is located in Wheaton, Illinois. Moody Church is located

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Lake
      Gaston, NC, and Boone Lake, TN. Lake Gaston is a lake located on the North Carolina-Virginia
      border, while Boone Lake is located in Tennessee.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine the general geographic
      positions of these locations. North Carolina is south of Virginia, and both
      are east of Tennessee. Tennessee is generally southwest of North Carolina and
      south of Virginia.


      3. **Compare Specific Locations**: Now, comparing Lake Gaston, NC (which is
      on the NC-VA border), and Boone Lake, TN, we need to consider their relative
      positions. Lake Gaston is situated in the northeastern part of North Carolina,
      close to the Virginia border. Boone Lake, on the other hand, is located in northeastern
      Tennessee.


      4. **North-South Alignment**: Considering the north-south alignment, North Carolina
      is generally east and slightly north of Tennessee. Given that Lake Gaston is
      in northeastern North Carolina, it would be more north than Boone Lake, which
      is in northeastern Tennessee but still south of the North Carolina-Virginia
      border area where Lake Gaston is located.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on these geographic relationships, Lake Gaston, NC,
      is not south of Boone Lake, TN. Instead, it is generally north or northeast
      of Boone Lake, TN.


      The final answer is: NO'

      To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Lake
      Gaston, NC, and Boone Lake, TN. Lake Gaston is a lake along the North Carolina-Virginia
      border, and Boone Lake is in Tennessee.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we determine the geographic
      relationship between North Carolina and Tennessee. North Carolina is located
      east and slightly south of Tennessee.


      3. **Specific Locations of Lakes**: Lake Gaston is situated in the northern
      part of North Carolina, near the Virginia border. Boone Lake is in northeastern
      Tennessee.


      4. **Compare Latitudes**: To determine if Lake Gaston is south of Boone Lake,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Generally, the farther north a location
      is, the higher its latitude. If Lake Gaston''s latitude is lower than Boone
      Lake''s, then it is south of Boone Lake.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without exact latitude and longitude coordinates provided,
      we rely on general geographic knowledge. However, knowing that Boone Lake is
      in northeastern Tennessee and Lake Gaston is in northern North Carolina, and
      considering the states'' positions relative to each other, we can infer their
      relative positions. North Carolina is generally south and east of Tennessee,
      which suggests that Lake Gaston would be south of Boone Lake, given their respective
      locations within their states.

      2. **James R. Thompson Center Location**: The James R. Thompson Center is located
      in Chicago, Illinois. Specifically, it is situated in the Loop district of downtown
      Chicago.


      3. **Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist Location**: Without specific details
      provided in the question, we must assume or find the location of the Seventeenth
      Church of Christ, Scientist, in Illinois. Given the context, it''s reasonable
      to assume this church is also in Chicago, as the denomination has multiple branches,
      and Chicago has a significant number of these churches.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Assuming both are in Chicago, to determine if the
      Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist is south of the James R. Thompson Center,
      we would need the exact address or location of the church. However, since the
      question does not provide specific addresses, we''ll proceed with general knowledge.
      The James R. Thompson Center is in the heart of downtown Chicago, which is relatively
      north in the city''s layout.


      5. **Chicago''s Layout**: Chicago is laid out in a grid pattern with the downtown
      area (the Loop) near the lakefront. Areas to the south of downtown are considered
      part of the South Side of Chicago.


      6. **Decision**: Without the exact address of the Seventeenth Church of Christ,
      Scientist, we cannot definitively say its location relative to the James R.
      Thompson Center. However, considering typical inquiries and the fact that many
      locations in Chicago can be either north, south, east, or west of downtown (where
      the Thompson Center is), if the church is indeed in Chicago and not in a northern
      suburb or district, there''s a possibility it could be south of the Thompson
      Center, depending on its exact location.


      However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and considering the need
      for specific location details to accurately answer, the most informed approach
      based on typical Chicago geography would be to consider if it''s plausible for
      the church to be south of the Thompson Center, given that both could be in Chicago,
      and much of Chicago''s residential and commercial areas lie south of the downtown
      area.


      Given the constraints of the question and assuming both locations are within
      the city of Chicago, the answer to whether the Seventeenth Church of Christ,
      Scientist, IL is located south of the James R. Thompson Center, IL, could be
      YES, considering the vast area of Chicago that lies south of the downtown area
      where the Thompson Center is located. However, without exact addresses, this
      is an educated guess.


      The final answer is: YES'

      \ the locations of both the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist, in Illinois\
      \ (IL) and the James R. Thompson Center in Illinois and then compare their positions\
      \ in terms of north-south orientation.\n\n1. **Identify the Locations**:\n \
      \  - **Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist, IL**: Without specific details,\
      \ it's challenging to pinpoint the exact location of this church, as there could\
      \ be multiple churches with this name in different parts of Illinois. However,\
      \ for the sake of this exercise, let's assume it's in a known location that\
      \ we can compare with the James R. Thompson Center.\n   - **James R. Thompson\
      \ Center, IL**: This is a well-known building located in Chicago, Illinois.\
      \ It serves as a government building and is situated in the Loop district of\
      \ Chicago.\n\n2. **Determine the Relative Positions**:\n   - Assuming the Seventeenth\
      \ Church of Christ, Scientist, is also in Chicago (to make a comparison feasible),\
      \ we would need to know its exact location to compare. If it's not in Chicago,\
      \ we'd consider its location relative to Chicago.\n   - If the church is in\
      \ Chicago, we can directly compare its location to the Thompson Center. If it's\
      \ south of the Thompson Center's location, the answer would be \"YES\".\n  \
      \ - If the church is outside of Chicago but still in Illinois, we'd need to\
      \ compare its location to Chicago. Many parts of Illinois are south of Chicago,\
      \ so if the church is in one of these areas, it could indeed be south of the\
      \ Thompson Center.\n\n3. **Make an Assumption for the Sake of Argument**:\n\
      \   - Given that I don't have the exact location of the Seventeenth Church of\

      \ process, let's assume it is located in Chicago or somewhere in Illinois that\
      \ is directly comparable to the Thompson Center's location in Chicago.\n\n4.\

      \ However, for the sake of completing this exercise, if we assume the church\
      \ is in a location that can be directly compared to the James R. Thompson Center\
      \ in Chicago, we can proceed with a hypothetical answer.\n\nGiven the hypothetical\
      \ nature and the need for a direct comparison that cannot be accurately made\
      \ without more specific information, I will provide a tentative answer based\
      \ on the assumption that the church could be located in various parts of Illinois,\
