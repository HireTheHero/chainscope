      Therefore, NO, Grant USA Tower is not south of Barrow Street Theatre.'
    d8400381-7772-4bda-b534-5d7d891d7948: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s identify the locations:

      - Grant USA Tower is in New Jersey

      - Barrow Street Theatre is in New York (specifically in Greenwich Village, Manhattan)


      2. Looking at the general geography:

      - New Jersey is west and south of Manhattan

      - Barrow Street Theatre is in lower Manhattan

      - Grant USA Tower is likely in northern New Jersey (as it''s close enough to
      be referenced in relation to NYC)


      3. Even though New Jersey extends south of Manhattan, the areas of NJ that are
      typically referenced in relation to NYC landmarks are in northern NJ (like Jersey
      City, Hoboken, etc.)


      4. Given that this is likely comparing locations in the NYC metro area, Grant
      USA Tower would be in northern NJ, which is roughly at the same latitude as,
      or slightly north of, Greenwich Village where Barrow Street Theatre is located.


      Answer: NO'
