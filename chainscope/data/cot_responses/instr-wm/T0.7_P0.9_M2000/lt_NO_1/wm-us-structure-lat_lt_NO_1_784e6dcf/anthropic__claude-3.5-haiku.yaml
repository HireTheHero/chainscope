      - Cambridge is north of Boston

      - Therefore, Kendall Cogeneration Station is north of Improv Asylum


      4. The question asks: Is Kendall Cogeneration Station south of Improv Asylum?

      - No, it is not south of Improv Asylum


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      3. I''ll determine their relative positions to each other


      After careful checking:

      - Downtown Presbyterian Church is located at 4th Ave N in downtown Nashville

      - Tennessee Performing Arts Center is located at 505 Deaderick St, also in downtown
      Nashville

      - By comparing their addresses, TPAC is actually located south of Downtown Presbyterian
      Church


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      2. Then I''ll locate Tennessee Performing Arts Center (TPAC) in Nashville, TN

      3. I''ll determine their relative positions


      Step 1: Downtown Presbyterian Church location

      - Located in downtown Nashville

      - Specific address is 4th Avenue North


      Step 2: Tennessee Performing Arts Center location

      - Located at 505 Deaderick Street

      - Also in downtown Nashville


      Step 3: Relative positioning

      - Looking at a map of downtown Nashville

      - TPAC is located slightly southeast of Downtown Presbyterian Church

      - "South" means directly below/south of the reference point


      Therefore, Tennessee Performing Arts Center IS located south of Downtown Presbyterian
      Church.

    f0291fab-ceba-438b-8fc9-653887405de1: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate 257 Central Park West and Brick Presbyterian Church in
      Manhattan.


      2. 257 Central Park West is located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, near
      Central Park.


      3. Brick Presbyterian Church is located at 91 Central Park West, which is also
      on the Upper West Side.


      4. Both addresses are on Central Park West, so I''ll compare their street numbers.


      5. 257 is a higher street number than 91.


      6. In Manhattan, street numbers generally increase as you go north.


      7. Therefore, 257 Central Park West is located NORTH of 91 Central Park West
      (Brick Presbyterian Church).


      8. Since the question asks if it is south of the church, the answer is NO.

    af78fa50-025a-46eb-838e-c1031bd21ba2: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Dillon Reservoir in Colorado

      - This is located in Summit County, Colorado

      - Specifically, it''s near the town of Silverthorne, in the Rocky Mountains


      2. Next, I''ll locate Muskingum River Power Plant

      - This is located in Ohio

      - Specifically, it''s in Muskingum County, in southeastern Ohio


      3. Comparing their geographical locations

      - Colorado is in the western United States

      - Ohio is in the eastern United States

      - Colorado is west of Ohio


      4. Determining their north-south positioning

      - Colorado is actually north of Ohio in terms of latitude

      - So Dillon Reservoir is north of the Muskingum River Power Plant


      5. The specific question asks: Is Dillon Reservoir south of Muskingum River
      Power Plant?


      Since Dillon Reservoir is north of the Muskingum River Power Plant, the answer
      is:


      NO'
