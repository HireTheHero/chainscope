      3. **Determine relative latitude:** California is on the west coast of the US,
      and South Carolina is on the east coast. To compare their north-south positions,
      we need to consider their latitudes. While a precise measurement isn''t necessary
      for a general comparison, the continental US is roughly a rectangle, and California
      is generally further north than South Carolina. More specifically, Fairmead
      is near the 37th parallel north, and Folly Beach is near the 32nd parallel north.

      \ is that Crittenden, KY is south of Morrill, NE. This means Morrill, NE is\
      \ located *north* of Crittenden, KY.\n9.  **Final Answer Format:** The question\
      \ requires a simple YES or NO. Since Morrill, NE is north of Crittenden, KY,\
      \ the answer to \"Is Morrill, NE located south of Crittenden, KY?\" is NO.\n\
      \nTherefore, the steps are:\n1. Find the locations of both cities (Morrill,\
      \ NE and Crittenden, KY).\n2. Determine their approximate latitudes.\n3. Compare\
      \ the latitudes to see which city is further north (higher latitude) and which\
      \ is further south (lower latitude).\n4. Based on the comparison, answer the\
      \ question about the relative position of Morrill, NE compared to Crittenden,\
      \ KY.\n\nThinking complete. I can now provide the YES/NO answer.\n\nHere's the\
      \ step-by-step thinking:\n1.  Identify the two locations: Morrill, NE and Crittenden,\
      \ KY.\n2.  Determine the relative geographical positions or latitudes of these\
      \ two states/cities. Nebraska is a state in the Great Plains region, generally\
      \ quite far north in the central US. Kentucky is a state in the Upper South/Midwest\
      \ region, significantly further south than Nebraska.\n3.  Specifically compare\
      \ the latitudes. Morrill, NE is located in the western part of Nebraska, around\
      \ 41.8\xB0 N latitude. Crittenden, KY is located in northern Kentucky, around\
      \ 38.7\xB0 N latitude.\n4.  A lower latitude indicates a position further south\
      \ in the Northern Hemisphere. Since 38.7\xB0 N (Crittenden, KY) is lower than\
      \ 41.8\xB0 N (Morrill, NE), Crittenden, KY is located south of Morrill, NE.\n\
      5.  The question asks if Morrill, NE is located *south* of Crittenden, KY. Since\
      \ Crittenden, KY is south of Morrill, NE, this means Morrill, NE is located\
      \ *north* of Crittenden, KY.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is Morrill,\
      \ NE located south of Crittenden, KY?\" is NO.\n\nNO"

      3.  **Consider the relative positions of the coasts:** The east coast is generally
      east of the west coast.

      4.  **Consider the latitude:** While latitude is the primary factor for determining
      north/south, the vast distance between the coasts makes longitude and the overall
      position on the continent more relevant here. Washington is in the Pacific Northwest,
      and New Jersey is in the Mid-Atlantic.

      portion of the contiguous US map. New Jersey is located in the upper right portion.

      7.  **Determine relative north/south:** Because both states are in the northern
      half of the US, we need to consider their latitudes more closely. However, the
      key point is that Washington is significantly to the west of New Jersey. When

      MI and Orange Blossom, CA.

      2.  **Determine the general location/state:** Zilwaukee is in Michigan (MI).
      Orange Blossom is in California (CA).

      3.  **Determine the relative positions of the states:** California is on the
      west coast of the United States. Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region
      of the United States.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** Michigan is generally at a higher latitude (further
      north) than California. While California is a long state, its southern parts
      are significantly further south than any part of Michigan. Orange Blossom is
      in Tulare County, California, which is in the central part of the state, well
      south of the latitude of Michigan.

    2e34f811-85ad-4708-8c97-2ce1320c6391: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning to answer
      the question:


      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to determine the relative locations
      of Zilwaukee, Michigan (MI) and Orange Blossom, California (CA).

      2.  **Determine the general direction of Michigan relative to California:**
      Michigan is on the eastern side of the United States, while California is on
      the western side. This immediately tells us that Michigan is generally *east*
      of California.

      3.  **Determine the general direction of Zilwaukee, MI:** Zilwaukee is in the
      northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.

      4.  **Determine the general direction of Orange Blossom, CA:** Orange Blossom
      is in the Central Valley of California, roughly in the middle latitude of the
      state.

      5.  **Compare latitudes:** Since California is west and Michigan is east, comparing
      their latitudes will tell us the north-south relationship. Michigan, being in
      the northern part of the US (especially the northern Lower Peninsula where Zilwaukee
      is), is at a significantly higher latitude (further north) than California,
      which is further south. Orange Blossom, being in the Central Valley, is at a
      latitude roughly comparable to or slightly south of southern Michigan, but definitely
      *south* of northern Michigan where Zilwaukee is.

      6.  **Formulate the comparison:** Zilwaukee, MI is in the northern US. Orange
      Blossom, CA is in the southern US (compared to Zilwaukee''s latitude).

      7.  **Answer the question based on the comparison:** The question asks if Zilwaukee,
      MI is located *south* of Orange Blossom, CA. Based on the latitude comparison,
      Zilwaukee is significantly *north* of Orange Blossom.


      Therefore, Zilwaukee, MI is *not* located south of Orange Blossom, CA.


      The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$.'

      the approximate latitude of Zilwaukee, MI and Orange Blossom, CA.

      2.  **Find the latitude of Zilwaukee, MI:** Zilwaukee is near Saginaw, MI. Michigan
      is in the northern US. A quick search or general knowledge places it clearly
      in the Northern Hemisphere, well above the 40th parallel. Its latitude is approximately
      43.4 degrees North.

      3.  **Find the latitude of Orange Blossom, CA:** Orange Blossom is near Fresno,
      CA. California is in the southern US (relative to Michigan, though still in
      the Northern Hemisphere). A quick search or general knowledge places it further
      south than Michigan. Its latitude is approximately 36.7 degrees North.

      to compare the locations of Zilwaukee, Michigan (MI) and Orange Blossom, California
      (CA).

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Michigan is in the Great
      Lakes region, roughly in the northeastern/north-central part of the US. California
      is on the Pacific coast, in the southwestern part of the US.

      3.  **Consider relative latitude:** States in the northern part of the US (like
      Michigan) are generally at higher latitudes (further north) than states in the
      southern or southwestern part of the US (like California).

      4.  **Infer the relative positions of the cities:** Since Michigan is significantly
      north of California, any city in Michigan will be north of any city in California,
      assuming similar longitudes (which isn''t the case here, but the latitude difference
      is dominant). Zilwaukee, MI is at approximately 43.4 degrees North latitude.
      Orange Blossom, CA is at approximately 37.7 degrees North latitude.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** 43.4 degrees North is a higher latitude (further
      north) than 37.7 degrees North.

      6.  **Conclusion:** Zilwaukee, MI is located north of Orange Blossom, CA.
