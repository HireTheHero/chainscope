      1.  **Locate Connecticut (CT) and New Jersey (NJ) generally:** Connecticut is
      a New England state, located north of New York. New Jersey is a Mid-Atlantic
      state, located south of New York. Therefore, Connecticut is generally north
      of New Jersey.


      2.  **Locate Canaan, CT within Connecticut:** Canaan is in the northwestern
      corner of Connecticut.


      3.  **Locate Cape May, NJ within New Jersey:** Cape May is at the very southern
      tip of New Jersey.


      4.  **Compare the locations:** Since Connecticut as a whole is north of New
      Jersey, and Canaan is within Connecticut, while Cape May is at the southernmost
      point of New Jersey, Canaan, CT must be north of Cape May, NJ.


      Therefore, the question "Is Canaan, CT located south of Cape May, NJ?" is asking
      if a location in a more northern state is south of a location at the very southern
      tip of a more southern state. This is not the case.
