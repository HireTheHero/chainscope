    37240c33-ec4c-42e7-82ff-ec321f7686ba: 'To determine whether Lakota, ND is located
      south of Hoback, WY, we need to compare their latitudes.


      1. **Identify the latitude of Lakota, ND**: Lakota is in North Dakota, which
      is in the northern part of the United States. Its approximate latitude is around
      48 degrees north.


      2. **Identify the latitude of Hoback, WY**: Hoback is in Wyoming, which is further
      south compared to North Dakota. Its approximate latitude is around 43 degrees
      north.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Since 48 degrees north (Lakota, ND) is greater
      than 43 degrees north (Hoback, WY), Lakota is indeed north of Hoback.

    fe9b7bcf-ec15-488a-86fa-9b369a9e63fd: 'To determine whether Fairmead, CA is located
      south of Folly Beach, SC, we need to consider the latitudinal positions of both
      locations:


      1. **Identify the latitude of Fairmead, CA**: Fairmead is a community in California,
      which is generally located in the central part of the state. California''s central
      region, including Fairmead, is situated at a latitude approximately around 37
      degrees North.


      2. **Identify the latitude of Folly Beach, SC**: Folly Beach is a city in South
      Carolina, located along the coast. South Carolina is on the eastern side of
      the United States, and Folly Beach is situated at a latitude approximately around
      32.6 degrees North.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Since 37 degrees North (Fairmead, CA) is greater
      than 32.6 degrees North (Folly Beach, SC), Fairmead is located north of Folly
      Beach.
