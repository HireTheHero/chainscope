      2. Next, I''ll locate Escobares, TX:

      - Escobares is in Starr County, Texas

      - It is located in the Rio Grande Valley, in the southernmost part of Texas,
      near the Mexican border


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Fruitland Park is in central Florida, which is east and north of Escobares

      - Escobares is much further south and west


      4. Therefore, Fruitland Park is NOT south of Escobares.
