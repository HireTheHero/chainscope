      relative positions of two US cities: Lakota, ND (North Dakota) and Hoback, WY
      (Wyoming). Specifically, it''s asking if Lakota, ND is south of Hoback, WY.


      To answer this, I need to know the general geographic positions of North Dakota
      and Wyoming.


      North Dakota is a northern state that borders Canada. It''s positioned near
      the top of the contiguous United States.


      Wyoming is south of North Dakota. It doesn''t directly border North Dakota,
      as Montana is in between them.


      Since Lakota is in North Dakota (a northern state) and Hoback is in Wyoming
      (a state south of North Dakota), Lakota must be north of Hoback, not south of
      it.


      So, Lakota, ND is NOT located south of Hoback, WY. Instead, it''s located north
      of it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these
      two cities by examining which state is farther north.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these cities are located.

      - Lakota is in North Dakota (ND)

      - Hoback is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada

      - Wyoming is located south of North Dakota (with Montana in between)


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since North Dakota is positioned north of Wyoming on a map of the United States,
      cities in North Dakota would generally be north of cities in Wyoming.


      Therefore, Lakota, ND would be north of Hoback, WY, not south of it.

      by step.


      First, I need to identify the locations:

      1. Lakota, North Dakota (ND)

      2. Hoback, Wyoming (WY)


      To determine if one city is south of another, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A location with a lower latitude is further south.


      North Dakota (ND) is a state in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      Wyoming (WY) is a state in the western United States, south of Montana.


      Generally speaking, North Dakota is north of Wyoming. The entire state of North
      Dakota is north of the entire state of Wyoming in terms of latitude.


      Since Lakota is in North Dakota, and Hoback is in Wyoming, it''s very likely
      that Lakota is north of Hoback, not south of it.


      Therefore, Lakota, ND is NOT located south of Hoback, WY. Instead, it''s located
      north of it.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:

      cities based on their states.

      - Hoback is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is a northern border state, located at the northern edge of the
      contiguous United States, bordering Canada.

      - Wyoming is in the western mountain region, situated south of Montana and north
      of Colorado.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - North Dakota lies entirely north of Wyoming on a map of the United States.

      - Any city in North Dakota (including Lakota) would be north of any city in
      Wyoming (including Hoback).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - Since Lakota is in a state that is entirely north of the state where Hoback
      is located, Lakota must be north of Hoback, not south.

      Step 1: I need to identify where Goodrich, MI is located in Michigan.

      - Goodrich is in Michigan (MI), which is generally north of Ohio.

      - Within Michigan, Goodrich is in Genesee County, which is in the eastern part
      of the Lower Peninsula.


      Step 2: I need to identify where New Concord, OH is located in Ohio.

      - New Concord is in Ohio (OH), which is generally south of Michigan.

      - New Concord is in eastern Ohio, in Muskingum County.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Michigan is generally north of Ohio, so cities in Michigan are typically north
      of cities in Ohio.

      - Goodrich, MI is in the lower part of Michigan, but it''s still in Michigan
      which is north of Ohio.

      - New Concord, OH is in eastern Ohio.


      Since Michigan is north of Ohio, and these cities don''t appear to be in unusual
      locations within their states that would reverse the typical north-south relationship,
      Goodrich, MI should be north of New Concord, OH.


      Therefore, Goodrich, MI is NOT south of New Concord, OH. It is north of it.</think>To

      Lower Peninsula.

      - New Concord, OH is located in eastern Ohio in Muskingum County.


      Step 2: Consider the north-south relationship between Michigan and Ohio.

      - Michigan is generally positioned north of Ohio.

      - The entire Lower Peninsula of Michigan (where Goodrich is located) sits above
      Ohio geographically.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of these specific cities.

      - Even though Goodrich is in the southern part of Michigan, it is still positioned
      north of most of Ohio.

      - New Concord is not located in the extreme northern part of Ohio that might
      put it north of some Michigan locations.

      Let me reason about their locations:


      1. Goodrich, MI is in Michigan, which is generally north of Ohio. Michigan is
      directly north of Ohio.

      2. New Concord, OH is in Ohio.

      3. However, I need to be more precise about their specific locations within
      their states.


      Goodrich, MI is likely in the lower peninsula of Michigan. The southern part
      of Michigan borders northern Ohio.


      New Concord, OH - I''m not certain of its exact location, but I believe it''s
      in eastern Ohio.


      Without knowing the exact coordinates, I can make an educated guess based on
      general state geography:

      - Michigan is north of Ohio

      - Therefore, Goodrich, MI is likely north of New Concord, OH, not south


      So Goodrich, MI is probably NOT south of New Concord, OH. The answer would be
      NO.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two
      cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general positions.

      Michigan (MI) is located north of Ohio (OH). The entire state of Michigan is
      positioned above Ohio on the map.


      Step 2: Consider possible exceptions.

      Sometimes cities near state borders might not follow the general north-south
      relationship of their states. However, Goodrich is located in the lower peninsula
      of Michigan, not near the southern border.


      Step 3: Examine specific city locations.

      Goodrich, MI is in Genesee County in the eastern part of Michigan''s lower peninsula.

      New Concord, OH is in eastern Ohio.


      Step 4: Determine their positions on the north-south axis.

      Since Michigan is entirely north of Ohio, and Goodrich is not in an unusual
      southern projection of Michigan, Goodrich must be north of New Concord, not
      south of it.

      NV, specifically whether West Sand Lake is south of Mogul.


      Step 1: Let me recall the approximate locations of these places.

      - West Sand Lake, NY is in New York state, which is in the northeastern United
      States.

      - Mogul, NV is in Nevada, which is in the western United States.


      Step 2: Let me think about the latitudes.

      - New York is generally north of Nevada in terms of latitude.

      - West Sand Lake would be in the eastern part of New York.

      - Mogul would be somewhere in Nevada.


      Step 3: More specifically:

      - West Sand Lake, NY is likely around 42-43 degrees north latitude (typical
      for upstate New York).

      - Mogul, NV is probably around 39-40 degrees north latitude (typical for northern
      Nevada).


      Since West Sand Lake is likely at a higher latitude (more north) than Mogul,
      West Sand Lake would NOT be south of Mogul. It would be north of Mogul.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two locations to answer whether
      one is south of the other.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      West Sand Lake is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States.

      Mogul is in Nevada (NV), which is in the western United States.


      Step 2: Consider their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      New York state is generally located in the northern part of the country.

      Nevada is also in the northern half of the country, but typically at lower latitudes
      than New York.


      Step 3: Compare their specific positions.

      West Sand Lake, NY is in the eastern part of upstate New York, typically around
      42-43 degrees north latitude.

      Mogul, NV (near Reno) is in western Nevada, typically around 39-40 degrees north

      1. West Sand Lake, NY: New York state is in the northeastern United States.
      West Sand Lake is likely in upstate New York.

      New York is generally further north than Nevada. New York is in the northeastern
      US while Nevada is more southwest. In terms of latitude, New York locations

      States.

      - Mogul, NV is in Nevada, which is in the western United States.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes (north-south positions).

      - New York state is generally much further north in the United States compared
      to Nevada.

      - New York locations typically have higher latitudes (more northerly) than Nevada
      locations.

      - West Sand Lake would be in the northern part of the US, while Mogul would
      be in a more middle-southern latitude.

      New Jersey (NJ) is a state located in the northeastern United States, on the
      East Coast.

      Mississippi (MS) is a state located in the southern United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico.

      to determine the relative locations of Deer River, Minnesota and Rib Mountain,
      Wisconsin.


      Let me think about where these places are:


      1. Deer River is a city in Minnesota (MN)

      2. Rib Mountain is in Wisconsin (WI)


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A location with a lower latitude is farther south.


      From my knowledge of US geography:

      - Minnesota is generally north of Wisconsin

      - Minnesota borders Wisconsin to the west, but Wisconsin extends further south
      than the southern border of Minnesota

      - However, northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin are adjacent to each other


      Deer River, MN is likely in northern Minnesota, while Rib Mountain, WI is likely
      in central or northern Wisconsin.


      More specifically, Deer River is in Itasca County in north-central Minnesota,
      somewhat close to the headwaters of the Mississippi River.


      Rib Mountain is near Wausau in Marathon County, which is in the central part
      of Wisconsin.


      Given this understanding, Deer River is likely north of Rib Mountain, not south
      of it. But I should be clear about this before giving a definitive answer.


      Minnesota is generally north of Wisconsin, and Deer River is in the northern

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Deer River is in northern Minnesota

      - Rib Mountain is in central Wisconsin


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions

      Minnesota is generally north of Wisconsin, though they share an east-west border
      with Minnesota to the west of Wisconsin.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations

      - Deer River, MN is located in Itasca County in north-central Minnesota

      - Rib Mountain, WI is near Wausau in Marathon County in central Wisconsin


      ## Step 4: Compare latitudes

      Deer River is positioned in the northern part of Minnesota, while Rib Mountain
      is in central Wisconsin. Given Minnesota''s northern position relative to Wisconsin,
      Deer River would be north of Rib Mountain, not south.


      NO, Deer River, MN is not located south of Rib Mountain, WI.'

      Park, NY is located south of Riverwood, KY.


      First, let me consider the geographic positions:


      1. Averill Park, NY is in New York state, which is in the northeastern United
      States.

      2. Riverwood, KY is in Kentucky, which is in the south-central United States.


      In terms of north-south positioning, New York is generally north of Kentucky.
      New York is one of the northernmost states in the eastern US, while Kentucky
      is more centrally located but definitely south of New York.


      Since Averill Park is in New York, and Riverwood is in Kentucky, it''s very
      likely that Averill Park is NORTH of Riverwood, not south of it.


      So my answer would be NO, Averill Park, NY is not located south of Riverwood,
      KY. It''s located north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the north-south relationship between these two locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these cities are located.

      - Averill Park is in New York (NY)

      - Riverwood is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Determine the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New York state is significantly north of Kentucky

      - Cities in New York will generally be north of cities in Kentucky


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Averill Park is in New York (a northern state) and Riverwood is in Kentucky
      (a more southern state), Averill Park would be north of Riverwood, not south
      of it.

      Step 2: Compare the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - Ohio is located north of Virginia in the United States

      - Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north while Virginia is further south in the
      country


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Since Ohio as a state is entirely north of Virginia, Bloomdale (regardless
      of where it is within Ohio) would be north of Ettrick (regardless of where it
      is within Virginia)


      Therefore, Bloomdale, OH is located north of Ettrick, VA, not south of it.

      Bloomdale is in Ohio (OH). Ohio is a state in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      Ettrick is in Virginia (VA). Virginia is a state on the East Coast/Mid-Atlantic

      - Forsgate, NJ is in central New Jersey (Middlesex County).


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Michigan generally extends farther north than New Jersey.

      - Charlevoix is in northern Michigan, putting it even farther north.

      - New Jersey, including Forsgate, lies at a more southern latitude than northern

      further south.


      Illinois is generally north of Texas in the US. Illinois is in the Midwest,
      while Texas is in the South/Southwest. So geographically speaking, cities in
      Illinois tend to be north of cities in Texas.


      Grayville is in Illinois, so it''s likely north of most Texas cities.

      Rendon is in Texas, so it''s likely south of most Illinois cities.


      Based on general geographic knowledge of US states, I can say that Illinois
      is north of Texas. Therefore, Grayville, IL would be north of Rendon, TX, not
      south of it.

      First, let''s identify what states these cities are in:

      - Kieler is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Mount Auburn is in Illinois (IL)


      Generally, Wisconsin is north of Illinois in the United States. Wisconsin borders
      the northern part of Illinois. This gives us a preliminary guess that Kieler,
      WI would be north of Mount Auburn, IL, not south. But let''s think more precisely.


      Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois, so a city in Wisconsin would typically
      be north of a city in Illinois. However, there could be exceptions depending
      on the exact locations within each state, especially if Kieler is in southern
      Wisconsin and Mount Auburn is in northern Illinois.


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, based on general US geography knowledge,
      Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois. So a city in Wisconsin (Kieler) would

      - Kieler is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Mount Auburn is in Illinois (IL)

      - Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois on the US map


      Step 2: Consider the geographic layout of these states.

      - Wisconsin entirely sits north of Illinois

      - Even the southernmost point of Wisconsin is north of many parts of Illinois


      Step 3: Apply this information to the specific cities.

      - Since Kieler is in Wisconsin, it must be north of Illinois'' border

      - Since Mount Auburn is in Illinois, it must be south of Wisconsin''s border

      - Therefore, Kieler must be north of Mount Auburn, not south of it

      2. Mount Auburn, IL is in Illinois, which is south of Wisconsin


      Generally speaking, locations in Wisconsin tend to be north of locations in

      Step 1: Let me recall the approximate locations of these states.

      - Wisconsin (WI) is in the northern part of the United States, in the Midwest
      region, bordering Lake Michigan

      - Colorado (CO) is in the western part of the United States, in the Rocky Mountain
      region

      locations of Plain, Wisconsin and Knightsville, Indiana to figure out which
      one is further south.


      First, I need to know the approximate latitude of each city:


      1. Plain, WI is in Wisconsin, which is in the northern part of the US. Wisconsin
      is generally north of Indiana.


      2. Knightsville, IN is in Indiana, which is south of Wisconsin.


      Generally speaking, places in Indiana tend to be south of places in Wisconsin
      because Indiana as a state is south of Wisconsin. Wisconsin borders the northern
      part of Illinois, while Indiana is east of Illinois.


      So without knowing the exact coordinates, the general geographic arrangement
      of these states would suggest that Plain, WI (being in Wisconsin) is north of
      Knightsville, IN (being in Indiana).


      Therefore, Plain, WI would NOT be south of Knightsville, IN.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these

      - Knightsville is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Wisconsin is located in the northern part of the Midwest, while Indiana is located
      further south. Wisconsin''s southern border is roughly aligned with northern
      Illinois, while Indiana is positioned south of that.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level knowledge to the cities.

      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Indiana in terms of latitude, any city
      in Wisconsin (including Plain) would be north of any city in Indiana (including
      Knightsville).


      NO, Plain, WI is not located south of Knightsville, IN. It is located north

      to determine the geographic locations of Meadows Place, TX and Montura, FL and

      Step 1: Identify the location of Meadows Place, TX.

      Meadows Place is a city in Fort Bend County, Texas, which is in the southeastern
      part of Texas, near Houston.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Montura, FL.

      Montura (or Montura Ranch Estates) is in Hendry County, Florida, which is in
      the southern part of Florida.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Texas is generally north of Florida in the United States.

      - However, southern Texas could potentially be at a similar latitude as northern
      Florida.

      - Meadows Place is near Houston in southeastern Texas, which is still more northern
      than southern Florida where Montura is located.

      - Southern Florida is one of the southernmost parts of the continental United
      States.

      Step 2: Locate Montura, FL.

      Montura (or Montura Ranch Estates) is in Hendry County in southern Florida.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Florida extends much further south than Texas does. Southern Florida, where
      Montura is located, is one of the southernmost parts of the continental United
      States. While Meadows Place is in the southern part of Texas, Texas as a whole
      is positioned more northerly than southern Florida.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Meadows Place, TX has a higher latitude (more northerly position) than Montura,
      FL, which has a lower latitude (more southerly position).

      Necedah is in Wisconsin (WI), which is generally north of Ohio (OH). Wisconsin
      is in the upper Midwest of the United States, while Ohio is more in the eastern
      part of the Midwest.


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Wisconsin is typically north of Ohio

      - Wisconsin shares a border with Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and Michigan

      - Ohio shares borders with Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky,
      and Indiana


      Based on the general position of these states, it''s unlikely that Necedah,
      WI would be south of Darbydale, OH. Wisconsin as a whole is north of Ohio.


      So my reasoning suggests that Necedah, WI is NOT south of Darbydale, OH, but
      rather north of it. The answer would be NO.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of Necedah, Wisconsin and Darbydale, Ohio by comparing their latitudes.


      Step 1: Consider the general geographic positions of Wisconsin and Ohio.

      Wisconsin is located in the northern part of the Midwest United States, while
      Ohio is located further south and east.


      Step 2: Think about their relative positions on a map.

      Wisconsin is generally positioned north of Ohio. Wisconsin borders Minnesota,
      Iowa, Illinois, and Michigan, while Ohio borders Michigan, Pennsylvania, West
      Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      Necedah is in central Wisconsin, while Darbydale is in central Ohio. Even a
      town in southern Wisconsin would typically be further north than a town in northern
      Ohio due to the overall positioning of these states.


      NO, Necedah, WI is not located south of Darbydale, OH. It is located north of
      it.'

      southeastern United States. Kentucky is positioned significantly north of Georgia
      on the map.


      Step 3: Since the cities are in their respective states, their relative positions
      generally follow the same pattern.

      Cynthiana, being in Kentucky, is north of Georgia''s state line.

      Cuthbert, being in Georgia, is south of Kentucky''s state line.


      Therefore, Cynthiana is north of Cuthbert, not south of it.

      Let me think about the general geography of these states first. Kentucky is
      a state in the eastern United States, located north of Tennessee. Georgia is
      a southeastern state, located south of Tennessee. So in general, Kentucky is
      north of Georgia.


      Given this general orientation:

      - Kentucky is north of Georgia

      - Cynthiana is in Kentucky

      - Cuthbert is in Georgia


      Generally speaking, cities in Kentucky would be north of cities in Georgia.
      However, I need to be careful as specific cities within these states could have
      unusual positions relative to each other depending on their exact locations
      within their respective states.


      But given the standard geography of the United States, with Kentucky being clearly
      north of Georgia on the map, it''s very likely that Cynthiana, KY is located

      Analysis of Cynthiana, KY and Cuthbert, GA Locations


      To determine if Cynthiana, KY is south of Cuthbert, GA, I need to consider the
      geographical relationship between these states and cities.


      ## Step 1: Identify state locations

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the eastern United States

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Generally, Kentucky is positioned north of Georgia


      ## Step 2: Consider relative positions

      - Kentucky shares its southern border with Tennessee

      - Georgia is south of Tennessee

      - This means Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia on the map


      ## Step 3: Determine city locations

      - Cynthiana is in Kentucky, therefore it must be north of the Kentucky-Tennessee
      border

      - Cuthbert is in Georgia, therefore it must be south of the Tennessee-Georgia
      border


      Since the entirety of Kentucky is north of Georgia, any city in Kentucky (including
      Cynthiana) would be north of any city in Georgia (including Cuthbert), not south.

      Step 1: Determine the general positions of Kentucky and Georgia.

      Kentucky is a state in the southeast/east-central United States, but it''s north

      Cynthiana is a city in Kentucky, and Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia.

      Cuthbert is a city in Georgia, and Georgia is entirely south of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Since Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia, any city in Kentucky (including
      Cynthiana) must be north of any city in Georgia (including Cuthbert).


      Therefore, Cynthiana, KY is NOT south of Cuthbert, GA. Rather, it''s north of

      Step 2: Look at the geographic relationship between these states.

      North Carolina is located north of Georgia. Georgia is directly south of North
      Carolina in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the cities.

      Since Pleasant Garden is in North Carolina and Swainsboro is in Georgia, and
      North Carolina is north of Georgia, Pleasant Garden would generally be north
      of Swainsboro (not south).

      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the specific cities.

      - Since Carey is in Ohio, and Ohio is north of North Carolina, Carey must be
      north of Oakboro.

      - The specific locations of these cities within their states wouldn''t change
      this north-south relationship.


      NO - Carey, OH is not located south of Oakboro, NC.'

      whether Carey, OH is located south of Oakboro, NC.


      To solve this, I need to know the approximate latitudes of these two cities:

      1. Carey, OH (Ohio)

      2. Oakboro, NC (North Carolina)


      In the United States, Ohio is generally north of North Carolina. Ohio is in
      the Midwest/Great Lakes region, while North Carolina is in the Southeast/South
      Atlantic region.


      So generally speaking, cities in Ohio tend to be north of cities in North Carolina.
      This means that Carey, OH is likely north of Oakboro, NC, not south.


      To be certain, I would need to know the specific latitudes of these cities,
      but based on the general geographic positions of these states, we can reasonably
      conclude that Carey, OH is north of Oakboro, NC.


      Therefore, the answer should be NO - Carey, OH is not located south of Oakboro,
      NC.</think># Is Carey, OH located south of Oakboro, NC?


      I''ll think through this by determining the locations of both cities and comparing
      their positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Carey is in Ohio (OH)

      - Oakboro is in North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - North Carolina is in the Southeast region of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare latitudes

      - States in the Midwest (like Ohio) are generally farther north than states
      in the Southeast (like North Carolina)

      - Ohio is positioned well north of North Carolina on the map


      ## Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Since Carey is in Ohio, and Ohio is north of North Carolina (where Oakboro is
      located), Carey must be north of Oakboro, not south.


      NO'

      IA is the abbreviation for Iowa, and VA is the abbreviation for Virginia.


      To determine if Epworth, IA is south of Blue Ridge Shores, VA, I need to compare
      their latitudes. A location with a lower latitude is further south than a location
      with a higher latitude.


      Iowa is a midwestern state, generally in the northern part of the United States.
      Virginia is an eastern state, located in what''s commonly called the Mid-Atlantic
      region.


      Geographically speaking, Iowa is located in the north-central United States,
      while Virginia is in the east-central United States. Generally, Iowa is at a
      higher latitude (more northern) than Virginia.


      So in general, I would expect a city in Iowa to be north of a city in Virginia,
      not south. But I should be more specific about these particular cities.


      Epworth, Iowa is located in the northeastern part of Iowa.

      Blue Ridge Shores, Virginia is likely in the Blue Ridge Mountain region of Virginia,
      which is in the western part of the state.


      In terms of north-south positioning, Iowa is generally north of Virginia, so
      Epworth, IA is likely north of Blue Ridge Shores, VA, not south.</think># Is
      Epworth, IA located south of Blue Ridge Shores, VA?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two cities by

      1) Epworth is in Iowa (IA), which is a Midwestern state

      2) Blue Ridge Shores is in Virginia (VA), which is a Mid-Atlantic state

      3) Geographically, Iowa is located in the northern part of the United States

      4) Virginia is located significantly further south than Iowa

      5) Cities in Iowa will generally be north of cities in Virginia


      Even without knowing the exact coordinates of these specific cities, the geographic

      La Plata is in Maryland (MD), which is generally south of Pennsylvania.


      Pennsylvania is north of Maryland in general, so a city in Pennsylvania would

      determine the relative positions of Chillicothe, Ohio and Norfolk, Arkansas
      on a north-south axis.


      First, let me clarify the locations:

      1. Chillicothe is in Ohio (OH), which is in the Midwest region of the United
      States

      2. The question refers to "Norfork, AR" - not Norfolk (with an "l"), but Norfork
      (with an "r") in Arkansas (AR)


      Let me think about the rough geographical positions:


      Ohio is generally north of Arkansas in the United States. Ohio borders Lake
      Erie to the north and Kentucky to the south. Arkansas is much further south,
      bordering Missouri to the north and Louisiana to the south.


      Specifically:

      - Chillicothe, OH is located in southern Ohio

      - Norfork, AR is located in northern Arkansas


      Even though Chillicothe is in southern Ohio, Ohio as a whole is significantly
      north of Arkansas. So Chillicothe, OH would be north of Norfork, AR, not south
      of it.


      Therefore, Chillicothe, OH is NOT located south of Norfork, AR. It''s located
      north of it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of
      these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Arkansas (AR)
      is in the South/Southeast region.


      Step 2: Compare the states'' latitudes.

      Ohio is significantly north of Arkansas on a map of the United States. Ohio
      borders Lake Erie and Pennsylvania to the north, while Arkansas borders Missouri
      to the north and Louisiana to the south.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      Even though Chillicothe is in southern Ohio, and Norfork is in northern Arkansas,
      the overall north-south difference between the states is substantial enough
      that any city in Ohio would be north of any city in Arkansas.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Chillicothe, OH is north of Norfork, AR (not south), the answer is:


      NO'

      - AR = Arkansas, which is in the South/Southeast


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is south of Ohio on a map of the United States.
      Ohio is much further north than Arkansas.


      Now for the specific cities:

      - Chillicothe is a city in Ohio

      - Norfork is a city in Arkansas


      Since Ohio is north of Arkansas, and these cities are within their respective
      states, it''s very likely that Chillicothe, OH is north of Norfork, AR (not
      south).

      Arkansas (AR) is located in the South/Southeast region of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare the general north-south positioning.

      Ohio is significantly north of Arkansas on the map of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities within their states.

      Chillicothe is a city in south-central Ohio.

      Norfork is a city in north-central Arkansas.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these positions.

      Even though Chillicothe is in southern Ohio and Norfork is in northern Arkansas,
      the overall north-south difference between the states is substantial enough
      that any city in Ohio (including Chillicothe) would be north of cities in Arkansas

      - Even the southern portions of Ohio are generally north of the northern portions
      of Arkansas


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific cities.

      - While Chillicothe is in southern Ohio, it would still be north of Norfork,

      In general, Minnesota is located west of Pennsylvania, but that doesn''t tell

      Minnesota is generally north of Pennsylvania. Minnesota borders Canada, while

      which requires looking at their latitudes.


      ## Step 1: Locate these cities geographically

      - Prior Lake, Minnesota is in the southern part of Minnesota, in the Minneapolis
      metropolitan area.

      - I need to consider Schlusser, Pennsylvania''s location. Actually, I should
      note that "Schlusser, PA" doesn''t appear to be a recognized municipality in
      Pennsylvania. There may be a Schlusser Road or a small unincorporated community,
      but it''s not a major city or town in Pennsylvania.


      ## Step 2: Compare the states geographically

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - Generally speaking, Minnesota is located west of Pennsylvania, but more importantly
      for this question, Minnesota is located NORTH of Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Make the north-south comparison

      - Even though Prior Lake is in the southern part of Minnesota, Minnesota itself
      is significantly north of Pennsylvania

      - Any location in Pennsylvania, including Schlusser (if it exists), would be
      south of most Minnesota locations


      Therefore, Prior Lake, MN is NOT south of Schlusser, PA, but rather north of
      it.

      located south of Schlusser, PA, I need to know their relative geographic positions.


      Let me think about the states first:

      - MN is Minnesota, located in the northern part of the Midwest

      - PA is Pennsylvania, located in the northeastern part of the US


      In terms of latitude:

      - Minnesota is generally north of Pennsylvania in terms of north-south positioning

      - However, specific cities within these states could have different relative
      positions


      I need to remember the specific locations of these cities:


      Prior Lake, MN is a suburb in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area in Minnesota,
      which is in the southern part of Minnesota.


      For Schlusser, PA - I''m not immediately certain of its exact location. I''m
      not sure if this is a well-known place in Pennsylvania or possibly a small town.


      Without knowing the specific coordinates of Schlusser, PA, it''s difficult to
      make a definitive comparison. However, generally speaking, most of Minnesota
      (even its southern parts) tends to be north of Pennsylvania.</think>I need to
      determine the north-south relationship between these two cities by examining
      their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Prior Lake, MN.

      Prior Lake is a city in Minnesota, located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan
      area in the southeastern part of the state.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Schlusser, PA.

      I need to consider where Schlusser, Pennsylvania is located. Pennsylvania is
      in the northeastern United States, significantly south of Minnesota.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of Minnesota and Pennsylvania.

      Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada, while Pennsylvania is several
      states south of Minnesota. Even the southernmost parts of Minnesota are generally
      north of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Prior Lake, being in Minnesota, is located north of essentially all points in
      Pennsylvania, including Schlusser.


      NO (Prior Lake, MN is not south of Schlusser, PA, but rather north of it)'

    d0a45fa9-fc8e-441a-acdd-da7ad03bcc44: '<think>Let''s break this down:


      1. I need to determine if Prior Lake, Minnesota is located south of Schlusser,
      Pennsylvania.


      2. To determine this, I need to know the latitudes of both cities. A lower latitude
      means further south.


      Prior Lake, Minnesota is located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area in the
      state of Minnesota, which is in the northern part of the US.


      For Schlusser, Pennsylvania - I need to be careful here. I''m not immediately
      familiar with a city called "Schlusser" in Pennsylvania. Let me think about
      this more carefully.


      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern US, generally east of Minnesota.
      In terms of north-south positioning, Pennsylvania is roughly at the same latitude
      as southern Minnesota or northern Iowa.


      If Schlusser, PA exists, it would be somewhere in Pennsylvania. Minnesota is
      generally considered to be north of Pennsylvania, so Prior Lake, MN would likely
      be north of Schlusser, PA - not south.


      But I should be cautious since I''m not familiar with Schlusser, PA specifically.
      The general relationship between Minnesota and Pennsylvania would suggest that
      Prior Lake is NOT south of any city in Pennsylvania, but I can''t be 100% certain
      without specific latitude information for Schlusser.


      Based on general geographic knowledge of US states, the answer is likely NO
      - Prior Lake, MN is not south of Schlusser, PA. It would be north of it.</think>#
      Is Prior Lake, MN located south of Schlusser, PA?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two cities by
      considering their locations.


      ## Step 1: Consider Minnesota''s location

      Prior Lake is in Minnesota, which is in the northern part of the United States,
      bordering Canada. Minnesota is generally located in the Upper Midwest region.


      ## Step 2: Consider Pennsylvania''s location

      Schlusser is in Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern United States. Pennsylvania
      is considerably south of Minnesota.


      ## Step 3: Compare latitudes

      Even without knowing the exact coordinates, Minnesota cities (including Prior
      Lake) are generally at higher latitudes (more northerly) than Pennsylvania cities
      (including Schlusser).


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Minnesota is north of Pennsylvania, Prior Lake would be north of Schlusser,
      not south.


      # NO

      Illinois is generally north of Texas.


      2. Sundown, TX is in Texas, which is in the southern United States, bordering

      Based on the general geography of the US, Texas is south of Illinois. This would
      suggest that Ullin, IL is north of Sundown, TX, not south.


      To be more precise:

      - Ullin, IL is in the southern part of Illinois, near the border with Missouri
      and Kentucky

      - Sundown, TX is in the northwestern part of Texas, in the panhandle region

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Ullin is in Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Sundown is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Illinois is generally located north of Texas on a map of the United States.

      - Even though Ullin is in southern Illinois, Texas is significantly further
      south overall.


      Step 3: Consider regional positioning.

      - Sundown, TX is in the northwest part of Texas (in the Texas Panhandle region).

      - Ullin, IL is in the far southern portion of Illinois.

      - However, even the northern parts of Texas tend to be south of the southernmost

      To determine which one is more south (i.e., has a lower latitude), I need to
      think about their approximate positions.


      Michigan is generally north of California. Michigan is one of the northern states
      bordering Canada, while California extends from the middle latitudes down to
      the Mexican border.


      Zilwaukee is in Saginaw County in Michigan, which is in the eastern part of
      Michigan''s Lower Peninsula. This puts it at a northern latitude compared to
      most of the United States.


      Orange Blossom, CA is likely in southern California where many citrus-growing
      regions are located. California''s citrus belt is generally in the southern
      part of the state.


      Based on this general knowledge, Orange Blossom, CA is likely further south
      than Zilwaukee, MI. That would mean Zilwaukee is NOT located south of Orange
      Blossom.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Zilwaukee, MI is in Michigan, which is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of
      the United States.

      - Orange Blossom, CA is in California, which is on the West Coast.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Michigan is a northern state that borders Canada, with even its southern portions
      being relatively far north in the continental US.

      - California extends from the middle latitudes of the US down to the Mexican
      border.

      - Orange Blossom, CA is likely in the citrus-growing region of California, which
      tends to be in the central to southern parts of the state.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Geographically, Michigan locations (including Zilwaukee) are generally much
      further north than California locations.

      - Even the northernmost parts of California are typically south of Michigan
      cities.


      NO - Zilwaukee, MI is NOT located south of Orange Blossom, CA. It is located
      north of it.'

      Maumee, Ohio is in the northern part of Ohio, near Toledo. Ohio is in the northern
      United States, bordering Lake Erie.


      Garner, North Carolina is near Raleigh in central North Carolina. North Carolina
      is in the southeastern United States, considerably south of Ohio.


      In the northern hemisphere, a lower latitude means more south, and a higher
      latitude means more north.


      Ohio is generally north of North Carolina. Maumee being in northern Ohio would

      So Maumee, OH is almost certainly NOT south of Garner, NC. Instead, Maumee is
      north of Garner.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two cities by comparing their latitudes.

      - Garner is in North Carolina (NC), which is in the Southeast region of the
      US

      - Ohio is much further north than North Carolina

      - Ohio borders Lake Erie and is near the Great Lakes region

      - North Carolina is along the Atlantic coast in the southeastern US


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - Ohio is generally positioned well north of North Carolina

      - Cities in Ohio, including Maumee, would have higher latitudes (more northern)
      than cities in North Carolina

      - Maumee is actually in northern Ohio, making it even further north


      NO, Maumee, OH is not located south of Garner, NC. It is located north of Garner,

      Wisconsin, and Barberton is in northeastern Ohio, Mole Lake should be north
      of Barberton, not south.

      of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Wisconsin (WI) is located in the upper Midwest, while Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest/Great
      Lakes region. Generally, Wisconsin is positioned north of Ohio.


      Step 2: Locate the specific cities.

      Mole Lake is in northeastern Wisconsin, in Forest County.

      Barberton is in northeastern Ohio, near Akron.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Wisconsin''s southern border is generally north of Ohio''s northern border.
      Since Mole Lake is in northeastern Wisconsin and not at the extreme southern
      edge of the state, it would be considerably north of Barberton, Ohio.

      determine the relative geographic positions of McLean, VA and Berry College,
      GA. I''ll approach this by figuring out where each place is located.


      McLean, VA is in Virginia, which is a state in the mid-Atlantic region of the
      US. Virginia is north of Georgia.


      Berry College is in Georgia (GA), which is a southeastern state in the US. Georgia
      is south of Virginia.


      Since McLean is in Virginia, and Berry College is in Georgia, and Virginia is
      north of Georgia, it follows that McLean is likely north of Berry College, not
      south.


      To be more precise:

      - McLean, VA is in northern Virginia, near Washington DC.

      - Berry College is in Rome, GA, which is in the northwestern part of Georgia.


      Even with these specifics, the general geography of the US means that locations
      in Virginia are north of locations in Georgia. So McLean, VA would be north
      of Berry College, GA, not south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states. McLean is in Virginia (VA), and Berry College is
      in Georgia (GA).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states. Virginia
      is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the US, while Georgia is in the southeastern
      region. Virginia is north of Georgia on a map.


      Step 3: For more precision, McLean is specifically in northern Virginia (near
      Washington DC), while Berry College is in Rome, in the northwestern part of
      Georgia.


      Step 4: Since Virginia is entirely north of Georgia on the north-south axis,
      McLean (in northern VA) must be north of Berry College (in GA).


      NO, McLean, VA is not located south of Berry College, GA. It is located north
      of it.'

      South Carolina.


      3. Therefore, generally speaking, locations in Virginia would be north of locations

      Step 2: Look at the geographic relationship between these states. Virginia is
      located north of North Carolina, which in turn is north of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Since Virginia is entirely north of South Carolina on the US map, any
      city in Virginia (including Rich Creek) would be located north of any city in

    5ec9048c-8cf6-4fc1-9e76-f7c1ccfcda0f: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to compare the geographical locations of Rich Creek, VA and Cash, SC to determine
      which one is further south.


      First, let me recall the general geography of Virginia (VA) and South Carolina
      (SC):

      - Virginia is a state in the Mid-Atlantic/Southeastern United States

      - South Carolina is a state in the Southeastern United States

      - Generally speaking, South Carolina is south of Virginia


      Now, let''s think about the specific locations:

      - Rich Creek is in Virginia (VA)

      - Cash is in South Carolina (SC)


      Since South Carolina is generally south of Virginia, and Rich Creek is in Virginia
      while Cash is in South Carolina, it''s most likely that Rich Creek, VA is north
      of Cash, SC (not south of it).


      To be thorough, I should note that there could potentially be exceptions if
      these towns are very close to the state borders in a way that defies the general
      north-south relationship of the states. However, the state boundary between
      Virginia and South Carolina doesn''t actually touch - North Carolina is between
      them. So it''s not possible for a Virginia town to be south of a South Carolina
      town.


      Therefore, Rich Creek, VA is north of Cash, SC, not south of it.</think>I need
      to determine the relative north-south positions of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the states. Rich Creek is in Virginia (VA), and Cash is in
      South Carolina (SC).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states. Virginia
      is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US, while South Carolina is in
      the Southeast. Looking at a US map, Virginia is positioned north of South Carolina
      (with North Carolina in between them).


      Step 3: Since the states follow a clear north-south relationship, cities within
      these states would generally maintain this relationship. Rich Creek, being in
      Virginia, would be north of any city in South Carolina, including Cash.


      NO, Rich Creek, VA is not located south of Cash, SC. It is located north of

      Virginia is north of South Carolina in the United States.


      2. Since Rich Creek is in Virginia, and Cash is in South Carolina, and Virginia
      is generally north of South Carolina, it would suggest that Rich Creek is likely

      3. However, I should be careful. State boundaries aren''t perfectly horizontal,
      and locations within states can have varying latitudes. It''s possible for a
      southern point in Virginia to be further south than a northern point in South
      Carolina.


      4. But generally speaking, most of Virginia lies north of most of South Carolina.

      2. Cash is in South Carolina (SC)


      I need to determine their relative north-south positions. In the United States:

      - Virginia is north of South Carolina (SC is further south than VA)

      - Virginia borders North Carolina to its south, and North Carolina borders South
      Carolina to its south


      Since Virginia is north of South Carolina, generally places in Virginia would

      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Virginia is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the US, while South Carolina
      is in the southeastern region.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      Virginia is positioned north of North Carolina, which itself is north of South
      Carolina. This means Virginia as a whole is north of South Carolina.


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions of the specific towns.

      is north of South Carolina, Rich Creek would be north of Cash (not south).

      - VA (Virginia) is north of SC (South Carolina)

      - This means that generally, locations in Virginia would be north of locations

      However, I need to be careful because specific towns within these states could
      have positions that don''t follow the general state positioning. For example,
      a town in southern Virginia could potentially be south of a town in northern

      Let me reason about their specific locations:


      Rich Creek, VA would be in Virginia, which borders North Carolina to its south,
      and North Carolina borders South Carolina to its south.


      So geographically:

      - Virginia is north of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is north of South Carolina


      This means that any location in Virginia would almost certainly be north of
      any location in South Carolina, because there''s an entire state (North Carolina)

      Step 2: Analyze the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located north of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is located north of South Carolina

      - Therefore, Virginia is north of South Carolina with an entire state (North
      Carolina) between them


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the cities.

      - Since Rich Creek is in Virginia, and Virginia is significantly north of South
      Carolina, Rich Creek must be north of Cash, SC

      - Even if Rich Creek were in southern Virginia and Cash were in northern South
      Carolina, Virginia is far enough north that any Virginia location would be north

      have different latitudes even if their states are generally positioned differently.
      Let me try to recall the approximate latitudes of these cities.


      Grace, ID is in southeastern Idaho, which is still fairly northern in the US.

      Lecompton, KS is in northeastern Kansas, which is in the central US.


      Based on general US geography, Grace, ID should be located north of Lecompton,
      KS, not south. So the answer should be NO.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of Grace, ID and Lecompton, KS to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Grace, ID is in southeastern Idaho

      - Lecompton, KS is in northeastern Kansas


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Idaho is located in the northwestern part of the United States

      - Kansas is located in the central part of the United States, significantly
      south of Idaho


      Step 3: Compare latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - Even though Grace is in the southern part of Idaho, Idaho as a whole is much
      further north than Kansas

      - Lecompton, being in Kansas, is at a much lower latitude (more southern) than
      cities in Idaho


      Therefore, Grace, ID is located north of Lecompton, KS, not south of it.

      United States.


      3. Moorland, KY is in Kentucky, which is south of Pennsylvania.


      4. Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is north of Kentucky. Pennsylvania borders

      5. Since Montandon is in Pennsylvania and Moorland is in Kentucky, and Pennsylvania
      is north of Kentucky, it''s likely that Montandon is north of Moorland.


      6. If Montandon is north of Moorland, then it is NOT south of Moorland.


      However, I should be careful about edge cases. Sometimes cities near state borders

      Coosada, AL is in central Alabama, likely in the southern part of the state.

      Actually, let me reconsider. While Florida is generally south of Alabama, the
      Florida panhandle extends westward along the Gulf Coast, bordering Alabama''s
      southern border. If Schall Circle is in the Florida panhandle, it''s possible

      Coosada is a town in central Alabama, in Elmore County.

      Schall Circle appears to be a location in Florida.

      to determine the geographic locations of Stantonsburg, NC (North Carolina) and
      Notasulga, AL (Alabama), and specifically their positions relative to each other
      in terms of north-south orientation.


      Step 1: First, I need to know approximately where these states are located.
      North Carolina is on the east coast, while Alabama is more inland but also in
      the southeastern US.


      Step 2: In terms of north-south positioning of the states, North Carolina is
      generally north of Alabama. North Carolina borders Virginia to the north and
      South Carolina to the south. Alabama borders Tennessee to the north and Florida
      to the south.


      Step 3: However, the question is about specific towns, not the states in general.
      I need to consider the specific locations of Stantonsburg, NC and Notasulga,
      AL.


      Step 4: Stantonsburg is in North Carolina, which is generally north of Alabama.
      But Stantonsburg could be in southern North Carolina, and Notasulga could be
      in northern Alabama.


      Usually, if we''re comparing cities from two different states where one state

      Step 1: Let''s consider the states first. North Carolina (NC) is located on

      region.


      Step 2: In terms of latitude (north-south positioning), North Carolina as a
      state is generally north of Alabama. North Carolina shares a border with Virginia
      to the north and South Carolina to the south, while Alabama borders Tennessee
      to the north and Florida to the south.


      Step 3: Since Stantonsburg is in North Carolina and Notasulga is in Alabama,
      and North Carolina is geographically north of Alabama, Stantonsburg would typically
      be north of Notasulga.


      Step 4: There could potentially be exceptions if Stantonsburg were in the extreme
      southern part of NC and Notasulga in the extreme northern part of AL, but this
      is not the case. Stantonsburg is in the eastern part of NC, and Notasulga is

      Cape May is specifically at the southern tip of New Jersey, at the Cape May
      Peninsula. It''s one of the southernmost points in New Jersey.


      Canaan is in the northwestern part of Connecticut.


      Given these geographical positions:

      - Connecticut is north of New Jersey overall

      - Canaan is in northern Connecticut

      - Cape May is at the southern tip of New Jersey


      Therefore, Canaan, CT would be north of Cape May, NJ, not south of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two locations by considering
      their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Canaan, CT is located in the northwestern part of Connecticut.

      - Cape May, NJ is located at the southern tip of New Jersey.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Connecticut is a northeastern state that sits north of most of New Jersey.

      - New Jersey extends south along the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their specific positions.

      - Canaan is in the northern portion of Connecticut.

      - Cape May is at the southernmost point of New Jersey, extending into the Delaware
      Bay.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about latitude.

      - Canaan, CT has a more northern latitude than Cape May, NJ.

      - Therefore, Canaan is located NORTH of Cape May, not south of it.

      to compare the geographical positions of Canaan, CT and Cape May, NJ, particularly
      whether Canaan is south of Cape May.


      Let me think about where these locations are:


      1. Canaan, CT is in Connecticut, which is in the northeastern United States.
      Connecticut is north of New York City.


      2. Cape May, NJ is at the southern tip of New Jersey. It''s one of the southernmost
      points in New Jersey.


      To determine if Canaan is south of Cape May, I need to compare their latitudes:


      - Connecticut is generally north of New Jersey

      - Canaan is in the northwestern part of Connecticut, near the Massachusetts
      and New York borders

      - Cape May is at the southern tip of New Jersey


      Given these facts, Canaan, CT is almost certainly north of Cape May, NJ, not
      south. Connecticut as a whole state is north of most of New Jersey, and especially
      north of Cape May which is at the southern end of New Jersey.


      So the answer is NO, Canaan, CT is not located south of Cape May, NJ. It''s
      located north of it.</think># Is Canaan, CT located south of Cape May, NJ?


      To determine this, I need to consider the geographical positions of both locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Canaan, CT is located in the northwestern corner of Connecticut.

      - Cape May, NJ is located at the southernmost tip of New Jersey.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship of these states.

      - Connecticut is a New England state that sits north of New York and New Jersey.

      - New Jersey extends south of Connecticut along the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their specific positions.

      - Canaan is in the northern part of Connecticut.

      - Cape May is at the extreme southern end of New Jersey.


      Given this north-south arrangement, Canaan, CT is positioned significantly NORTH
      of Cape May, NJ, not south of it.

      United States.

      2. Cape May, NJ is at the southern tip of New Jersey, at the point where Delaware
      Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean.


      To determine which is further south, I need to consider their latitudes:


      Connecticut is generally north of New Jersey. Connecticut borders New York to
      the south (except for Long Island) and Massachusetts to the north.


      Specifically, Canaan is in the northwestern part of Connecticut, very close
      to the Massachusetts border. This would place it quite far north in Connecticut.


      Cape May is at the southernmost point of New Jersey, making it one of the southernmost
      points in the entire state.


      Given these geographical positions, Canaan, CT would be north of Cape May, NJ
      - not south of it.
