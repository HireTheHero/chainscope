      - Fruita is in Colorado (CO)

      - Pottsboro is in Texas (TX)


      2. Let me consider their positions:

      - Colorado is north of Texas in general

      - Fruita is in western Colorado

      - Pottsboro is in northern Texas


      3. Even though Pottsboro is in northern Texas, and Fruita is in western Colorado:

      - All of Colorado is still significantly north of even the northernmost parts

      - North Carolina is north of Georgia

      - Pleasant Garden is in central North Carolina

      - Swainsboro is in eastern Georgia


      3. Since North Carolina is entirely north of Georgia, and Pleasant Garden is
      in North Carolina, it must be north of any point in Georgia, including Swainsboro.


      4. Therefore, Pleasant Garden cannot be south of Swainsboro.

      1. First, let me locate both cities:

      - Pleasant Garden is in North Carolina

      - Swainsboro is in Georgia


      2. Looking at the general geography:

      - North Carolina is north of Georgia

      - Pleasant Garden is in central North Carolina

      - Swainsboro is in central/eastern Georgia


      3. Since North Carolina is entirely north of Georgia, and both cities are in

      of Swainsboro.


      4. Therefore, Pleasant Garden is NOT south of Swainsboro.
