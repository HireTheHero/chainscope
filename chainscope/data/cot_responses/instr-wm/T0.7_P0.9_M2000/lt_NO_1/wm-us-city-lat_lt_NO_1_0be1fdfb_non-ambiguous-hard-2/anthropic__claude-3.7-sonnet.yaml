      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Lakota is in North Dakota (ND)

      - Hoback is in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - North Dakota is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada.

      - Wyoming is located south of North Dakota, with Montana in between them.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Since North Dakota is significantly north of Wyoming in the United States,
      cities in North Dakota (including Lakota) would generally be north of cities
      in Wyoming (including Hoback).

      - Therefore, Lakota, ND would be north of Hoback, WY (not south).

      - Lakota, ND is in North Dakota (ND), which is a northern state.

      - Hoback, WY is in Wyoming (WY), which is south of North Dakota.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of the states.

      - North Dakota borders Canada to the north and South Dakota to the south.

      - Wyoming is south of both North and South Dakota.


      Step 3: Determine the north-south relationship.

      - Since Lakota is in North Dakota, and Hoback is in Wyoming, and Wyoming is
      south of North Dakota, Lakota must be north of Hoback.

      - Therefore, Lakota, ND is NOT south of Hoback, WY. It is north of it.

      States.

      - Riverwood, KY is in Kentucky, which is in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - Kentucky lies south of New York.


      Step 3: Determine if the specific cities'' locations would change this general
      relationship.

      - Even accounting for specific locations within their states, cities in New
      York would generally be north of cities in Kentucky due to the significant latitude
      difference between these states.

      - Averill Park is in the eastern part of New York, but this east-west positioning
      doesn''t change its north-south relationship with Kentucky.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geographic positioning.

      - Since Averill Park is in New York (a northern state) and Riverwood is in Kentucky
      (a more southern state), Averill Park would be north of Riverwood.


      NO, Averill Park, NY is not located south of Riverwood, KY. It is located north

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Fife, WA is in Washington state (WA), which is in the northwestern United
      States.

      - Kenilworth, NJ is in New Jersey (NJ), which is on the eastern coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider their approximate latitudes.

      - Washington state is much farther north than New Jersey.

      - Cities in Washington state typically have latitudes around 45-49 degrees North.

      - Cities in New Jersey typically have latitudes around 39-41 degrees North.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since Fife is in Washington state (northwest US), and Kenilworth is in New
      Jersey (northeast US), Fife would be farther north than Kenilworth.

      - This means Fife is NOT south of Kenilworth. In fact, it''s north of Kenilworth.

      - Wisconsin is generally north of Ohio in the United States.

      - Wisconsin borders the northern states of Minnesota and Michigan, as well as
      Lake Superior.

      - Ohio is further south, bordering Kentucky and West Virginia.


      Step 3: More specifically, Wisconsin is positioned in the northern Midwest,
      while Ohio is in a more southern and eastern position.


      Step 4: Given this geographical arrangement, Mole Lake, WI would be north of
      Barberton, OH, not south of it.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two cities by comparing their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Mole Lake is in Wisconsin (WI), which is in the northern central United States.

      - Barberton is in Ohio (OH), which is in the eastern part of the Midwest.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      - Wisconsin is generally north of Ohio in the United States.

      - Wisconsin borders Lake Superior and is one of the northernmost states in the
      continental US.

      - Ohio is further south, bordering Lake Erie.


      Step 3: Compare specific locations.

      - Mole Lake, WI is in northern Wisconsin.

      - Barberton, OH is in northeastern Ohio.

      - Given Wisconsin''s position relative to Ohio, Mole Lake would be north of
      Barberton.


      NO, Mole Lake, WI is not located south of Barberton, OH. It is located north
      of Barberton.'

      Step 1: Determine the location of McLean, VA.

      McLean is in northern Virginia, near Washington D.C., in the northeastern part
      of the state.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Berry College, GA.

      Berry College is located in Rome, Georgia, which is in the northwestern part
      of Georgia.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Virginia is north of Georgia on the U.S. map. Since McLean is in northern Virginia
      and Berry College is in northwestern Georgia, McLean must be north of Berry
      College.


      Step 4: Answer the question "Is McLean, VA located south of Berry College, GA?"

      Since McLean is north of Berry College (not south), the answer is:

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Coosada is in Alabama (AL)

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Alabama is located directly north of Florida in the southeastern United States.

      - Florida extends southward from the mainland US.


      Step 3: Based on this geographical relationship:

      - Any location in Alabama would generally be north of most locations in Florida.

      - Since Coosada is in Alabama and Schall Circle is in Florida, Coosada would
