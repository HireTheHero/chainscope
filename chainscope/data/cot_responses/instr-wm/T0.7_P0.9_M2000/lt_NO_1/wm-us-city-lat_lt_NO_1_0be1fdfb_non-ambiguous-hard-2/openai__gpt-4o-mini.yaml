    2af1c737-72c5-4867-8ad6-5607b1e024c9: 'To determine whether Lakota, ND is located
      south of Hoback, WY, we need to identify the geographical locations of both
      cities.


      1. **Locate Lakota, ND**: Lakota is in North Dakota, which is in the northern
      part of the United States.


      2. **Locate Hoback, WY**: Hoback is in Wyoming, which is located to the southwest
      of North Dakota.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: North Dakota is north of Wyoming. Therefore,
      any city in North Dakota, including Lakota, would generally be located north
      of cities in Wyoming, including Hoback.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Lakota is in North Dakota and Hoback is in Wyoming,
      and North Dakota is north of Wyoming, Lakota cannot be south of Hoback.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'

      1. **Identify the location of Epworth, IA**: Epworth is a small city located
      in Dubuque County in the state of Iowa.


      2. **Identify the location of Blue Ridge Shores, VA**: Blue Ridge Shores is
      a community located in Louisa County in the state of Virginia.


      3. **Consider the relative positions**: Iowa is located to the northwest of
      Virginia. Specifically, Epworth, IA is situated in the upper Midwest region,
      while Blue Ridge Shores, VA is in the southeastern part of the United States.


      4. **Determine the north-south relationship**: Since Iowa is generally north
      of Virginia, and considering the specific locations of Epworth and Blue Ridge
      Shores, we can conclude that Epworth is actually north of Blue Ridge Shores.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Epworth, IA located south of Blue
      Ridge Shores, VA?" is **NO**.'

    5e403f3e-f852-419b-8e43-e6fd3daa44c0: 'To determine whether Stirling, NJ is located
      south of Salt Creek, CO, we need to identify the locations of both places and
      their relative positions.


      1. **Locate Stirling, NJ**: Stirling is an unincorporated community in Morris
      County, New Jersey, located in the northeastern United States.


      2. **Locate Salt Creek, CO**: Salt Creek is a small community in Colorado. Colorado
      is located in the western United States.


      3. **Determine Relative Position**: New Jersey (where Stirling is located) is
      east of Colorado (where Salt Creek is located). Therefore, Stirling is significantly
      east of Salt Creek.


      4. **North-South Positioning**: Since Stirling is east of Salt Creek, we need
      to assess their north-south positions. Generally, New Jersey is further north
      than most parts of Colorado. However, Salt Creek, being in Colorado, is located
      at a lower latitude compared to Stirling.

      in Alamance County. It is situated in the eastern part of the state.


      2. **Location of Bertram, TX**: Bertram is located in Texas, specifically in

      the northeast of Bertram, TX.


      4. **Determining "South"**: For Saxapahaw to be "south" of Bertram, it would
