    688f7aeb-d92a-4eed-b8d8-ba0b0be852c7: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate Touro College in New York

      - Touro College has multiple campuses in New York, primarily in the New York
      City area

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States


      2. Next, I need to locate Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina

      - Winston-Salem is a city in North Carolina

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern part of the United States


      3. Compare their geographical locations

      - New York is east of North Carolina

      - This means any location in New York (including Touro College) will be east
      of Winston-Salem State University


      4. Therefore, Touro College is NOT west of Winston-Salem State University


      The answer is: NO.'
