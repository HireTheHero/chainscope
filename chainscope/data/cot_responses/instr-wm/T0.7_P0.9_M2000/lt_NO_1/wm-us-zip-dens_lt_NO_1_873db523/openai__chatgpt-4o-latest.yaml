      population density, which is calculated as the number of people per square mile.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Locations

      - **95404**: Covers parts of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County. This area includes
      both urban and rural regions.

      - **95655**: Covers Mather in Sacramento County, which is a smaller community
      near Sacramento.


      ### Step 2: Compare Population and Land Area

      - **95404** is a mix of city and rural areas, meaning it has a lower average
      density compared to fully urban areas.

      - **95655** is a much smaller ZIP code centered around Mather, which has a more
      concentrated population.


      ### Step 3: Density Estimation

      - **95404** has more land area with some rural sections, leading to lower density.

      - **95655** is geographically smaller and closer to Sacramento, likely leading
      to higher density.


      ### Conclusion:

      Since **95404** has a larger area with rural sections and **95655** is a smaller,
      more compact community, **95404 is less densely populated than 95655**.

      ### Step 1: Identify the Locations

      - **ZIP code 63120** is in **St. Louis, Missouri**.

      - **ZIP code 60195** is in **Schaumburg, Illinois**, a suburb of Chicago.


      ### Step 2: Understand Population Density

      Population density is calculated as **population per square mile**.


      - **63120 (St. Louis, MO)**: This ZIP code covers a portion of north St. Louis
      and is largely residential but has some industrial areas.

      - **60195 (Schaumburg, IL)**: This ZIP code mainly covers a business district
      with office parks and commercial areas rather than dense residential neighborhoods.


      ### Step 3: Compare Population Data

      - **63120 (MO)** has a smaller land area and a moderate population, leading
      to a relatively high population density.

      - **60195 (IL)** largely comprises office spaces and business centers with fewer
      residential areas, leading to a **lower** population density.


      ### Conclusion:

      ### Step 1: Identify the locations

      - **39051** is in Mississippi.

      - **97741** is in Oregon (covers areas including Madras).


      ### Step 2: Consider general population trends

      - Mississippi has rural areas with lower population density.

      - Oregon includes both urban and rural regions, but Madras (97741) is a town
      with a moderate population.


      ### Step 3: Check population and land area

      - **39051 (Carthage, MS area)**: A rural area in central Mississippi with a
      sparse population.

      - **97741 (Madras, OR area)**: Madras is a town with a notable population, making
      it more densely populated than a rural Mississippi area.

      Since 97741 includes a town (Madras) and 39051 is a rural area in Mississippi,
      39051 is likely to be **less densely populated** than 97741.

      \ that 77204 is primarily a university ZIP code with fewer permanent residents\
      \ and more open space, while 02472 is a suburban area with dense housing and\
      \ a larger residential population, it is reasonable to conclude that **77204\
