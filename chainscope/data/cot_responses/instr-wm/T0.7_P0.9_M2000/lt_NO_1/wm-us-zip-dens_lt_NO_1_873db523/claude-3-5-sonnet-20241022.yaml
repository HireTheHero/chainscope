      - 85024 is in the northern part of Phoenix, a major metropolitan area

      - 61201 is in Rock Island, a smaller city along the Mississippi River


      3. Key facts:

      - Phoenix 85024 is a suburban area with many residential developments

      - Rock Island 61201 includes the city''s downtown and older residential areas


      4. Population density comparison:

      - Phoenix 85024 is more spread out with larger lots and some desert areas

      - Rock Island 61201 is a more compact, traditional midwestern city layout with
      denser housing


      5. Based on this analysis:

      - Rock Island 61201 has a higher population density due to its urban core nature

      - 17901 is in Pottsville, Pennsylvania


      2. Let me check population density information:

      - 92145 (San Diego) is a largely military area, containing Marine Corps Air
      Station Miramar. Much of the land is restricted military use with relatively
      sparse residential population.

      - 17901 (Pottsville) is a small but relatively dense town, serving as the county
      seat of Schuylkill County with typical small-town residential density.


      3. Comparing:

      - Military bases and restricted areas typically have very low population density

      - Small town county seats typically have moderate population density with residential
      and commercial areas


      Based on these factors, 92145 would have a lower population density due to its
      military nature and restricted areas, compared to the more traditionally populated
      small town of Pottsville.


      YES (92145, CA is less densely populated than 17901, PA)'

      2. Let me consider key facts about these areas:

      - 92145 includes MCAS Miramar (Marine Corps Air Station) in San Diego, which
      is primarily a military base with restricted access and large open spaces for
      aviation

      - 17901 is in Pottsville, which is a small but established city and the county
      seat of Schuylkill County


      3. Analyzing population density:

      - Military bases typically have very low population density due to large land
      areas used for runways, training grounds, and restricted zones

      - Pottsville (17901) is a traditional small city with typical urban/suburban
      density patterns


      4. Making the comparison:

      - MCAS Miramar area (92145) has large unpopulated areas and restricted zones

      - Pottsville (17901) has a more concentrated civilian population in a smaller
      area

      2. Let me check population density data:

      - 63120 (St. Louis) is in a historically declining urban area with many vacant
      lots and lower population density

      - 60195 (Schaumburg) is in a densely populated suburban area of Chicago with
      many office parks, shopping centers, and residential developments


      3. Looking at specific density numbers:

      - 63120 has approximately 2,000-3,000 people per square mile

      - 60195 has approximately 4,000-5,000 people per square mile

      relatively spread out population

      - 18011 (Alburtis): This is a small borough in Lehigh County, with a more concentrated

      3) 88310 is in Otero County, New Mexico, which includes part of the Tularosa
      Basin and Lincoln National Forest.

      The population density of Otero County, NM is approximately 9 people per square
      mile.


      4) Comparing the densities:

      - Lee County, KY: ~45 people/sq mile

      - Otero County, NM: ~9 people/sq mile

      - 45 is greater than 9


      5) Therefore, 40336 (KY) is MORE densely populated than 88310 (NM), not less.

    ddd0d308-152b-4544-a4a3-17be4782ff66: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let''s identify these zip codes:

      - 40336 is in Jackson County, Kentucky

      - 88310 is in Otero County, New Mexico


      2) Let''s look at the characteristics:

      - 40336 (KY) is a rural area in eastern Kentucky

      - 88310 (NM) includes Alamogordo and surrounding areas in New Mexico


      3) Comparing population density:

      - 40336 is in a very rural part of Kentucky with scattered homes

      - 88310 includes Alamogordo, which is a city of about 30,000 people


      4) Reasoning:

      - Since 88310 contains a significant city (Alamogordo), while 40336 is primarily
      rural

      - Urban/suburban areas are inherently more densely populated than rural areas


      Therefore:


      YES - 40336, KY is less densely populated than 88310, NM'

      - 77204 is primarily a university zip code (University of Houston)

      - 02472 is a residential suburban area


      3. Key considerations:

      - University zip codes often have high daytime population but lower residential
      density

      - Boston suburbs like Watertown are known for being relatively densely populated
      residential areas

      - 77204, being an institutional zip code, has fewer permanent residents

      - 02472 is a established residential neighborhood with many homes and apartments


      4. Comparing:

      - 02472 (Watertown) has more permanent residents per square mile

      - 77204 (UH) mainly consists of university buildings with temporary student
      population


      Therefore: YES, 77204 TX is less densely populated (in terms of permanent residents)

      1. Let me identify these zip codes:

      - 48202 is in Detroit, Michigan

      2. Detroit (48202) is an urban area in a major city, located near downtown Detroit

      5. While Surprise has grown significantly, it''s still characterized by suburban-style
      development with single-family homes and more spread-out development patterns.


      Based on these factors, 48202 (Detroit) would likely have a higher population

      1. First, identify the locations:

      - 48202 is in Detroit, Michigan

      2. Let''s consider the characteristics:

      - 48202 is an urban zip code in Detroit, near Wayne State University

      - 85379 is a suburban zip code in Surprise, a satellite city of Phoenix


      3. Key context:

      - Detroit zip codes, especially near downtown/universities, tend to be quite
      densely populated

      - Surprise, AZ is a more spread out suburban area with newer development


      4. Population density comparison:

      - 48202 (Detroit) has approximately 13,000 people per square mile

      - 85379 (Surprise) has approximately 2,800 people per square mile


      Based on these numbers, 48202 is actually MORE densely populated than 85379,
