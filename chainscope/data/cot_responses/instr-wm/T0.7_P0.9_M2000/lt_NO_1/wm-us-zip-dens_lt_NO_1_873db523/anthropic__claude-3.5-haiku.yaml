      - This is a rural zip code in Missouri

      - It appears to be in a sparsely populated area


      3. For 73018 (OK):

      - This is a zip code in Oklahoma

      1. First, identify the locations:

      - 11234 is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York

      - 90016 is a zip code in Los Angeles, California


      2. Consider population density characteristics:

      - Brooklyn (11234) is part of New York City, which is generally very densely
      populated

      - Los Angeles (90016) is in an urban area, but typically less dense than NYC


      3. Specific neighborhood considerations:

      - 11234 is in southeastern Brooklyn, which tends to be more residential and
      slightly less dense

      - 90016 is in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, which is a relatively dense
      urban neighborhood


      4. Compare population density:

      - Brooklyn''s overall density is around 35,000 people per square mile

      - Los Angeles''s overall density is around 8,500 people per square mile


      5. Conclusion based on data:

      - 11234 (Brooklyn) is likely more densely populated than 90016 (Los Angeles)

      1. First, let''s understand what determines population density:

      - Population density is the number of people per square mile

      - This depends on the total population and the land area of the zip code region


      2. Identify the locations:

      - 34434 is in Marion County, Florida (near Ocala)

      - 04038 is in Cumberland County, Maine (near Portland)


      3. Consider the characteristics of these regions:

      - Florida is generally more populous and has warmer weather

      - Maine is more rural and has a colder climate

      - Marion County, FL has a population of about 375,000

      - Cumberland County, ME has a population of about 290,000


      4. Consider land area:

      - Marion County, FL is larger (1,579 sq miles)

      - Cumberland County, ME is smaller (1,266 sq miles)


      5. Calculate population density:
