      north of Idaho. Therefore, most locations in Minnesota, including Star Lite
      Motel, will be north of locations in Idaho, including Anderson Ranch Dam.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Minnesota is north of Idaho, any location in Minnesota,
      including Star Lite Motel, would be north of Anderson Ranch Dam.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is **NO**, Star Lite Motel, MN is not located
      south of Anderson Ranch Dam, ID.'

      \ at a latitude of approximately 45.5\xB0 N, while Minneapolis (Big Pink) is\
      \ at a latitude of approximately 44.9\xB0 N.\n\nSince 45.5\xB0 N (Hells Canyon\
      \ Dam) is north of 44.9\xB0 N (Big Pink), we can conclude that Hells Canyon\
      \ Dam is actually north of Big Pink.\n\nThus, the answer to the question \"\

      in Annapolis, Maryland is located south of High Rock Lake in North Carolina,
      we need to consider the geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Identify the location of St. Anne''s Church**: St. Anne''s Church is located
      in Annapolis, Maryland. Annapolis is situated on the Chesapeake Bay, in the
      central part of Maryland.


      2. **Identify the location of High Rock Lake**: High Rock Lake is located in
      North Carolina, specifically in Davidson County. It is situated in the central
      part of North Carolina.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Maryland (where Annapolis is located) is generally
      north of North Carolina (where High Rock Lake is located). Therefore, Annapolis,
      Maryland, is further north than High Rock Lake, North Carolina.


      Since St. Anne''s Church is in Annapolis, Maryland, which is north of High Rock
      Lake in North Carolina, we conclude that St. Anne''s Church is not located south
      of High Rock Lake.

      4. **Determining South**: For Buckhorn Lake to be "south" of the Binoculars

      to the north of the Binoculars Building.
