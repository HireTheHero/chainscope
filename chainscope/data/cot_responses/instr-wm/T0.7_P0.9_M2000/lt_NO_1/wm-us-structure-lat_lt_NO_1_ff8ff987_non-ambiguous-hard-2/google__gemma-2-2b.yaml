      a structure is located south of a structure in another state.


      It''s a bit of a stretch, but it works.


      The structure in the other state is always north of the border, so you only
      need to compare the coordinates of the two structures.


      If the two structures are on opposite sides of the border, then the structure
      in the other state is always south of the structure in the first state.


      For example, if you want to know if a structure in California is located south
      of a structure in New York, you would need to compare the coordinates of the
      two structures.


      If the coordinates of the two structures are on opposite sides of the border,
      then the structure in California is always south of the structure in New York.


      The problem with this method is that it only works if the structures are on
      opposite sides of the border. If the structures are not on opposite sides of
      the border, then the method will not work.


      This method is a good way to determine whether a structure is located south
      of a structure in another state.

      it requires you to think about how to find the exact location of Cranberry Lake,
      NY. But it''s not impossible.


      First, let''s look at the name of the lake. Cranberry Lake, NY is a lake in
      the state of New York. It''s located in the Adirondack Mountains, which is a
      very large region of the United States.


      Now, let''s think about the other lake. Lake Centennial (Maryland), MD is a
      lake in the state of Maryland. It''s located in the Chesapeake Bay region of
      the United States.


      So, how do we know that these two lakes are in the same area?


      The answer is that they are both located in the same region of the United States.
      They are both located in the Adirondack Mountains, and they are both located
      in the Chesapeake Bay region.


      So, yes, Cranberry Lake, NY is located south of Lake Centennial (Maryland),
