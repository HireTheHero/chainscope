      I need to determine if Atwood Lake is south of Fontana Lake.


      Let me think about the general geographic locations:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the US

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast in the southeastern US


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Ohio is generally north of North Carolina

      Carolina, not south

      - Atwood Lake in Ohio is very likely north of Fontana Lake in North Carolina

      - This would mean Atwood Lake is NOT south of Fontana Lake


      I''m confident in this answer because the entire state of Ohio is generally

      North Carolina (NC) is located on the East Coast in the southeastern United

      - Without looking up the exact location, Tennessee is generally south of Maryland


      To determine north-south relationship, I need to compare their latitudes (higher
      latitude = more north, lower latitude = more south).


      Maryland is north of Tennessee on the US map. Silver Spring, MD would be in

      - AFI Silver is in Maryland (MD), which is a state in the mid-Atlantic region.

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (TN), which is in the
      southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Maryland is located significantly north of Tennessee on the US map.

      - Silver Spring, MD (where AFI Silver is located) is in the southern part of
      Maryland, near Washington DC.

      - Even the southernmost parts of Maryland are generally north of Tennessee.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on north-south positioning.

      - Since Maryland is north of Tennessee, AFI Silver (in MD) must be north of
      any location in Tennessee, including the Arnold Engineering Development Complex.

      \ the locations:\n\n1. Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Houston, Texas.\n2. West\
      \ County Energy Center is in Florida.\n\nNow I need to compare their latitudes\

      N latitude\n- Florida extending roughly from 25\xB0N to 31\xB0N latitude\n\n\
      However, I need to be more specific about these particular locations.\n\nHouston,\
      \ Texas (where Miller Outdoor Theatre is located) is at approximately 29.7\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\nI'm not completely certain of the exact location of West County\

      systematically. I need to determine the relative geographical positions of two

      1. Kewaunee Power Station in Wisconsin (WI)

      2. Chicago Avenue Pumping Station in Illinois (IL)


      I need to determine if the first location is south of the second location.


      First, let me recall the general geography. Wisconsin is a state that is north
      of Illinois. Chicago is a major city in Illinois, located in the northeastern
      part of the state along Lake Michigan.


      The Kewaunee Power Station is in Wisconsin, which suggests it''s north of Illinois.
      The Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in Illinois, likely in Chicago based on
      its name.


      Given that Wisconsin is north of Illinois, it would be highly unlikely that
      a location in Wisconsin would be south of a location in Illinois, especially
      one in Chicago which is in the northern part of Illinois.


      So, Kewaunee Power Station in WI is almost certainly north of Chicago Avenue
      Pumping Station in IL, not south of it.</think># Determining if Kewaunee Power
      Station is south of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station


      I need to compare the geographic locations of these two facilities:


      1. **Kewaunee Power Station** is located in Wisconsin (WI)

      2. **Chicago Avenue Pumping Station** is located in Illinois (IL)


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - Wisconsin is a state that lies directly **north** of Illinois

      - Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, along Lake Michigan

      - The Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, based on its name, is likely in Chicago

      - The Kewaunee Power Station is in Wisconsin, which means it must be north of
      any point in Illinois


      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois geographically, any location in
      Wisconsin (including Kewaunee Power Station) would be north of any location
      in Illinois (including Chicago Avenue Pumping Station).

      First, I need to understand the general geographic relationship between Colorado

      - Colorado is located north of Arizona in the United States

      - Colorado''s southern border touches Arizona''s northern border along with

      ## Step-by-step analysis:

      1. Crystal Creek Reservoir is located in Colorado (CO)

      3. Colorado is positioned directly north of Arizona in the United States

      4. Even accounting for potential irregular locations within each state, Colorado''s
      southern border touches Arizona''s northern border

      5. Water bodies in Colorado would therefore typically be north of water bodies
      in Arizona

      I need to check if Vernon Court, RI is located south of the Cathedral Basilica

      The United States has a general geographic layout where:

      - West coast (California) is on the left/west side

      In terms of latitude:

      - Rhode Island is in the northeastern United States

      - California is on the west coast, and San Jose is in northern California


      Typically, northeastern states like Rhode Island are at higher latitudes (more
      north) than northern California. This means Rhode Island locations are generally
      north of California locations, not south.

      States.

      - Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph is in San Jose, California (CA), which is
      on the West Coast.

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Ohio (OH) is generally north of Tennessee (TN)

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, while Tennessee is in the South


      Looking at their general locations:

      - Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north and Kentucky to the south

      - Tennessee is south of Kentucky

      - So Tennessee is definitely south of Ohio


      Since Rosary Cathedral is in Ohio (specifically Toledo, which is in the northern
      part of Ohio) and the Walking Horse Hotel is in Tennessee, the cathedral would
      be north of the hotel, not south.


      Therefore, Rosary Cathedral (Toledo, Ohio) is NOT located south of Walking Horse
      Hotel, TN. The correct answer is NO.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each location is situated.

      - Rosary Cathedral is in Toledo, Ohio (OH)

      - Walking Horse Hotel is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Ohio is a Midwestern state that borders Lake Erie to the north

      - Tennessee is a Southern state located south of Kentucky

      - Ohio is positioned north of Tennessee on the map of the United States


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Toledo is in the northern part of Ohio, near the Michigan border

      - Even without knowing the exact location of Walking Horse Hotel in Tennessee,
      any location in Tennessee would be south of Toledo, Ohio


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on north-south positioning.

      - Since Ohio is north of Tennessee, Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio must be
      north of any location in Tennessee, including the Walking Horse Hotel

      State. Albany is located in the eastern part of New York State.


      3. Society Hill Towers is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia is in
      the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      4. In terms of north-south positioning, Albany, NY is north of Philadelphia,
      PA. New York State in general is north of Pennsylvania.


      5. Therefore, the New York State Capitol (in Albany, NY) is north of Society
      Hill Towers (in Philadelphia, PA), not south of it.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - The New York State Capitol is located in Albany, which is the capital city
      of New York State.

      - Society Hill Towers is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Consider their geographic positions.

      - Albany is located in the eastern part of New York State.

      - Philadelphia is located in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - New York State is generally north of Pennsylvania.

      - More specifically, Albany, NY (where the State Capitol is) is farther north
      than Philadelphia, PA (where Society Hill Towers is).


      Therefore, the New York State Capitol is NOT south of Society Hill Towers -
      it is north of it.

      PA refers to Pennsylvania, which is a state in the northeastern United States.

      Looking at the geographic positions of these states:

      - Montana is in the northwest of the US

      - PA is Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern United States


      Now let''s consider latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Montana is generally north of Pennsylvania in the United States

      Specifically, I need to determine if the church in New York is located south

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - New York is generally north of Texas

      - The Bronx is in the southern part of New York state, but still much further
      north than Texas

      - Texas, even its northern parts, is much further south than any part of New

      - St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church is in the Bronx, which is in New York City,
      in the state of New York.

      - FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas (TX), likely in Amarillo (which has
      a known FirstBank Southwest Tower).


      Step 2: Compare the states'' positions.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - New York (including the Bronx) is significantly farther north than Texas.

      - Even the southernmost parts of New York state are still north of the northernmost
      parts of Texas.


      Therefore, St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church in the Bronx, NY is NOT south of
      FirstBank Southwest Tower in TX. It is north of it.

      To answer this, I need to consider the general north-south positioning of New
      York state relative to Missouri state, since these bodies of water are in different
      states.


      New York state is in the northeastern United States, while Missouri is in the
      central/midwestern United States.


      Generally speaking:

      - New York is farther north than Missouri

      - Missouri is farther south than New York


      Therefore, a body of water in New York (Rondout Reservoir) would typically be
      located north of a body of water in Missouri (Smithville Lake), not south of
      it.

      - Smithville Lake is in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Missouri is located in the central/midwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - New York is generally farther north in the United States

      - Missouri is located farther south than New York


      Step 4: Apply this knowledge to the specific water bodies.

      I need to determine if Lake Rescue is south of the Basilica.


      Let me think about the general geography of Vermont and New York:


      Vermont is a state in the northeastern United States, bordered by New York to
      the west, Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, and the Canadian
      province of Quebec to the north.


      New York is a state in the northeastern United States, with Vermont to its east.


      Now, Southampton is located on Long Island, which is in the southeastern part
      of New York state. Long Island extends eastward from New York City into the
      Atlantic Ocean.


      Vermont is located north of most of New York state, but Long Island (where Southampton
      is located) extends quite far to the east and south of the main part of New
      York state.


      So generally speaking, Vermont is north of Long Island.


      Lake Rescue is in Vermont, so it''s likely north of Southampton, New York (which
      is on Long Island). This means Lake Rescue is NOT south of the Basilica.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lake Rescue is in Vermont (VT)

      - Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary is in Southampton, New York
      (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Vermont is in the northeastern United States, while New York is directly to
      its west. However, the location within New York is important here.


      Step 3: Determine where Southampton is within New York.

      Southampton is located on the eastern end of Long Island, which extends eastward
      from New York City into the Atlantic Ocean. Long Island represents the southernmost
      portion of New York state.


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes.

      Vermont is entirely north of Long Island. Even the southernmost parts of Vermont
      are north of Southampton, NY. Lake Rescue, being in Vermont, must therefore
      be north of the Basilica in Southampton.


      NO - Lake Rescue (Vermont) is NOT located south of the Basilica of the Sacred

      (NY)


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to think about their geographical
      positions.


      Vermont (VT) is a state in the northeastern United States, bordering Canada
      to the north. It''s generally north of New York state.


      Southampton, New York is located on Long Island, which extends east from New

      Generally speaking:

      - Vermont is north of most of New York state

      - Southampton is in the southern portion of New York state on Long Island


      Therefore, Lake Rescue in Vermont would most likely be north of the Basilica

      ## Step 2: Consider state positions

      - Vermont is located in the northeastern United States

      - Vermont is positioned north of New York State

      - Southampton is located on Long Island

      - Long Island extends eastward from New York City along the southern portion
      of New York State

      - Southampton is in the southeastern part of New York State


      ## Step 4: Compare latitudes

      - Vermont locations, including Lake Rescue, are generally at higher latitudes
      (more northerly) than locations on Long Island

      - Southampton, being on Long Island, is one of the more southerly points in
      New York State

      - Southampton is located on Long Island, which extends east from New York City
      and is in the southeastern part of New York state


      Given that Southampton is on Long Island in the southeastern part of New York,
      and Vermont is generally north of most of New York state, it''s very likely
      that Lake Rescue in Vermont is NORTH of the Basilica in Southampton, not south.


      So the answer would be NO, Lake Rescue is not south of the Basilica. But let
      me double-check my geographical understanding...

      - Vermont is located in northern New England.

      - Southampton is on the eastern end of Long Island, which extends east from
      New York City in the southeastern part of New York state.

      - Long Island is south of Connecticut, which is south of Massachusetts, which

      Generally speaking:

      - Vermont is located in northern New England

      - Southampton is located on Long Island, which extends east from New York City


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Vermont is typically north of Long Island

      - Long Island, including Southampton, is south of Vermont


      Therefore, Lake Rescue in Vermont would be NORTH of the Basilica in Southampton,
      NY, not south of it.


      So the answer should be NO, Lake Rescue is not located south of the Basilica.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations
      by examining their general geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Lake Rescue is in Vermont (VT), which is in the northeastern United States

      - The Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary is in Southampton, New
      York (NY), which is located on Long Island


      Step 2: Consider the general geography

      - Vermont is a northern New England state, bordering Canada

      - Southampton is on the eastern end of Long Island, which extends east from
      New York City


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      - Vermont is positioned significantly further north in the United States compared
      to Long Island

      - Long Island, including Southampton, lies well south of the entire state of
      Vermont

      - Lake Rescue, being in Vermont, would therefore be north of the Basilica in
      Southampton

      2. Corpus Christi is a city located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern
      part of the state.


      Given these general locations, Lake Alan Henry should be north of Corpus Christi,
      not south. The Panhandle and Lubbock areas are definitely north of Corpus Christi.


      Therefore, Lake Alan Henry is NOT south of Corpus Christi Cathedral.</think>#
      Is Lake Alan Henry, TX located south of Corpus Christi Cathedral (Corpus Christi,
      Texas), TX?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the locations of both places in Texas.


      2) Lake Alan Henry is a reservoir located in the Texas Panhandle-South Plains
      region, near Lubbock in northwest Texas.


      3) Corpus Christi Cathedral is located in Corpus Christi, which is on the Gulf
      Coast in southern Texas.


      4) When comparing the geographic positions, the Texas Panhandle and Lubbock
      region are in the northern part of Texas, while Corpus Christi is in the southern
      part of the state.


      5) Something in northern Texas cannot be south of something in southern Texas.


      6) Therefore, Lake Alan Henry is north of Corpus Christi Cathedral, not south
      of it.

      Let me think about the locations:


      1. Lake Alan Henry is a reservoir located in the Texas Panhandle region, near
      Lubbock in northwest Texas.


      2. Corpus Christi Cathedral is located in Corpus Christi, Texas, which is on
      the Gulf Coast of Texas in the southern part of the state.


      In terms of north-south positioning in Texas:

      - The Texas Panhandle and Lubbock area is in the northern part of Texas

      - Corpus Christi is in the southern part of Texas, close to the Gulf of Mexico

      it. The answer would be NO.</think># Step-by-Step Analysis


      To determine if Lake Alan Henry is south of Corpus Christi Cathedral, I need
      to locate both places geographically within Texas.


      ## Step 1: Locate Lake Alan Henry

      Lake Alan Henry is a reservoir located in Northwest Texas, primarily in Garza
      County with portions in Kent County. It''s in the vicinity of Lubbock in the
      Texas Panhandle region.


      ## Step 2: Locate Corpus Christi Cathedral

      Corpus Christi Cathedral is located in Corpus Christi, Texas, which sits on
      the Gulf Coast in the southern part of Texas.


      ## Step 3: Compare North-South Positions

      When looking at a map of Texas:

      - The Lubbock/Garza County area (where Lake Alan Henry is) is in the northern
      half of Texas

      - Corpus Christi is much further south, near the Gulf of Mexico in South Texas


      ## Conclusion

      Lake Alan Henry is located NORTH of Corpus Christi Cathedral, not south of it.

      Let me check more precisely. Minnesota borders Canada to the north and its southern

      south.


      So generally, a location in Minnesota would be north of a location in Indiana,

      - St. Matthew Cathedral is in South Bend, Indiana (IN)

      - Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, significantly south of Minnesota


      ## Step 2: Consider state positions

      Minnesota is entirely north of Indiana on the map of the United States. The
      southernmost points of Minnesota are still generally north of the northernmost
      points of Indiana.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations

      South Bend is in northern Indiana, but even this northern Indiana location would
      still be south of locations in Minnesota, including Lac qui Parle County/area.

      First, let me recall where these reservoirs are located:


      Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack Mountains in Herkimer County,
      NY, which is in the northern part of New York State.


      Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, which is in the Hudson Valley region
      of New York State, closer to New York City and in the southeastern part of the
      state.


      Geographically speaking, locations that are in northern New York (like the Adirondacks)
      are north of locations in southeastern New York (like Dutchess County).


      Therefore, Stillwater Reservoir is north of Beacon Reservoir, not south of it.</think>I''ll
      think step by step about the locations of these two reservoirs in New York.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both reservoirs.

      - Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack region in northern New York
      (specifically in Herkimer County).

      - Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County, which is in the Hudson Valley
      region in southeastern New York.


      Step 2: Compare their north-south positions.

      - The Adirondack region is in the northern part of New York state.

      - Dutchess County and the Hudson Valley are considerably further south in New
      York state.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      - Since Stillwater Reservoir is in the northern Adirondack region, and Beacon
      Reservoir is in the southeastern part of the state, Stillwater Reservoir is
      located NORTH of Beacon Reservoir, not south.


      NO, Stillwater Reservoir is not located south of Beacon Reservoir.'

      Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack region of New York State,
      specifically in Herkimer County in the north-central part of the state.


      Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County, which is in the Hudson Valley
      region of New York State, in the southeastern part of the state.


      In terms of north-south positioning in New York State:

      - The Adirondack region (where Stillwater Reservoir is) is in the northern part
      of the state

      - The Hudson Valley/Dutchess County region (where Beacon Reservoir is) is in
      the southern part of the state


      Therefore, Stillwater Reservoir is north of Beacon Reservoir, not south of it.</think>#
      Is Stillwater Reservoir, NY located south of Beacon Reservoir (Dutchess County,
      New York), NY?


      Let me determine the relative locations of these two reservoirs in New York
      state:


      1) Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack region of New York, specifically
      in Herkimer County in the north-central part of the state.


      2) Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County, which is in the Hudson Valley
      region in the southeastern part of New York state.


      3) Geographically, the Adirondack region (containing Stillwater Reservoir) is
      significantly north of the Hudson Valley region (containing Beacon Reservoir).


      Therefore, Stillwater Reservoir is positioned north of Beacon Reservoir, not
      south of it.


      NO'

      to determine the locations of Stillwater Reservoir and Beacon Reservoir in New
      York state, and then compare their positions to see which one is farther north.


      First, let me consider what I know about these locations:


      Stillwater Reservoir is in New York state. I believe it''s located in the Adirondack
      region in northern New York.


      Beacon Reservoir is specified as being in Dutchess County, New York. Dutchess
      County is in the Hudson Valley region of New York, in the southeastern part
      of the state.


      Based on my knowledge of New York geography:

      - The Adirondacks are in northern New York

      - Dutchess County is in southeastern New York, in the Hudson Valley region


      Given these general locations, Stillwater Reservoir in the Adirondacks would
      be NORTH of Beacon Reservoir in Dutchess County.


      So the answer to "Is Stillwater Reservoir, NY located south of Beacon Reservoir?"
      would be "NO" - it''s actually located north of Beacon Reservoir.</think># Is
      Stillwater Reservoir, NY located south of Beacon Reservoir (Dutchess County,
      New York), NY?


      Let me determine the geographic locations of these two reservoirs:


      1) Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack region in northern New
      York state, specifically in Herkimer and Lewis counties.


      2) Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County, which is in the Hudson Valley
      region in southeastern New York state.


      3) Geographically, the Adirondack region (where Stillwater Reservoir is) is
      significantly north of the Hudson Valley region (where Beacon Reservoir is).


      Therefore, Stillwater Reservoir is located NORTH of Beacon Reservoir, not south
      of it.

      To answer this, I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations
      on a north-south axis.


      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - California is on the west coast of the US

      - Arizona is inland, east of California

      - In general, California extends further north and south than Arizona


      But that general knowledge isn''t enough to determine the specific north-south

      Twitchell Reservoir is in California, but California is a large state that spans
      a significant north-south distance. Similarly, Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona,
      but I need to know specifically where in Arizona.


      Twitchell Reservoir is located in San Luis Obispo County in central California.

      Parker Canyon Lake is located in southern Arizona, near the US-Mexico border.


      Given their locations:

      - Therefore, Twitchell Reservoir would be north of Parker Canyon Lake</think>I
      need to determine the north-south relationship between Twitchell Reservoir in

      - Twitchell Reservoir is located in San Luis Obispo County in central California.

      - Parker Canyon Lake is located in southern Arizona, very close to the US-Mexico
      border.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Central California (where Twitchell Reservoir is) is at a higher latitude
      than southern Arizona.

      - Southern Arizona (where Parker Canyon Lake is) is at a lower latitude, near
      the Mexican border.


      Step 3: Determine north-south relationship.

      - Places with higher latitudes are further north.

      - Places with lower latitudes are further south.

      - Since Twitchell Reservoir is in central California, it is north of Parker
      Canyon Lake which is in southern Arizona near the Mexican border.

      Is Twitchell Reservoir, CA located south of Parker Canyon Lake, AZ?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the locations of both water bodies.


      2) Twitchell Reservoir is located in San Luis Obispo County in central California,
      roughly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles.


      3) Parker Canyon Lake is located in southern Arizona, very close to the Mexican
      border in Cochise County.


      4) Comparing their latitudes: Central California (where Twitchell Reservoir
      is) sits at a higher latitude (more northerly) than the Arizona-Mexico border
      region where Parker Canyon Lake is located.


      5) Since Parker Canyon Lake is closer to the Mexican border in southern Arizona,
      it is further south than Twitchell Reservoir in central California.


      NO - Twitchell Reservoir is NOT located south of Parker Canyon Lake. It is located
      to the north.'

      Pennsylvania is generally north of West Virginia, as WV borders the southern
      part of PA. This gives us an initial indication, but I should double-check the
      specific locations of these water bodies since they could be near the border.


      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Centre County, Pennsylvania, which is in
      the central part of the state.


      R. D. Bailey Lake is in Wyoming and Mingo Counties in West Virginia, in the
      southern part of that state.


      Given the general geography:

      - Pennsylvania is north of West Virginia

      - Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in central PA

      - R. D. Bailey Lake is in southern WV

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

      - Pennsylvania is located north of West Virginia on the map.

      - Central Pennsylvania is definitely north of southern West Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Given that Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in central PA, and R. D. Bailey

      I need to determine if the first is located south of the second.


      Let me think about the geography of Pennsylvania and West Virginia:

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of West Virginia

      - PA shares its southern border with parts of WV

      - WV is southwest of PA


      Given this general knowledge, a reservoir in PA would typically be north of

      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Centre County, Pennsylvania, in the central

      R. D. Bailey Lake is in Wyoming and Mingo Counties in southern West Virginia.


      Since Pennsylvania is north of West Virginia, and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir

      Let me determine the relative locations of these two bodies of water by analyzing

      First, looking at the states themselves:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located north of West Virginia (WV)

      - Pennsylvania shares its southern border with northern West Virginia


      Now for the specific locations:

      - Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Centre County, in central Pennsylvania

      - R. D. Bailey Lake is in Wyoming and Mingo Counties in southern West Virginia


      Since Pennsylvania is positioned north of West Virginia on the map, and Foster
      Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in central Pennsylvania while R. D. Bailey Lake is
      in southern West Virginia, it follows that Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir would
      be positioned to the north of R. D. Bailey Lake, not to the south.

      To solve this, I need to figure out the relative positions of these two bodies
      of water. Let me think about the general geography of Pennsylvania (PA) and
      West Virginia (WV).


      Pennsylvania is generally north of West Virginia. PA borders WV on WV''s northern
      border. However, I need to be more specific about these two particular lakes.


      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania. Without knowing its exact
      location within PA, I would generally expect it to be north of anything in West
      Virginia.


      R.D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia. Without knowing its exact location within
      WV, I would generally expect it to be south of anything in Pennsylvania.


      Based on the general geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and West Virginia,
      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir in PA would likely be north of R.D. Bailey Lake
      in WV, not south of it.


      So the answer is likely NO, Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, PA is not located
      south of R.D. Bailey Lake, WV. But I need to be careful here without knowing
      their exact locations within their respective states.</think># Is Foster Joseph

      To determine this, I need to consider the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania
      and West Virginia.


      Pennsylvania is located north of West Virginia in the United States. West Virginia
      borders Pennsylvania along Pennsylvania''s southern border.


      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA), while R. D. Bailey Lake
      is in West Virginia (WV).


      Given that Pennsylvania is generally north of West Virginia, a body of water
      in Pennsylvania would typically be north of a body of water in West Virginia,
      not south of it.


      Therefore, Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir in Pennsylvania would be north of
      R. D. Bailey Lake in West Virginia.

      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is located in Centre County, Pennsylvania. This
      is in central Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Next, I need to locate R. D. Bailey Lake in West Virginia.

      R. D. Bailey Lake is in Wyoming and Mingo Counties, West Virginia. This is in

      Pennsylvania is generally north of West Virginia. Central Pennsylvania would
      be north of southern West Virginia.


      West Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, and southern West Virginia is even further
      south. So R. D. Bailey Lake in southern West Virginia should be south of Foster

      Since Cranberry Lake is in NY, and Lake Centennial is in Maryland, the most
      likely answer is that Cranberry Lake is north of Lake Centennial, not south
      of it.


      So to answer the question "Is Cranberry Lake, NY located south of Lake Centennial,
      Maryland?", the answer would be NO - Cranberry Lake would be north of Lake Centennial,
      not south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two lakes based on their locations in their respective states.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic positions of the states.

      New York state is located in the northeastern United States.

      Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region, south of New York.


      Step 2: Analyze the north-south relationship.

      Any location in New York state would be north of any location in Maryland, because
      New York as a whole is positioned north of Maryland on the map.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific lakes.

      Since Cranberry Lake is in New York, and Lake Centennial is in Maryland, Cranberry
      Lake must be north of Lake Centennial.


      Therefore, Cranberry Lake, NY is NOT located south of Lake Centennial, MD.

      - Maryland is south of New York


      Therefore, generally speaking, locations in New York would be north of locations
      in Maryland. Cranberry Lake, being in New York, would typically be north of

      Centennial, MD. It would be located north of it, following the general geographic
      relationship between the two states.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of Cranberry Lake, NY and Lake Centennial, MD.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these lakes are located.

      - Cranberry Lake is in New York (NY)

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region, south of New York


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific lakes.

      - Since New York is north of Maryland, lakes in New York would generally be
      north of lakes in Maryland

      - Cranberry Lake (NY) would therefore be north of Lake Centennial (MD)

      - This means Cranberry Lake is NOT south of Lake Centennial

      the geographical relationship between two locations:

      1. Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville, New York (NY)

      2. Robert S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma (OK)


      I need to determine if the church is south of the reservoir. Let''s think about
      the general geography of the United States:


      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central part of the United States


      In terms of latitude:

      - New York is generally further north than Oklahoma

      - This means locations in New York are typically north of locations in Oklahoma,
      not south


      Since Bronxville is in New York (northeast US) and the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir
      is in Oklahoma (south-central US), it''s very likely that the Church of St.
      Joseph is NORTH of the reservoir, not south.


      Therefore, the answer should be NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative geographic positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Church of St. Joseph is in Bronxville, New York (NY), which is in the northeastern
      United States.

      - Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is in Oklahoma (OK), which is in the south-central
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - New York is significantly further north in latitude compared to Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma lies well south of New York on a map of the United States.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Bronxville, being in New York, is in the northern part of the United States.

      - Any location in Oklahoma, including Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, would be south
      of Bronxville.


      Therefore, the Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville, NY is NORTH of the Robert
      S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma, not south of it.

      I need to consider the general geography of these states.


      Pennsylvania (PA) is a northern state in the eastern United States, while Alabama
      (AL) is a southern state. Based on the general locations of these states:

      - Pennsylvania is located much further north than Alabama

      - Alabama is in the deep south of the United States

      - Pennsylvania borders New York and the Great Lakes region to the north


      Since Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania and Lewis Smith Lake is in
      Alabama, it''s almost certainly the case that Youghiogheny River Lake is located
      NORTH of Lewis Smith Lake, not south of it.

      - Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Pennsylvania is considerably north of Alabama on the map

      - All of Pennsylvania is north of all of Alabama


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the lakes.

      Since Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is entirely
      north of Alabama (where Lewis Smith Lake is located), Youghiogheny River Lake
      must be north of Lewis Smith Lake.


      NO, Youghiogheny River Lake, PA is not located south of Lewis Smith Lake, AL.'

      Then I need to compare their latitudes to determine which one is further south.


      Let me think about where these lakes are located:


      Lake Monroe is in Indiana (IN), which is in the Midwestern United States. Indiana
      is north of Texas in terms of latitude.


      Mountain Creek Lake is in Texas (TX), which is in the Southern United States.
      Texas is south of Indiana.


      Generally speaking, locations in Texas are going to be further south than locations
      in Indiana because Texas is a southern state while Indiana is a northern/midwestern
      state.


      So based on the general geographic locations of these states, Lake Monroe in
      Indiana would be NORTH of Mountain Creek Lake in Texas, not south of it.</think>#
      Is Lake Monroe (Indiana) located south of Mountain Creek Lake (Texas)?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two lakes by
      comparing their locations.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' locations

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - Generally, Indiana is significantly north of Texas


      ## Step 2: Compare geographic positions

      - Lake Monroe is in south-central Indiana

      - Mountain Creek Lake is in north-central Texas

      - Even though Lake Monroe is in southern Indiana, and Mountain Creek Lake is
      in northern Texas, the entire state of Indiana lies north of most of Texas


      ## Step 3: Conclusion based on geography

      Since Indiana is a northern state compared to Texas, Lake Monroe must be north
      of Mountain Creek Lake, not south of it.

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      1. Lake Icaria is in Iowa (IA), which is a state in the Midwest/northern United

      - Since Iowa is north of Tennessee, Lake Icaria (in Iowa) must be north of Nashville
      Municipal Auditorium (in Tennessee)

      - Therefore, Lake Icaria is NOT south of Nashville Municipal Auditorium

      to determine the relative positions of Lake Icaria, Iowa (IA) and Nashville
      Municipal Auditorium, Tennessee (TN).


      Step 1: Let me identify where Lake Icaria, IA is located.

      Lake Icaria is in Iowa, which is in the midwestern United States. Iowa is north
      of Tennessee.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Nashville Municipal Auditorium, TN is located.

      Nashville is the capital city of Tennessee, which is in the southeastern United
      States. Tennessee is south of Iowa.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Since Iowa is north of Tennessee, and Lake Icaria is in Iowa, while Nashville
      Municipal Auditorium is in Tennessee, Lake Icaria must be north of Nashville
      Municipal Auditorium.


      If the question asks "Is Lake Icaria, IA located south of Nashville Municipal
      Auditorium, TN?", then the answer would be NO, because Lake Icaria is north
      of Nashville Municipal Auditorium, not south.</think>I''ll solve this step by
      step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Lake Icaria is in Iowa (IA), which is a midwestern state.

      - Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville, Tennessee (TN), which is in
      the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Iowa is located in the northern part of the United States.

      - Tennessee is located significantly south of Iowa.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Iowa is positioned entirely north of Tennessee on a map.

      - Any location in Iowa (including Lake Icaria) would be north of locations in
      Tennessee (including Nashville Municipal Auditorium).


      Step 4: Draw conclusion.

      - Since Lake Icaria is in Iowa (north) and Nashville Municipal Auditorium is
      in Tennessee (south), Lake Icaria cannot be south of Nashville Municipal Auditorium.

      \ (OK), which is in the central part of the United States.\n\nGenerally, Washington\
      \ DC is east of Oklahoma. But the question is asking specifically about north-south\
      \ positioning (is DC south of Oklahoma?).\n\nWashington DC is roughly at about\
      \ 38.9\xB0 N latitude.\nOklahoma is generally between about 33.6\xB0 N and 37\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n\nSo DC is actually north of Oklahoma. But I need to verify Oologah\
      \ Lake specifically, as it might be in the northern part of Oklahoma.\n\nOologah\
      \ Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma, so it would be in the northern part of the\

      \ still place Washington DC (38.9\xB0 N) north of Oologah Lake (approx 36.5\xB0\
      \ N).\n\nSo the House of the Temple in DC would be NORTH of Oologah Lake, not\
      \ south of it.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine the relative\
      \ north-south positions of these two landmarks, I need to identify their locations\
      \ and compare their latitudes.\n\n1) **House of the Temple**: Located in Washington,\
      \ DC on the east coast of the United States. Washington DC is situated at approximately\
      \ 38.9\xB0 N latitude.\n\n2) **Oologah Lake**: Located in northeastern Oklahoma\
      \ in the central United States. Oologah Lake is situated at approximately 36.4\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n\n3) **Comparing latitudes**: Since Washington DC (38.9\xB0 N)\
      \ is at a higher latitude than Oologah Lake (36.4\xB0 N), and higher latitude\
      \ in the northern hemisphere means further north, the House of the Temple is\

      1. Lost Creek Lake, OR (in Oregon)

      2. Navajo Generating Station, AZ (in Arizona)


      And then determine if Lost Creek Lake is south of Navajo Generating Station.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of Oregon and Arizona:

      - Oregon is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States

      - Arizona is a state in the Southwestern United States

      - Generally speaking, Oregon is north of Arizona


      Since Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, and Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona,
      it''s likely that Lost Creek Lake is north of the Navajo Generating Station,
      not south of it.


      However, I should be careful because the question is specifically about whether
      Lost Creek Lake is south of Navajo Generating Station, not whether Oregon is
      south of Arizona. It''s possible (though unlikely) that Lost Creek Lake is in
      the very southern part of Oregon and the Navajo Generating Station is in the
      very northern part of Arizona.

      of Arizona. So Lost Creek Lake, OR is almost certainly north of, not south of,
      Navajo Generating Station, AZ.</think># Is Lost Creek Lake, OR located south
      of Navajo Generating Station, AZ?

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      - Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona (AZ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Oregon is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States

      - Arizona is located in the Southwestern United States

      - Oregon is entirely north of Arizona on the map


      ## Step 3: Make the determination

      Since Oregon is geographically north of Arizona, and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon
      while Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona, Lost Creek Lake must be north
      of (not south of) the Navajo Generating Station.

      positions of Iowa and Kansas.


      Iowa is a state in the Midwest region of the United States. It''s located north

      1. St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis, MD

      2. High Rock Lake in North Carolina


      Maryland is generally north of North Carolina on the US East Coast. Annapolis
      is in central Maryland, on the Chesapeake Bay. North Carolina is south of Maryland.


      Since Maryland is north of North Carolina, and Annapolis is in Maryland while
      High Rock Lake is in North Carolina, St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis would be
      north of High Rock Lake, not south of it.


      So my answer will be NO - St. Anne''s Church is not south of High Rock Lake;
      it''s north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      geographical positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - St. Anne''s Church is in Annapolis, Maryland (MD)

      - High Rock Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - On the US East Coast, Maryland is located north of North Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Annapolis is the capital of Maryland, located in the central part of the state

      - High Rock Lake is in North Carolina, but its specific location doesn''t change
      the fact that North Carolina as a whole is south of Maryland


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Maryland is entirely north of North Carolina, any location in Maryland
      (including St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis) must be north of any location in
      North Carolina (including High Rock Lake)

      - Therefore, St. Anne''s Church cannot be south of High Rock Lake

      1. St. Anne''s Church is in Annapolis, Maryland (MD).

      2. High Rock Lake is in North Carolina (NC).


      To determine which is further south, I need to know their approximate latitudes:


      - Maryland is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

      - North Carolina is a state in the Southeastern United States.


      Geographically, North Carolina is located south of Maryland. States generally
      arranged from north to south in this region are:

      - Pennsylvania

      - Maryland

      - Virginia

      - North Carolina

      - South Carolina

      - Georgia

      - Florida


      Since Annapolis is in Maryland and High Rock Lake is in North Carolina, and
      North Carolina is south of Maryland, St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis, Maryland
      would be NORTH of High Rock Lake, North Carolina.


      So the answer would be NO - St. Anne''s Church is not located south of High
      Rock Lake.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Maryland is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, while North
      Carolina is in the Southeastern region.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Maryland is positioned north of North
      Carolina. The states in order from north to south would be Maryland, then Virginia,
      then North Carolina.


      Step 4: Since Annapolis is in Maryland and High Rock Lake is in North Carolina,
      St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis must be north of High Rock Lake.

      Maryland (MD) is a Mid-Atlantic state, while North Carolina (NC) is a Southeastern
      state. Generally, Maryland lies north of North Carolina on the U.S. East Coast.


      Step 2: Locate the specific places.

      St. Anne''s Church is in Annapolis, Maryland, which is the state capital located
      on the Chesapeake Bay.

      High Rock Lake is in North Carolina, in the central part of the state.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Annapolis, Maryland is entirely north of North Carolina, St. Anne''s Church
      must be north of High Rock Lake.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      If St. Anne''s Church is north of High Rock Lake, then it cannot be south of

      determine the relative locations of:

      1. Church of the Guardian Angel in Manhattan, NY

      2. Badin Lake, NC


      First, let''s establish their approximate locations:


      Church of the Guardian Angel (Manhattan, NY) would be in New York City, specifically
      on the island of Manhattan. Manhattan is located in the northeastern United
      States.


      Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC), which is a state on the east coast of
      the United States, but south of New York.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - New York is further north than North Carolina

      - Therefore, Manhattan (being in NY) is north of any location in North Carolina

      - Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina, it must be south of Manhattan

      - If Badin Lake is south of Manhattan, then the Church of the Guardian Angel
      in Manhattan must be north of Badin Lake

      NY located south of Badin Lake, NC?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Church of the Guardian Angel is in Manhattan, which is part of New York City
      in New York state.


      2) Badin Lake is located in North Carolina.


      3) Geographically, New York state is in the northeastern United States, while
      North Carolina is in the southeastern United States.


      4) Looking at their positions on a map, New York is significantly north of North
      Carolina.


      5) Therefore, Manhattan (being in New York) is north of any location in North
      Carolina, including Badin Lake.


      6) If Manhattan is north of Badin Lake, then the Church of the Guardian Angel
      in Manhattan cannot be south of Badin Lake.

      to determine the locations of Truman Reservoir, Missouri and Lake Martin, Alabama,
      and then compare their north-south positions.


      Truman Reservoir (also called Truman Lake) is in Missouri (MO). Missouri is
      in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Lake Martin is in Alabama (AL). Alabama is in the southeastern United States.


      Let me think about their relative positions on a north-south axis. I need to
      determine which is further north or south.


      Missouri is generally north of Alabama. Missouri borders Iowa to the north and
      Arkansas to the south, while Alabama is much further south, bordering Tennessee
      to the north and Florida to the south.


      Since Truman Reservoir is in Missouri, and Lake Martin is in Alabama, and Missouri
      is north of Alabama, Truman Reservoir would be north of Lake Martin.


      So to the question "Is Truman Reservoir, MO located south of Lake Martin, AL?"
      the answer would be NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative north-south positions of these two bodies of water.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Truman Reservoir is located in Missouri (MO)

      - Lake Martin is located in Alabama (AL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Missouri is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Missouri is generally positioned north of Alabama on the map

      - Missouri borders Iowa to the north and Arkansas to the south

      - Alabama borders Tennessee to the north and the Gulf of Mexico/Florida to the
      south


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Since Missouri is geographically north of Alabama, Truman Reservoir (in Missouri)
      would be north of Lake Martin (in Alabama), not south of it.

    75f4bf2b-f758-43b4-b730-afe1d34d265e: '<think>I need to determine the locations
      of Boldt Castle, NY and Allegheny Reservoir, PA, and then compare their relative
      north-south positions.


      First, let me identify where Boldt Castle is located:

      - Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the St. Lawrence River in New York
      State

      - It''s near Alexandria Bay in the Thousand Islands region

      - This puts it in northern New York, close to the Canadian border


      Next, let me identify where Allegheny Reservoir is located:

      - Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua Dam) is located on the Allegheny River

      - It spans the border between northwestern Pennsylvania and southwestern New
      York

      - It''s in the Allegheny National Forest area


      Now I need to compare their north-south positions:

      - Northern New York (where Boldt Castle is) is generally north of northwestern
      Pennsylvania (where Allegheny Reservoir is)

      - The Thousand Islands region is at the far northern edge of New York State

      - The Allegheny Reservoir is more southerly, in the northern part of Pennsylvania


      Based on their geographic locations, Boldt Castle in NY is north of Allegheny
      Reservoir in PA, not south.</think># Is Boldt Castle, NY located south of Allegheny
      Reservoir, PA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both
      landmarks and compare their positions along a north-south axis.


      ## Step 1: Locate Boldt Castle, NY

      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the St. Lawrence River in the Thousand
      Islands region of northern New York, near Alexandria Bay. This places it very
      close to the Canadian border in the northernmost part of New York State.


      ## Step 2: Locate Allegheny Reservoir, PA

      The Allegheny Reservoir (also known as Kinzua Dam) is located on the Allegheny
      River in northwestern Pennsylvania, extending slightly into southwestern New
      York State. It''s situated in the Allegheny National Forest area.


      ## Step 3: Compare north-south positions

      When comparing these locations on a north-south axis:

      - Boldt Castle is in far northern New York near the Canadian border

      - Allegheny Reservoir is in northern Pennsylvania, but still south of Boldt
      Castle''s position


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Boldt Castle is NOT south of Allegheny Reservoir. It is actually north
      of it.'

      So Boldt Castle should be north of the Allegheny Reservoir, not south of it.</think>#
      Is Boldt Castle, NY located south of Allegheny Reservoir, PA?


      I''ll reason through this step-by-step:


      1) Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the St. Lawrence River in the
      Thousand Islands region of northern New York, very close to the Canadian border.


      2) The Allegheny Reservoir (also known as Kinzua Reservoir) is located in northwestern

      to determine the locations of both Boldt Castle, NY and Allegheny Reservoir,
      PA, and then compare their north-south positions.


      Step 1: Locate Boldt Castle, NY.

      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the Saint Lawrence River in New York
      state. It''s in the Thousand Islands region, near Alexandria Bay, NY. This puts
      it in the northern part of New York state, close to the Canadian border.

      ## Step 2: Locate Allegheny Reservoir, PA

      The Allegheny Reservoir (also known as Kinzua Reservoir) is located in northwestern
      Pennsylvania, along the Allegheny River near the New York state border.


      ## Step 3: Compare north-south positions

      Northern New York state is geographically north of northwestern Pennsylvania.
      Boldt Castle is close to the Canadian border in one of the northernmost parts

      Step 1: Determine where Boldt Castle is located in New York.

      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the St. Lawrence River, near Alexandria
      Bay in upstate New York. This is in the Thousand Islands region, very far north
      in New York State, close to the Canadian border.


      Step 2: Determine where Allegheny Reservoir is located in Pennsylvania.

      The Allegheny Reservoir (also known as Kinzua Dam) is located in northwestern

    1d0bb8d1-c168-4008-a500-2c0ab5d548c8: '<think>Let me solve this step by step:


      1) I need to determine the locations of Nichols Hall, KS and Lake Wappapello,
      MO.


      2) Kansas (KS) is a state that is generally west of Missouri (MO). Kansas is
      primarily to the west of Missouri, though some parts of Kansas are also north
      of parts of Missouri.


      3) Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri. It''s in Wayne County in the
      southeastern part of the state.


      4) Nichols Hall is likely at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas, which
      is in the northeastern part of Kansas.


      5) Since Kansas is primarily west of Missouri, and Lake Wappapello is in southeastern
      Missouri, Nichols Hall in Kansas would be to the northwest of Lake Wappapello.


      6) If Nichols Hall is to the northwest of Lake Wappapello, then it cannot be
      south of Lake Wappapello.


      Therefore, Nichols Hall, KS is NOT south of Lake Wappapello, MO.</think># Is
      Nichols Hall, KS located south of Lake Wappapello, MO?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. Nichols Hall is in Kansas (KS), while Lake Wappapello is in Missouri (MO).


      2. Geographically, Kansas is located west of Missouri in the United States.


      3. Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri, in Wayne County.


      4. Nichols Hall (likely referring to the building at Kansas State University)
      is in Manhattan, Kansas, which is in the northeastern part of Kansas.


      5. Since Kansas is west of Missouri, and Manhattan, KS is in the northeastern
      part of Kansas, Nichols Hall would be northwest of Lake Wappapello.


      6. If Nichols Hall is northwest of Lake Wappapello, it cannot be south of it.


      ## Answer: NO


      Nichols Hall, KS is not located south of Lake Wappapello, MO. It is located
      to the northwest.'
    1f188887-b718-44f8-a7b4-02367baacf0a: '<think>I need to determine if Nichols Hall
      in Kansas is located south of Lake Wappapello, Missouri.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Nichols Hall, KS - This is likely a building in Kansas (KS)

      - Lake Wappapello, MO - This is a lake in Missouri (MO)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      To determine if Nichols Hall is south of Lake Wappapello, I need to know their
      geographical coordinates or at least their rough positions within their respective
      states.


      Step 3: Consider the geography of Kansas and Missouri.

      Missouri is generally located east of Kansas. However, the question is about
      north-south positioning, not east-west. Kansas and Missouri share a border,
      with Missouri to the east of Kansas.


      Kansas is roughly at the same latitude as Missouri, with both states spanning
      similar north-south ranges. However, Missouri extends further south than Kansas
      at its southeastern corner (the "bootheel").


      Lake Wappapello appears to be in southeastern Missouri, in the more southern
      portion of the state.


      Nichols Hall is likely at a university in Kansas, possibly Kansas State University
      or the University of Kansas, which would put it in the northeastern or eastern
      part of Kansas.


      Given that Missouri and Kansas are at roughly the same latitude, and Lake Wappapello
      is in the southeastern (more southern) part of Missouri, while Nichols Hall
      is likely in the eastern part of Kansas, Nichols Hall is probably not south
      of Lake Wappapello. It''s more likely that Nichols Hall is north or northwest
      of Lake Wappapello.</think>To determine if Nichols Hall, KS is located south
      of Lake Wappapello, MO, I need to consider the geographic positions of both
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Nichols Hall is located in Kansas (KS), likely at Kansas State University
      in Manhattan, KS.

      - Lake Wappapello is a reservoir in southeastern Missouri (MO).


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Kansas is directly west of Missouri.

      - Kansas is generally at the same latitude as the northern part of Missouri.


      Step 3: Determine specific locations within their states.

      - Manhattan, KS (where Nichols Hall is located) is in the northeastern part
      of Kansas.

      - Lake Wappapello is in the southeastern part of Missouri, close to the "bootheel"
      region.


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Manhattan, KS is roughly at the same latitude as northern Missouri.

      - Lake Wappapello is in southern Missouri, at a lower latitude than Manhattan.


      Therefore, Nichols Hall in Kansas is located NORTH of Lake Wappapello, not south
      of it.

      To answer this, I need to determine the approximate locations of:

      1. Nichols Hall, Kansas

      2. Lake Wappapello, Missouri


      Then I need to determine which one is further north.


      Nichols Hall is likely at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas. Manhattan,
      Kansas is in the northeastern part of Kansas.


      Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri.


      In terms of north-south positioning (latitude):

      - Kansas is generally south of Missouri, as Missouri is directly north of Kansas
      in the US map.

      - Manhattan, Kansas would be in northern Kansas, while Lake Wappapello would
      be in southern Missouri.


      Even though Manhattan is in northern Kansas and Lake Wappapello is in southern
      Missouri, since Missouri is north of Kansas, Lake Wappapello is still likely
      north of Nichols Hall.


      Therefore, Nichols Hall, KS is likely south of Lake Wappapello, MO.</think>#
      Is Nichols Hall, KS located south of Lake Wappapello, MO?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations.

      - Nichols Hall is located at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas.

      - Lake Wappapello is a reservoir in southeastern Missouri.


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Missouri is directly north of Kansas on the US map.


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within each state.

      - Manhattan, KS is in the northeastern part of Kansas.

      - Lake Wappapello is in the southeastern part of Missouri.


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Even though Manhattan is in northern Kansas, and Lake Wappapello is in southern
      Missouri, Missouri as a whole is still north of Kansas.

      - The southern part of Missouri is generally still north of the northern part
      of Kansas.

      1. The location of Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis in St. Louis, MO

      2. The location of Cherokee Lake, TN

      3. Compare these locations to determine if the cathedral is south of the lake


      Let me think about the geographic locations:


      St. Louis, Missouri is located in the east-central part of Missouri, along the
      western bank of the Mississippi River. Missouri is generally north of Tennessee.


      Cherokee Lake is in eastern Tennessee.


      Given the general geography of the United States:

      - Tennessee is south of Missouri

      - St. Louis is in Missouri, which is north of Tennessee

      - Cherokee Lake is in Tennessee


      Since Missouri is north of Tennessee, and St. Louis is in Missouri, while Cherokee
      Lake is in Tennessee, the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis would be NORTH of
      Cherokee Lake, not south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two locations by examining their geographic coordinates.


      Step 1: Locate Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis.

      of Missouri, near the Illinois border.


      Step 2: Locate Cherokee Lake, Tennessee.

      Cherokee Lake is in northeastern Tennessee.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      When examining a map of the United States, Missouri is situated north of Tennessee.
      St. Louis is in the eastern part of Missouri, while Cherokee Lake is in northeastern
      Tennessee.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Missouri is entirely north of Tennessee, and St. Louis is in Missouri
      while Cherokee Lake is in Tennessee, the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis must
      be north of Cherokee Lake, not south of it.

      2. Cherokee Lake is in Tennessee

      First, let''s identify the two locations:

      1. St. Teresa Church in Manhattan, NY

      2. Ovens Auditorium in NC (North Carolina)


      I know that Manhattan is in New York City, which is in the state of New York
      in the northeastern United States.

      North Carolina (NC) is a state on the East Coast of the United States, significantly
      south of New York.


      In general, New York is north of North Carolina. So logically, a location in
      Manhattan, NY would be north of a location in North Carolina, not south of it.


      Therefore, St. Teresa Church in Manhattan, NY would be located NORTH of Ovens
      Auditorium in NC, not south of it.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - St. Teresa Church is in Manhattan, New York (NY)

      - Ovens Auditorium is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Determine their relative north-south positions on a map.

      - Manhattan is located in New York City in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is a state on the eastern seaboard, significantly south of
      New York


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New York is farther north than North Carolina

      - Therefore, Manhattan (in NY) is north of any location in North Carolina


      Since St. Teresa Church is in Manhattan (NY), which is north of North Carolina
      where Ovens Auditorium is located, St. Teresa Church cannot be south of Ovens
      Auditorium.

      Dam in South Dakota is located south of Griffy Lake in Indiana. To answer this,
      I need to know the approximate latitudes of these two landmarks.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - South Dakota (SD) is a state in the northern central part of the US

      - Indiana (IN) is a state in the Midwest, east of South Dakota


      The key factor here is the latitude (north-south position):

      - South Dakota is generally north of Indiana, as it''s closer to the Canadian
      border

      - Indiana is further south in the US


      Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota, so it would likely be at a more northern latitude
      than Griffy Lake which is in Indiana.


      If Big Bend Dam is at a more northern latitude than Griffy Lake, then Big Bend
      Dam is NOT south of Griffy Lake.</think># Is Big Bend Dam, SD located south
      of Griffy Lake, IN?


      I need to determine the north-south relationship between these two water bodies
      by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Griffy Lake is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - South Dakota is in the northern central United States, bordering North Dakota
      and Canada to the north

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region, significantly southeast of South Dakota


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - South Dakota generally sits at higher latitudes (more northerly) than Indiana

      - Even the southern portions of South Dakota are typically at similar or higher
      latitudes than the northern parts of Indiana


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota, and South Dakota is north of Indiana
      where Griffy Lake is located, Big Bend Dam must be north of Griffy Lake, not
      south.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - South Dakota is in the northern central part of the United States

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, considerably southeast of South Dakota


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - South Dakota sits at a higher latitude than Indiana

      - Any location in South Dakota would generally be north of locations in Indiana

      - Big Bend Dam would therefore be north of Griffy Lake, not south of it

      1. UCCU Center is in Utah (UT). Based on my knowledge, it''s located in Orem,
      Utah.

      2. Lake Palmdale is in California (CA), specifically in Palmdale, which is in

      - Utah is generally north of California in the United States

      - Orem, Utah (where UCCU Center is) is in the northern half of the country

      - Palmdale, California is in southern California


      California extends quite far north-south, but even the northernmost parts of
      California are generally south of Utah. Palmdale specifically is in southern
      California, making it even further south compared to Orem, Utah.


      Therefore, UCCU Center in Utah would be NORTH of Lake Palmdale in California,
      not south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify where UCCU Center is located.

      UCCU Center is in Orem, Utah (UT).


      Step 2: Identify where Lake Palmdale is located.

      Lake Palmdale is in Palmdale, California (CA), which is in southern California.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      Utah is located north of California in the United States. Even the southernmost
      parts of Utah are generally north of southern California where Palmdale is located.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about their relative positions.

      Since Utah is north of southern California, UCCU Center in Utah must be north

      1. UCCU Center, UT

      2. Lake Palmdale, CA


      First, let me identify where UCCU Center in Utah is located. UCCU Center is
      likely in Utah (UT), probably a sports arena or event center. Utah is a state
      in the western United States.


      Next, I need to identify where Lake Palmdale in California is located. Lake
      Palmdale is in California (CA), which is also in the western United States,
      specifically on the west coast.


      Now I need to compare their north-south positions:


      Utah is generally north of California in the United States. Utah borders Nevada,
      which borders California on its eastern side. So generally speaking, locations
      in Utah tend to be north of locations in California.


      However, California is a very large state that extends quite far north. Southern
      California (where Palmdale would be located) is definitely south of Utah. Palmdale
      is in the southern part of California, in Los Angeles County.


      So UCCU Center in Utah would be north of Lake Palmdale in California, not south
      of it.</think>To determine if UCCU Center in Utah is south of Lake Palmdale
      in California, I need to consider the geographic positions of both locations.


      Step 1: Locate UCCU Center, UT

      UCCU Center is in Utah, specifically in Orem, Utah. It''s a sports/event venue
      at Utah Valley University.


      Step 2: Locate Lake Palmdale, CA

      Lake Palmdale is in Palmdale, California, which is in Los Angeles County in
      Southern California.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      Utah is entirely north of Southern California in terms of latitude. Utah is
      positioned in the mountain west region of the United States, while Palmdale
      is in the southern portion of California.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison

      Since Utah is geographically north of Southern California, UCCU Center in Utah
      must be north of Lake Palmdale, not south of it.

      \ is south of Arizona, but also east of Arizona\n\nActually, let me be more\
      \ precise. Texas is not directly south of Arizona. Texas is to the east of Arizona,\
      \ and Arizona and Texas don't share a border. New Mexico is between them.\n\n\
      In terms of latitude:\n- Arizona is roughly between 31\xB0N and 37\xB0N latitude\n\
      - Texas is roughly between 26\xB0N and 36\xB0N latitude\n\nSo Texas extends\
      \ further south than Arizona, but they overlap considerably in their north-south\
      \ extent.\n\nNow for the specific lakes:\n- Bartlett Lake is in central Arizona,\
      \ northeast of Phoenix\n- Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, Texas, which is in central\
      \ Texas\n\nPhoenix is at about 33.4\xB0N latitude, and Bartlett Lake is northeast\

      relative locations of two places:

      1. Shofuso Japanese House and Garden in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2. Lake Mohave in Arizona (AZ)


      The question specifically asks if Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is located
      south of Lake Mohave.


      Let me think about the geography:


      Pennsylvania is a state in the northeastern United States. It''s on the east
      coast.

      Arizona is a state in the southwestern United States.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Pennsylvania is generally located further north than Arizona

      - Lake Mohave specifically is on the Arizona-Nevada border, in the southwestern
      US

      - Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which
      is in the southeastern part of PA


      Given that Pennsylvania is entirely north of Arizona, and Shofuso is in Pennsylvania
      while Lake Mohave is in Arizona, Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is NOT south
      of Lake Mohave. It would be north of Lake Mohave.</think># Is Shofuso Japanese
      House and Garden, PA located south of Lake Mohave, AZ?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
      (PA)

      2) Philadelphia is in the northeastern United States

      3) Lake Mohave is on the Arizona-Nevada border in the southwestern United States

      4) Geographically, Pennsylvania is substantially north of Arizona

      5) This means Philadelphia, PA must be north of Lake Mohave, AZ


      NO, Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is not located south of Lake Mohave. It
      is located to the north.'

      First, let me identify the locations:

      1. Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is a state
      in the northeastern United States.

      2. Lake Mohave is in Arizona (AZ), which is a state in the southwestern United
      States.


      Now let me think about their relative positions in terms of latitude (north-south
      positioning):

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern US, much further north than Arizona which
      is in the southwestern US.

      - Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is north of Arizona on a map of the United
      States.

      - Since Lake Mohave is in Arizona, and Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is
      in Pennsylvania, the Japanese garden would be located north of Lake Mohave,
      not south.


      To be south of Lake Mohave, Shofuso would need to be at a lower latitude than
      Lake Mohave. Since Pennsylvania is clearly at a higher latitude than Arizona,
      this cannot be true.</think># Is Shofuso Japanese House and Garden, PA located

      is in the northeastern United States.


      2) Lake Mohave is located in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern United
      States.


      3) When comparing north-south positions in the US, states in the northeast (like
      Pennsylvania) are generally located much further north than states in the southwest
      (like Arizona).


      4) On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is positioned significantly north
      of Arizona.


      5) Therefore, Shofuso Japanese House and Garden in Pennsylvania would be located

      \nTuttle Creek Lake is in northeastern Kansas, near Manhattan, KS.\nLake Glenville\

      \ I would say that since Kansas is generally north of North Carolina, Tuttle\

      \ make the answer \"NO\" - Tuttle Creek Lake is NOT south of Lake Glenville.\n\
      \nBut let me double-check this reasoning. Kansas is definitely north of North\
      \ Carolina in terms of latitude. Even the southernmost part of Kansas is likely\
      \ north of or at a similar latitude to the northernmost part of North Carolina.\
      \ Given that, Tuttle Creek Lake in Kansas should be north of Lake Glenville\
      \ in North Carolina.</think>To determine if Tuttle Creek Lake, KS is located\
      \ south of Lake Glenville, NC, I need to consider the geographic positions of\
      \ Kansas and North Carolina in relation to each other.\n\nStep 1: Consider the\
      \ general north-south positioning of these states.\nKansas is located in the\
      \ central United States, roughly between 37\xB0N and 40\xB0N latitude.\nNorth\
      \ Carolina is located on the East Coast, roughly between 34\xB0N and 36.5\xB0\
      N latitude.\n\nStep 2: Compare the latitudes of the two states.\nKansas is generally\
      \ positioned north of North Carolina on a map of the United States.\n\nStep\
      \ 3: Consider the specific locations of the lakes within their states.\nTuttle\
      \ Creek Lake is in northeastern Kansas, near Manhattan.\nLake Glenville is in\
      \ western North Carolina in the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nStep 4: Make the final\
      \ comparison.\nSince Kansas is entirely north of North Carolina in terms of\
      \ latitude, Tuttle Creek Lake must be north of Lake Glenville, not south of\
      \ it.\n\nNO"

      1. The Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson,
      Ohio (OH).

      2. The Lensic Theater is in New Mexico (NM).


      Now I need to determine which one is further north (higher latitude):


      Ohio is in the Midwest/Northeast region of the United States, while New Mexico

      The Lensic Theater is likely in Santa Fe or Albuquerque (major cities in New
      Mexico).


      So the Basilica in North Jackson, Ohio would be north of the Lensic Theater
      in New Mexico.

      - Ohio is significantly farther north than New Mexico on the map of the United

      \ River runs through southern Idaho, which is significantly south of the northern\
      \ parts of the state\n\nStep 4: Compare the latitudes.\n- Seattle is at approximately\
      \ 47.6\xB0 N latitude\n- Southern Idaho, where Minidoka Dam is located, is likely\
