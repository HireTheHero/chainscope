      \ or south.\n\nStep 1: Find the latitude of Lake Icaria, Iowa.\n\n- Lake Icaria\
      \ is located near Corning, in southwestern Iowa.\n- Corning, IA is approximately\
      \ at latitude 40.99\xB0 N.\n\nStep 2: Find the latitude of Nashville Municipal\
      \ Auditorium, Tennessee.\n\n- Nashville, TN is located in central Tennessee.\n\
      - The Nashville Municipal Auditorium is located in downtown Nashville, approximately\
      \ at latitude 36.17\xB0 N.\n\nStep 3: Compare the latitudes.\n\n- Lake Icaria\
      \ (40.99\xB0 N) has a higher latitude than Nashville Municipal Auditorium (36.17\xB0\
      \ N).\n- Higher latitude in the Northern Hemisphere means it is further north.\n\
      \nConclusion:\n\nLake Icaria is north of Nashville Municipal Auditorium.\n\n\
