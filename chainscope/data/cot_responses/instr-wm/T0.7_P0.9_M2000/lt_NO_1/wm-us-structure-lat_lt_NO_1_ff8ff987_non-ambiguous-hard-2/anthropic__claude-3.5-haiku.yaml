      - This church is located in Manhattan, New York City


      3. Determine their relative geographic positions

      - Oregon is a western state

      - New York is an eastern state

      - Oregon is much further west than New York


      4. Compare their latitudes

      - Oregon is significantly north of New York''s latitude


      5. Conclusion:

      - Since Oregon is west and north of New York, Oxbow Dam, OR is NOT south of
      the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in Manhattan, NY


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      - Lake Tapps is located in Pierce County, Washington State

      - It is near the city of Auburn, which is south of Seattle


      2. Next, let''s locate Holy Name Cathedral:

      - Holy Name Cathedral is located in Chicago, Illinois

      - Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois


      3. Comparing their geographic positions:

      - Lake Tapps is in Washington State (west coast)

      - Holy Name Cathedral is in Illinois (midwest)

      - Washington State is west of Illinois

      - More specifically, Lake Tapps is northwest of Chicago


      4. To determine if Lake Tapps is south of Holy Name Cathedral:

      - Since Lake Tapps is northwest of Chicago, it cannot be south of Chicago

      - Therefore, Lake Tapps is NOT south of Holy Name Cathedral

      Step 3: Relative positioning

      - Ohio is east of California

      - The entire state of Ohio is north of California

      - Therefore, Allen Theatre is north of New Exchequer Dam


      Since the question asks if Allen Theatre is south of New Exchequer Dam, and
      we''ve determined it is actually north, the answer is:


      NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Allen Theatre in Ohio

      2. Then, I''ll locate New Exchequer Dam in California

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Allen Theatre location

      - I know this is in Ohio, which is in the eastern part of the United States


      Step 2: New Exchequer Dam location

      - This is in California, which is in the western part of the United States


      Step 3: Relative positioning

      - Ohio is east of California

      - This means any point in Ohio will be geographically north of a point in California


      Therefore, Allen Theatre, OH is NOT located south of New Exchequer Dam, CA.


      The answer is: NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Lake Icaria, IA (Iowa)

      2. Then, I''ll locate Nashville Municipal Auditorium, TN

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Lake Icaria is located in Adams County, Iowa, which is in the southwestern
      part of Iowa.


      Step 2: Nashville Municipal Auditorium is located in Nashville, Tennessee, which
      is in the southeastern part of the United States.

      - Iowa is north of Tennessee

      - Lake Icaria is in the northern part of Iowa

      - Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in the southern part of Tennessee


      Therefore, Lake Icaria is NORTH of Nashville Municipal Auditorium, not south.

      is located in New York.

      1. First, let''s locate Hells Canyon Dam:

      - Hells Canyon Dam is located in Idaho, specifically in the Snake River on the
      border of Idaho and Oregon

      - It is in the western part of the United States


      2. Next, let''s locate Big Pink:

      - Big Pink is in New York

      - New York is on the eastern side of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographic locations:

      - Hells Canyon Dam is in the western US

      - Big Pink is in the eastern US

      - The western US is west of the eastern US


      4. So the question becomes: Is something in the western US south of something
      in the eastern US?

      - This depends on their specific latitudes

      - But in general, west coast locations are not typically considered "south"
      of east coast locations


      5. Conclusion:

      - Big Pink is a nickname for the Portland Building in Portland, Oregon

      - This building is located in Oregon, not New York


      3. Checking the geographical relationship:

      - Since the question mentions "Big Pink, NY" which doesn''t actually exist (Big

      - And Hells Canyon Dam is in western Idaho

      - There''s no meaningful geographical comparison possible

      - Hells Canyon Dam is in western Idaho

      - Big Pink is in Oregon
