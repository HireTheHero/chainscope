      2.  **Locate Lake Martin:** Lake Martin is in Alabama (AL).

      3.  **Compare the general locations of the states:** Missouri is geographically
      north of Alabama.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, Truman Reservoir, MO, is located north of Lake
      Martin, AL.

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Truman Reservoir
