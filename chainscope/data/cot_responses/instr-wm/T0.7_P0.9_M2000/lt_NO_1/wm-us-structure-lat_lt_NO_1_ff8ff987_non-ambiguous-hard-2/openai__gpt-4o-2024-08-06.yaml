      1. **Identify the location of House on the Rock**: House on the Rock is located
      in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Wisconsin is in the north-central part of the United
      States.


      2. **Identify the location of Sparks Shot Tower**: Sparks Shot Tower is located

      3. **Determine the relative latitudes**: Wisconsin is generally located to the
      north of Pennsylvania. Specifically, Spring Green, WI (where House on the Rock
      is located) is at a higher latitude than Philadelphia, PA (where Sparks Shot
      Tower is located).


      Therefore, House on the Rock in Wisconsin is located north of Sparks Shot Tower

      Colorado is located south of Atlanta Symphony Hall in Georgia, we need to consider
      the geographic locations of these two places.


      1. **Location of Auraria Campus, CO**: The Auraria Campus is located in Denver,
      Colorado. Denver is situated at approximately 39.74 degrees north latitude.


      2. **Location of Atlanta Symphony Hall, GA**: The Atlanta Symphony Hall is located
      in Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta is situated at approximately 33.75 degrees north
      latitude.


      3. **Comparison of Latitudes**: Since latitude lines run parallel to the equator,
      locations with higher latitude numbers are further north. Therefore, 39.74 degrees
      north (Denver) is north of 33.75 degrees north (Atlanta).


      Given this information, Auraria Campus in Denver, Colorado, is north of Atlanta
      Symphony Hall in Atlanta, Georgia.

      of both places:


      1. **Identify the location of Bunch-of-Grapes, MA**: Bunch-of-Grapes is not
      a commonly recognized location, but given the "MA" designation, it implies that
      it is in Massachusetts.


      2. **Identify the location of Navajo Lake, NM**: Navajo Lake is located in the
      northwestern part of New Mexico, near the Colorado border.


      3. **Compare the relative positions**: Massachusetts is located in the northeastern
      United States, whereas New Mexico is in the southwestern United States. Since
      Massachusetts is generally north of New Mexico, any location within Massachusetts,
      including Bunch-of-Grapes (if it exists), would be north of Navajo Lake, NM.

      on the Snake River along the border of Idaho and Oregon. It is situated in the
      western United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Big Pink, NY**: Big Pink is a house located in
