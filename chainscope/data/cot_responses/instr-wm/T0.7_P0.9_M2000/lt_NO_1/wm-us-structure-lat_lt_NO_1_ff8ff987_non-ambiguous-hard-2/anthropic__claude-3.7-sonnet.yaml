      1) First, I need to identify the locations of both facilities.


      2) The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is located in southeastern New Mexico
      (NM).


      3) The Sunrise Musical Theater was located in Sunrise, Florida (FL), which is

      the relative positions of these two structures.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Determine their general geographic positions.

      - Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois

      - Kewaunee is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan in eastern Wisconsin

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station would be in Chicago, Illinois, also along Lake
      Michigan but further south


      Step 3: Consider their specific locations.

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in northeastern Wisconsin

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in downtown Chicago

      - On a north-south axis, Wisconsin locations are typically north of Chicago
      locations


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geographic positioning.

      Since Kewaunee Power Station is in Wisconsin, which is north of Illinois where
      the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is located, Kewaunee Power Station is north
      of (not south of) the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station.

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both Crystal Creek Reservoir in
      Colorado and Black Canyon Lake in Arizona.


      Step 2: Colorado is located north of Arizona in the United States. Colorado
      shares its southern border with New Mexico, which in turn borders Arizona to
      the north.


      Step 3: Since Crystal Creek Reservoir is in Colorado, and Black Canyon Lake
      is in Arizona, the reservoir must be north of the lake, not south.


      Step 4: To be "south of" something means to be positioned at a lower latitude.
      Since Colorado is at a higher latitude than Arizona, Crystal Creek Reservoir
      cannot be south of Black Canyon Lake.


      NO, Crystal Creek Reservoir, CO is not located south of Black Canyon Lake, AZ.
      It is located north of it.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the location of Lake Alan Henry, TX.

      Lake Alan Henry is located in the Texas Panhandle region, specifically in Garza
      and Kent counties. It''s in the northwestern part of Texas, south of Lubbock.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Corpus Christi Cathedral.

      Corpus Christi Cathedral is located in the city of Corpus Christi, which is
      on the Gulf Coast of Texas in the southern part of the state.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Texas extends from north to south, with the Panhandle region (where Lake Alan
      Henry is) being in the northern half of the state, while Corpus Christi is much
      further south, near the Mexican border on the Gulf Coast.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Lake Alan Henry is in the northwestern part of Texas and Corpus Christi
      is in the southern coastal region, Lake Alan Henry is located NORTH of Corpus
      Christi Cathedral, not south.

      in the upper Midwest region of the United States.

      - Christian Cultural Center is in Brooklyn, New York, which is in the northeastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - South Dakota is in the northern central part of the United States.

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States.

      - When comparing latitudes, South Dakota is generally at a similar latitude
      to or slightly north of New York.

      part of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Compare their relative north-south positions.

      Pennsylvania is generally north of Kentucky. Specifically, Philadelphia (where
      Tun Tavern was located) is in the northern United States, while Berea, Kentucky
      is further south.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Pennsylvania is north of Kentucky, and Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania
      while Berea is in Kentucky, Tun Tavern in Philadelphia would be north of Berea
      College, not south of it.


      NO, Tun Tavern, PA is not located south of Berea College, KY. It is located
      north of it.'

      - Lake Glenville is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern US, roughly between the 34th and 36.5th
      parallels north.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Tuttle Creek Lake is in northeastern Kansas, likely around the 39th parallel
      north.

      - Lake Glenville is in western North Carolina in the Appalachian Mountains,
      likely around the 35th parallel north.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Since Tuttle Creek Lake is at a higher latitude (further north) than Lake
      Glenville, Tuttle Creek Lake is NOT south of Lake Glenville.
