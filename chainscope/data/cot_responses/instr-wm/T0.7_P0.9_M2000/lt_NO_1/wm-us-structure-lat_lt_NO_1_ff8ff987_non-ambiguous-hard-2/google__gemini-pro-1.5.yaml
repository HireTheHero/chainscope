      depends entirely on their respective latitudes, not their east/west placement.  More
      information is needed to determine this.  However, the question requires a YES/NO
      answer.  Since it''s impossible to answer definitively without more information,
      and since Pennsylvania *could* be at a lower latitude than a specific location
      in California, neither a YES or NO answer is definitively correct based on the
      information provided.


      However, given that most of Pennsylvania is north of most of California, statistically,
      a NO answer is more likely to be correct, but not guaranteed.

      doesn''t matter as much as longitude in this case.  Anything significantly East
      of California will be North *and* South of it.

      be west of something in Arkansas.  South implies a lower latitude. West or East
      implies longitude.

      much of Texas is north of Florida, but a portion dips south.  However, even

      being south of something in Florida would require being both south *and east*
