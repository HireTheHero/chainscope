      CO is located south of Lake Arrowhead Reservoir, CA, we need to compare their
      geographical locations step by step:


      1. **Locate Barker Meadow Reservoir, CO**: Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado,
      which is in the central-western part of the United States. Colorado is landlocked
      and lies to the east of California.


      2. **Locate Lake Arrowhead Reservoir, CA**: Lake Arrowhead Reservoir is in California,
      which is on the west coast of the United States. California is located to the
      west of Colorado.


      3. **Compare latitudes**: Since Colorado is east of California, Barker Meadow
      Reservoir, CO is generally further east than Lake Arrowhead Reservoir, CA. However,
      the key factor here is **latitude** (north-south position). Barker Meadow Reservoir,
      CO, is at a higher latitude (further north) than Lake Arrowhead Reservoir, CA,
      because Colorado is north of California in the U.S. map.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Barker Meadow Reservoir, CO, is further north than
      Lake Arrowhead Reservoir, CA, it is not located south of Lake Arrowhead Reservoir,
      CA.

      Lite Motel) is located at a higher latitude (further north) than Idaho (including
      Anderson Ranch Dam).


      Therefore, **Star Lite Motel, MN, is not located south of Anderson Ranch Dam,
      ID**.

      is located south of Nimrod Lake, AR, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Locate Lake Del Valle, CA**: Lake Del Valle is a reservoir located in Alameda
      County, California. It is situated in the northern part of California, near
      the city of Livermore.


      2. **Locate Nimrod Lake, AR**: Nimrod Lake is a reservoir in Arkansas, located
      in the central part of the state, near the city of Nimrod.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: California is generally to the west of Arkansas.
      However, the key factor here is the latitude (north-south position). Northern
      California is at a higher latitude (farther north) than central Arkansas.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Lake Del Valle, CA is in northern California and Nimrod

    dbb5ae22-94cc-4b5e-9c9f-dda6c9ba3967: "Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether\
      \ the Pantages Theatre in Minneapolis, MN, is located south of the St. George\
      \ Theatre in New York. At first glance, this seems like a straightforward geography\
      \ question, but I realize I need to break it down into smaller steps to ensure\
      \ I get the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations of Both Theatres\n\
      \nFirst, I need to know where each theatre is located geographically.\n\n- **Pantages\
      \ Theatre (Minneapolis, MN):** I know that Minneapolis is in the state of Minnesota,\
      \ which is in the northern part of the United States.\n  \n- **St. George Theatre\
      \ (NY):** This theatre is in New York, specifically in the state of New York.\
      \ New York is on the east coast of the U.S., and the St. George Theatre is located\
      \ in Staten Island, which is one of the boroughs of New York City.\n\n### Step\
      \ 2: Understand the Geographical Coordinates\n\nTo determine which location\
      \ is south of the other, I need to look at their latitudes.\n\n- **Minneapolis,\
      \ MN:** From what I recall, Minneapolis is at a latitude of approximately 44.98\xB0\
      \ N.\n  \n- **Staten Island, NY:** Staten Island, where the St. George Theatre\
      \ is located, has a latitude of approximately 40.58\xB0 N.\n\n### Step 3: Compare\
      \ the Latitudes\n\nLatitude measures how far north or south a location is from\
      \ the equator. The higher the latitude, the farther north the location is.\n\
      \n- Minneapolis: 44.98\xB0 N\n- Staten Island: 40.58\xB0 N\n\nSince 44.98\xB0\
      \ N is greater than 40.58\xB0 N, Minneapolis is farther north than Staten Island.\n\
      \n### Step 4: Determine Which Theatre is South of the Other\n\nGiven that Minneapolis\
      \ is farther north than Staten Island, the Pantages Theatre in Minneapolis would\
      \ be north of the St. George Theatre in Staten Island.\n\nTherefore, the St.\
      \ George Theatre is south of the Pantages Theatre.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\
      \nBased on the comparison of their latitudes:\n\n- **Pantages Theatre (Minneapolis,\
      \ MN):** 44.98\xB0 N\n- **St. George Theatre (Staten Island, NY):** 40.58\xB0\
      \ N\n\nSince 44.98\xB0 N (Pantages) is greater than 40.58\xB0 N (St. George),\
      \ the Pantages Theatre is north of the St. George Theatre.\n\n**Final Answer:**\
      \ NO, Pantages Theatre (Minneapolis, MN) is not located south of St. George\
