      asks about Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and Champaign County, Illinois.

      2.  **Determine the relative location of Massachusetts and Illinois:** Massachusetts
      is a state in the northeastern US. Illinois is a state in the Midwest, located
      significantly west of the Northeast.

      3.  **Consider the counties within their states:** Plymouth County is in Massachusetts.
      Champaign County is in Illinois. Since the states themselves have a clear west-east
      relationship (Illinois is west of Massachusetts), it is highly probable that
      a county within the western state is west of a county within the eastern state.

      4.  **Confirm with general knowledge or map check (if necessary):** A quick
      mental check or look at a map confirms that Illinois is indeed west of Massachusetts.
      Therefore, any location within Illinois will be west of any location within
      Massachusetts.


      Since Champaign County, IL is located in Illinois and Plymouth County, MA is
      located in Massachusetts, and Illinois is west of Massachusetts, Champaign County,
      IL is west of Plymouth County, MA.

      \ the question: \"Is Galax City, VA located west of Nueces County, TX?\"\n\n\
      1.  **Identify the key locations:** I need to know the approximate geographical\
      \ positions of:\n    *   Galax City, Virginia\n    *   Nueces County, Texas\n\
      \n2.  **Determine the relative direction:** The question asks if Galax City\
      \ is \"west of\" Nueces County. This means I need to compare their longitudinal\
      \ positions. The location with a smaller (more western) longitude is west of\
      \ the location with a larger (more eastern) longitude.\n\n3.  **Find the location\
      \ of Galax City, VA:**\n    *   I know Galax City is in Virginia. Virginia is\
      \ on the East Coast of the US.\n    *   A quick mental check or search confirms\
      \ Galax's approximate location. It's in southwestern Virginia.\n    *   Its\
      \ approximate longitude is around 80.9\xB0 West.\n\n4.  **Find the location\
      \ of Nueces County, TX:**\n    *   I know Nueces County is in Texas. Texas is\
      \ in the southern/southwestern US.\n    *   Nueces County contains Corpus Christi.\n\
      \    *   A quick mental check or search confirms Nueces County's approximate\
      \ location. It's on the Gulf Coast of Texas.\n    *   Its approximate longitude\
      \ is around 97.4\xB0 West.\n\n5.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *   Galax\
      \ City, VA longitude: ~80.9\xB0 West\n    *   Nueces County, TX longitude: ~97.4\xB0\
      \ West\n\n6.  **Interpret the comparison:** A larger *negative* number or a\
      \ smaller *positive* number when measuring degrees *west* means a more western\
      \ location. In this case, 97.4 is a larger value than 80.9. Since we are measuring\
      \ degrees *west* of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0), a higher number of degrees west\
      \ means a location further west.\n    *   Nueces County is ~97.4\xB0 West.\n\
      \    *   Galax City is ~80.9\xB0 West.\n\n    Since 97.4 > 80.9, Nueces County\
      \ is further west than Galax City.\n\n7.  **Formulate the answer to the specific\
      \ question:** The question is \"Is Galax City, VA located west of Nueces County,\
      \ TX?\". My comparison shows that Galax City is *east* of Nueces County.\n\n\
      8.  **Provide the final YES/NO answer:** The answer is NO.\n\nHere's the step-by-step\

      \ on the East Coast of the US. Nueces County is in Texas, in the southern/southwestern\
      \ US on the Gulf Coast.\n2.  To determine if one location is west of another,\
      \ we need to compare their longitudes. A location further west will have a higher\
      \ degree of West longitude (or a lower degree of East longitude, but both are\
      \ in the Western Hemisphere).\n3.  Galax City, Virginia is located at approximately\
      \ 80.9\xB0 West longitude.\n4.  Nueces County, Texas (which contains Corpus\
      \ Christi) is located at approximately 97.4\xB0 West longitude.\n5.  Comparing\
      \ the longitudes: 97.4\xB0 West is further west than 80.9\xB0 West.\n6.  Therefore,\
      \ Nueces County is located west of Galax City.\n7.  The question asks if Galax\

      \ the question: \"Is Bristol County, MA located west of Worth County, GA?\"\n\
      \n1.  **Identify the key entities:** The question is about the relative locations\
      \ of two specific US counties: Bristol County, Massachusetts (MA) and Worth\
      \ County, Georgia (GA).\n\n2.  **Determine the primary geographic characteristic\
      \ being compared:** The question asks about their *east-west* relationship (\"\
      west of\").\n\n3.  **Locate Bristol County, MA:**\n    *   I know Massachusetts\
      \ is in the northeastern United States.\n    *   I need a more precise location\
      \ for Bristol County within MA. A quick mental check or search confirms Bristol\
      \ County is in the southeastern part of Massachusetts, bordering Rhode Island.\
      \ It's a coastal county on Buzzards Bay.\n    *   Geographically, it's quite\
      \ far *east* within the continental US context, being on the Atlantic coast.\n\
      \n4.  **Locate Worth County, GA:**\n    *   I know Georgia is in the southeastern\
      \ United States.\n    *   I need a more precise location for Worth County within\
      \ GA. A quick mental check or search confirms Worth County is in southwestern\
      \ Georgia, south of Atlanta and west of the central part of the state. It's\
      \ an inland county.\n    *   Geographically, it's further *west* than coastal\
      \ locations in the northeast.\n\n5.  **Compare the locations based on longitude:**\n\
      \    *   Bristol County, MA is on the Atlantic coast in the northeast. Its longitude\
      \ is roughly around 70-71 degrees West.\n    *   Worth County, GA is in southwestern\
      \ Georgia. Its longitude is roughly around 83-84 degrees West.\n    *   A location\
      \ further *west* has a *higher* degree of West longitude (e.g., 80W is west\
      \ of 70W).\n    *   Since 83-84 degrees West (Worth County) is a higher number\
      \ than 70-71 degrees West (Bristol County), Worth County is geographically *west*\
      \ of Bristol County.\n\n6.  **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:**\
      \ The question asks if Bristol County, MA is *west* of Worth County, GA. My\
      \ analysis shows that Worth County, GA is *west* of Bristol County, MA. This\
      \ means Bristol County, MA is *east* of Worth County, GA.\n\n7.  **Final Answer\
      \ Derivation:** The statement \"Bristol County, MA is located west of Worth\

      \ Does the relative position make intuitive sense? Yes, the northeast coast\
      \ (MA) is much further east than the inland southeast (GA). Therefore, a county\
      \ in MA is almost certainly east of a county in GA. The specific counties confirm\
      \ this general placement.Okay, let's break this down:\n\n1.  **Locate Massachusetts:**\
      \ Massachusetts is a state in the northeastern United States, situated on the\
      \ Atlantic coast.\n2.  **Locate Bristol County, MA:** Bristol County is in the\
      \ southeastern part of Massachusetts, bordering Rhode Island and the Atlantic\
      \ coast (Buzzards Bay). It is quite far east within the continental US.\n3.\
      \  **Locate Georgia:** Georgia is a state in the southeastern United States,\
      \ located further west than the New England states like Massachusetts.\n4. \
      \ **Locate Worth County, GA:** Worth County is located in southwestern Georgia,\
      \ south of the major cities and inland from the coast.\n5.  **Compare East-West\
      \ Position:** Generally, states on the Atlantic coast further north (like MA)\
      \ are significantly *east* of states further south and inland (like GA). Specifically\
      \ comparing Bristol County, MA (on the far eastern coast) and Worth County,\
      \ GA (in southwestern GA), Bristol County is much further east.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Bristol County, MA is located *east* of Worth County, GA.\n\nThe question\
      \ asks if Bristol County, MA is located *west* of Worth County, GA.\n\nBased\

      4.  **Consider the counties within their states:** While the specific location
      within the state matters for precise county-to-county comparisons *within the
      same state* or *nearby states*, the vast geographical distance between SD and
      WA means that *any* county in Washington will be west of *any* county in South
      Dakota. Whatcom County is a western county in a western state (WA). Charles
      Mix County is an eastern-to-central county in a midwestern state (SD).

      5.  **Compare the relative positions:** Since Washington is west of South Dakota,
      Whatcom County (WA) must be west of Charles Mix County (SD).

      3.  **Determine the specific locations within the states:** Otsego County is
      roughly in the central part of New York. Karnes County is in the southern part
      of Texas, southeast of San Antonio.

      4.  **Compare the longitudes:** While not strictly necessary to look up exact
      coordinates for this general question, we know that locations further east have
      higher (closer to 0 or positive) longitudes, and locations further west have
      lower (more negative) longitudes in the Western Hemisphere. Texas is significantly
      west of New York. Therefore, any county in Texas will have a more negative longitude
      than any county in New York.

      5.  **Formulate the comparison:** The question asks if Otsego County, NY is
      *west* of Karnes County, TX. This means we are asking if Otsego County has a
      *more negative* longitude than Karnes County.

      in the central US, south of the Great Lakes. North Dakota is in the upper Midwest,
      bordering Canada.

      3.  **Determine the relative east/west position of the states:** North Dakota
      is significantly further west than Missouri.

      4.  **Consider the specific counties:** While counties within a state can vary
      in their east-west position, the difference in longitude between the states
      is substantial. St. Charles County is near the eastern edge of Missouri (near
      St. Louis). McKenzie County is in the far western part of North Dakota.

      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** Since North Dakota is west of Missouri, and
      McKenzie County is in the western part of ND while St. Charles County is in

      \ County, MI is east of Upton County, TX, the answer to the question \"Is Ontonagon\
      \ County, MI located west of Upton County, TX?\" is NO.\n\n9.  **Final check:**\
      \ Visually imagine a map of the US. Michigan's Upper Peninsula is generally\
      \ north-northeast of central/west Texas. If you draw a line directly west from\
      \ Ontonagon County, you would pass through Minnesota, the Dakotas, Montana,\

      \ you would pass through central/east Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, etc., well\
      \ *south* and *east* of Michigan. This confirms the relative positions.\n\n\
      **Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  Identify the two counties: Ontonagon County,\
      \ MI and Upton County, TX.\n2.  Determine the general location of each state:\
      \ Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, Texas is in the Southwest.\n3.  Determine\
      \ the general location of each county within its state: Ontonagon is in the\
      \ far western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Upton is in West Texas.\n4.  To determine\
      \ if one location is west of another, compare their longitudes. A larger West\
      \ longitude value means further west.\n5.  Ontonagon County, MI is located around\
      \ 89-90\xB0 West longitude.\n6.  Upton County, TX is located around 102-103\xB0\
      \ West longitude.\n7.  Since 102-103 is a larger West longitude value than 89-90,\
      \ Upton County, TX is located west of Ontonagon County, MI.\n8.  Therefore,\
      \ Ontonagon County, MI is located east of Upton County, TX.\n\n**Final Answer\
      \ Derivation:** The question asks if Ontonagon County, MI is *west* of Upton\
      \ County, TX. Our reasoning shows it is *east* of Upton County, TX. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is NO.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  Identify the two locations:\

      \ SD.\n\n3.  **Determine the location of Cullman County, AL:**\n    *   Cullman\
      \ County is in Alabama (AL).\n    *   Alabama is in the southeastern United\
      \ States.\n    *   I need to approximate its longitude. Alabama is generally\
      \ around the 85-88 degrees West longitude range. Cullman County is roughly in\
      \ the northern part of the state. Looking at a map or recalling its position,\
      \ it's likely around 86-87 degrees West longitude. Let's estimate it as approximately\
      \ 87\xB0 W.\n\n4.  **Determine the location of Haakon County, SD:**\n    * \
      \  Haakon County is in South Dakota (SD).\n    *   South Dakota is in the north-central\
