      - Broome County is in New York state, which is in the northeastern United States.

      - Red River County is in Texas, which is in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of New York and Texas.

      Texas, Broome County must be east of Red River County.


      Step 4: To be "west of" something means to be positioned to the left of it on
      a standard map. Since Broome County is to the right (east) of Red River County,
      it cannot be west of it.

      - OH stands for Ohio, which is in the eastern part of the United States.

      - MN stands for Minnesota, which is in the upper Midwest of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Ohio and Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is located to the west of Ohio.

      - Ohio is east of Minnesota.

      - Morrow County is in Ohio (eastern state)

      - Roseau County is in Minnesota (western state)


      Step 4: Since Minnesota is west of Ohio, and these counties are within their
      respective states, Roseau County in Minnesota must be west of Morrow County
      in Ohio.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO

      - Hyde County is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - Van Zandt County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern central part of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Texas is located much further west than North Carolina.


      Step 3: Apply this general positioning to the counties.

      - Hyde County, being in North Carolina, would be positioned in the eastern part
      of the United States.

      - Van Zandt County, being in Texas, would be positioned much further west.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Hyde County is in a state on the east coast (North Carolina) and Van
      Zandt County is in a state much further west (Texas), Hyde County must be east
      of Van Zandt County, not west of it.

      of Ascension Parish, LA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Manassas Park City is in Virginia (VA), which is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      - Ascension Parish is in Louisiana (LA), which is in the southern United States
      along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider general geography of the United States.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Louisiana is located in the south-central part of the United States, west
      of most of the eastern seaboard states.


      Step 3: Compare their approximate longitudes.

      - Virginia locations are generally around 75-80 degrees west longitude.

      - Louisiana locations are generally around 90-95 degrees west longitude.

      - Places with higher west longitude numbers are further west.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Louisiana is further west than Virginia, Ascension Parish (LA) would
      be west of Manassas Park City (VA).

      - Therefore, Manassas Park City is NOT west of Ascension Parish, but rather
      east of it.

      County, MT?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Dade County is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United States.

      - Treasure County is in Montana (MT), which is in the northwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Georgia is located on the eastern side of the United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean.

      - Montana is located in the western part of the United States, much further
      west than Georgia.


      Step 3: Since Montana is west of Georgia, any county in Montana (including Treasure
      County) would be west of any county in Georgia (including Dade County).


      Step 4: Therefore, Dade County, GA is NOT west of Treasure County, MT. In fact,
      it''s the opposite - Treasure County, MT is west of Dade County, GA.

      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Georgia is located in the eastern United States.

      - Montana is located in the western United States.

      - States in the western US (like Montana) are generally west of states in the
      eastern US (like Georgia).


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Georgia is east of Montana, Dade County (in Georgia) would be east of
      any county in Montana, including Treasure County.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positioning
      of these two counties by comparing their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Ontonagon County is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (MI)

      - Upton County is in western Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Michigan is in the northern part of the eastern half of the continental US

      - Texas is in the southern part of the central US


      Step 3: Compare their approximate longitudes.

      - Michigan''s Upper Peninsula is quite far west in Michigan, bordering Wisconsin

      - Ontonagon County is in the western part of the Upper Peninsula

      - Texas extends much further west than most eastern states

      - Upton County is in western Texas, which pushes it significantly westward


      Step 4: Based on US geography, western Texas is generally further west than
      even the westernmost parts of Michigan.
