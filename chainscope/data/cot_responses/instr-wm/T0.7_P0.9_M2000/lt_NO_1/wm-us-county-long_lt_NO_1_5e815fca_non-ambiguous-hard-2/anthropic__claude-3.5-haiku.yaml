      2. Next, let''s locate Calaveras County, CA:

      - Calaveras County is located in central California

      - It is in the Sierra Nevada foothills

      - It is east of the coastal mountain ranges


      3. Now, let''s consider their relative geographic positions:

      - Texas is east of California

      - Hudspeth County is in the westernmost part of Texas

      - Calaveras County is in central California


      4. Comparing their positions:

      - Hudspeth County is east of Calaveras County

      - This means Hudspeth County is NOT west of Calaveras County


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'

      States.


      3. Since Utah is west of Kentucky, any county in Utah would be located west
      of any county in Kentucky.


      4. Therefore, Duchesne County, UT is west of McCracken County, KY.


      5. The question asks if McCracken County is west of Duchesne County.


      6. Since Duchesne County is actually west of McCracken County (not the other
      way around), the answer is:


      NO'
