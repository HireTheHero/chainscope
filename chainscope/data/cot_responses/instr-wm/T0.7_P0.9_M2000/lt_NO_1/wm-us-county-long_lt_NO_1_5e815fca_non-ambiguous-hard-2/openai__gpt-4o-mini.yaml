      1. **Locate Kootenai County, ID**: Kootenai County is located in the northern
      part of Idaho, near the state border with Canada and west of the state of Montana.


      2. **Locate Muskogee County, OK**: Muskogee County is situated in the eastern
      part of Oklahoma, towards the southeastern region of the state.


      3. **Determine their relative positions**: To find out if Muskogee County is
      west of Kootenai County, we need to compare their longitudes. Kootenai County
      is significantly further north and west compared to Muskogee County, which is
      located much further south and east in the United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Muskogee County, OK is located to the east of Kootenai
      County, ID, we conclude that Muskogee County is not west of Kootenai County.

      \ located west of Uintah County, UT, we need to consider the geographical locations\
      \ of both counties.\n\n1. **Walworth County, WI**: This county is located in\
      \ the southeastern part of Wisconsin. Its approximate coordinates are around\
      \ 42.5\xB0 N latitude and 88.5\xB0 W longitude.\n\n2. **Uintah County, UT**:\
      \ This county is located in the northeastern part of Utah. Its approximate coordinates\
      \ are around 40.5\xB0 N latitude and 109.5\xB0 W longitude.\n\n3. **Comparison\
      \ of Longitudes**: \n   - Walworth County's longitude is approximately 88.5\xB0\
      \ W.\n   - Uintah County's longitude is approximately 109.5\xB0 W.\n\n4. **Determining\
      \ the West/East Position**: \n   - A county with a longitude of 88.5\xB0 W is\
      \ east of a county with a longitude of 109.5\xB0 W. \n   - Therefore, since\
      \ 88.5\xB0 W (Walworth County) is less than 109.5\xB0 W (Uintah County), Walworth\
      \ County is to the east of Uintah County.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer\
      \ to the question is:\n\nNO."
