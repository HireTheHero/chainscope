      - North Carolina is on the East Coast of the US

      - Western Texas is much further west


      3. Since Caswell County, NC is on the East Coast and Scurry County, TX is in
      western Texas, Caswell County must be EAST of Scurry County, not west of it.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
    e56c7683-2110-4f03-b000-80e563c6a1d9: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to locate these counties:

      - Caswell County is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Scurry County is in Texas (TX)


      2) When comparing east/west locations in the US:

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast

      - Texas is much further west, in the central part of the country


      3) Any county in North Carolina will be east of any county in Texas, because
      the entire state of North Carolina is east of Texas.


      4) Therefore, Caswell County, NC must be east of Scurry County, TX.


      5) The question asks if Caswell County is WEST of Scurry County, which is the
      opposite of what we determined.


      Answer: NO'

      2. Next, let me consider the specific locations within each state:

      - Catawba County is in western North Carolina

      - Pembina County is in the northeastern corner of North Dakota


      3. Now, I can compare their relative positions:

      - Even though Catawba is in "western" NC, all of North Carolina is still significantly
      east of North Dakota

      - Being in the eastern part of a western state (ND) is still further west than
      being in the western part of an eastern state (NC)


      4. Therefore, Catawba County, NC must be EAST of Pembina County, ND
