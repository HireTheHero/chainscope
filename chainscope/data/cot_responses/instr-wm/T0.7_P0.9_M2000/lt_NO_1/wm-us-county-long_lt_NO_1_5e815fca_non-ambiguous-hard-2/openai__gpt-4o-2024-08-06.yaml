      west of Red River County, TX, we need to consider their geographical positions
      relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of Broome County, NY**: Broome County is located
      in the south-central part of New York State. Its county seat is Binghamton.


      2. **Identify the location of Red River County, TX**: Red River County is in
      the northeastern part of Texas. Its county seat is Clarksville.


      3. **Compare their longitudinal coordinates**: Generally, locations in the eastern
      United States (such as New York) have a higher longitudinal coordinate (further
      east) compared to locations in the western or central parts of the United States
      (such as Texas).


      Since New York is generally located east of Texas, Broome County, NY is likely
      to be east of Red River County, TX.

      1. **Dukes County, MA**: This county is located in the state of Massachusetts
      and primarily comprises the islands of Martha''s Vineyard and the Elizabeth
      Islands. It is situated off the southeastern coast of Massachusetts.


      2. **Ingham County, MI**: This county is located in the state of Michigan, with
      its county seat in Lansing, which is in the central part of the Lower Peninsula
      of Michigan.


      To compare the longitudinal positions:


      - Massachusetts is on the eastern coast of the United States.

      - Michigan is located further west relative to Massachusetts.


      Since Ingham County, MI is in the central part of Michigan, it is indeed west
      of the eastern seaboard where Dukes County, MA is located.


      Thus, Dukes County, MA is east of Ingham County, MI.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**.'

      in the southwestern part of Tennessee.


      2. **Identify the location of Slope County, ND**: Slope County is located in
      the southwestern part of North Dakota.


      3. **Compare their longitudes**: Tennessee is generally located to the east
      of North Dakota.


      Since Tennessee is generally east of North Dakota, McNairy County, TN is located
