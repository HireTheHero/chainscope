      is located west of Roseau County, Minnesota, we need to understand the geographical
      locations of both counties in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Locate Morrow County, Ohio.

      - Morrow County is in central Ohio. Ohio is in the eastern part of the United
      States, though not on the East Coast.


      Step 2: Locate Roseau County, Minnesota.

      - Roseau County is in the far northern part of Minnesota, bordering Canada.
      Minnesota is in the northern central part of the U.S., part of the Midwest,
      and is generally west of Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Ohio is east of Minnesota in general. Therefore, counties in Ohio are typically
      located to the east of counties in Minnesota.

      - Thus, Morrow County, OH is east of Roseau County, MN.

      NO.'

      Step 1: Identify the location of Lane County, Oregon.

      - Lane County is in western Oregon.

      - It includes the city of Eugene and is near the Pacific coast.

      - Oregon is in the Pacific Time Zone and is one of the westernmost states in
      the U.S.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Coke County, Texas.

      - Coke County is in west-central Texas.

      - Texas is in the southern part of the U.S., and Coke County is not on the western
      edge of Texas; it is more central-west.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Oregon is generally farther west than Texas.

      - Even though Coke County is in the western part of Texas, it is still east

      is located west of Edmunds County, SD, we need to understand the relative geographic
      locations of the two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the state locations.

      - Medina County is in the state of Ohio.

      - Edmunds County is in the state of South Dakota.


      Step 2: Understand the general geography of the United States.

      - South Dakota is located in the north-central region of the US, part of the
      Midwest.

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest, bordering Pennsylvania
      and West Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Since South Dakota is generally west of Ohio, most counties within South Dakota
      will be west of counties in Ohio.

      - Therefore, Edmunds County, SD is likely located west of Medina County, OH.


      Conclusion: Medina County, OH is located EAST of Edmunds County, SD.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Becker County, MN.

      - Becker County is located in the northwestern part of Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is in the Upper Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Musselshell County, MT.

      is located west of Zavala County, TX, we need to consider their geographical
      positions in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify where Twiggs County, Georgia is located.

      - Twiggs County is in the state of Georgia, which is in the southeastern part
      of the United States.

      - Georgia is situated to the east of Texas.


      Step 2: Identify where Zavala County, Texas is located.

      - Zavala County is in Texas, which is in the south-central region of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes of the two counties.

      - Longitudes increase as you move westward across the United States.

      - Georgia lies to the east of Texas, so any county in Georgia (including Twiggs
      County) will have a smaller (more eastern) longitude than any county in Texas
      (including Zavala County).


      Therefore, Twiggs County, GA is east of Zavala County, TX.
