      \ consider a film like \"Aradhana\" (1969) by Shakti Samanta, which is well-known,\
      \ and compare it with \"Dostana\" (1980), we can see that Shakti Samanta was\
      \ active and releasing films before Raj Khosla's \"Dostana\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Given the corrected understanding and without the precise details on a \"\
      Geetanjali\" by Shakti Samanta that matches the context (as the details provided\
      \ seem to be mismatched with known filmographies), if we were to consider the\
      \ general filmography of Shakti Samanta and Raj Khosla, Shakti Samanta was indeed\
      \ active and releasing films earlier than the release of \"Dostana\" in 1980.\n\
      \nTherefore, based on the steps and considering the need for accurate film titles\
      \ and release years, the answer would be:\n\nYES"
