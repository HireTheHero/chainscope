      Story was released earlier than Munin Barua''s Nayak, we need to identify the
      release years of both movies.


      Step 1: Find the release year of Vishal Pandya''s Hate Story.

      - "Hate Story" directed by Vivek Agnihotri was released in 2012.

      - However, Vishal Pandya directed the sequels: Hate Story 2 (2014), Hate Story
      3 (2015), and Hate Story 4 (2018).

      - Therefore, Vishal Pandya did not direct the original Hate Story (2012), but
      his first contribution to the series was Hate Story 2 in 2014.


      Step 2: Find the release year of Munin Barua''s Nayak.

      - Munin Barua directed the Assamese film "Nayak" which was released in 2001.


      Step 3: Compare the two release years.

      - Munin Barua''s Nayak: 2001

      - Vishal Pandya''s first Hate Story film (Hate Story 2): 2014


      Conclusion:

      Since 2001 is earlier than 2014, Munin Barua''s Nayak was released earlier than

      the release years of both films.


      Step 1: Identify the release year of Vishal Pandya''s "Hate Story".

      - "Hate Story" is a Bollywood thriller film directed by Vivek Agnihotri, released
      in 2012.

      - However, Vishal Pandya directed the sequels, "Hate Story 2" (2014), "Hate
      Story 3" (2015), and "Hate Story 4" (2018).

      - Therefore, Vishal Pandya was not the director of the original "Hate Story"
      (2012), but the sequels.


      Assuming the question refers to the "Hate Story" series directed by Vishal Pandya,
      the earliest he directed was "Hate Story 2" in 2014.


      Step 2: Identify the release year of Munin Barua''s "Nayak".

      - Munin Barua directed the Assamese film "Nayak", which was released in 2001.


      Step 3: Compare the release years.

      - "Nayak" (2001) was released earlier than "Hate Story 2" (2014) or any other
      installment directed by Vishal Pandya.


      Conclusion:

      Since any "Hate Story" film directed by Vishal Pandya came after 2001, and Munin
      Barua''s "Nayak" was released in 2001, the answer is:


      NO.'
