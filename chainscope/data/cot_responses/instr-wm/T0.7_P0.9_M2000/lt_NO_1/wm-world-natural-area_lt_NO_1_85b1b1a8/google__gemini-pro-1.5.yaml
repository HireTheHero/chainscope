      3. **Estimate/find the area of Lake Windigo:**  Lake Windigo is a sizable lake
      in the BWCAW.  While precise area may be difficult to find quickly, it''s known
      to be a substantial lake used for canoeing and camping trips.

      4. **Estimate/find the area of Lake Phalen:** Lake Phalen is a large urban lake,
      popular for recreation.  Again, precise area might be hard to find immediately,
      but it''s clearly a large lake within city limits.

      5. **Compare the sizes:**  From general knowledge of the two lakes, and their
      contexts (wilderness vs urban), it is highly likely Lake Windigo is larger than
      the urban Lake Phalen.

      The Gulf of Mexico is a large gulf bordered by the US, Mexico, and Cuba. The
      Norwegian Sea is a marginal sea in the Arctic Ocean, north of Norway. The Norwegian
      Sea feels intuitively larger because it''s part of a vast ocean.


      2. **Consider relative sizes:** The Gulf of Mexico is fairly enclosed.  The
      Norwegian Sea opens into the much larger Arctic Ocean.


      3. **Reasoning:**  Seas that are part of larger oceans tend to be bigger than
      gulfs which are more enclosed.

      approximate size:** Upvan Lake is located in Thane, India.  While its exact
      area is difficult to pin down quickly, it''s a relatively small urban lake.


      2. **Identify Jellyfish Lake''s location and approximate size:** Jellyfish Lake
      is located in Palau, part of the Rock Islands. While it''s also a lake, it''s
      considerably larger than a typical urban lake, being a marine lake connected
      to the ocean via fissures and tunnels.


      3. **Compare the sizes:** A small urban lake is almost certainly smaller than
      a marine lake connected to the ocean.

      Lake''s historical area (when full) was approximately 690 square miles.  However,
      it is now mostly dry due to agricultural diversion.  Its current size is much
      smaller and fluctuates.


      2. **Find the area of Ise Bay:** Ise Bay''s area is approximately 680 square
      miles.


      3. **Compare the areas:** Historically, Tulare Lake was larger than Ise Bay
      (690>680). However, in its current, mostly dry state, Tulare Lake is undoubtedly
      smaller.
