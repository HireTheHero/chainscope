      1. **Identify Great Bear Lake and Kattegat**: Great Bear Lake is a large lake
      located in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Kattegat, on the other hand,
      is a sea area located between Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, connecting the North
      Sea and the Baltic Sea.


      2. **Determine the Area of Great Bear Lake**: Great Bear Lake is known to be
      the largest lake entirely within Canada and is among the largest freshwater
      lakes in the world. Its surface area is approximately 31,153 square kilometers
      (12,028 square miles).


      3. **Determine the Area of Kattegat**: Kattegat is not as straightforward to
      measure as a lake because it is a part of the sea. However, we can estimate
      its area. Kattegat is approximately 30,000 square kilometers (11,583 square

      \ length and width.\n\nStep 3: Compare the areas of the two places.\n- Given\
      \ the area of Lake Ilmen as 982 square kilometers, we can compare it to the\
      \ Gulf of \u0130zmir's estimated size. The Gulf of \u0130zmir's length is approximately\
      \ 40 kilometers, and its width varies, but it's generally around 20-30 kilometers.\

      or 4.5 square miles (11.6 square kilometers).

      - Hadero Lake is relatively small and not as well-known as other Ethiopian lakes,
      but it is located in the Awash River basin and is part of the Hadero National
      Park. However, specific area information for Hadero Lake is not readily available.


      Step 3: Compare the areas of the two lakes.

      Given the area of Mountain Island Lake as 4.5 square miles (11.6 square kilometers)
      and the lack of specific area information for Hadero Lake, it is difficult to
      make a direct comparison. However, based on the available information, Mountain
      Island Lake is likely to have a larger area than Hadero Lake.


      Conclusion: Based on the comparison, the answer to whether Mountain Island Lake
      has a smaller area than Hadero Lake is likely to be NO.

      1. **Identify Upvan Lake and Jellyfish Lake**: Upvan Lake is located in Thane,
      Maharashtra, India, and Jellyfish Lake is located on the island of Eil Malk
      in Palau, a country in the western Pacific Ocean.


      2. **Determine the Area of Upvan Lake**: The exact size of Upvan Lake is not
      readily available, but it is a relatively small lake, especially when compared
      to larger lakes or seas.


      3. **Determine the Area of Jellyfish Lake**: Jellyfish Lake is a relatively
      small lake, but its exact size is not easily accessible. It''s worth noting
      that Jellyfish Lake is known for its unique ecosystem and population of non-stinging
      jellyfish.


      4. **Compare the Areas**: Since we don''t have exact measurements for both lakes,
      we can make a rough comparison based on their known characteristics.


      Upvan Lake, being a small lake in India, is likely to have a smaller area than
      Jellyfish Lake, which is a small but notable lake in Palau. However, without
      specific measurements, it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer.

      Step 1: Identify the locations and characteristics of both bodies of water.

      - Lac de Chalain is a lake located in the Jura Mountains in eastern France.

      - Coral Bay is a coastal bay located in Paphos, Cyprus.


      Step 2: Determine the areas of both bodies of water.

      - Lac de Chalain covers an area of approximately 2.32 square kilometers (0.9
      square miles).

      - Coral Bay covers an area that is difficult to determine precisely because
      it''s a coastal bay, but it''s likely to be significantly larger than Lac de
