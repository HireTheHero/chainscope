      Answer: YES'
    d5a2bf19-9cff-4955-961a-de160d65721f: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me check how many Housefull movies exist:

      - Housefull (2010)

      - Housefull 2 (2012)

      - Housefull 3 (2016)

      - Housefull 4 (2019)

      So there are 4 movies in the Housefull franchise.


      2. Now, let me check Alper Mestci''s Siccin series:

      - Siccin (2014)

      - Siccin 2 (2015)

      - Siccin 3 (2016)

      - Siccin 4 (2017)

      - Siccin 5 (2018)

      - Siccin 6 (2019)

      So there are 6 movies in the Siccin series.


      3. Comparing:

      - Housefull franchise: 4 movies

      - Siccin series: 6 movies


      4. Since 4 is less than 6, the Housefull franchise is shorter.

      - "Baton Bunny" (1959) directed by Abe Levitow

      - "To Hare is Human" (1956) directed by Chuck Jones


      2. Let me check their runtimes:

      - "Baton Bunny" is approximately 7 minutes long

      - "To Hare is Human" is approximately 7 minutes long


      3. Since both cartoons are Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies shorts,
      they were made to fit standard theatrical cartoon lengths of the era.

      - "Haunted Castle" (2001) is an animated IMAX film directed by Ben Stassen

      - "God Is the Bigger Elvis" (2012) is a documentary directed by Rebecca Cammisa


      2. Let me check their runtimes:

      - "Haunted Castle" runs approximately 40 minutes

      - "God Is the Bigger Elvis" runs approximately 37 minutes


      3. Comparing the lengths:

      40 minutes > 37 minutes


      Therefore, since Haunted Castle is longer than God Is the Bigger Elvis...


      NO'
