      different LEGO Star Wars specials. For the sake of this question, let''s assume

      film produced by Aardman or similar, it would generally be much shorter than

      1. **Identify the runtime of "Landing Stripling":** "Landing Stripling" is a
      short film directed by Gene Deitch, and like many of his Tom and Jerry shorts,
      it has a typical runtime of approximately 6 to 7 minutes.


      2. **Identify the runtime of "From Hare to Heir":** "From Hare to Heir" is a
      Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. It typically runs around 7 to
      8 minutes.


      3. **Compare the runtimes:** Given the typical runtimes of these types of shorts,
      both films are quite similar in length, but "Landing Stripling" is generally
      on the shorter side in comparison.


      Based on these steps, the answer is: **YES**, "Landing Stripling" is shorter

      1. **American Epic**: This is a series of music documentary films and a larger
      project that includes a three-part documentary series and a feature-length film.
      If we consider only the feature-length film, "American Epic: The Big Bang,"
      it typically runs around 110 minutes. However, if considering the entire documentary
      series, it would be longer.


      2. **Hera Pheri Series**: The "Hera Pheri" series consists of at least two films:
      "Hera Pheri" (2000) and "Phir Hera Pheri" (2006). The runtime for "Hera Pheri"
      is approximately 156 minutes, and "Phir Hera Pheri" is around 153 minutes. This
      totals to around 309 minutes for the two films.


      Comparing the runtimes:

      - If considering only the feature-length film of "American Epic," it is significantly
      shorter than the "Hera Pheri" series.

      - If considering the entire "American Epic" documentary project, it may still
      be shorter than the combined total of the "Hera Pheri" films.


      Given typical criteria where entire series or trilogies are compared against
      each other, the "Hera Pheri" series is longer than the single film or even the
      series episodes individually.


      **NO**, Bernard MacMahon''s "American Epic" is not shorter than Priyadarshan''s
      "Hera Pheri" series.'

      1. **Find the runtime of "The Mouse from H.U.N.G.E.R.":** This short film, part
      of the Tom and Jerry series, was released in 1967. Typically, Tom and Jerry
      shorts from this era run approximately 6 to 7 minutes in length.

      from this period typically run around 7 to 8 minutes.


      3. **Compare the runtimes:** Based on typical runtimes for these types of shorts,
      "The Mouse from H.U.N.G.E.R." is likely around 6 to 7 minutes, while "Southern

      Rao''s "Sri Krishnavataram" is shorter than Wang Bing''s "Fengming, a Chinese
      Memoir," let''s consider the lengths of both films:


      1. **Sri Krishnavataram (1967):** This is an Indian mythological film directed
      by Kamalakara Kameswara Rao. The typical runtime for films of this genre and
      era is usually around 2 to 3 hours.


      2. **Fengming, a Chinese Memoir (2007):** Directed by Wang Bing, this documentary
      film is known for its lengthy runtime. It is approximately 186 minutes (or over
      3 hours long).


      Given these points, "Sri Krishnavataram" is likely to be shorter than "Fengming,
      a Chinese Memoir," as it is uncommon for films from its period and genre to
      exceed 3 hours.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.'

      Now, we compare the two runtimes:
