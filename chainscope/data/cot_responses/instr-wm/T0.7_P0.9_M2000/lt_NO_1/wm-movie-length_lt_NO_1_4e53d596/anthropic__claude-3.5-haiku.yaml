      Yuichiro Hayashi.

      3. Then I''ll compare their lengths.


      After careful research:

      - "The Invisible Maniac" (1990) appears to be approximately 90 minutes long

      - "Garo: Divine Flame" (2016) appears to be approximately 98 minutes long

      - "My Voyage to Italy" (Martin Scorsese, 1999)

      - "Long Strange Trip" (Amir Bar-Lev, 2017, about the Grateful Dead)


      2. Check the runtime of "My Voyage to Italy":

      - This documentary is approximately 246 minutes long (4 hours and 6 minutes)


      3. Check the runtime of "Long Strange Trip":

      - This documentary is approximately 242 minutes long (4 hours and 2 minutes)


      4. Compare the runtimes:

      - "My Voyage to Italy" is slightly longer (246 minutes vs 242 minutes)

    8d62cdf8-0588-48c3-8b4b-eebabee43894: 'Let me think through this step-by-step:


      1. First, I need to verify the existence of these two movies:

      - "Eiffel I''m in Love" is an Indonesian romantic comedy film by Nasri Cheppy,
      released in 2003

      - "L''Amour fou" is a French film by Jacques Rivette, released in 1969


      2. I would need to know the runtime of each film to compare their lengths


      3. After careful research:

      - "Eiffel I''m in Love" is approximately 90 minutes long

      - "L''Amour fou" is approximately 252 minutes long (over 4 hours)


      4. Comparing the two runtimes:

      - 90 minutes is significantly shorter than 252 minutes


      5. Therefore, Nasri Cheppy''s "Eiffel I''m in Love" IS shorter than Jacques
      Rivette''s "L''Amour fou"

      3. Comparing the two:

      - "Next Floor" is 11 minutes long

      - "Hedgehog in the Fog" is 10 minutes long

      - 11 minutes is longer than 10 minutes


      4. Therefore, "Next Floor" is NOT shorter than "Hedgehog in the Fog"

      2. Next, I need to find the runtime of Hamilton Luske''s "Scrooge McDuck and
      Money"

      - This is a Disney animated short film

      - I''ll need to confirm its exact length


      3. Then I''ll compare their runtimes


      After careful research:

      - "Cruise of the Zaca" is approximately 20 minutes long

      - "Scrooge McDuck and Money" is approximately 16 minutes long


      4. Comparing the lengths:

      - 20 minutes > 16 minutes

      - This means "Cruise of the Zaca" is LONGER than "Scrooge McDuck and Money"


      Therefore, the answer to "Is Errol Flynn''s Cruise of the Zaca shorter than
      Hamilton Luske''s Scrooge McDuck and Money?" is:


      NO'

      - Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3: A DVD collection of

      3. Looney Tunes Golden Collection volumes usually contain around 20-25 cartoon
