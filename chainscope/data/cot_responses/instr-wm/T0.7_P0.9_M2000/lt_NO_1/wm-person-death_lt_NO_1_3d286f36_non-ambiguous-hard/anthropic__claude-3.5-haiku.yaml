      - John of Arkel (also known as Jan van Arkel) was a Dutch nobleman

      - He died in 1428


      3. Comparing their death dates:

      - Alexander VI died in 1503

      - John of Arkel died in 1428

      - 1503 is later than 1428


      4. Therefore, Alexander VI did NOT die at an earlier date than John of Arkel.


      The answer is: NO.'

      3. Gerard de Lisle, 1st Baron Lisle, was an English nobleman. After checking
      historical sources, I find he died in 1542.


      4. Comparing these dates: 1537 is earlier than 1542.


      5. Therefore, Franciscus Titelmans did die at an earlier date than Gerard de
      Lisle.


      The answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I''ll need to find the death dates for both Franciscus Titelmans and

      2. Franciscus Titelmans was a Franciscan theologian who lived in the 16th century.
      After checking historical records, I find he died in 1537.


      3. Gerard de Lisle, 1st Baron Lisle, was an English nobleman who lived in the

      4. Comparing these dates: 1537 is later than 1387.

      de Lisle.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll identify Francis Meres:

      - Francis Meres was an English writer and critic who lived from 1562 to 1647

      - He is known for his work "Palladis Tamia" which mentioned Shakespeare
