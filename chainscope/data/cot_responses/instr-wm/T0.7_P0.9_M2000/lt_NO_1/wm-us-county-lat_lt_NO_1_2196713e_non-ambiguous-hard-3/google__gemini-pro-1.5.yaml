      ND, and Quay County, NM.**  I need to know their general locations within the
      United States. North Dakota is in the northern part of the US, and New Mexico
      is in the southwest.


      2. **Compare their latitudes.** Since North Dakota is much further north than
      New Mexico, Billings County, ND, will have a higher latitude than Quay County,
      NM.  Locations further south have lower latitudes.


      3. **Relate latitude to north/south position.**  A higher latitude means further
      north.


      Therefore, Billings County, ND, cannot be south of Quay County, NM.
