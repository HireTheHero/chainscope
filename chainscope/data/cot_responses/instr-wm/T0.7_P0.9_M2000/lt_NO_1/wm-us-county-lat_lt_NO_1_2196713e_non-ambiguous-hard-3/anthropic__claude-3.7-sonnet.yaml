      - Nebraska is in the northern central part of the United States

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States, bordering Mexico


      Step 3: More specifically, determine the relative north-south positioning.

      - Nebraska is significantly north of Texas

      - All Nebraska counties would be north of most Texas counties


      Step 4: Consider Starr County''s specific location in Texas.

      - Starr County is located in the southernmost part of Texas, along the Mexican
      border

      - It''s one of the southernmost counties in the entire United States


      Step 5: Compare the latitudes.

      - Since Nuckolls County is in Nebraska (a northern state) and Starr County is
      in the extreme southern part of Texas, Nuckolls County must be north of Starr
      County, not south.

      - Florida extends southward and is one of the southernmost states in the continental
      US.
