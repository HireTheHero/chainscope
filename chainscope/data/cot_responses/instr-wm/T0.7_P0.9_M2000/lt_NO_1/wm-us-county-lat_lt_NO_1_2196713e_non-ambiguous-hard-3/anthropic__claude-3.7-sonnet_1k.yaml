      First, let me think about the general locations of these states:

      - Michigan is in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - Alabama is in the southern United States


      Generally speaking, Michigan counties will be north of Alabama counties. But
      I should verify the specific locations of these counties.

      positions of these counties.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - Brookings County is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Matagorda County is in Texas (TX)


      In the United States, South Dakota is a northern state, located in the northern
      part of the country. Texas is a southern state, bordering Mexico.


      In terms of latitude:

      - South Dakota is much further north than Texas

      - Therefore, counties in South Dakota are generally north of counties in Texas


      Specifically:

      - Brookings County would be in South Dakota, which is north of Texas

      - Matagorda County would be in Texas, which is south of South Dakota


      So, Brookings County, SD would be NORTH of Matagorda County, TX - not south
      of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two counties

      - Matagorda County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - South Dakota is in the northern part of the United States

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Texas is significantly south of South Dakota

      - All counties in South Dakota would be north of most counties in Texas

      - Matagorda County is particularly far south in Texas, as it''s on the Gulf
      Coast


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on this geographic relationship.

      - Since Brookings County is in South Dakota (a northern state) and Matagorda
      County is in Texas (a southern state), Brookings County must be north of Matagorda
      County, not south.

      First, let me recall where Nebraska and Texas are located relative to each other
      in the United States:

      - Nebraska is in the central part of the US

      - Texas is in the southern part of the US


      Generally speaking, Nebraska is north of Texas. The entire state of Nebraska
      is north of the entire state of Texas.


      Since Kearney County is in Nebraska, and Bee County is in Texas, it follows
      that Kearney County must be north of Bee County.


      If Kearney County is north of Bee County, then it cannot be south of Bee County.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Kearney County is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Bee County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic relationship between Nebraska and Texas.

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - Nebraska is entirely north of Texas on a map of the United States


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the counties.

      - Since Kearney County is in Nebraska, and Nebraska is north of Texas

      - And Bee County is in Texas, which is south of Nebraska

      - Kearney County must be north of Bee County


      Step 4: Answer the specific question asked.

      - If Kearney County is north of Bee County, then it cannot be south of it

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Wisconsin (WI) is located in the northern part of the United States, in the
      Midwest region.

      - Louisiana (LA) is located in the southern part of the United States, in the
      South region.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship of these states.

      Wisconsin is significantly north of Louisiana. Wisconsin borders Canada (via
      Lake Superior) in the north, while Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico in the
      south.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Marathon County is in Wisconsin

      - Vermilion Parish is in Louisiana


      Given that Wisconsin is entirely north of Louisiana, any county in Wisconsin
      (including Marathon County) would be north of any parish in Louisiana (including

      - Vermilion Parish is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Wisconsin is located in the northern United States (Upper Midwest region), while
      Louisiana is located in the southern United States (Gulf Coast region).


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Wisconsin is entirely north of Louisiana on the map of the United States. Wisconsin
      is near the Canadian border, while Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico in the
      south.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific county and parish.

      Since Marathon County is in Wisconsin, and Vermilion Parish is in Louisiana,
      Marathon County must be north of Vermilion Parish.

      2) Specifically, it''s asking if Sibley County, MN is located south of Sabine
      Parish, LA.


      3) To answer this, I need to consider the general geographic positions of Minnesota
      and Louisiana in the United States.


      4) Minnesota is a northern state, bordering Canada, while Louisiana is a southern

      Step 1: Consider the states'' locations in the US.

      Minnesota is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada.

      Louisiana is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Minnesota is significantly north of Louisiana in the United States, any

      locations of these two counties.


      IL stands for Illinois, which is a state in the northern/midwestern United States.

      LA stands for Louisiana, which is a state in the southern United States.


      Generally speaking, Illinois is located north of Louisiana in the United States.
      Illinois borders Wisconsin to the north and extends down to where it borders
      Kentucky in the south. Louisiana is much further south, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      So geographically speaking, any county in Illinois (including Whiteside County)
      should be located north of any parish in Louisiana (including Iberville Parish).


      (Note: Louisiana uses the term "parish" instead of "county" for its administrative
      divisions, but they serve the same function.)


      So my answer is: No, Whiteside County, IL is not located south of Iberville
      Parish, LA. Instead, it is located north of Iberville Parish.</think># Is Whiteside
      County, IL located south of Iberville Parish, LA?


      I need to consider the geographic locations of these two places:


      1) Whiteside County is in Illinois (IL), which is a northern/midwestern state

      2) Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (LA), which is a southern state bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico

      3) The entire state of Illinois is located north of Louisiana on the map of
      the United States

      4) Therefore, any county in Illinois (including Whiteside County) must be located
      north of any parish in Louisiana (including Iberville Parish)


      NO, Whiteside County is not located south of Iberville Parish. It is located
      north of it.'

      locations of Whiteside County, IL and Iberville Parish, LA.


      First, let me identify which states these counties are in:

      - Whiteside County is in Illinois (IL)

      - Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (LA)


      Now, I need to think about the geographical positions of these states. Illinois
      is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Louisiana is in the Southern
      region.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Illinois is located north of Louisiana

      - Louisiana is located in the southern part of the United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico


      Since Whiteside County is in Illinois, and Illinois is north of Louisiana, and
      Iberville Parish is in Louisiana, it follows that Whiteside County must be located
      north of Iberville Parish.


      The question asks if Whiteside County, IL is located south of Iberville Parish,
      LA. Since Whiteside County is actually north of Iberville Parish, the answer
      is NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Whiteside County is in Illinois (IL)

      - Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Louisiana is in the Deep South, bordering the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Illinois is significantly north of Louisiana on the map

      - Louisiana is one of the southernmost states in the continental US


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Whiteside County is in Illinois (a northern state) and Iberville Parish
      is in Louisiana (a southern state), Whiteside County must be located north of
      Iberville Parish, not south of it.

      region of the United States.


      2) Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (LA). Louisiana is a state in the Southern

      3) Generally speaking, Illinois is north of Louisiana in the United States.


      4) To be more precise, I need to consider the specific locations of these counties
      within their respective states.


      Whiteside County is in the northwestern part of Illinois, bordering Iowa.


      Iberville Parish is in the southeastern part of Louisiana.


      Since Illinois is north of Louisiana, and Whiteside County is in Illinois while
      Iberville Parish is in Louisiana, it''s very likely that Whiteside County is
      north of Iberville Parish, not south.

      United States.

      - Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (LA), which is in the Southern region of

      - Illinois is significantly north of Louisiana in the United States.

      - Whiteside County is located in the northwestern part of Illinois.

      - Iberville Parish is located in southern Louisiana.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on latitude.

      - Since Illinois is north of Louisiana, and Whiteside County is in Illinois
      while Iberville Parish is in Louisiana, Whiteside County must be north of Iberville
      Parish.

      - For Whiteside County to be south of Iberville Parish, it would have to be
      at a lower latitude, which is not the case.

      - Illinois is substantially north of Louisiana

      - All counties in Illinois would be north of most or all parishes in Louisiana


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Whiteside County is in Illinois (a northern state) and Iberville Parish
      is in Louisiana (a southern state), Whiteside County must be north of Iberville

      First, let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - South Dakota (SD) is in the northern part of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is in the southern part of the United States


      Just based on this general knowledge, South Dakota is north of Texas. This means
      that counties in South Dakota would be north of counties in Texas, not south
      of them.


      So Hanson County, SD would be north of Bell County, TX, not south of it.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of Hanson County, SD and Bell County, TX.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these counties are located.

      - Hanson County is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Bell County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - South Dakota is located in the northern part of the United States

      - Texas is located in the southern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since South Dakota is significantly north of Texas, all counties in South
      Dakota (including Hanson County) would be north of counties in Texas (including
      Bell County)

      - It''s not possible for Hanson County, SD to be south of Bell County, TX

      - SD stands for South Dakota, which is a northern state in the US

      - TX stands for Texas, which is a southern state in the US


      Step 2: Let me think about their general geographic positions.

      - South Dakota is in the northern part of the United States, bordering North
      Dakota to the north and Nebraska to the south.

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States, bordering Mexico to the
      south.


      Step 3: Given the general geography of the US, South Dakota is located north
      of Texas.


      Step 4: Since Hanson County is in South Dakota, and Bell County is in Texas,
      Hanson County would be north of Bell County.


      Therefore, Hanson County, SD is NOT located south of Bell County, TX. It is
      located to the north.</think># Is Hanson County, SD located south of Bell County,

      - TX is Texas, located in the southern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions.

      - South Dakota is significantly north of Texas in the United States.

      - Texas borders Mexico in the south, while South Dakota is near the Canadian
      border in the north.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions of the counties.

      - Since Hanson County is in South Dakota, and Bell County is in Texas, Hanson
      County must be north of Bell County.

      - For Hanson County to be south of Bell County would contradict the geographic
      arrangement of these states.


      NO, Hanson County, SD is not located south of Bell County, TX. It is located

      - Osborne County is in Kansas (KS)

      - Cameron County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of US states.

      - Kansas is in the central United States

      - Texas is south of Kansas, along the US-Mexico border


      Step 3: More specifically, let''s think about the locations within each state.

      - Osborne County, KS is likely in Kansas, which is entirely north of Texas

      - Cameron County, TX is likely in Texas. And since it''s "Cameron County," it
      might be in the southern part of Texas, possibly near the border with Mexico.


      Step 4: Based on this general understanding of US geography, Osborne County
      in Kansas would be north of Cameron County in Texas, not south of it. This is
      because Kansas as a state is entirely north of Texas.


      Step 5: In fact, Cameron County is the southernmost county in Texas, located
      at the very southern tip of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican border.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Kansas and Texas.

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Texas is located south of Kansas


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of these counties.

      - Osborne County is in north-central Kansas

      - Cameron County is at the southernmost tip of Texas, bordering Mexico and the
      Gulf of Mexico


      Step 4: Given these positions, Osborne County in Kansas must be north of Cameron

      First, let''s think about the states:

      - MT (Montana) is in the northern part of the United States

      - NM (New Mexico) is in the southern part of the United States


      In general, Montana is far north of New Mexico in the United States. Montana
      borders Canada to the north, while New Mexico borders Mexico to the south.


      Since Treasure County is in Montana, and Otero County is in New Mexico, it''s
      very likely that Treasure County is located NORTH of Otero County, not south.


      To be completely sure, I should consider that counties within states could potentially
      have unusual positions, but the difference in latitude between Montana and New
      Mexico is so significant that any county in Montana would be north of any county
      in New Mexico.


      Therefore, Treasure County, MT is NOT located south of Otero County, NM. It
      is located NORTH of Otero County, NM.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:

      if Calumet County, WI (Wisconsin) is located south of Sharkey County, MS (Mississippi).


      To answer this, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of Wisconsin
      and Mississippi in the United States.


      Wisconsin is a northern state in the Midwest region of the United States, bordering
      Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. It shares borders with Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois,
      and Michigan.


      Mississippi is a southern state in the Deep South region of the United States,
      bordering the Gulf of Mexico. It shares borders with Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana,
      and Arkansas.


      Geographically speaking, Wisconsin is much further north than Mississippi in
      the United States. Wisconsin is near the Canadian border, while Mississippi
      is close to the Gulf of Mexico.


      Since Calumet County is in Wisconsin (a northern state) and Sharkey County is
      in Mississippi (a southern state), Calumet County would be NORTH of Sharkey
      County, not south of it.</think># Is Calumet County, WI located south of Sharkey

      3) Wisconsin is a northern state in the Midwest region of the United States

      4) Mississippi is a southern state in the Deep South region

      5) Geographically, Wisconsin is located significantly north of Mississippi


      Since Calumet County is in Wisconsin (a northern state) and Sharkey County is
      in Mississippi (a southern state), Calumet County must be north of Sharkey County,

      Starr County is located in southern Texas, right along the US-Mexico border.
      Texas extends quite far south, and counties along the Mexican border are among
      the southernmost counties in the continental United States.


      Given these facts, Starr County, TX is almost certainly further south than Nuckolls

      - Nebraska is a northern plains state in the central United States

      - Texas is much further south, extending all the way to the Gulf of Mexico and
      the Mexican border


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Even though Nuckolls County is in southern Nebraska, Nebraska itself is entirely

      - Starr County, being on the southern border of Texas, is one of the southernmost
      counties in the continental United States


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on latitude.

      - Nuckolls County in Nebraska has a higher latitude (more northern position)

      - Starr County in Texas has a lower latitude (more southern position)


      NO. Nuckolls County, NE is not located south of Starr County, TX. It is located

      to determine the geographical locations of Kossuth County, IA (Iowa) and Freestone
      County, TX (Texas) and compare their north-south positions.


      First, I know that Iowa is a state in the northern part of the United States,
      located in the Midwest region. Texas is located in the southern United States.


      Geographically speaking, Iowa is north of Texas. The entirety of Iowa is north
      of the entirety of Texas.


      Since Kossuth County is in Iowa, and Freestone County is in Texas, it follows
      that Kossuth County is north of Freestone County.


      The question asks if Kossuth County, IA is located south of Freestone County,
      TX. Since Kossuth County is north of Freestone County (not south), the answer
      is NO.</think>I''ll think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Kossuth County is located in Iowa (IA)

      - Freestone County is located in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Iowa and Texas.

      - Iowa is a Midwestern state in the northern portion of the United States

      - Texas is a Southern state that extends much further south


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Iowa is entirely north of Texas on the map

      - Therefore, any county in Iowa (including Kossuth) must be north of any county
      in Texas (including Freestone)


      Step 4: Answer the specific question about whether Kossuth County is south of
      Freestone County.

      - Since Kossuth County is in Iowa (north) and Freestone County is in Texas (south),
      Kossuth cannot be south of Freestone


      NO'

      First, let me think about the general geography of the United States. Iowa is
      a state in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas is in the South.
      In terms of latitude, Iowa is generally north of Texas.


      Let''s be more specific:

      - Kossuth County is in Iowa (IA)

      - Freestone County is in Texas (TX)


      Since Iowa is north of Texas, it would be reasonable to conclude that Kossuth
      County, IA is north of Freestone County, TX - not south of it.

      - Kossuth County is in Iowa (IA)

      - Freestone County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Iowa and Texas.

      Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Texas is in
      the southern part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      Iowa is significantly north of Texas on the map of the United States. Iowa borders
      Minnesota to the north and Missouri to the south, while Texas is much further
      south, bordering Mexico.


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the counties.

      Since Iowa is north of Texas, Kossuth County (in Iowa) must be north of Freestone
      County (in Texas), not south of it.


      NO, Kossuth County, IA is not located south of Freestone County, TX.'

      Let me think about the geographic locations:


      1. Montana (MT) is a northern state, bordering Canada

      2. California (CA) is a western coastal state, south of Oregon and Washington


      In general, Montana is north of California. But I need to be more specific about
      these particular counties.


      Sanders County is in Montana, so it''s somewhere in that northern state.

      Inyo County is in California, but I need to know where in California.


      Inyo County, if I recall correctly, is in eastern California, containing part
      of Death Valley and is near the Nevada border.


      Given the general geography of the US:

      - Montana is entirely north of California

      - Sanders County, being in Montana, must be north of any county in California

      - Inyo County, being in California, must be south of any county in Montana


      Therefore, Sanders County, MT would be north of Inyo County, CA - not south
      of it.</think># Is Sanders County, MT located south of Inyo County, CA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two counties.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Sanders County is in Montana (MT)

      - Inyo County is in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Montana and California

      Montana is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada.

      California is located on the west coast, significantly south of Montana.


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      All of Montana, including Sanders County, lies north of California.

      Inyo County, being in California, must be south of any county in Montana.


      ## Step 4: Reach conclusion

      Since Sanders County in Montana is north of Inyo County in California, it cannot
      be south of it.


      NO'

      positions of Sanders County, Montana (MT) and Inyo County, California (CA).


      First, let me consider the general geography of the United States. Montana is
      a northern state that borders Canada, while California is on the west coast
      and extends quite far south.


      In terms of north-south positioning (latitude):

      - Montana is generally north of California

      - Sanders County would be somewhere in Montana

      - Inyo County would be somewhere in California


      However, I need to be careful because California is a long state that extends
      quite far north, and some northern California counties might be at similar latitudes
      to some southern Montana counties.


      Let me think about the specific counties:

      - Sanders County is in northwestern Montana

      - Inyo County is in eastern California, containing parts of Death Valley and
      the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains


      Inyo County is in the southern/central eastern part of California, which would
      definitely be south of any county in Montana, including Sanders County.


      So Sanders County, MT would be north of Inyo County, CA, not south of it.</think>#
      Is Sanders County, MT located south of Inyo County, CA?


      Let me think about the locations of these counties:


      1) Sanders County is in Montana (MT), which is a northern state that borders
      Canada.

      2) Inyo County is in California (CA), which is on the west coast.

      3) While California is a long state that extends fairly far north, Inyo County
      specifically is located in east-central/southeastern California, containing
      parts of Death Valley and the eastern Sierra Nevada.

      4) Montana is entirely north of the southern portions of California where Inyo
      County is located.

      5) Therefore, Sanders County in Montana must be north of Inyo County in California,
      not south of it.


      NO, Sanders County, MT is not located south of Inyo County, CA. It is located
      north of it.'

      to determine the relative locations of Sanders County, Montana (MT) and Inyo
      County, California (CA).


      Step 1: Let me recall the general location of Montana and California in the
      United States.

      - Montana is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - In general, Montana is north of California.


      Step 2: Let me think about the specific counties.

      - Sanders County is in Montana, so it''s somewhere in Montana.

      - Inyo County is in California, so it''s somewhere in California.


      Step 3: Let me think about where these counties are within their respective
      states.

      - Sanders County is likely in Montana, which is entirely north of California.

      - Inyo County, CA - I believe this is in eastern California, in the region that
      includes Death Valley.


      Step 4: Given the general geography of the United States, any county in Montana
      would be north of most or all counties in California, since Montana is entirely
      north of California.


      Therefore, Sanders County, MT would be north of Inyo County, CA, not south of
      it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two
      counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      Montana (MT) is located in the northwestern United States, while California
      (CA) is on the west coast. Generally, Montana is positioned north of California
      on a map.


      Step 2: Consider the counties'' positions within their states.

      Sanders County is in Montana, in the northwestern part of the state.

      Inyo County is in eastern California, containing part of Death Valley.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Montana as a state is entirely north of California, any county in Montana
      (including Sanders County) would be north of counties in California (including
      Inyo County).


      Therefore, Sanders County, MT is NOT located south of Inyo County, CA. It is
      located north of it.

      - California (CA) is on the west coast of the United States


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Montana is generally north of California


      Now, to be more specific about these counties:

      - Sanders County would be somewhere in Montana

      - Inyo County would be somewhere in California


      Given that Montana is north of California, it''s likely that Sanders County,
      MT is north of Inyo County, CA. But I should be careful, as a county in the
      very southern part of Montana could potentially be south of a county in the
      very northern part of California.


      However, Inyo County is not in northern California. It''s actually in eastern
      California along the Nevada border, containing Death Valley and parts of the
      Sierra Nevada mountains. It''s in the southern half of California.


      Sanders County is in western Montana, along the Idaho border.


      Given these locations, Sanders County, MT is definitely north of Inyo County,
      CA.</think>To determine if Sanders County, MT is located south of Inyo County,
      CA, I need to consider the geographic positions of both counties.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Montana is located in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.

      California is located on the west coast, south of Oregon and Washington.

      Generally, Montana is north of California.


      Step 2: Consider the specific county locations.

      Sanders County is in western Montana, near the Idaho border.

      Inyo County is in eastern California, containing Death Valley and part of the
      Sierra Nevada mountains. It''s in the southern portion of California.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Given that all of Montana is north of southern California, and Inyo County is
      in southern California, Sanders County must be north of Inyo County.


      NO, Sanders County, MT is not located south of Inyo County, CA. It is located
      north of it.'

      Now I need to think about where these states are located relative to each other.
      Minnesota is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada. Texas
      is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico.


      Since Minnesota is a northern state and Texas is a southern state, counties

      MN is located south of Gregg County, TX, I need to understand the relative geographical
      positions of these counties.


      First, let me identify which states these counties are in:

      - Beltrami County is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Gregg County is in Texas (TX)


      Now, I need to consider the general geographic positions of these states:

      - Minnesota is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - Texas is in the southern United States


      In general, Minnesota is north of Texas. Since Beltrami County is in Minnesota
      and Gregg County is in Texas, it''s very likely that Beltrami County is north
      of Gregg County, not south of it.


      To be precise, I should think about where in their respective states these counties
      are located:

      - Beltrami County is likely in northern or central Minnesota

      - Gregg County is likely in northern, central, or southern Texas


      But regardless of the specific locations within their states, given the substantial
      north-south distance between Minnesota and Texas, it''s almost certain that
      any county in Minnesota would be north of any county in Texas.</think>I need

      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Beltrami County is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Gregg County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada

      - Texas is a southern state near the Gulf of Mexico and Mexican border


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Minnesota is significantly north of Texas on the map of the United States. Even
      the southernmost county in Minnesota would be north of the northernmost county
      in Texas due to the large north-south distance between these states.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Beltrami County is in Minnesota, and Gregg County is in Texas, Beltrami
      County must be north of Gregg County, not south of it.

      - TX (Texas) is in the southern part of the United States, bordering Mexico


      In terms of north-south positioning, Minnesota is definitely north of Texas
      on the map.


      Since Beltrami County is in Minnesota, and Gregg County is in Texas, it follows
      that Beltrami County must be north of Gregg County, not south.

      - Beltrami County is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Gregg County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Compare the general north-south positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - Texas is located in the southern United States, bordering Mexico


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Minnesota is substantially north of Texas on the map of the United States,
      any county in Minnesota (including Beltrami) would be north of any county in

      To answer this, I need to consider the geographic locations of Montana and Texas:

      - Montana is a northern state, bordering Canada

      - Texas is a southern state, bordering Mexico


      In general, Montana is north of Texas. So any county in Montana would be north

      2. Specifically, it''s asking if Fallon County, MT is located south of Pecos
      County, TX.


      To answer this, I need to think about the geographical positions of Montana
      and Texas within the United States.


      Montana is a northern state, bordering Canada. It''s one of the northernmost
      states in the contiguous United States.


      Texas is a southern state, bordering Mexico. It''s one of the southernmost states
      in the contiguous United States.


      Generally speaking, any county in Montana would be north of any county in Texas
      due to the relative positions of these states.


      Since Fallon County is in Montana, and Pecos County is in Texas, Fallon County
      would be north of Pecos County, not south of it.

      County, TX. It is located north of it.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states these counties are in.

      - Fallon County is in Montana (MT)

      - Pecos County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Montana is a northern state, located along the US-Canada border

      - Texas is a southern state, located along the US-Mexico border


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Texas is much farther south


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Montana is significantly north of Texas, any county in Montana (including
      Fallon County) would be north of any county in Texas (including Pecos County),
      not south of it.


      NO, Fallon County, MT is not located south of Pecos County, TX.'

      while Arizona borders Mexico to the south. This means that counties in Montana
      are typically north of counties in Arizona.


      Since Yellowstone County is in Montana, and Gila County is in Arizona, it''s
      highly likely that Yellowstone County is north of Gila County, not south.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO, Yellowstone County, MT is not located south
      of Gila County, AZ. Instead, it would be located north of it.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative positions of Yellowstone County,
      MT and Gila County, AZ.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these counties are located.

      - Yellowstone County is in Montana (MT)

      - Gila County is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Montana is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Montana is significantly north of Arizona on the map. Since Yellowstone County
      is in Montana and Gila County is in Arizona, Yellowstone County must be north
      of Gila County, not south of it.

      Let me think about the general geography of US states first:

      - Montana (MT) is in the northern part of the US, bordering Canada

      - Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern US, bordering Mexico


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Montana is far north, near the Canadian border

      - Arizona is far south, near the Mexican border


      Since Montana is a northern state and Arizona is a southern state, we can generally
      say that counties in Montana would be north of counties in Arizona.


      Therefore, Yellowstone County, MT would be north of Gila County, AZ, not south
      of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations

      - Yellowstone County is in Montana (MT)

      - Gila County is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Montana and Arizona.

      - Montana is a northern state that borders Canada

      - Arizona is a southwestern state that borders Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Montana is significantly farther north in the United States

      - Arizona is in the southern portion of the United States


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the relative positions of the counties.

      Since Yellowstone County is in Montana (a northern state) and Gila County is
      in Arizona (a southern state), Yellowstone County must be north of Gila County,
      not south of it.

      to determine the geographic locations of:

      1. Dubuque County, Iowa (IA)

      2. Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana (LA)


      And then compare their north-south positioning (latitude).


      First, let me recall what I know about these locations:


      Dubuque County is located in the eastern part of Iowa, along the Mississippi
      River. Iowa is in the northern part of the United States, in the Midwest region.


      Avoyelles Parish is in Louisiana. Louisiana is in the southern United States,
      along the Gulf of Mexico.


      In general, Iowa is north of Louisiana in the United States. Iowa is in the
      upper middle part of the country, while Louisiana is much further south.


      So generally speaking, a county in Iowa would be north of a parish in Louisiana.
      But I should verify this with more specific geographic knowledge.


      Dubuque County is in the northeastern part of Iowa, which is still well north
      of Louisiana.

      Avoyelles Parish is in central Louisiana.


      So Dubuque County, IA is north of Avoyelles Parish, LA - not south of it.</think>I
      need to determine whether Dubuque County, Iowa is located south of Avoyelles
      Parish, Louisiana.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Iowa is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States, while Louisiana
      is located in the Deep South along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Compare the general north-south positioning.

      Iowa is significantly north of Louisiana in the United States. The entire state
      of Iowa is north of the entire state of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Dubuque County is in the northeastern part of Iowa, bordering the Mississippi
      River.

      Avoyelles Parish is in central Louisiana.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Dubuque County is in Iowa (a northern state) and Avoyelles Parish is in
      Louisiana (a southern state), Dubuque County must be north of Avoyelles Parish,
      not south of it.

      - Prairie County is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada

      - Arkansas is a southern state in the central United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Minnesota is significantly north of Arkansas in the United States

      - Therefore, counties in Minnesota would be north of counties in Arkansas


      Since Itasca County is in Minnesota (a northern state) and Prairie County is

      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) Whatcom County is in Washington state (WA), which is in the Pacific Northwest
      of the United States.

      2) Merced County is in California (CA), which is south of Washington state.

      3) Whatcom County is actually one of the northernmost counties in Washington

      bordering Canada.


      2. Whatcom County specifically is in the northwestern corner of Washington state,
      bordering Canada. It''s one of the northernmost counties in Washington.


      3. Next, I need to identify where Merced County, CA is located. "CA" stands
      for California, which is south of Washington state along the Pacific coast.


      4. Merced County is located in central California, in what''s known as the San
      Joaquin Valley or Central Valley region of California.


      5. Since Washington state is entirely north of California, and Whatcom County

      First, let me think about the geography of Washington state and California:

      - Washington state is located on the west coast of the United States, north
      of Oregon and California.

      - California is also on the west coast but is south of Washington and Oregon.


      This means that generally, counties in Washington state are north of counties
      in California.


      Now, specifically about these counties:

      - Whatcom County, WA is in the northwestern part of Washington state, bordering
      Canada. It''s one of the northernmost counties in Washington.

      - Merced County, CA is in the central part of California, in the San Joaquin

      - Merced County is located in the central part of California, in the San Joaquin
      Valley.


      Step 3: Compare their relative north-south positions.

      - Since Washington state is entirely north of California state, and Whatcom
      County is in the northern part of Washington, it must be north of any county
      in California, including Merced County.


      NO, Whatcom County, WA is not located south of Merced County, CA. It is located

      Presque Isle County, MI is NOT located south of Bullock County, AL.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of these two
      counties within their respective states.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Michigan (MI) is located in the northern United States, near the Canadian border.

      Alabama (AL) is located in the southern United States, in the Deep South region.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning.

      Michigan is significantly further north than Alabama in the continental United
      States.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific counties.

      Since Presque Isle County is in Michigan, and Bullock County is in Alabama,
      the geographic relationship between the states determines the relationship between
      these counties.


      NO, Presque Isle County, MI is not located south of Bullock County, AL. It is
      located north of it.'

      Step 1: First, I need to understand where these counties are located in their
      respective states.

      - Lenawee County is in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern United States.

      - Hernando County is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Michigan and Florida.

      - Michigan is a northern state, bordering Canada.

      - Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental US.


      Step 3: Based on US geography, Florida is generally south of Michigan. This
      means that counties in Florida would typically be south of counties in Michigan.


      Therefore, Lenawee County, MI would be north of Hernando County, FL, not south
      of it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these
      two counties.

      - Hernando County is in Florida (FL), which is in the southernmost part of the
      continental United States


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions

      - Michigan is located much further north than Florida

      - Florida extends southward toward the Caribbean

      - All Michigan counties are north of most Florida counties


      Step 3: Make the specific comparison

      - Lenawee County is in southern Michigan, but even southern Michigan is far
      north of Florida

      - Hernando County is in west-central Florida, which is significantly south of
      any point in Michigan


      Conclusion: NO, Lenawee County, MI is NOT located south of Hernando County,
      FL. It is located north of it.'

      Dakota and New Mexico within the United States.


      4. North Dakota is a northern state, bordering Canada, and is located in the
      upper Midwest of the United States.


      5. New Mexico is a southwestern state, bordering Mexico, and is much further
      south than North Dakota.


      6. Since Billings County is in North Dakota, and Quay County is in New Mexico,
      it''s very likely that Billings County is north of Quay County, not south of
      it.


      7. North Dakota is entirely north of New Mexico on a map of the United States.</think>#
      Is Billings County, ND located south of Quay County, NM?


      I need to think about the geographic positions of these counties and their states.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. Billings County is in North Dakota (ND)

      2. Quay County is in New Mexico (NM)

      3. North Dakota is a northern state near the Canadian border

      4. New Mexico is a southwestern state near the Mexican border

      5. On a map of the US, North Dakota is significantly north of New Mexico

      6. Therefore, any county in North Dakota (including Billings County) would be
      north of any county in New Mexico (including Quay County)


      ## Answer: NO


      Billings County, ND is not south of Quay County, NM. It is north of it.'
