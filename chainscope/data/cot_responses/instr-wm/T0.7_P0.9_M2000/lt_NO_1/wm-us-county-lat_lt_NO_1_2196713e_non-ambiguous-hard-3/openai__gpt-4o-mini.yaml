      located in the southwestern part of South Dakota. It is known for its proximity
      to the Black Hills region and is bordered by Nebraska to the south.


      2. **Identify the Location of Reeves County, TX**: Reeves County is located
      in West Texas, specifically in the Trans-Pecos region. It is situated just north
      of the border with Mexico.


      3. **Comparative Positioning**: To assess whether Fall River County is south
      of Reeves County, we can look at their latitudinal positions. Fall River County,
      SD, is situated at a higher latitude compared to Reeves County, TX. Generally,
      areas that are further north have higher latitude numbers.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Fall River County is located at a higher latitude than
      Reeves County, it is to the north of Reeves County.
