      *   Freestone County, TX: Approximately 31.5\xB0 N\n\n**Step 4: Determine which\
      \ county is further south.**\nA lower North latitude means a location is further\
      \ south. Since 31.5\xB0 N (Freestone County) is lower than 43\xB0 N (Kossuth\

      1.  **Locate Walworth County, WI:** Walworth County is in southeastern Wisconsin.

      2.  **Locate Geneva County, AL:** Geneva County is in southeastern Alabama.

      3.  **Determine the approximate latitude of Walworth County, WI:** Wisconsin
      is a northern state. Walworth County is roughly around 42-43 degrees North latitude.

      4.  **Determine the approximate latitude of Geneva County, AL:** Alabama is
      a southern state. Geneva County is roughly around 31-31.5 degrees North latitude.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** A higher North latitude means the location is
      further north. 42-43 degrees North is significantly higher (further north) than
      31-31.5 degrees North.


      Therefore, Walworth County, WI is located *north* of Geneva County, AL.

      2.  **Locate Geneva County, AL:** Geneva County is in the southeastern part
      of Alabama.

      3.  **General Geographic Understanding:** Wisconsin is in the northern Midwest.
      Alabama is in the southeastern United States.

      4.  **Compare Latitudes (Conceptual):** States in the northern US are generally

      is significantly north of Alabama. Therefore, any county in Wisconsin will be
      north of any county in Alabama, latitude-wise.


      Given this, Walworth County, WI, is clearly located **north** of Geneva County,

      **Step 1: Locate Edmunds County, SD.**

      Edmunds County is in South Dakota. South Dakota is in the upper Midwest of the
      United States.


      **Step 2: Locate Stonewall County, TX.**

      Stonewall County is in Texas. Texas is in the southern part of the United States.


      **Step 3: Compare their relative latitudes.**

      South Dakota is significantly north of Texas. Therefore, any county in South
      Dakota will be north of any county in Texas.


      **Conclusion:** Edmunds County, SD is located **north** of Stonewall County,
      TX.

      1.  **Locate Nance County, NE:** This county is in Nebraska, which is in the
      northern part of the Great Plains region of the US.

      2.  **Locate Karnes County, TX:** This county is in Texas, which is in the southern
      part of the US, bordering Mexico.

      3.  **Compare Latitudes:** Without even looking at a map, it''s clear that Nebraska
      is significantly north of Texas. Therefore, any county in Nebraska will be north
      of any county in Texas.


      **Conclusion:** Nance County, NE is located *north* of Karnes County, TX.

      1.  **Identify Nance County, NE:** This county is in Nebraska. Nebraska is in
      the central United States, generally north of Texas.


      2.  **Identify Karnes County, TX:** This county is in Texas. Texas is in the
      southern United States.


      3.  **Determine relative latitude:** Without looking at exact coordinates, a
      state like Nebraska is fundamentally north of a state like Texas. Therefore,
      any county in Nebraska will be north of any county in Texas.


      4.  **Formulate the comparison:** The question asks if Nance County, NE is *south*
      of Karnes County, TX. Based on the previous steps, Nance County, NE is clearly
      *north* of Karnes County, TX.
