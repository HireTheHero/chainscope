      Minnesota is located south of Archer County, Texas, we need to consider the
      geographic positions (specifically, the latitude) of both counties.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Lac qui Parle County, Minnesota.

      - Lac qui Parle County is located in western Minnesota, near the border with
      South Dakota.

      - Minnesota is a northern U.S. state, and Lac qui Parle County is situated in
      the upper Midwest.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Archer County, Texas.

      - Archer County is located in northern Texas, near the city of Wichita Falls.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Lac qui Parle County is approximately at a latitude of about 45 degrees North.

      - Archer County is approximately at a latitude of about 33.6 degrees North.


      Step 4: Determine which is farther south.

      - A lower latitude number means a location is farther south.

      - 33.6 (Archer County) is lower than 45 (Lac qui Parle County), so Archer County
      is farther south.


      Therefore, Lac qui Parle County, MN is located north of Archer County, TX.
