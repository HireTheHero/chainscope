      the relative locations of Presque Isle County, MI, and Gila County, AZ.


      1. **Locate Presque Isle County, MI**: This county is in the state of Michigan,
      specifically in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula, along the northeastern
      shore of Lake Huron.


      2. **Locate Gila County, AZ**: This county is in the state of Arizona, which
      is in the southwestern United States. Gila County is centrally located in Arizona.
