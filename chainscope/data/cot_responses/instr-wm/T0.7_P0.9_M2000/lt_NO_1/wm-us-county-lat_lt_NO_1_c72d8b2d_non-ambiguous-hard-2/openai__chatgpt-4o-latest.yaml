      locations (specifically the latitudes) of both counties.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Grand Isle County, Vermont.

      - Grand Isle County is located in the northwestern corner of Vermont.

      - Vermont is in the northeastern United States, and Grand Isle County is near
      the Canadian border.

      - Thus, Grand Isle County is at a relatively high latitude (i.e., farther north).


      Step 2: Identify the location of Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana.

      - Calcasieu Parish is located in southwestern Louisiana.

      - Louisiana is in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.

      - Therefore, Calcasieu Parish is at a relatively low latitude (i.e., farther
      south).


      Step 3: Compare the two latitudes.

      - Grand Isle County, VT is much farther north than Calcasieu Parish, LA.

    26aac5af-2a12-4ff4-87c5-9ac250960928: 'To determine whether Windsor County, Vermont
      is located south of Coleman County, Texas, we need to consider their geographic
      positions in terms of latitude.


      Step 1: Identify the general location of each county.


      - Windsor County is in the state of Vermont, which is located in the northeastern
      United States, near the Canadian border.

      - Coleman County is in central Texas, which is in the southern part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.


      - Windsor County, VT is approximately around 43.6 degrees North latitude.

      - Coleman County, TX is approximately around 31.8 degrees North latitude.


      Step 3: Analyze the comparison.


      - A higher latitude number in the Northern Hemisphere means a location is farther
      north.

      - 43.6 (Windsor) is greater than 31.8 (Coleman), so Windsor County is farther
      north than Coleman County.


      Therefore, Windsor County, VT is not located south of Coleman County, TX.

      is located south of Zavala County, TX, we need to analyze the relative geographic
      positions of these two counties within the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Summit County, Ohio.

      - Summit County is located in the northeastern part of the state of Ohio.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Summit County includes the city of Akron and lies at a relatively northern
      latitude in the U.S.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Zavala County, Texas.

      - Zavala County is in the southern part of Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border.

      - Texas is in the southern region of the United States.

      - Zavala County is situated at a relatively southern latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Ohio is significantly farther north than Texas.

      - Therefore, Summit County, OH must be north of Zavala County, TX.


      Final determination:

      Since Summit County, OH is north of Zavala County, TX, it is not located south
      of it.

      Dakota (SD) is located south of Sterling County, Texas (TX), we need to consider
      the relative geographic positions of the two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Spink County, SD.

      - Spink County is located in the northern part of the United States, in the
      state of South Dakota.

      - South Dakota is in the northern central region of the U.S., bordering North
      Dakota to the north.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Sterling County, TX.

      - Sterling County is located in Texas, which is in the southern part of the
      United States.

      - More specifically, Sterling County is in western-central Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - South Dakota is significantly farther north than Texas.

      - Therefore, Spink County, SD, is north of Sterling County, TX.


      Conclusion:

      Spink County, SD is located to the north of Sterling County, TX.
