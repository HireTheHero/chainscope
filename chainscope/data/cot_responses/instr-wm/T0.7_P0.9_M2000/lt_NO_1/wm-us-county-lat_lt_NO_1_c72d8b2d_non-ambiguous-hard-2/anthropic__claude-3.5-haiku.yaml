      - Reeves County is much further south

      - There is a significant distance between these two counties


      4. Determining relative position:

      - Since Edmunds County is in South Dakota (north)

      - And Reeves County is in Texas (south)

      - Edmunds County is NOT south of Reeves County


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Dubuque County, IA (Iowa)

      - This county is in northeastern Iowa

      - It is located near the Mississippi River


      2. Next, I''ll locate Geneva County, AL (Alabama)

      - This county is in southeastern Alabama

      - It is located in the southern part of the state, near Florida


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Dubuque County is much further north (in Iowa)

      - Geneva County is much further south (in Alabama)


      4. So Dubuque County is definitively north of Geneva County


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Treasure County, Montana

      - Treasure County is located in southeastern Montana


      2. Next, I''ll locate Cottle County, Texas

      - Cottle County is located in north-central Texas


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Montana is north of Texas

      - So any county in Montana would be north of any county in Texas


      4. Therefore, Treasure County, MT is north of Cottle County, TX, not south of
      it.
