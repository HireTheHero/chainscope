      Presque Isle County is in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern part of the
      United States, bordering Canada. Michigan is in the Great Lakes region.


      Gila County is in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern part of the United
      States, bordering Mexico.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Michigan is generally north of Arizona

      - Presque Isle County, being in Michigan, would be north of most places in Arizona

      - Gila County, being in Arizona, would be south of most places in Michigan


      So, Presque Isle County, MI would be NORTH of Gila County, AZ - not south of
      it.

      Let me think about the general locations:

      1. Presque Isle County, MI is in Michigan, which is in the northern part of
      the United States.

      2. Gila County, AZ is in Arizona, which is in the southwestern part of the United
      States.


      Generally speaking, Michigan is north of Arizona. Michigan borders Canada in
      the north-central part of the US, while Arizona is on the US-Mexico border in
      the southwest.


      To be more precise:

      - Presque Isle County is in the northeastern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula,
      bordering Lake Huron.

      - Gila County is in central Arizona.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Michigan is significantly further north than Arizona

      - Therefore, Presque Isle County, MI would be north of Gila County, AZ - not
      south of it.


      So my conclusion is that Presque Isle County, MI is NOT located south of Gila
      County, AZ. It''s located north of it.</think>I''ll solve this by comparing

      Step 1: Identify the general locations of both counties.

      - Presque Isle County is in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern United States.

      - Gila County is in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions in terms of latitude (north-south positioning).

      - Michigan is a northern state that borders Canada.

      - Arizona is a southwestern state that borders Mexico.


      Step 3: More specifically for these counties:

      - Presque Isle County is in the northeastern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.

      - Gila County is in central Arizona.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about their relative positions.

      - States in the northern US (like Michigan) are generally north of states in

      relative locations of two US counties:

      1. Bath County, Kentucky (KY)

      2. Starr County, Texas (TX)


      Specifically, it''s asking if Bath County, KY is located south of Starr County,
      TX.


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographic locations of Kentucky
      and Texas.


      Kentucky is a state in the eastern United States, located in the Upper South
      region.

      Texas is a state in the south-central United States, bordering Mexico to the
      south.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Kentucky is generally much further north than southern Texas

      - Texas extends quite far south, with its southern border touching Mexico

      - Starr County, TX is very likely in southern Texas, probably near the Mexican
      border

      - Bath County, KY would be somewhere in Kentucky, which is entirely north of
      Texas


      Based on general U.S. geography knowledge, Kentucky is north of Texas. Even
      the southernmost part of Kentucky would be north of the southernmost parts of
      Texas. Starr County, being in Texas and likely near the Mexican border, would
      be far south. Bath County in Kentucky would be much further north.


      Therefore, Bath County, KY is NOT south of Starr County, TX. It would be NORTH

      region

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States, extending to the
      Mexican border


      ## Step 2: Analyze specific county locations

      - Bath County is in Kentucky, which is entirely north of Texas

      - Starr County is in Texas, and specifically is one of the southernmost counties
      in Texas, located right on the Mexican border


      ## Step 3: Compare latitudes

      - Kentucky''s southern border is significantly north of Texas''s southern border

      - Even the southernmost point of Kentucky is well north of where Starr County

      - Beltrami County is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Randolph County is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state on the Atlantic coast


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - North Carolina is much further south than Minnesota


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the counties.

      Since Beltrami County is in Minnesota (a northern state) and Randolph County
      is in North Carolina (a more southern state), Beltrami County must be north
      of Randolph County, not south of it.


      NO, Beltrami County, MN is not located south of Randolph County, NC.'

      I need to figure out whether Beltrami County, MN is south of Randolph County,
      NC. Let me think about the locations of Minnesota and North Carolina in the
      United States:


      - Minnesota is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States along the Atlantic coast


      In terms of latitude:

      - Minnesota is generally much further north than North Carolina

      - This means counties in Minnesota are typically north of counties in North
      Carolina


      Beltrami County is in Minnesota, so it''s in a northern state.

      Randolph County is in North Carolina, so it''s in a southeastern state.


      Given the general geography of the United States, Minnesota is north of North

      located south of Wichita County, TX?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two counties
      by examining their locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the general locations of the states

      - Minnesota (MN) is in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - Texas (TX) is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico


      ## Step 2: Consider the specific county locations

      - Morrison County is located in central Minnesota

      - Wichita County is in northern Texas, near the Oklahoma border


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Even though Wichita County is in the northern portion of Texas, Texas itself
      is significantly farther south than Minnesota. The northernmost parts of Texas
      are still well south of the central portions of Minnesota.

      - Kossuth County is in Iowa (IA)

      - McMullen County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is located in the southern United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - Iowa is significantly north of Texas on the map

      - All counties in Iowa are therefore north of most or all counties in Texas


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      Since Iowa is north of Texas, Kossuth County, IA would be north of McMullen

      - Natrona County is in Wyoming (WY)

      - Live Oak County is in Texas (TX)


      Now, I need to think about the geographic relationship between Wyoming and Texas.
      Wyoming is in the northern part of the United States, while Texas is in the

      Lucas County is in Ohio (OH), which is in the northern part of the United States.
      Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north and is generally considered part of the
      Midwest region.


      Highlands County is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States

      latitudes than states in the southern US (like Florida). On a map of the United

      4) Florida is one of the southernmost states in the continental US, while Ohio
      is relatively far north, bordering Lake Erie.

      5) Since Lucas County is in Ohio, and Highlands County is in Florida, Lucas
      County must be north of Highlands County.


      Therefore, Lucas County, OH is NOT located south of Highlands County, FL.

      - Georgia (GA) is in the southeastern part of the US, along the Atlantic coast


      In terms of latitude:

      - Wyoming is generally much further north than Georgia

      - Georgia is one of the southern states, while Wyoming is in the northern half

      To solve this, I need to think about the geographical positions of Washington

      1. Washington state is in the northwest corner of the contiguous United States,
      bordering Canada to the north.

      2. New Mexico is in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico to the
      south.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Washington is one of the northernmost states in the US

      - New Mexico is much further south


      Within these states:

      - Whatcom County is in the northern part of Washington, right on the Canadian
      border

      - Quay County is in eastern New Mexico


      Since Washington state is entirely north of New Mexico, Whatcom County (in northern

      2) Quay County is in New Mexico (NM), which is located in the southwestern United

      Step 1: Let me identify the states.

      - WI stands for Wisconsin, which is in the northern United States

      - TX stands for Texas, which is in the southern United States


      Step 2: In general, Wisconsin is located north of Texas in the United States.
      Wisconsin is in the northern part of the country, bordering Canada, while Texas
      is in the southern part of the country, bordering Mexico.


      Step 3: If Wisconsin is north of Texas, then counties in Wisconsin would be
      north of counties in Texas (barring some unusual county boundary configurations,
      which are unlikely to cross state lines to this degree).


      Step 4: Therefore, Brown County, Wisconsin would be located north of Young County,
      Texas - not south of it.


      So the answer is NO, Brown County, WI is not located south of Young County,
      TX. It''s located north of it.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Brown County is in Wisconsin (WI), which is located in the northern United
      States.

      - Young County is in Texas (TX), which is located in the southern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions.

      Wisconsin is significantly north of Texas on the map of the United States. Wisconsin
      borders Lake Superior and is close to Canada, while Texas extends to the Gulf
      of Mexico and borders Mexico.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions of counties.

      Since Wisconsin is north of Texas, Brown County (in Wisconsin) must be north
      of Young County (in Texas).


      NO, Brown County, WI is not located south of Young County, TX. It is located

      - Texas (TX) is in the southern United States, south of Nebraska


      In general, any county in Nebraska would be north of any county in Texas simply
      because of the geographic positions of these states. Texas borders Mexico to
      the south, while Nebraska is much further north.


      So without even knowing the specific locations of these counties within their
      states, I can determine that:

      - Kearney County, NE would be north of Karnes County, TX

      - Karnes County, TX would be south of Kearney County, NE


      Therefore, Kearney County, NE is NOT located south of Karnes County, TX. It''s

      - Nebraska (NE) is located in the central United States

      - Texas (TX) is located in the southern United States


      Nebraska is entirely north of Texas on the map of the United States. Since Kearney
      County is in Nebraska and Karnes County is in Texas, this means:


      - Kearney County, NE must be north of Karnes County, TX

      - Karnes County, TX must be south of Kearney County, NE


      Therefore, Kearney County, NE is NOT located south of Karnes County, TX.

      - Nebraska is significantly north of Texas on the map

      - Any county in Nebraska would therefore be north of any county in Texas


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Since Kearney County is in Nebraska and Karnes County is in Texas, Kearney County
      must be north of Karnes County, not south of it.

      - Idaho borders Canada at its northern end and Utah/Nevada at its southern end

      - Texas is along the Gulf of Mexico at its southern end and borders Oklahoma

      Is Jerome County, ID located south of Colorado County, TX?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two counties
      by examining their geographic locations.

      First, let me identify where each county is located:

      - Jerome County is in Idaho (ID), which is in the northwestern United States

      - Colorado County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States


      Generally speaking, Idaho is north of Texas. The northern states tend to have
      higher latitudes than southern states in the US.


      Idaho is near the Canadian border, while Texas borders Mexico. This already
      suggests that Jerome County, ID is likely north of Colorado County, TX.


      To be more precise:

      - Jerome County, ID is located in southern Idaho, but even southern Idaho is
      quite far north compared to Texas

      - Colorado County, TX is in southeastern Texas


      Given these geographical positions, Jerome County, ID would be north of Colorado
      County, TX, not south of it.


      Therefore, the answer should be NO - Jerome County, ID is NOT located south
      of Colorado County, TX.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south

      Step 1: Identify the locations of each county.

      - Jerome County is in Idaho (ID), which is in the northwestern United States.

      - Colorado County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the US.

      - Idaho is a northern state, bordering Canada at its northern edge.

      - Texas is a southern state, with parts of it bordering Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Even the southernmost parts of Idaho are generally north of the northernmost
      parts of Texas.

      - Jerome County is in southern Idaho, but Colorado County is in southeast Texas.

      - Idaho''s latitude range is much further north than Texas''s latitude range.


      NO - Jerome County, ID is not located south of Colorado County, TX. It is located
      north of it.'

      step:


      1. The question is asking about the relative locations of two US counties: Jerome
      County, ID (Idaho) and Colorado County, TX (Texas).

      2. Specifically, I need to determine if Jerome County, ID is located south of
      Colorado County, TX.


      To answer this, I need to think about the general geography of the United States:


      3. Idaho (ID) is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.

      4. Texas (TX) is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico.

      5. Therefore, Idaho is generally north of Texas in terms of latitude.


      Since Jerome County is in Idaho, and Colorado County is in Texas, Jerome County
      would be located north of Colorado County, not south of it.</think>I need to
      determine the relative north-south positions of these two counties.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Idaho is located in the northwestern United States

      - Texas is located in the southern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Idaho is much further north in the country compared to Texas

      - All counties in Idaho would be at higher latitudes (more northern) than counties
      in Texas


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Since Jerome County is in Idaho (a northern state) and Colorado County is
      in Texas (a southern state), Jerome County must be north of Colorado County,
      not south of it.

      Vermont is one of the northernmost states in the US.

      Texas is much further south than Vermont.


      Step 3: Compare county positions.

      Since Windsor County is in Vermont, and Coleman County is in Texas, Windsor
      County must be significantly north of Coleman County.

      3. South Dakota is located in the northern part of the United States

      4. Texas is located in the southern part of the United States

      5. All counties in South Dakota are geographically north of all counties in

      First, I need to identify the states:

      - SD stands for South Dakota, which is a northern state in the US

      - TX stands for Texas, which is a southern state in the US


      Generally speaking, South Dakota is north of Texas in the United States. South
      Dakota borders North Dakota to the north, Minnesota and Iowa to the east, Nebraska

      Since Edmunds County is in South Dakota, and Reeves County is in Texas, and
      South Dakota is north of Texas, it follows that Edmunds County, SD is north
      of Reeves County, TX, not south of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south

      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - South Dakota is in the northern part of the United States

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States

      - South Dakota is significantly north of Texas on the map


      Step 3: Since counties are contained within their respective states, the relative
      positions of the counties must follow the same pattern.

      - Edmunds County must be north of Reeves County because South Dakota is north
      of Texas

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. Edmunds County is located in South Dakota (SD)

      2. Reeves County is located in Texas (TX)

      3. Geographically, South Dakota is a northern state in the US

      4. Texas is located in the southern United States

      First, I need to think about the general geography of the United States. South
      Dakota (SD) is a state in the northern United States, while Texas (TX) is in
      the southern United States. Generally speaking, South Dakota is north of Texas.


      Since Edmunds County is in South Dakota, and Reeves County is in Texas, it''s
      very likely that Edmunds County is north of Reeves County, not south of it.


      To be more precise:

      - South Dakota shares borders with North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska,
      Wyoming, and Montana. It''s in the north-central part of the country.

      - Texas is at the southern border of the United States, sharing a border with
      Mexico.

      - South Dakota is a northern state, located in the north-central United States

      - Texas is a southern state, bordering Mexico at the southern edge of the US


      Step 3: Determine the relative position.

      Since South Dakota is significantly north of Texas in the United States, any
      county in South Dakota (including Edmunds County) would be north of any county
      in Texas (including Reeves County).


      NO, Edmunds County, SD is not located south of Reeves County, TX. It is located

      to determine the geographical locations of Bingham County, ID and Conecuh County,
      AL, and figure out if Bingham County is south of Conecuh County.


      First, let''s identify the states:

      - Bingham County is in Idaho (ID), which is in the northwestern part of the
      United States

      - Conecuh County is in Alabama (AL), which is in the southeastern part of the
      United States


      In terms of general north-south positioning in the United States:

      - Idaho is further north compared to Alabama

      - Alabama is in the Deep South of the US, while Idaho is in the northern part
      of the country


      Given this general understanding of US geography, Bingham County in Idaho should
      be NORTH of Conecuh County in Alabama, not south.


      To be more precise, we could think about the latitudes:

      - Counties in Idaho would typically have higher latitudes (more northern) than
      counties in Alabama

      - Bingham County, ID would be at a higher latitude than Conecuh County, AL


      Therefore, Bingham County, ID is NOT located south of Conecuh County, AL. It''s
      located north of it.</think>I''ll solve this step by step by comparing the geographic
      positions of these counties.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties by state.

      - Bingham County is in Idaho (ID), which is in the northwestern United States.

      - Conecuh County is in Alabama (AL), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - Idaho is located in the northern part of the country.

      - Alabama is located in the southern part of the country, specifically in the
      Deep South.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - States in the northwestern US (like Idaho) are located significantly north
      of states in the southeastern US (like Alabama).

      - Therefore, counties in Idaho would be north of counties in Alabama.


      NO, Bingham County, ID is not located south of Conecuh County, AL. It is located
      north of it.'

      - Alabama borders Tennessee to the north and Florida to the south (with Florida

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Idaho is located in the northwestern United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Idaho is much further north in the United States

      - Louisiana is one of the southernmost states in the continental US


      Step 4: Make the comparison between the specific county and parish.

      - Since Owyhee County is in Idaho, it inherits Idaho''s northern position

      - Since Iberville Parish is in Louisiana, it inherits Louisiana''s southern
      position

      Idaho is in the northwestern part of the United States, bordering Canada, while
      Louisiana is in the southeastern part of the United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      In terms of north-south orientation:

      - Idaho is much further north than Louisiana

      - Therefore, any county in Idaho (including Owyhee County) would be north of
      any parish in Louisiana (including Iberville Parish)

      Owyhee County must be NORTH of Iberville Parish, not south of it.</think>I need

      - Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (LA), which is a southern state near the

      - Idaho is much further north in the United States, positioned in the northern
      part of the country.

      - Louisiana is in the deep south of the United States.


      Step 3: Since Owyhee County is in Idaho (a northern state) and Iberville Parish

      To solve this, I need to think about the geographic locations of Idaho and Louisiana

      Idaho is in the northwestern part of the United States, bordering Canada to
      the north. It''s positioned in the Rocky Mountain region.


      Louisiana is in the southern United States, along the Gulf of Mexico.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - States in the northern US have higher latitude values

      - States in the southern US have lower latitude values


      Idaho, being in the northwest, is considerably north of Louisiana, which is
      in the deep south.


      Therefore, Owyhee County in Idaho would be NORTH of Iberville Parish in Louisiana,
      not south of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two counties by considering their states'' locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Owyhee County is in Idaho (ID)

      - Iberville Parish is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Idaho is located in the northwestern United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States along the Gulf of Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Idaho is much farther north in the country than Louisiana

      - All counties in Idaho would be north of parishes in Louisiana


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about Owyhee County and Iberville Parish specifically.

      - Since Owyhee County is in Idaho (a northern state) and Iberville Parish is
      in Louisiana (a southern state), Owyhee County must be north of Iberville Parish,
      not south of it.

      Specifically, I need to determine if Gogebic County is south of Scurry County.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Michigan is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States, bordering Mexico


      In terms of latitude:

      - Michigan is generally much further north than Texas

      - Michigan is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Texas is one of the southernmost states in the contiguous US


      Since Gogebic County is in Michigan, and Scurry County is in Texas, it''s very
      likely that Gogebic County is NORTH of Scurry County, not south.


      To be more precise, Gogebic County is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which
      is the northernmost part of Michigan. This makes it even more certain that it''s
      north of any county in Texas.</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two counties by comparing their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these counties.

      - Gogebic County is located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (MI), which is
      in the northern United States.

      - Scurry County is located in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their general positions.

      - Michigan is significantly north of Texas in the United States.

      - The Upper Peninsula of Michigan is the northernmost part of Michigan, bordering
      Lake Superior and Canada.

      - Texas is much farther south, extending toward the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Make the latitude comparison.

      - Counties in Michigan''s Upper Peninsula are at much higher latitudes (further
      north) than counties in Texas.

      - Gogebic County is located in one of the northernmost regions of the contiguous
      United States.

      - Scurry County, being in Texas, is much farther south.


      NO, Gogebic County, MI is NOT located south of Scurry County, TX. It is located

      by step:


      1. The question is asking if Pepin County, WI (Wisconsin) is located south of
      Rockwall County, TX (Texas).


      2. Let''s think about the geography of the United States. Wisconsin is a state
      in the northern part of the US, bordering Canada. Texas is a state in the southern
      part of the US, bordering Mexico.


      3. In general, Wisconsin is north of Texas because Wisconsin is in the northern
      part of the US while Texas is in the southern part.


      4. Therefore, counties in Wisconsin would generally be north of counties in
      Texas.


      5. Specifically, Pepin County is in Wisconsin, so it would be north of Rockwall
      County, which is in Texas.


      6. The question asks if Pepin County, WI is south of Rockwall County, TX. Based
      on the reasoning above, the answer would be no, because Pepin County is north
      of Rockwall County.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Pepin County is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - Rockwall County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Wisconsin is a northern state, located in the Upper Midwest region of the
      United States

      - Texas is a southern state, located along the US-Mexico border


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Wisconsin is significantly further north in the United States compared to
      Texas

      - All counties in Wisconsin would be north of most counties in Texas


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Pepin County is in Wisconsin (a northern state) and Rockwall County is
      in Texas (a southern state), Pepin County is located north of Rockwall County,
      not south of it.

      South Dakota is in the northern United States, while Texas is in the southern
      United States. Generally speaking, South Dakota is north of Texas. But let me
      think more specifically about these counties.


      Bon Homme County is in South Dakota, which borders North Dakota to the north
      and Nebraska to the south. South Dakota is quite far north in the continental
      US.


      Guadalupe County is in Texas, which borders Mexico to the south and Oklahoma

      - States in the northern US (like South Dakota) have higher latitudes than states
      in the southern US (like Texas)

      - Since Bon Homme County is in South Dakota, it must be north of Guadalupe County,

      2. Specifically, it''s asking if Washakie County, WY is located south of Peach
      County, GA.


      To answer this, I need to determine the approximate latitudes of these counties.


      Wyoming is a northern state in the western United States, bordering Canada.

      Georgia is a southeastern state, much further south than Wyoming.


      In the United States, higher latitudes are further north, while lower latitudes
      are further south.


      Wyoming is definitely north of Georgia in terms of latitude.

      Therefore, Washakie County, WY would be north of Peach County, GA.


      The question asks if Washakie County is south of Peach County. Since Washakie
      County is actually north of Peach County, the answer would be NO.</think># Is

      the country.


      3) Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, positioned much
      further south than Wyoming.


      4) In terms of latitude (north-south positioning), states in the northern part
      of the US like Wyoming are at higher latitudes than southern states like Georgia.


      5) Since Washakie County is in Wyoming, and Peach County is in Georgia, Washakie
      County would be located north of Peach County, not south of it.


      NO, Washakie County, WY is not located south of Peach County, GA. It is located

      The question asks if Charles Mix County is located south of Coke County. To
      answer this, I need to recall the general locations of South Dakota and Texas
      within the United States.


      South Dakota is a state in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      North Dakota to the north, Minnesota to the east, Iowa to the southeast, Nebraska
      to the south, Wyoming to the west, and Montana to the northwest.


      Texas is a state in the southern United States, bordering New Mexico to the
      west, Oklahoma to the north, Arkansas to the northeast, Louisiana to the east,
      and Mexico to the south.


      Given the locations of these states, we can determine that South Dakota is entirely
      north of Texas. Therefore, any county in South Dakota (including Charles Mix
      County) would be north of any county in Texas (including Coke County).

      and located near the Canadian border.

      Texas is a southern state that borders Mexico.

      First, let me think about the states themselves:

      - South Dakota (SD) is in the northern part of the United States, in the Midwest
      region

      - Louisiana (LA) is in the southern part of the United States, in the Deep South

      Texas is one of the southernmost states in the continental US, while South Dakota
      is in the north-central part of the country.


      So, Spink County, SD would be located in South Dakota, which is north of Texas.
      Sterling County, TX would be located in Texas, which is south of South Dakota.

      lower latitude values.


      South Dakota (SD) is a northern state in the US, bordering North Dakota, Minnesota,
      Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana. It''s located in the north-central part

      2. Gadsden County is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Generally speaking, Florida is much further south than New York on a map of

      is one of the southernmost states, extending down into a peninsula.


      Florida''s northern border connects with Georgia, while New York''s southern
      border connects with Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The entire state of Florida

      County, CO (Colorado) on a map of the United States.


      First, let me think about the general locations of the states of Idaho and Colorado:

      - Idaho is in the northwest of the United States, bordering Washington, Oregon,
      Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, and Canada.

      - Colorado is further east and south compared to Idaho, bordering Wyoming, Nebraska,
      Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah.


      Generally speaking, Colorado is south and east of Idaho.


      Now, let''s consider the specific counties:

      - Boundary County, ID would be in Idaho. The name "Boundary" suggests it might
      be on the border of Idaho, possibly the northern border with Canada.

      - Baca County, CO would be in Colorado.


      Since Idaho is generally north of Colorado, and Boundary County is likely in
      the northern part of Idaho (possibly at the Canadian border), while Baca County
      is somewhere in Colorado, it''s very likely that Boundary County, ID is NOT
      south of Baca County, CO. In fact, it''s likely north of it.


      Let me refine this further. If Boundary County is indeed on the northern border
      of Idaho, and Baca County is anywhere in Colorado, then Boundary County would
      be north of Baca County.


      Let me check my knowledge about these specific counties:

      - Boundary County is indeed the northernmost county in Idaho, on the border
      with Canada.

      - Baca County is in the southeastern corner of Colorado.

      First, let me think about the states:

      - Colorado (CO) is in the central part of the US, in the Rocky Mountain region


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Idaho is generally north of Colorado. Idaho borders Canada on its northern
      edge, while Colorado is several states away from Canada.


      Now, let''s think about the specific counties:

      - Boundary County is in Idaho, and given its name, it''s likely at the boundary
      of the state

      - Baca County is in Colorado


      Based on state positions, I would expect Boundary County, ID to be north of
      Baca County, CO simply because Idaho is north of Colorado.


      Let me be more precise:

      - Boundary County is the northernmost county in Idaho (bordering Canada)

      - Baca County is in the southeastern corner of Colorado, bordering Oklahoma
      and Kansas


      So Boundary County is at the northern edge of Idaho, while Baca County is at

      - Baca County is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Idaho and Colorado.

      - Idaho is located in the northwest United States

      - Colorado is located south of Idaho, in the central mountain region


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations of these counties within their states.

      - Boundary County is the northernmost county in Idaho, located at the Canadian
      border

      - Baca County is in the southeastern corner of Colorado


      Step 4: Compare the north-south positions.

      - Since Boundary County is at the northern edge of Idaho, and Idaho itself is

      - Northern Idaho is definitely north of southern Colorado.

      - Even if Baca County isn''t in the southern part of Colorado, Colorado as a

      to determine the relative locations of Boundary County, Idaho (ID) and Baca
      County, Colorado (CO).


      First, let me consider what I know about these states:

      - Idaho (ID) is in the northwest of the United States

      - Colorado (CO) is in the central-western part of the United States

      - Generally, Idaho is north of Colorado on a map


      Now for the specific counties:

      - Boundary County, ID: As the name might suggest, it''s likely at a border of
      Idaho. Given Idaho''s shape, this could be at the northern, western, or eastern
      border.

      - Baca County, CO: I''m not certain of its exact location within Colorado.


      To be precise, I need to determine:

      1. Where Boundary County is in Idaho

      2. Where Baca County is in Colorado


      Based on my knowledge:

      - Boundary County is the northernmost county in Idaho, bordering Canada.

      - Baca County is in the southeastern corner of Colorado.


      Given these locations:

      - Idaho is entirely west and north of Colorado

      - Boundary County is at the northern end of Idaho

      - Baca County is at the southern end of Colorado


      Therefore, Boundary County, ID is north of Baca County, CO, not south of it.</think>#
      Is Boundary County, ID located south of Baca County, CO?


      I need to determine the geographic positions of these two counties.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Boundary County is located in Idaho (ID), which is in the northwestern United
      States.

      - Baca County is located in Colorado (CO), which is southeast of Idaho.


      ## Step 2: Find specific county locations

      - Boundary County is the northernmost county in Idaho, located at the border
      with Canada.

      - Baca County is in the extreme southeastern corner of Colorado.


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      - Idaho is entirely north and west of Colorado on the US map.

      - Boundary County, being in northern Idaho, is far north of any part of Colorado.

      - Baca County, being in southern Colorado, is well south of any part of Idaho.


      ## Conclusion

      NO. Boundary County, ID is NOT located south of Baca County, CO. It is actually
      located significantly north of Baca County.'

      County, ID and Baca County, CO are located relative to each other, specifically
      whether Boundary County is south of Baca County.


      First, let me think about the states:

      - ID is Idaho, which is in the northwest United States

      - CO is Colorado, which is in the central-western United States


      Generally, Idaho is north of Colorado on a map of the US.


      Now, let''s think about the specific counties:

      - Boundary County, ID is likely on a boundary of Idaho. Given Idaho''s shape,
      it could be on the northern, western, or eastern edge.

      - Baca County, CO - I need to determine where this is in Colorado.


      Idaho is entirely north of Colorado. Colorado''s northern border is with Wyoming,
      not Idaho.


      Boundary County, ID is actually on the northern border of Idaho (bordering Canada),
      making it one of the northernmost counties in Idaho.


      Baca County, CO is in the southeastern corner of Colorado, making it one of
      the southernmost counties in Colorado.


      So if Boundary County is in the north of Idaho, and Idaho is north of Colorado,
      and Baca County is in the south of Colorado, then Boundary County must be north
      of Baca County, not south of it.</think>To determine if Boundary County, ID
      is south of Baca County, CO, I need to consider the geographic locations of
      both counties and states.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Idaho (ID) is located in the northwestern United States, while Colorado (CO)
      is located in the central-western United States. Generally, Idaho is positioned
      north of Colorado.


      Step 2: Identify Boundary County''s location in Idaho.

      Boundary County is the northernmost county in Idaho, located at the very top
      of the state along the Canadian border.


      Step 3: Identify Baca County''s location in Colorado.

      Baca County is located in the extreme southeastern corner of Colorado.


      Step 4: Compare the north-south positions.

      Since Boundary County is at the northern edge of Idaho, and Idaho itself is
      north of Colorado, and Baca County is in the southern part of Colorado, Boundary
      County must be significantly north of Baca County.


      NO, Boundary County, ID is not located south of Baca County, CO. It is located

      - CO is Colorado, which is in the central/western United States


      Idaho is generally north of Colorado in the US. Idaho borders Canada to the
      north, while Colorado is several states south of the Canadian border.


      More specifically:

      - Boundary County is likely in northern Idaho (given its name "Boundary", it
      might be on the border with Canada)

      - Baca County, CO is likely in Colorado


      If Boundary County is indeed in northern Idaho, and Baca County is in Colorado,
      then Boundary County would be north of Baca County, not south.


      Let me verify my assumption about Boundary County: Yes, Boundary County is the
      northernmost county in Idaho, bordering Canada.


      For Baca County: It appears to be in the southeastern corner of Colorado, bordering
      Kansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.

      Step 2: Determine the locations of the specific counties.

      - Boundary County is Idaho''s northernmost county, bordering Canada

      - Baca County is located in the southeastern corner of Colorado


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Idaho is entirely north of Colorado on the map. Since Boundary County is at
      the northern edge of Idaho and Baca County is in the southern part of Colorado,
      Boundary County must be significantly north of Baca County.

      1. First, I need to determine where Boundary County, ID (Idaho) is located.
      The name "Boundary" suggests it might be on a state boundary. Idaho is in the
      northwest of the US.


      2. Next, I need to determine where Baca County, CO (Colorado) is located. Colorado
      is east of Idaho and more central/south in the US.


      3. Then I need to compare their north-south positions.


      Boundary County, ID is located in the northernmost part of Idaho, bordering
      Canada. In fact, it''s the northernmost county in Idaho, which is why it''s
      named "Boundary" - it''s on the boundary with Canada.


      Baca County, CO is located in the southeastern corner of Colorado, bordering
      Oklahoma and New Mexico.


      Given these locations:

      - Boundary County, ID is in the far north of the US (bordering Canada)

      - Baca County, CO is in the southern part of Colorado


      Therefore, Boundary County, ID must be north of Baca County, CO, not south of

      Step 1: Identify the location of Boundary County, Idaho.

      Boundary County is located in the northernmost part of Idaho, bordering Canada.
      As its name suggests, it sits on the international boundary.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Baca County, Colorado.

      Baca County is located in the southeastern corner of Colorado, bordering Kansas,
      Oklahoma, and New Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Idaho is entirely west and north of Colorado in the US. Furthermore, Boundary

      Since Bureau County is in Illinois (a northern state) and Terrebonne Parish

      To be even more specific:

      - Terrebonne Parish is located in southern Louisiana, right along the Gulf Coast

      is located south of Sabine Parish, LA, I need to understand the geographic locations
      of these two counties.


      First, let me identify which states these counties are in:

      - Fallon County is in MT (Montana)

      - Sabine Parish is in LA (Louisiana)


      Now, I need to think about the relative positions of Montana and Louisiana in
      the United States.


      Montana is a state in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.

      Louisiana is a state in the southeastern United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Montana is in the northern part of the contiguous United States

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the contiguous United States


      Since Montana is a northern state and Louisiana is a southern state, it''s very
      likely that Fallon County, MT is north of Sabine Parish, LA (not south).


      So the answer is likely "NO" - Fallon County, MT is not located south of Sabine
      Parish, LA. But let me just double-check my understanding of US geography before
      finalizing.


      Yes, Montana is definitely north of Louisiana. Montana borders Canada at the
      north, while Louisiana is one of the southernmost states in the continental
      US, bordering the Gulf of Mexico. So any county in Montana would be north of
      any parish in Louisiana.</think># Is Fallon County, MT located south of Sabine

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Fallon County is in MT (Montana)

      - Sabine Parish is in LA (Louisiana)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states

      - Montana is located in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada

      Since Montana is significantly north of Louisiana in terms of latitude, Fallon
      County (in Montana) must be north of Sabine Parish (in Louisiana), not south
      of it.

      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two counties.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Slope County is in North Dakota (ND)

      2) Crane County is in Texas (TX)

      3) North Dakota is a northern state bordering Canada

      4) Texas is a southern state bordering Mexico

      5) Geographically, all of North Dakota is north of all of Texas on the map of

      whether Slope County, North Dakota is located south of Crane County, Texas.


      To answer this, I need to know the relative positions of these counties on a
      north-south axis (latitude).


      North Dakota (ND) is a northern state bordering Canada, while Texas (TX) is
      a southern state bordering Mexico. In the United States, states farther north
      have higher latitudes than states farther south.


      Given the geographic positions of these states:

      - North Dakota is in the northern part of the US

      - Texas is in the southern part of the US


      Regardless of the specific positions of these counties within their states,
      a county in North Dakota (a northern state) would be north of a county in Texas
      (a southern state).


      Therefore, Slope County, ND would be NORTH of Crane County, TX, not south of
      it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two
      counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these counties are located.

      - Slope County is in North Dakota (ND)

      - Crane County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is a northern state that borders Canada

      - Texas is a southern state that borders Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - North Dakota is significantly further north than Texas on the map

      - Any county in North Dakota would be north of any county in Texas


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Slope County is in North Dakota (a northern state) and Crane County is
      in Texas (a southern state), Slope County must be north of Crane County, not
      south of it.

      North Dakota (ND) is a state in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada. Texas (TX) is a state in the southern part of the United States, bordering

      Just based on the states, we would generally expect that a county in North Dakota
      would be north of a county in Texas, since North Dakota is north of Texas.


      Let me verify this by considering the specific counties:


      1. Slope County is in North Dakota, which is in the northern United States

      2. Crane County is in Texas, which is in the southern United States


      Since North Dakota is significantly north of Texas, Slope County, ND would be
      north of Crane County, TX.

      North Dakota is located in the northern United States, along the Canadian border.

      Texas is located in the southern United States, along the Mexican border.


      Since North Dakota is significantly north of Texas on the map of the United
      States, and counties within these states would follow the same general north-south

      First, I''ll think about the general geographic locations of the states:

      - Montana (MT) is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada.

      - Tennessee (TN) is in the southeastern United States.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Montana is significantly north of Tennessee.

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the continental US.

      - Tennessee is in the southern half of the US.


      Since Sanders County is in Montana, and Cocke County is in Tennessee, and Montana
      is north of Tennessee, it follows that Sanders County, MT would be north of
      Cocke County, TN - not south of it.

      County, TN. Instead, it''s located north of it.</think>To answer this question,

      - Sanders County is in Montana (MT)

      - Cocke County is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Montana is located in the northwestern United States, along the Canadian border

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Montana is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US

      - Tennessee is in the southern portion of the US


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the counties.

      Since Sanders County is in Montana (a northern state) and Cocke County is in
      Tennessee (a southern state), Sanders County must be north of Cocke County,
      not south of it.

      Then I need to compare their latitudes to determine if Pacific County is south
      of Ellis County.


      Let me think about the rough geographic positions:

      - Washington state is in the northwest corner of the contiguous United States,
      bordering Canada

      - Texas is in the southern United States, bordering Mexico


      Generally speaking, Washington state is north of Texas. Since Pacific County

      \ located in the northern part of the United States.\n- Texas is located in\
      \ the southern part of the United States.\n\nSo generally speaking, Oregon is\
      \ north of Texas. This would suggest that Deschutes County, Oregon is north\
      \ of Matagorda County, Texas.\n\nTo be more precise:\n- Oregon is roughly between\
      \ 42\xB0N and 46\xB0N latitude\n- Texas is roughly between 26\xB0N and 36\xB0\
      N latitude\n\nSo even the southernmost part of Oregon is north of the northernmost\
      \ part of Texas. This confirms that Deschutes County, OR must be north of Matagorda\
      \ County, TX, not south of it.</think># Is Deschutes County, OR located south\
      \ of Matagorda County, TX?\n\nLet me solve this by identifying the locations\
      \ of these counties and comparing their positions.\n\nStep 1: Identify the states.\n\
      - Deschutes County is in Oregon (OR)\n- Matagorda County is in Texas (TX)\n\n\
      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.\n- Oregon\
      \ is in the Pacific Northwest of the United States\n- Texas is in the southern\
      \ United States\n\nStep 3: Compare their latitudes.\n- Oregon is located much\
      \ farther north (roughly between 42\xB0N and 46\xB0N latitude)\n- Texas is located\
      \ farther south (roughly between 26\xB0N and 36\xB0N latitude)\n\nStep 4: Make\
      \ the specific county comparison.\nSince Deschutes County is in Oregon, and\
      \ all of Oregon is north of Texas, Deschutes County must be north of Matagorda\
      \ County, not south of it.\n\nNO"

      \ County is in Oregon (OR)\n- Matagorda County is in Texas (TX)\n\nOregon is\
      \ in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, along the Pacific coast.\
      \ It's one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.\n\nTexas is in the\
      \ south-central region of the United States. It's much further south than Oregon.\n\
      \nIn terms of latitude:\n- Oregon is roughly between 42\xB0N and 46\xB0N latitude\n\
      - Texas is roughly between 26\xB0N and 36\xB0N latitude\n\nEven without knowing\

      - Oregon (OR) is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States\n- Texas\
