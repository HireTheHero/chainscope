      1. **Identify the locations**: Presque Isle County is located in the state of
      Michigan (MI), and Gila County is located in the state of Arizona (AZ).


      2. **Understand geographical positions**: Michigan is generally located in the
      northern United States, while Arizona is located in the southwestern part of
      the country.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Without needing the exact latitudes, we can infer
      that Michigan, being in the north, is likely at a higher latitude than Arizona,
      which is in the southwest. This implies that Michigan is generally north of
      Arizona.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Presque Isle County, MI, is in the northern United
      States and Gila County, AZ, is in the southwestern United States, it''s reasonable
      to conclude that Presque Isle County is north of Gila County. Therefore, it

      1. **Identify the states and their general locations**: Minnesota (MN) is located
      in the northern United States, specifically in the Midwest region. North Carolina
      (NC) is located in the southeastern United States.


      2. **Consider the general latitude of each state**: Minnesota is known for being
      one of the northernmost states, while North Carolina is significantly farther
      south, though not as far south as states like Florida.


      3. **Determine the relative positions of the counties within their states**:
      Beltrami County in Minnesota is in the northern part of the state. Randolph
      County in North Carolina is somewhat central in the state but leans towards
      the southern part of the central region.


      4. **Compare the latitudes**: Given Minnesota''s northern position and North

      United States.

      3. Given that Fall River County is in South Dakota and Vermilion Parish is in

      3. **Compare latitudes**: Generally, the farther south you go in the United
      States, the lower the latitude. Whatcom County, WA, is at a higher latitude
      than Quay County, NM, because Washington is significantly farther north than
      New Mexico.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Whatcom County, WA, is at a higher latitude (farther

      1. **Identify the locations**: Whatcom County is located in the state of Washington,
      which is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Quay County is
      located in the state of New Mexico, which is in the Southwest region.


      2. **Determine the general latitude of each location**: Washington state is
      generally at a higher latitude (further north) than New Mexico. This means that
      most of Washington, including Whatcom County, is north of most of New Mexico,
      including Quay County.


      3. **Consider the specific geography**: Without needing the exact latitude and
      longitude, knowing the general positions of these states is sufficient for a

      or south a place is, if Yellowstone County, MT is at a higher latitude than
      Pecos County, TX, it means Yellowstone County is located north of Pecos County,
      TX, not south.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether Yellowstone County, MT is located
      south of Pecos County, TX is: NO.'
