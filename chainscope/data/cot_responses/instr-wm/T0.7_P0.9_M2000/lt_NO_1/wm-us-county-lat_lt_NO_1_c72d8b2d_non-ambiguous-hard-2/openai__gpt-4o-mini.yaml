      - Montana is generally north of Texas.

      - Since Treasure County is in Montana, it will have a higher latitude than Cottle
      County in Texas.


      Given that Treasure County is in the northern part of the U.S. and Cottle County
      is in the southern part of the U.S., we can conclude that Treasure County, MT
      is not south of Cottle County, TX.

      1. **Location of Calumet County, WI**: Calumet County is located in east-central
      Wisconsin. It is situated north of several other counties and is relatively
      far north compared to many locations in the southern United States.


      2. **Location of Palo Pinto County, TX**: Palo Pinto County is located in north-central
      Texas. It is further south than Wisconsin and is part of a region that has a
      generally warmer climate.


      3. **Comparative Position**: Given that Calumet County is in Wisconsin, which
      is in the northern part of the United States, and Palo Pinto County is in Texas,
      which is in the southern part of the United States, we can infer that Calumet
      County is generally located to the north of Palo Pinto County.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      **NO**.'
