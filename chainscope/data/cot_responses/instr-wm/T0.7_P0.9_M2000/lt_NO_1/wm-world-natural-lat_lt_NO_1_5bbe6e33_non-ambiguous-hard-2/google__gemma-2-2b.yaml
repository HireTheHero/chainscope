      Lough Gill is a lake located in County Sligo, Ireland. It is situated in the

      through the River Foyle.


      Wheeler Lake is a lake located in the US state of Colorado. It is situated in
      the Rocky Mountains, and its waters are fed by snowmelt and rainfall.


      Now, let''s see if Lough Gill is located south of Wheeler Lake.


      To do this, we need to know the direction of the lake relative to the other
      lake.


      If we imagine that Lough Gill is in the west, and Wheeler Lake is in the east,
      then we can say that Lough Gill is located south of Wheeler Lake.


      This is because, from the west, we would need to travel south to reach Wheeler

      is located in the southwestern part of Turkmenistan, while Songkhla Lake is
      located in the northeastern part of Thailand. This means that they are not located
      directly south of each other.

      Boyukshor to Songkhla Lake, we would need to travel north, rather than south.

      The third step is to consider the distance. We can estimate the distance between
      the lakes using a map or online tools. It is possible that the distance between
      them is greater than the distance between them, making them not directly south
      of each other.

      \ Plateau, which is a plateau in the Russian Far East, and Parry Sound, which\
      \ is a city in Ontario, Canada.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider\
      \ the distance between Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound, as well as the direction\
      \ of the line connecting them.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the distance between\
      \ Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound. To do this, we can use the formula for the\
      \ distance between two points in a plane:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 -\
      \ y1)^2)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\
      \nIn this case, we can assume that Putorana Plateau is located at the coordinates\
      \ (0, 0) and Parry Sound is located at the coordinates (x2, y2).\n\nIf we assume\
      \ that the distance between the two points is 1000 km, we can calculate the\
      \ distance between them as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((0 - x2)^2 + (0 - y2)^2)\n\
      \nd = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nWe can also assume that the direction\
      \ of the line connecting Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound is given by the angle\
      \ \u03B8, where \u03B8 is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n\
      \nIf we assume that \u03B8 = 90 degrees, we can calculate the distance between\
      \ the two points as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A\
      (x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf we assume that \u03B8 = 0 degrees, we can calculate\
      \ the distance between the two points as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 +\
      \ (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf we assume that \u03B8\
      \ = 180 degrees, we can calculate the distance between the two points as follows:\n\
      \nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\
      \nIf we assume that \u03B8 = 270 degrees, we can calculate the distance between\
      \ the two points as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((x2 - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A\
      (x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nIf we assume that \u03B8 = 360 degrees, we can\
      \ calculate the distance between the two points as follows:\n\nd = \u221A((x2\
      \ - 0)^2 + (y2 - 0)^2)\n\nd = \u221A(x2^2 + y2^2)\n\nd = 1000\n\nWe can see\
      \ that the distance between Putorana Plateau and Parry Sound does not depend\
      \ on the direction of the line connecting them, as long as the distance is 1000\
      \ km.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is YES. Putorana Plateau is located\
      \ south of Parry Sound.\n\n"
