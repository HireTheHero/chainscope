      of Lake Mountains, we need to identify the geographical positions of both Gjende
      and the Lake Mountains.


      1. **Identify Gjende**: Gjende is a lake located in Jotunheimen National Park
      in Norway. It is known for its striking turquoise color and is a popular destination
      for hiking and outdoor activities.


      2. **Identify Lake Mountains**: The term "Lake Mountains" is not a standard
      geographic term. However, if we interpret it as referring to the mountains surrounding
      lakes in the Jotunheimen region, we can consider the prominent mountains in
      that area.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Gjende Lake is situated in a valley surrounded
      by mountains, including the Besseggen ridge to the north. If we consider the
      surrounding mountains in Jotunheimen, they are generally to the north and west
      of Gjende.


      4. **Relative Positioning**: Since Gjende is located in a valley with mountains
      around it, and the prominent peaks are to the north and west, we can conclude
      that Gjende is not south of the surrounding mountains.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      NO'

      \ any significant mountain range that could be referred to as \"Lake Mountains\"\

      \ Park. \n\n2. **Lake Mountains**: If we interpret \"Lake Mountains\" as referring\

      lakes.


      1. **Lake Silvaplana** is located in Switzerland, specifically in the Engadin
      valley. It is situated at an elevation of about 1,800 meters and is surrounded
      by the Swiss Alps.


      2. **Lake Enriquillo** is located in the southwestern part of the Dominican
      Republic. It is the largest lake in the Caribbean and is situated at a very
      low elevation, below sea level.


      Now, let''s consider their geographic positions:


      - Lake Silvaplana is in Europe (Switzerland), while Lake Enriquillo is in the
      Caribbean (Dominican Republic).

      - When looking at a map, Switzerland is situated to the northeast of the Dominican
      Republic.


      Given this information, Lake Silvaplana is not south of Lake Enriquillo; it
      is actually to the north and east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'

      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to establish where the Paco volcano
      is located and where the Cordillera Real is situated in Bolivia.


      2. **Location of Cordillera Real**: The Cordillera Real is a mountain range
      in Bolivia that runs roughly north to south, and it is located in the western
      part of the country.


      3. **Location of Paco Volcano**: The Paco volcano is located in the southern
      part of Bolivia, specifically near the city of La Paz.


      4. **Relative Position**: Now, we need to determine the relative positions of
      the two. Since the Cordillera Real is a northern range, and the Paco volcano
      is to the south of this range, we can conclude that Paco is indeed located south
      of the Cordillera Real.

      1. **Lake Peipus**: This is a large lake situated on the border between Estonia

      2. **Nakaumi**: This is a lake located in Japan, specifically in the western
      part of the country on the island of Honshu.


      Now, we need to determine their relative positions:


      - Lake Peipus is located in Europe, while Nakaumi is located in Asia (Japan).

      - Since Europe is to the west of Asia, it can be inferred that Lake Peipus is
      not south of Nakaumi, but rather west and somewhat north of it.

      2. **Mount Sumagaya**: This is a mountain located in the Philippines, specifically

      Now, let''s determine their relative positions:


      - Loch Striven is in Scotland, which is located in the northern part of the
      globe.

      - Mount Sumagaya is in the Philippines, which is near the equator and considerably
      further south than Scotland.


      Given that Mount Sumagaya is located in the Philippines and Loch Striven is
      located in Scotland, it follows that Loch Striven is indeed situated north of
      Mount Sumagaya.


      Therefore, to the question "Is Loch Striven located south of Mount Sumagaya?"
      the answer is:


      **NO**.'

      2. **Mount Sumagaya**: This is a mountain located in the Philippines, specifically

      Next, we analyze their positions in relation to each other:


      - Loch Striven is in Scotland (Northern Hemisphere, Western Europe).

      - Mount Sumagaya is in the Philippines (Southeast Asia, Northern Hemisphere).


      Since Loch Striven is in a different part of the world (Scotland) than Mount
