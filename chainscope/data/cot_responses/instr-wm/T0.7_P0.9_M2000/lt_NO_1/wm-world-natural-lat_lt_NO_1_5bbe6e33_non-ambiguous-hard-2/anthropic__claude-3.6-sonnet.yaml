      1. First, I need to identify Quake Lake:

      - Quake Lake (also known as Earthquake Lake) is located in Montana, USA

      - It was formed by a landslide during an earthquake in 1959


      2. Next, I need to identify Chetput Lake:

      - I cannot find a lake called "Chetput Lake" in any reliable source

      - This lake name appears to be either incorrect or non-existent


      3. Since one of the lakes cannot be verified to exist:

      - It''s impossible to determine their relative positions

      - We cannot make a valid north/south comparison


      Therefore, I cannot make a definitive YES/NO determination about their relative
      positions since one of the reference points (Chetput Lake) cannot be verified
      to exist.


      However, since the question requires a YES/NO answer:


      NO (because there is no evidence to support that Quake Lake is south of a lake
      that cannot be verified to exist)'

      sij\xE4rvi (61\xB0N) is at a higher latitude than Lake Abant (40\xB0N)\n- And\
      \ higher latitude in the Northern Hemisphere means further north\n- Therefore\
