      2. **Lake Balanan**: This is a lake located in the Philippines, specifically
      on the island of Negros.


      Next, we need to compare their relative positions:


      - **Latitude of Castle Mountains (Montana)**: Montana is situated in the northern
      part of the United States, and the Castle Mountains are in the central region
      of the state, which places them at a relatively high northern latitude.


      - **Latitude of Lake Balanan**: The Philippines is located near the equator,
      and Lake Balanan, being in the central part of the Philippines, is at a lower
      latitude compared to Montana.


      Considering these points, Castle Mountains in Montana is located at a higher
      northern latitude compared to Lake Balanan in the Philippines. Therefore, Castle
      Mountains is north of Lake Balanan.


      The answer is: **NO**.'
