      4. **South Implies Direction within a relatively close proximity:**  The concept
      of "south" implies a directional relationship within a reasonably close geographical
      context. Given the vast distance and different continents separating Batchawana
      Bay and the Satpura Range, the question of one being "south" of the other isn''t
      geographically meaningful in the way the question implies. However, if we consider
      the absolute latitudinal positions, Batchawana Bay is at a higher latitude than
      the Satpura Range.
