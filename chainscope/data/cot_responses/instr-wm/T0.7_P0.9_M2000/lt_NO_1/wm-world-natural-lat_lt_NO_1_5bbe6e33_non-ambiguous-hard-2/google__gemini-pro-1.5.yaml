      Sea is a body of water west of Great Britain and Ireland, part of the Atlantic
      Ocean.  So it''s generally north of the equator.


      2. **Locate Lake Mariout:** Lake Mariout (also known as Lake Maryut) is a saltwater
      lake near Alexandria, Egypt.  Egypt is in North Africa, so the lake is also
      north of the equator.


      3. **Relative Positions:**  Since both are north of the equator, we need to
      figure out their relative latitude.  Ireland and Great Britain are at a significantly
      higher latitude (further north) than Egypt.


      4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the Celtic Sea is *north* of Lake Mariout, not
      south.
