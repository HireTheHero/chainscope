      Step 1: Let me identify where Chimborazo is located.

      Chimborazo is a volcano and mountain in Ecuador, South America. Ecuador is located
      near the equator in the northern part of South America.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Bogong High Plains is located.

      The Bogong High Plains are located in Victoria, Australia, in the southeastern
      part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Ecuador is close to the equator, with Chimborazo at approximately 1.5 degrees
      south latitude.

      Victoria, Australia is much further south, with the Bogong High Plains at approximately
      36-37 degrees south latitude.


      Step 4: Determine which is further south.

      Since Chimborazo is at about 1.5 degrees south and Bogong High Plains is at
      about 36-37 degrees south, Bogong High Plains is significantly further south
      than Chimborazo.


      NO, Chimborazo is not located south of Bogong High Plains. It is located north
      of Bogong High Plains.'

      The Caraballo Mountains are a mountain range in the northern Philippines, on

      Step 1: Let me identify where North Star Bay is located.

      North Star Bay is located in northwestern Greenland, near Thule Air Base. This
      places it in the Arctic region, at a very high northern latitude.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Loch Broom is located.

      Loch Broom is a sea loch (fjord) in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland, UK.
      Scotland is in the northern part of the UK, but at a much lower latitude than
      the Arctic.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      North Star Bay in Greenland is much further north (higher latitude) than Loch
      Broom in Scotland. The Arctic region where North Star Bay is located is one
      of the northernmost inhabited areas on Earth, while Scotland, though northern
      in Europe, is significantly further south.


      Step 4: Determine the answer.

      Since North Star Bay is further north than Loch Broom, North Star Bay cannot
      be south of Loch Broom.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both Mount Binuluan and Lake Sandoval.

      - Mount Binuluan is a mountain in the Cordillera Central mountain range in northern
      Luzon, Philippines.

      - Lake Sandoval is a lake in the Amazon rainforest in Peru, South America.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on a global north-south axis.

      - The Philippines is located in Southeast Asia, in the Northern Hemisphere.

      - Peru is located in South America, which spans both the Northern and Southern
      Hemispheres, but Lake Sandoval is in the southern portion of Peru, in the Southern
      Hemisphere.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - Mount Binuluan, being in the Northern Hemisphere (Philippines), is north of
      the equator.

      - Lake Sandoval, being in the Southern Hemisphere (Peru), is south of the equator.

      - Therefore, Mount Binuluan is north of Lake Sandoval, not south of it.

      Europe).

      - Lake Ashi (also called Ashinoko) is located in Japan, specifically in the
      Hakone region.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate latitudes.

      - Norway is located in Northern Europe, and Lysefjord is at approximately 58-59

      - Japan is in East Asia, and Lake Ashi is located at approximately 35 degrees
      North latitude.

      - 35 degrees North (Lake Ashi) is closer to the equator than 58-59 degrees North
      (Lysefjord).

      - This means Lake Ashi is south of Lysefjord, not the other way around.

      - Bali Strait is at around 8 degrees South

      - Since Satopanth Tal is in the northern hemisphere and Bali Strait is in the

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Big Sandy Lake is located in Minnesota, United States, in North America.

      - Laguna de Leche (also known as "Milk Lake") is located in Cuba, in the Caribbean.


      Step 2: Determine their latitudes.

      - Big Sandy Lake in Minnesota is located at approximately 46-47 degrees North
      latitude.

      - Laguna de Leche in Cuba is located at approximately 22-23 degrees North latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Since Big Sandy Lake is at around 46-47 degrees North and Laguna de Leche
      is at around 22-23 degrees North, Big Sandy Lake is farther north.

      - A higher number of degrees North means a more northerly location.

      but close to the equator.

      Jakarta Bay is slightly south of the equator, but still in the northern part
      of the southern hemisphere.

      Mount Paget is located much further south, deep in the southern hemisphere.

      in the Cowal peninsula in Argyll and Bute, in the western part of Scotland.

      Mount Sumagaya is a mountain located in the Philippines, specifically on Mindanao

      Scotland is located in the northern hemisphere, approximately between 55-60
      degrees north latitude.

      The Philippines is located in the northern hemisphere as well, but much closer
      to the equator, with Mindanao island at approximately 7-10 degrees north latitude.


      Step 4: Determine their relative north-south positions.

      Since Scotland (where Loch Striven is) is at a much higher latitude (further
      north) than the Philippines (where Mount Sumagaya is), Loch Striven is located
      NORTH of Mount Sumagaya, not south.

      - Loch Striven is a sea loch in Scotland, UK, in the northern part of Europe.

      - Mount Sumagaya is a mountain in the Philippines, located in Southeast Asia.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a global north-south axis.

      - Scotland is located approximately between 55-60 degrees north latitude.

      - The Philippines is located approximately between 5-20 degrees north latitude.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - The Philippines (where Mount Sumagaya is) is much closer to the equator than

      - This means Loch Striven is located further north than Mount Sumagaya.

      Hornindalsvatnet is a lake in Norway, located in western Norway. It''s known
      for being Europe''s deepest lake.


      Step 2: Identify where the Central Panay Mountain Range is located.

      The Central Panay Mountain Range is located in Panay Island, which is part of
      the Philippines in Southeast Asia.


      Step 3: Compare the global positions of these two locations.

      Norway is in Northern Europe, while the Philippines is in Southeast Asia. Geographically,
      Norway (including Hornindalsvatnet) is located in the northern hemisphere, significantly
      north of the Philippines (including the Central Panay Mountain Range).

      closer to the equator, Hornindalsvatnet (in Norway) is located north of the
      Central Panay Mountain Range (in the Philippines), not south of it.

      It''s situated in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Antongil Bay.

      Antongil Bay is located on the northeastern coast of Madagascar, which is an
      island nation off the southeastern coast of Africa.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine which is further south.

      - Wular Lake is in northern India/Kashmir, which is in the northern hemisphere.

      - Madagascar is entirely in the southern hemisphere.

      - Since Antongil Bay is in Madagascar, it must be south of the equator.

      - Since Wular Lake is in northern India, it must be north of the equator.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Antongil Bay is in the southern hemisphere and Wular Lake is in the northern
      hemisphere, Wular Lake is north of Antongil Bay, not south of it.

      Step 1: Identify where Wular Lake is located.

      Wular Lake is located in Kashmir, in the northern part of India/disputed territory.
