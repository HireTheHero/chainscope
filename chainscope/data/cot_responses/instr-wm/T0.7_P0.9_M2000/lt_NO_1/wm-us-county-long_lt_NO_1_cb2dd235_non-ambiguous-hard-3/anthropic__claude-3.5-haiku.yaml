      3. Compare their geographic positions:

      - Adams County is east of Plumas County

      - This means Plumas County is west of Adams County


      4. Reverse the original question:

      - The question asks if Adams County is west of Plumas County

      - Since we determined that Plumas County is actually west of Adams County, the
      answer is the opposite


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

    71b9ffb1-40f3-4eac-a3b2-f5df3fc01e37: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Deuel County, SD on a map:

      - Deuel County is in the eastern part of South Dakota, near the Minnesota border


      2. Next, I''ll locate Lemhi County, ID on a map:

      - Lemhi County is in east-central Idaho, a mountainous region


      3. Now I''ll compare their relative geographic positions:

      - Deuel County, SD is in the Great Plains region (eastern part of the Dakotas)

      - Lemhi County, ID is in the Rocky Mountain region (central/eastern Idaho)

      - These counties are in different states and separated by several states


      4. To determine "west of", I''ll visualize their longitude:

      - Deuel County, SD is around 96-97 degrees west longitude

      - Lemmi County, ID is around 113-114 degrees west longitude


      5. A county with a lower longitude number is east of a county with a higher
      longitude number


      6. Therefore, Deuel County, SD is EAST of Lemhi County, ID, not west

      Since Palo Alto County''s longitude is east of Bannock County''s longitude,
      Palo Alto County is EAST of Bannock County.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
    7e45945a-59da-405d-ba07-41392748673a: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate Palo Alto County, Iowa on a map

      2. Then, let''s locate Bannock County, Idaho on a map

      3. Compare their geographical positions


      Step 1: Palo Alto County is in northwestern Iowa, near the Minnesota border


      Step 2: Bannock County is in southeastern Idaho, near the Utah border


      Step 3: Comparing their positions:

      - Iowa is east of the Rocky Mountain states

      - Idaho is west of Iowa

      - Therefore, Palo Alto County (in Iowa) is east of Bannock County (in Idaho)


      So, Palo Alto County, IA is NOT located west of Bannock County, ID.
