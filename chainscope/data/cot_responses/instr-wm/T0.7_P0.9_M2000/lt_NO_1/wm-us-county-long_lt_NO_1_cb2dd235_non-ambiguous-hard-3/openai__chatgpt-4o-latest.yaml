      Step 1: Identify the location of Cheboygan County, Michigan.

      - Cheboygan County is located in the northern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula,
      near the eastern edge of the state. It borders Lake Huron.

      OH is located west of Doniphan County, KS, we need to understand the relative
      geographic positions of the two counties.


      **Step 1: Locate Doniphan County, Kansas**

      - Doniphan County is located in the northeastern corner of Kansas.

      - It borders the state of Missouri and lies along the Missouri River.

      - Kansas itself is located in the central part of the United States.


      **Step 2: Locate Muskingum County, Ohio**

      - Muskingum County is located in the eastern part of the state of Ohio.

      - Ohio is generally located to the east of Kansas in the Midwestern region of
      the United States.


      **Step 3: Determine Longitude Comparison**

      - Kansas lies to the west of Ohio in terms of longitude.

      - Therefore, Doniphan County, being in Kansas, is west of Muskingum County,
      which is in Ohio.


      **Conclusion:**

      Muskingum County, OH is east of Doniphan County, KS.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Cocke County, TN.

      - Cocke County is in eastern Tennessee, near the border with North Carolina.
      It is part of the Appalachian region and is located in the eastern part of the
      state.

    7d74bc2f-30e1-451c-8c95-03d1885f38fb: 'To determine whether Charles County, Maryland
      (MD) is located west of Leavenworth County, Kansas (KS), we need to consider
      the geographic positions (primarily longitude) of each county.


      Step 1: Locate Charles County, MD.

      - Charles County is in the state of Maryland, which is on the East Coast of
      the United States.

      - It is located south of Washington, D.C., and east of the Appalachian Mountains.

      - Maryland is in the Eastern Time Zone.


      Step 2: Locate Leavenworth County, KS.

      - Leavenworth County is in the state of Kansas, which is in the central part
      of the United States.

      - Kansas is west of the Mississippi River and is in the Central Time Zone.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Maryland is on the East Coast and Kansas is in the Midwest, Kansas is
      significantly farther west than Maryland.

      - Therefore, Charles County, MD is located to the east of Leavenworth County,
      KS.


      Final Answer:

      NO.'

      Mississippi is located west of Yavapai County, Arizona, we need to consider
      the geographic positions of both counties.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Sunflower County, MS.

      - Sunflower County is located in the state of Mississippi.

      - Mississippi is in the southeastern region of the United States.

      - Sunflower County is in the central part of the Mississippi Delta region, which
      is in the western part of Mississippi.

      of both counties in terms of longitude, which measures east-west position on
      the Earth''s surface.


      Step 1: Identify the general location of each county.


      - Davie County is located in the state of North Carolina, which is on the eastern
      side of the United States.

      - Quay County is located in the state of New Mexico, which is in the southwestern
      region of the United States.


      Step 2: Understand the relative position of North Carolina and New Mexico.


      - North Carolina is east of New Mexico. This means that any location in North
      Carolina is generally east of any location in New Mexico.


      Step 3: Apply this to the counties in question.


      - Since Davie County is in North Carolina, and Quay County is in New Mexico,
      Davie County must be east of Quay County.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Davie County, NC located west of Quay

      Maryland is located west of Jackson County, Missouri, we need to evaluate their
      relative positions on the map of the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Queen Anne''s County, MD.

      - Queen Anne''s County is located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Maryland
      is in the Mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States.

      - Specifically, Queen Anne''s County lies to the east of the Chesapeake Bay,
      making it even farther east within the state.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Jackson County, MO.

      - Jackson County is located in the western part of Missouri.

      - The city of Kansas City is partially located in Jackson County, which is near
      the border of Missouri and Kansas.


      Step 3: Compare the relative longitudes.

      - Missouri is located in the central United States, while Maryland is located
      in the eastern United States.

      - Therefore, Jackson County, MO is significantly west of Queen Anne''s County,
      MD.

      (MA) is located west of Pottawattamie County, Iowa (IA), we need to think geographically,
      using knowledge of U.S. states'' locations.


      Step 1: Identify the relative locations of Massachusetts and Iowa.

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States.

      - Iowa is in the Midwestern United States, which is west of the Northeast.


      Step 2: Identify the specific locations of the two counties within their states.

      - Hampden County is in western Massachusetts, but still within the state of
      Massachusetts.

      - Pottawattamie County is in western Iowa, near the border with Nebraska (specifically
      near the city of Council Bluffs, across the river from Omaha, Nebraska).


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Even though Hampden County is in western Massachusetts, the entire state of
      Massachusetts lies east of Iowa.

      - Pottawattamie County, being in western Iowa, is significantly further west
      than any part of Massachusetts.

    9ce69f77-7b8a-492c-9a17-9fbeded70e2d: 'To determine whether Windsor County, VT
      is located west of Yellow Medicine County, MN, we need to consider the geographic
      locations of both counties in the United States.


      Step 1: Locate Windsor County, Vermont.

      - Windsor County is located in the eastern part of the state of Vermont.

      - Vermont is in the northeastern region of the United States, part of New England.

      - Therefore, Windsor County is in the northeastern U.S.


      Step 2: Locate Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota.

      - Yellow Medicine County is in the southwestern part of Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is in the north-central region of the United States, part of the
      Midwest.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Vermont is generally east of Minnesota.

      - Since Windsor County is in eastern Vermont and Yellow Medicine County is in
      southwestern Minnesota, Yellow Medicine County is significantly farther west.


      Conclusion: Windsor County, VT is east of Yellow Medicine County, MN.
