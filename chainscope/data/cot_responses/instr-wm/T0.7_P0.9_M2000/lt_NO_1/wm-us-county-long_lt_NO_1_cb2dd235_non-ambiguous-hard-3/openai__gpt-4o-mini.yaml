      1. **Locate Okaloosa County, FL**: Okaloosa County is situated in the northwestern
      part of Florida, along the Gulf of Mexico.


      2. **Locate Val Verde County, TX**: Val Verde County is located in the southwestern
      part of Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border.


      3. **Compare their longitudes**: Florida is generally east of Texas. Since Okaloosa
      County is in Florida and Val Verde County is in Texas, we need to assess their
      relative positions.


      4. **Geographical orientation**: Okaloosa County is to the east of Val Verde
      County. In terms of latitude and longitude, the westernmost point of Okaloosa
