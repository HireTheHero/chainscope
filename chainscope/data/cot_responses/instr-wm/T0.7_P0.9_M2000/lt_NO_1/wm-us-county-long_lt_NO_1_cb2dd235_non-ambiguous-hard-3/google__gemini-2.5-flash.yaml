      1.  **Locate Beaufort County, SC:** This county is in the southeastern United
      States, on the Atlantic coast of South Carolina.

      2.  **Locate Coleman County, TX:** This county is in central Texas.

      3.  **Determine relative positions:** Texas is generally west of South Carolina.
      Central Texas is significantly west of the South Carolina coast.


      Therefore, Beaufort County, SC is located **east** of Coleman County, TX.


      The question asks if Beaufort County, SC is located *west* of Coleman County,
      TX. Since it''s located east, the answer is the opposite.

      Muskingum County, OH is located in eastern Ohio. Its approximate longitude is
      around **81-82 degrees West**.

      **Step 2: Locate Muskogee County, OK.**

      Muskogee County is in eastern Oklahoma. Its approximate longitude is -95.3 degrees.

      **Step 2: Locate Mariposa County, CA**

      Mariposa County, California is in the central part of California, in the Sierra

      answer.


      **Step 1: Determine the approximate longitude of Perquimans County, NC.**

      Perquimans County is located in northeastern North Carolina. North Carolina
      is an East Coast state. Its westernmost point is around 84 degrees West longitude,
      and its easternmost point is around 75 degrees West longitude. Perquimans County
      is on the eastern side of the state, near the coast. A quick check reveals its
      approximate longitude is around **76.3 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate longitude of Mississippi County, AR.**

      Mississippi County is located in northeastern Arkansas. Arkansas is a state
      in the South-Central US, west of the Mississippi River. Its easternmost point
      is around 89 degrees West longitude, and its westernmost point is around 94
      degrees West longitude. Mississippi County is on the eastern side of the state,
      bordering the Mississippi River. A quick check reveals its approximate longitude
      is around **90.0 degrees West**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      * Perquimans County, NC: ~76.3 degrees West

      * Mississippi County, AR: ~90.0 degrees West


      Remember that for West longitudes, a *smaller* number means *further East*,

      Since 76.3 is *smaller* than 90.0, Perquimans County, NC is located *east* of
      Mississippi County, AR.

      its approximate longitude is around **-86.5 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of Val Verde County, TX.**

      Val Verde County, TX is located in Southwest Texas, bordering Mexico. A quick
      search reveals its approximate longitude is around **-101.0 degrees West**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   Okaloosa County, FL: -86.5 degrees West

      *   Val Verde County, TX: -101.0 degrees West


      **Step 4: Determine which is "west" of the other.**

      On a map, as you move west, the longitude values become *more negative*.

      -101.0 is more negative than -86.5.

      Therefore, Val Verde County, TX is further west than Okaloosa County, FL.


      If Val Verde County, TX is *west* of Okaloosa County, FL, then Okaloosa County,
      FL is *east* of Val Verde County, TX.

      Specifically, northeastern Indiana is significantly east of western Nebraska.

      4.  **Compare longitudes (implied):** Since Indiana is east of Nebraska, any
      point in Indiana will have a more easterly longitude (a higher negative number,
      or closer to 0 if we consider 0 at the prime meridian and increasing westward)
      than a point in Nebraska, which is further west. Or, more simply, if you start
      at the Prime Meridian and travel west, you hit Indiana *before* you hit Nebraska.
      Therefore, Nebraska is to the west of Indiana.

    fb8c5edc-e1c9-4daf-9f03-51561492da82: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Saluda County, SC:** Saluda County is in central South Carolina.

      2.  **Locate Rockwall County, TX:** Rockwall County is in north-central Texas,
      just east of Dallas.

      3.  **Determine relative positions:** Texas is west of South Carolina. Therefore,
      any county in Texas will be west of any county in South Carolina (barring extremely
      unusual geographic quirks, which isn''t the case here).


      Since Rockwall County, TX is in Texas, and Saluda County, SC is in South Carolina,
      Rockwall County, TX is *west* of Saluda County, SC.


      The question asks: "Is Saluda County, SC located west of Rockwall County, TX?"


      Since Saluda County, SC is *east* of Rockwall County, TX, the answer is no.

      1.  **Locate Lanier County, GA:** Lanier County is in south-central Georgia.

      2.  **Locate Hill County, TX:** Hill County is in north-central Texas, south
      of Fort Worth.

      3.  **Determine relative positions:** If you look at a map of the United States,
      Georgia is significantly to the east of Texas. Therefore, any county in Georgia
      will be to the east of any county in Texas.


      Given this, Lanier County, GA is located *east* of Hill County, TX.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Lanier County, GA located west of
      Hill County, TX?" is:

      part of West Virginia. West Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States.


      2.  **Locate Gage County, NE:** Gage County, Nebraska, is in the southeastern
      part of Nebraska. Nebraska is in the Midwest, specifically the Great Plains
      region, which is significantly west of the East Coast.


      3.  **Compare their longitudes:** Without looking up exact coordinates, it''s
      clear from their state locations that Nebraska is much further west than West
      Virginia. Therefore, Gage County, NE, is located west of Tucker County, WV.


      4.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Tucker County, WV, is located
      *west* of Gage County, NE. Since Gage County, NE, is west of Tucker County,
      WV, it means Tucker County, WV, is *east* of Gage County, NE.
