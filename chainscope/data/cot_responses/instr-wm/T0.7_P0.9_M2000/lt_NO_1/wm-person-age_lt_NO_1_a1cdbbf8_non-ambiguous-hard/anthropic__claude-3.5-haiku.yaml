      years old.


      7. Comparing their ages at death: 59 (Huang Shao) vs 36 (Claudius Colas)


      8. 59 is greater than 36, which means Huang Shao was older at his time of death
      than Claudius Colas.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      For Ilya Oleynikov:

      - He was a Russian comedian and actor

      - He died on June 29, 2012

      - He was born on January 22, 1947

      - He was born around 1725

      Comparing their ages at death:

      - Oleynikov: 65 years old

      - Bernard of Vienne was born around 870

      - He died around 957

      - So he lived to be approximately 87 years old


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Rokossovsky died at 72

      - Bernard of Vienne died at about 87


      4. The question asks: Was Rokossovsky younger at time of death?

      - Since 72 is less than 87, the answer is YES


      The answer is: YES'

      3. Then I''ll compare their ages at death.


      After careful research:

      - Bernhard Karl von Koehne (1795-1864) lived from 1795 to 1864, meaning he was
      69 years old when he died.

      - Nicolas Neufchatel (c. 1525 - c. 1590) lived from around 1525 to around 1590,
      meaning he was around 65 years old when he died.


      69 is older than 65.


      Therefore, Bernhard Karl von Koehne was NOT younger at his time of death than
      Nicolas Neufchatel.
