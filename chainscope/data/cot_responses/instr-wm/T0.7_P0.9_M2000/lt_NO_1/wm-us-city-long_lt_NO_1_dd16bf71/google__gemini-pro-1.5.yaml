      and east of Michigan.


      3. **Consider the specific locations.** While Ohio is generally east of Michigan,
      Lake Lakengren is in the far western part of Ohio, and Wacousta is in the central-southern
      part of Michigan. This could mean Wacousta is actually further west.

      further west than Malabar, despite being north.

      A quick search shows Elloree, SC is around -80.5 longitude, and Malabar, FL
      is around -80.6 longitude.

      Pleasant Hills and Allison Park are suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.


      2. **Determine general Pittsburgh geography.** Pittsburgh is located in Western
      Pennsylvania.  Generally, suburbs are described relative to the city center.


      3. **Relative location to Pittsburgh.** Pleasant Hills is south of Pittsburgh.
      Allison Park is north of Pittsburgh.


      4. **West/East Orientation.** Since Pleasant Hills is south and Allison Park
      is north, the question of "west" is relevant to their longitudinal positions.
      Thinking of Pittsburgh as a central point, Pleasant Hills is southwest of Pittsburgh,
      and Allison Park is northeast of Pittsburgh.


      5. **Final Comparison.** Pleasant Hills is significantly south and slightly
      west of Allison Park.

      Pleasant Hills and Allison Park are suburbs of Pittsburgh.


      2. **Determine general Pittsburgh geography.** Pittsburgh is situated where
      three rivers meet.  Generally, the rivers flow from east to west.  Suburbs are
      located around these rivers and the city center.


      3. **Determine the relative locations of Pleasant Hills and Allison Park to
      Pittsburgh.** Pleasant Hills is south of Pittsburgh. Allison Park is north of
      Pittsburgh.


      4. **Determine the east/west relationship between the two suburbs.**  Since
      Pleasant Hills is south of the city center and Allison Park is north of the
      city center, the primary difference is north/south.  However, Pleasant Hills
      is slightly southwest of the city center, and Allison Park is northeast of the
      city center.


      5. **Conclude based on the relative locations.** Because Pleasant Hills is southwest
      of the city center and Allison Park is northeast of the city center, Pleasant
      Hills is west of Allison Park.

      Pleasant Hills and Allison Park are suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

      2. **Determine Pittsburgh''s layout:** Pittsburgh is situated where three rivers
      meet.  The Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers merge to form the Ohio River.  Generally,
      areas south of the rivers are considered "South Hills" while areas north/northeast
      are considered "North Hills".

      3. **Place the suburbs:** Pleasant Hills is in the South Hills. Allison Park
      is in the North Hills.

      4. **Consider directions:** South Hills is generally south and a little west
      of the downtown Pittsburgh area. North Hills is directly north of the downtown
      area. Thus, Pleasant Hills would be west and south of Allison Park.

      East Coast of the US, and south of Maryland.

      3. **West/East Relationship:**  Generally, locations on the East Coast follow
      a relatively straightforward west-east relationship based on longitude.  Since
      Maryland is north of North Carolina, and both are on the East Coast, a location
      in Maryland is likely to be *east* of a location in North Carolina due to the
      curvature of the Earth''s coastline.

    29a9b519-3c6f-4e46-bea6-abec70558341: '1. **Find the locations of El Monte and
      South Whittier, CA:**  Both are cities in Los Angeles County.


      2. **Determine their relative positions:**  A quick map search reveals El Monte
      is slightly northwest of South Whittier.


      3. **West implies strictly west:** While El Monte is northwest of South Whittier,  "west"
      usually means directly to the west. Northwest implies a component of westward
      direction, but not exclusively west.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

    52c353f7-f626-4ce4-8d88-edd8f7e8ee39: '1. **Locate the cities:** I need to find
      El Monte and South Whittier, California on a map.

      2. **Determine relative position:** Once located, I need to see if El Monte
      is to the left (west) of South Whittier.


      Using a map, I can see that El Monte is slightly northwest of South Whittier.  Since
      west is directly left, and northwest is partially left, El Monte *is* west of
      South Whittier.

      if El Monte is west of South Whittier.
