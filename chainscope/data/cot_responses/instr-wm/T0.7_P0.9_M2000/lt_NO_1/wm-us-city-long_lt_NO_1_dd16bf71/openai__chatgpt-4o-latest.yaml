      - Willow Oak, FL is an unincorporated community in Polk County, Florida.

      - Solana, FL is a census-designated place in Charlotte County, Florida.

      - Polk County (where Willow Oak is located) is farther inland, while Charlotte
      County (where Solana is located) is closer to Florida''s west coast.


      Since Polk County is generally east of Charlotte County, **Willow Oak, FL is
      located east of Solana, FL**.


      **Final Answer: NO.**'
