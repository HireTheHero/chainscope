      Hamel is a village in Madison County, Illinois.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To say one location is west of another

      \ the southeastern United States, we need to consider their relative positions\
      \ rather than their absolute east-west positions.\n   - Florida (where Pebble\
      \ Creek is located) is generally south of South Carolina (where Conestee is\
      \ located).\n\n5. **West of**:\n   - To be west of Conestee, SC, a location\
      \ would need to be to the west of South Carolina, considering its geographical\
      \ position.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Florida is south of South\
      \ Carolina and considering the geography of the southeastern United States,\
      \ locations in Florida are generally southeast of locations in South Carolina.\
      \ However, the question is about being west, not south. Since Conestee, SC,\
      \ is more eastward than many parts of Florida when considering their relative\
      \ longitudinal positions (east-west line), and given that Pebble Creek, FL,\
      \ is more to the south but can still be east or west depending on the specific\
      \ longitudes, we need to determine their specific longitudes.\n\n7. **Longitudes**:\n\
      \   - Without exact longitudes, one might initially think it's a complex geographical\
      \ question. However, knowing that Florida extends westward into the panhandle\
      \ and considering that South Carolina's eastern border is the Atlantic Ocean,\
      \ any part of Florida that is west of the easternmost part of South Carolina\
      \ could technically be considered west of Conestee, SC, if we're strictly talking\
      \ about longitude.\n\n8. **Final consideration**:\n   - Since Pebble Creek,\
      \ FL, is in the state of Florida, which does extend further west than South\
      \ Carolina, and considering Conestee, SC, is near the eastern part of South\
      \ Carolina, it's plausible that parts of Florida, including Pebble Creek, could\
      \ be west of Conestee, SC, based on longitude.\n\nGiven the steps above and\
      \ without the exact longitudes of Pebble Creek, FL, and Conestee, SC, but understanding\
      \ the general geography, the question essentially asks whether Pebble Creek,\
      \ FL, is west of Conestee, SC, in terms of longitude. Considering Florida's\
      \ western extension and South Carolina's eastern position, there's a possibility\
      \ for this to be true depending on the exact locations. However, the exact answer\
      \ would depend on the precise longitudes of these two locations.\n\nBut to simplify,\
      \ considering typical geography questions and without precise longitudes, one\
      \ might lean towards a simpler geographical interpretation. \n\nYES."

      3. **Consider East-West Orientation**: Since Alabama is relatively narrow from

      less about vast distances and more about relative positions. However, knowing

      west of Old Brookville, NY, let''s break down the steps needed to find the answer:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to understand where both West
      Sand Lake, NY, and Old Brookville, NY, are located. West Sand Lake is a hamlet
      in Rensselaer County, New York. Old Brookville is a village located within the
      Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, New York.


      2. **Understand geographic directions**: To say one location is west of another
      means that it is situated in the direction of the setting sun relative to the
      other location. The United States is broadly divided into regions that can be
      understood in terms of their directional relationships, with the general geography
      of the country trending from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean
      in the west.


      3. **Consider New York State geography**: New York State is located in the northeastern
      part of the United States. Rensselaer County, where West Sand Lake is situated,
      is in the eastern part of the state, relatively close to the state capital,
      Albany. Nassau County, where Old Brookville is located, is on Long Island, which
      is southeast of New York City.


      4. **Compare locations**: West Sand Lake, being in the eastern part of New York
      State, is generally north and somewhat west of the location of Old Brookville,
      which is on Long Island. However, the question is specifically about whether
      West Sand Lake is west of Old Brookville.


      5. **Conclusion**: Considering the geographic layout, West Sand Lake, NY, is
      not directly west but more northwest of Old Brookville, NY. However, for the
      purposes of this question, which asks for a simple "yes" or "no" without specifying
      exact directional relationships beyond "west," we need to consider the general
      direction. Since West Sand Lake is more to the north and slightly west (or northwest)
      of Old Brookville, it does have a component of being west but is not directly
      west.


      Given the simplification required for a YES/NO answer and understanding that
      geographic directions can be nuanced, the most straightforward interpretation
      of the question would lean towards considering if West Sand Lake is indeed located

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Point Pleasant Beach, NJ, and Hackensack, NJ,
      are the two locations in question. Point Pleasant Beach is a borough located
      on the Jersey Shore in Ocean County, New Jersey. Hackensack is a city located
      in Bergen County, New Jersey, and it is situated in the northern part of the
      state, not far from New York City.


      2. **Understand the geography of New Jersey**: New Jersey is a state in the
      northeastern United States. It can be divided into several regions, including
      the Jersey Shore (where Point Pleasant Beach is located) and the northern part
      of the state (where Hackensack is located).


      3. **Determine the relative locations**: Point Pleasant Beach is on the eastern
      coast of New Jersey, directly on the Atlantic Ocean. Hackensack, being in the
      northern part of the state, is more inland and closer to the New York border.


      4. **East-West orientation**: Considering the east-west axis, locations on the
      Atlantic coast (like Point Pleasant Beach) are to the east of locations inland
      (like Hackensack).


      Given these steps, Point Pleasant Beach, being on the coast, is east of Hackensack,
      which means it is not west of Hackensack.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      \ the locations of Willow Oak, FL, and Solana, FL, and then compare their positions\
      \ to see if Willow Oak is indeed west of Solana.\n\n1. **Identify the locations**:\
      \ First, we need to identify where Willow Oak, FL, and Solana, FL, are located.\
      \ \n   - Willow Oak is not a commonly recognized city name in Florida. It's\
      \ possible that it's a smaller community or not well-documented under this name.\
      \ However, there is a Willow Oak community or neighborhood in some parts of\
      \ Florida, but without a specific location, it's hard to determine its exact\
      \ position.\n   - Solana, FL, refers to Solana, a village in Collier County,\
      \ Florida. It's located on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\n2. **Determine the\
      \ geographical positions**: Without the exact location of Willow Oak, it's challenging\
      \ to determine its position relative to Solana accurately. However, assuming\
      \ Willow Oak might be in the general vicinity of larger cities or areas in Florida,\
      \ we can consider the state's geography. Florida is a long, narrow state with\
      \ the Gulf of Mexico to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ the positions**: Given that Solana is on the Gulf Coast (west side of Florida),\
      \ for Willow Oak to be west of Solana, it would need to be either directly west\
      \ (inland) or in a position that is more to the west than Solana within the\
      \ state. Without a precise location for Willow Oak, this comparison is speculative.\n\
      \n4. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific information about the location\
      \ of Willow Oak, FL, and considering that Solana is on the western edge of Florida\
      \ (Gulf Coast), if Willow Oak exists in a recognized form and is located within\
      \ Florida, it's unlikely to be \"west\" of Solana in the conventional sense\
      \ used for geography, as Solana is already on the western coast of Florida.\n\

      is a hamlet and census-designated place located in Saratoga County, New York.
      Sleepy Hollow Lake is a lake located in Greene County, New York.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the geographic
      positions of these locations in relation to each other. Given that Clifton Knolls-Mill
      Creek is in Saratoga County and Sleepy Hollow Lake is in Greene County, we need
      to determine the general direction from one to the other. Saratoga County is
      generally north of Greene County.


      3. **Westward Direction**: To determine if Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is west
      of Sleepy Hollow Lake, we must consider their relative positions. If Saratoga
      County (where Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is located) is north of Greene County
      (where Sleepy Hollow Lake is located), then Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek would

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where both Clifton Knolls-Mill
      Creek and Sleepy Hollow Lake are located. Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is a hamlet
      in Saratoga County, New York. Sleepy Hollow Lake is also in New York, specifically
      in the Hudson Valley.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we need to understand the geographical
      orientation of these locations relative to each other. The Hudson Valley, where
      Sleepy Hollow Lake is situated, is generally south of Saratoga County, where
      Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is located.


      3. **East-West Alignment**: Considering New York State''s geography, areas in
      the Hudson Valley are generally more to the southeast or directly south of areas
      in Saratoga County, depending on the specific locations within those regions.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Without exact coordinates, we can infer based on
      the names and general locations. Sleepy Hollow Lake is near the Hudson River,
      which runs north-south through eastern New York. Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek,
      being in Saratoga County, is further north and possibly west or northwest of
      the Hudson River Valley.

    7d6fa049-da5f-49a1-b5b9-de7b42f1ec1c: 'To determine if Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek,
      NY is located west of Sleepy Hollow Lake, NY, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek and Sleepy Hollow Lake on a map. Clifton Knolls-Mill
      Creek is a hamlet in Saratoga County, New York. Sleepy Hollow Lake is also in
      New York, but we need to establish its exact location relative to Clifton Knolls-Mill
      Creek.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: To say one location is west of another,
      it must be situated to the west on a map, meaning if you''re facing north, west
      would be to your left.


      3. **Research Locations**: Researching the locations, we find that Clifton Knolls-Mill
      Creek is in Saratoga County. Sleepy Hollow Lake, on the other hand, seems to
      be associated with the area around Sleepy Hollow, New York, which is in Westchester
      County.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Given that Sleepy Hollow is in the southeastern part
      of New York State and Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is further north and slightly
      west (in Saratoga County), we can start to form an opinion on their relative
      positions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Considering the general geography of New York State and the
      relative positions of Saratoga County (where Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is located)
      and Westchester County (associated with Sleepy Hollow Lake), Clifton Knolls-Mill
      Creek is indeed located west of Sleepy Hollow Lake, given the broader geographic
      context of New York State.


      The final answer is: YES'

      \ Hollow Lake. Given the general geography of New York State, areas in Saratoga\
      \ County (where Clifton Park is) are generally north of Westchester County (where\
      \ Sleepy Hollow is), but can also be west, depending on the specific locations\

    eda7dc49-f070-4848-af28-2c86c5a451ac: 'To determine if Sanger, CA is located west
      of Kingsburg, CA, let''s break down the process step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where Sanger, CA and Kingsburg,
      CA are. Both are cities in California.


      2. **Determine the county**: Sanger, CA is located in Fresno County, and Kingsburg,
      CA is also located in Fresno County. This tells us they are relatively close
      to each other.


      3. **Find geographical coordinates or a map**: Looking at a map or knowing the
      geographical coordinates can help. However, without specific coordinates, we
      can use general knowledge or online maps to understand their relative positions.


      4. **Analyze relative positions**: Generally, Sanger, CA is known to be east
      of Fresno, and Kingsburg, CA is south of Fresno. Given Fresno''s central position
      in the valley, we can infer relative directions from it.


      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Since Sanger is east of Fresno and Kingsburg
      is south of Fresno, and considering the general layout of the Central Valley
      in California, Sanger would not be west of Kingsburg. Instead, it would be more
      to the east or northeast in relation to Kingsburg.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Natalia,
      TX, and Mi Ranchito Estate, TX. Natalia is a city located in Medina County,
      Texas. Mi Ranchito Estate, however, does not appear to be a widely recognized
      or official city or estate name in common databases or maps. Without specific
      coordinates or a clear definition of Mi Ranchito Estate, it''s challenging to
      determine its exact location.


      2. **Consider Geographic Context**: Given that Natalia is in Texas, we''re looking
      for a comparison within the state or at least within the United States. Without
      the exact location of Mi Ranchito Estate, it''s hard to proceed with a direct
      comparison.


      3. **Research Mi Ranchito Estate**: Upon further consideration, "Mi Ranchito
      Estate" does not seem to be an officially recognized location that can be found
      in standard geographic or mapping services. This lack of information makes it
      difficult to determine its location relative to Natalia, TX.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Since Mi Ranchito Estate does
      not appear to be a recognized location, we cannot accurately determine its position
      relative to Natalia, TX. However, the question requires a yes or no answer regarding
      whether Natalia, TX is located west of Mi Ranchito Estate, TX.


      Given the steps and the lack of information on Mi Ranchito Estate''s location,
      the most straightforward approach to answering the question is to consider what
      we know about Natalia and the absence of recognizable data on Mi Ranchito Estate.
      Since we cannot verify the location of Mi Ranchito Estate, we cannot definitively
      say whether Natalia is west of it. However, the format of the question suggests
      we should provide an answer based on the information typically available.

      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Natalia,
      TX, and Mi Ranchito Estate, TX. Natalia is a city in Medina and Frio counties
      in the U.S. state of Texas. However, Mi Ranchito Estate, TX, does not appear
      to be a widely recognized city or town in available geographic databases or
      maps as of my last update. It''s possible that it could be a very small, unincorporated
      community, a housing development, or even a misunderstanding or misnaming of
      a location.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Without exact coordinates or a clear
      definition of Mi Ranchito Estate''s location, it''s challenging to determine
      its position relative to Natalia, TX, with certainty. However, assuming it''s
      somewhere in Texas, we would typically look at the general regions or counties
      where these places are located to assess their relative positions.


      3. **Consider Texas Geography**: Texas is a large state with diverse geography,
      stretching from the eastern part of the New Mexico border in the west to the
      Louisiana border in the east, and from the Oklahoma border in the north to the
      Mexico border in the south. Knowing the general layout, we can say that locations
      in western Texas are generally closer to New Mexico, while those in eastern
      Texas are closer to Louisiana.


      4. **Make an Informed Guess**: Without specific information on Mi Ranchito Estate,
      we cannot accurately determine its location relative to Natalia, TX. However,
      if we were to assume that Mi Ranchito Estate is a real location that could be
      anywhere in Texas, and given that Natalia, TX, is more towards the central part
      of the state but leaning towards the western side, any location west of Natalia
      would indeed be in the western part of Texas.


      Given the lack of specific information about Mi Ranchito Estate, TX, and considering
      that Natalia, TX, is located in a more central-western part of Texas, the question
      essentially becomes unanswerable with the information provided. However, since
      I must provide a YES or NO answer based on the steps taken:

      the steps needed to determine if Natalia, TX is located west of Mi Ranchito
      Estate, TX.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Natalia, TX, and Mi Ranchito Estate, TX. Natalia is a city in Medina and Frio
      counties, Texas. Mi Ranchito Estate, on the other hand, is more challenging
      to pinpoint without specific geographical data, as it could potentially be a
      smaller, less documented location or a misnomer. However, for the sake of this
      exercise, let''s assume it''s a recognizable location in Texas.


      2. **Geographical Positioning**: Without exact coordinates, we rely on general
      knowledge of Texas geography. Texas is a large state with diverse geography,
      spanning from the eastern part of the Great Plains to the southwestern part
      of the United States.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if Natalia is west of Mi Ranchito Estate,
      we need to understand the relative positions of these locations within Texas.
      Natalia, being in Medina and Frio counties, is relatively south-central in Texas,
      closer to San Antonio.


      4. **Mi Ranchito Estate''s Location**: The challenge here is the lack of specific
      information about Mi Ranchito Estate. If it''s assumed to be in a similar region
      or to the east of Natalia, then Natalia could potentially be west of it. Without
      a precise location for Mi Ranchito Estate, we''re at a disadvantage.


      5. **Decision**: Given the data we have, Natalia, TX, is a known city. Without
      specific details on Mi Ranchito Estate''s location, making an accurate determination
      is challenging. However, considering the question asks for a YES or NO answer
      and assuming Mi Ranchito Estate could be anywhere east of Natalia (given we
      don''t have its exact location), we might lean towards a speculative answer
      based on the available information.


      Given the constraints and the need for a definitive YES or NO answer, and without
      precise information on Mi Ranchito Estate''s location, the most straightforward
      approach is to consider the general geography of Texas and the known location
      of Natalia. However, the question''s phrasing implies a need for a direct answer
      despite these challenges.

    7326412a-0bd3-40e2-b671-ebf430863b75: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      a series of steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Natalia,
      TX, and Mi Ranchito Estate, TX. Natalia is a city in Texas, and after researching,
      it appears that Mi Ranchito Estate is not a well-known city or a recognized
      location in the same context as Natalia. However, for the sake of this exercise,
      let''s assume Mi Ranchito Estate refers to a specific location or estate within
      Texas, possibly near or in a city like El Paso, given the name''s hint towards
      a ranch or estate, which could imply a western or rural setting.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine the geographic positions
      of these locations. Natalia, TX, is located in Medina County, which is in the
      southern part of Texas, not far from San Antonio. Without an exact location
      for Mi Ranchito Estate, we must consider the general geography of Texas and
      how locations are positioned relative to each other.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Since we don''t have a specific location for Mi Ranchito
      Estate, let''s consider the hypothetical scenario based on its name suggesting
      it could be in a western part of Texas. If Mi Ranchito Estate were indeed located
      in the western part of Texas (for example, near El Paso), and considering Natalia,
      TX, is more towards the central-south part of Texas, then Natalia would be east
      of a location in western Texas.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the assumption that Mi Ranchito Estate could be in
      western Texas (due to the lack of specific information), Natalia, TX, would
      not be west of it but rather east. This conclusion is based on the general geography
      of Texas and the relative positions of locations within the state.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Natalia, TX, is located west of Mi Ranchito

      2. **Geographical Context**: Without the exact location of Mi Ranchito Estate,
      TX, it''s challenging to determine its geographical position relative to Natalia,
      TX. If Mi Ranchito Estate is not a recognized location, comparing its position
      to Natalia''s becomes speculative.


      3. **Assumption**: Given that I couldn''t verify Mi Ranchito Estate as a legitimate
      or recognized location, any answer would be based on incomplete or inaccurate

      4. **Conclusion**: Since I couldn''t verify the existence or location of Mi

      position, it''s not possible to definitively answer whether Natalia, TX, is

      that I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer due to the lack of verifiable

      need to know their relative positions.


      3. **Natalia, TX Location**: Natalia, TX, is located in the southern part of
      Texas, relatively close to San Antonio.


      4. **Mi Ranchito Estate, TX Location**: Without specific information on Mi Ranchito
      Estate, it''s challenging to determine its exact location. However, names like
      "Mi Ranchito Estate" often suggest a smaller, possibly rural or suburban area.
      The name "Mi Ranchito" translates to "my little ranch" in English, which could
      imply a smaller, more localized area, but without more context, its exact location
      relative to Natalia is difficult to ascertain.


      5. **Relative Positions**: Given the lack of specific information about Mi Ranchito
      Estate, we cannot accurately determine its location relative to Natalia, TX,

      2. Determine their relative positions in terms of cardinal directions (north,
      south, east, west).


      New Egypt, NJ is a section of Plumsted Township in Ocean County. Six Mile Run,
      NJ is an unincorporated community located within Franklin Township in Somerset
      County.


      Given the general geography of New Jersey:

      - Ocean County, where New Egypt is located, is in the eastern part of the state,
      closer to the coast.

      - Somerset County, where Six Mile Run is located, is more inland and westward
      compared to Ocean County.


      Therefore, based on the relative positions of these counties and the locations
      within them, New Egypt, NJ is generally east of Six Mile Run, NJ.


      So, considering the question of whether New Egypt, NJ is located west of Six
      Mile Run, NJ, the answer would be: NO.'

    9229ebae-4cb0-4c4a-9225-d3c09ade7911: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Letha,
      ID, and Caldwell, ID. Letha is a small community in Gem County, Idaho, and Caldwell
      is a city located in Canyon County, Idaho.


      2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Next, we determine the geographical
      positions of these locations. Caldwell is situated in the Treasure Valley area
      of southwestern Idaho.


      3. **Compare the locations**: To compare, we need to understand the layout of
      Idaho. Idaho is a large state with various regions, but generally, it can be
      divided into north, south, east, and west parts based on geographical features
      and city locations.


      4. **Specific locations of Letha and Caldwell**: Since specific GPS coordinates
      or detailed geographical descriptions are not provided, we''ll rely on general
      knowledge. Caldwell is in southwestern Idaho, which places it relatively in
      the western part of the state but more towards the south.


      5. **Letha''s location relative to Caldwell**: Without exact coordinates, we
      consider that both are in the western part of Idaho. However, to determine if
      Letha is west of Caldwell, we need to know their relative positions. Given that
      both cities are in the western part of Idaho, the question becomes about their
      specific locations relative to each other.


      6. **Gem County and Canyon County locations**: Letha is in Gem County, and Caldwell
      is in Canyon County. Gem County is located just north of Canyon County. This
      means that Letha, being in Gem County, would be north of Caldwell, which is
      in Canyon County, but the question is about being west, not north.


      7. **Conclusion based on available data**: Without precise geographical data
      or a detailed map, the general understanding of Idaho''s geography suggests
      that both locations are in the western part of the state, but their relative
      east-west positioning depends on their specific longitudes. Given that Letha
      is north of Caldwell and considering Idaho''s layout, it''s plausible that Letha
      could be slightly west or at least not significantly east of Caldwell due to
      the north-south alignment of the counties. However, the precise answer depends
      on their exact longitudes.


      Given the steps and considering the need for precise geographical data to give
      a definitive answer, the reasoning points towards needing more specific information
      for a certain answer. However, based on the general layout and assuming Letha''s
      position is north and potentially slightly west due to Idaho''s geography, the
      answer could lean towards yes, but with the understanding that this is based
      on general geographical principles and not exact coordinates.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Daufuskie Island, SC, and Orangeburg, SC, are
      the two locations in question. Daufuskie Island is located off the coast of
      South Carolina, near Hilton Head Island, and is part of Beaufort County. Orangeburg,
      on the other hand, is a city located in Orangeburg County, which is inland.


      2. **Understand the geography of South Carolina**: South Carolina can be divided
      into several regions, but for the purpose of this question, we''re looking at
      the coastal region where Daufuskie Island is located and the more inland region
      where Orangeburg is situated.


      3. **Determine east-west orientation**: Knowing that Daufuskie Island is a coastal
      island and Orangeburg is inland, we need to determine their relative positions
      east to west. The coast of South Carolina, where Daufuskie Island is located,
      is generally to the east of the inland areas like Orangeburg.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Given that Daufuskie Island is on the coast and
      Orangeburg is inland, Daufuskie Island would be east of Orangeburg, not west.
      This is because the eastern part of South Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean,
      and moving westward takes you further inland.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Daufuskie Island, SC, is located
      west of Orangeburg, SC, is **NO**.'

      west of St. Augusta, MN, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where Brainerd, MN, and
      St. Augusta, MN, are located. Brainerd is a city in Crow Wing County, Minnesota.
      St. Augusta is a city in Stearns County, Minnesota.


      2. **Understand the geography of Minnesota**: Minnesota is a state in the north-central
      United States. It is bordered by Canada to the north, North Dakota and South
      Dakota to the west, Iowa to the south, and Wisconsin to the east.


      3. **Compare the locations**: To compare the locations of Brainerd and St. Augusta,
      we need to consider their positions relative to each other in terms of cardinal
      directions (north, south, east, west).


      4. **Determine the direction**: Without exact coordinates, we rely on general
      knowledge of Minnesota''s geography. Brainerd is located in central Minnesota,
      and St. Augusta is also in central Minnesota but closer to the Twin Cities area
      (Minneapolis-St. Paul), which is more to the southeast of Brainerd.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the relative positions, Brainerd, MN, is generally
      northwest of the Twin Cities area, and St. Augusta, being near the Twin Cities,
      would be southeast of Brainerd. Therefore, Brainerd is west of St. Augusta.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'

      3. **Specific locations within the states**: Adams Center, NY, is in Jefferson
      County, in the northern part of the state, relatively close to Lake Ontario.
      Nanticoke, PA, is in Luzerne County, in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.

      4. **Relative positions**: Given that New York is east of Pennsylvania, the
      question is whether the specific location of Adams Center, NY, is west of Nanticoke,
      PA. Considering both are in the northern parts of their respective states but
      New York is generally east, we need to consider their longitudinal positions
      (east-west positioning).

      5. **Longitudinal comparison**: Without exact longitudes, we know that for Adams
      Center, NY, to be west of Nanticoke, PA, it would have to be significantly west
      within New York to counteract the general eastward position of New York relative
      to Pennsylvania.


      Given these considerations and without precise longitudinal data provided, we
      rely on general geographical knowledge. Typically, locations in northern New
      York are indeed east of locations in northeastern Pennsylvania due to the states''
      overall positions.


      Therefore, based on this step-by-step reasoning and the general geographical
      layout of the United States, the answer would be: **NO**.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: St. Michael, MN, and Leeton, MO, are the two
      cities in question. St. Michael is in Minnesota, and Leeton is in Missouri.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West refers to the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in the context of the United States, generally towards the
      Pacific Ocean from any given point within the country.


      3. **Determine the states'' relative positions**: Minnesota (where St. Michael

      (where Leeton is located) is also in the northern part of the central United
      States but is southeast of Minnesota.


      4. **Compare the cities'' longitudes**: Since we''re determining west/east positioning,
      we need to consider the longitude of each city. Generally, as you move west
      in the United States, your longitude increases (moves towards higher numbers).

      place located in San Bernardino County, California. Mountain View Acres is also
      in California, specifically in San Bernardino County.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to determine their relative
      geographic positions, particularly in terms of east-west orientation. Given
      that both are in the same county, we''ll need more specific information about
      their locations within San Bernardino County to compare their positions accurately.


      3. **Use Geographic References**: Without exact coordinates, we can consider

      1. **Identify the locations**: Dallesport is a census-designated place located

      Oregon.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Both locations are in the Pacific Northwest
      region of the United States. Washington and Oregon are adjacent states, with
      Washington located north of Oregon.


      3. **Specific locations**: Dallesport, WA, is situated near the Columbia River,
      which forms part of the border between Washington and Oregon. Metolius, OR,
      is also near the same general region but is specifically located in central
      Oregon, not directly on the border with Washington.


      4. **Directions and geography**: Given that Dallesport is in Washington, which
      is north of Oregon, and considering the locations of these two places, we must
      determine their relative positions east-west. The Columbia River, where Dallesport
      is located, runs east-west along the border between Washington and Oregon. Metolius,

      - Sunset Hills, MO, is in a county that is generally north of Festus, MO's county.\n\

      \ Sunset Hills and Festus are located within Missouri. Sunset Hills is a city\
      \ located in St. Louis County, Missouri, and it is part of the St. Louis metropolitan\
      \ area. Festus, on the other hand, is also in Missouri, situated in Jefferson\

    09aa1465-6664-4a36-9845-542c609aeaed: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We have two locations to consider: Port Wentworth,
      GA, and Edmund, SC. However, it seems there might be a typo in "Edmund, SC,"
      as there isn''t a well-known city by that name in South Carolina. Given the
      context, it''s possible the question intends to refer to "Edmunds" or more likely
      "Edmund" is a typo and the actual reference is to "North Charleston" or another
      city, but none directly named Edmund. For the sake of this exercise, let''s
      assume the question meant to ask about a city in South Carolina but acknowledge
      the typo. A city that might fit the context or is similarly named is "Edisto"
      or possibly a misunderstanding of "North" or another prefix with Edmund. However,
      without a clear city named Edmund, we''ll have to approach this with the information
      we have.


      2. **Correct potential typo**: Assuming a typo, if we were to consider "Edmund"
      as potentially being a misunderstanding or misnaming of a city like "North"
      (as in North Charleston) or another city in South Carolina, we''d then need
      to know the actual city intended. Since we cannot accurately identify "Edmund,
      SC," as a real city, we''ll proceed with the assumption that the intent was
      to ask about a city in South Carolina but acknowledge this could significantly
      impact the answer.


      3. **Geographical orientation**: Port Wentworth, GA, is located near Savannah,
      Georgia. If we consider a hypothetical or similarly named city in South Carolina
      (given the typo), most cities in South Carolina are east of Georgia, given South
      Carolina''s geographical position relative to Georgia.


      4. **Determine west/east orientation**: Given Port Wentworth, GA, is near the
      eastern border of Georgia, and considering the potential typo and geographical
      confusion, if "Edmund, SC," were actually a city east of Port Wentworth (which
      would be the case for many SC cities due to the state''s eastern position relative
      to GA), then Port Wentworth, GA, would not be west of it.


      5. **Conclusion based on available information**: Without a clear city named
      "Edmund" in South Carolina and acknowledging the typo, the question''s premise
      is flawed. However, considering the likely intent to compare a city in South
      Carolina to Port Wentworth, GA, and knowing most of South Carolina is east of
      Georgia, we can infer that Port Wentworth, GA, is likely not west of a city
      that would be in the eastern part of South Carolina or along its coast.


      Given the above steps and acknowledging the typo in the city''s name, the answer
      would have to be based on the assumption that "Edmund, SC," is not a real city
      and thus cannot be directly compared. However, for the sake of providing a YES/NO
      answer as requested and considering the geographical context provided:


      NO'
    0d3bb8f7-025c-44f8-b264-c1ba35bd7f22: 'To determine if Port Wentworth, GA is located
      west of Edmund, SC, let''s break it down:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Port
      Wentworth, GA, and Edmund, SC. Port Wentworth is a city in Chatham County, Georgia.
      Edmund, however, seems to be a less common reference, possibly referring to
      a specific location or a misprint. Assuming Edmund could be a typo or confusion
      with Edmond (which is actually in Oklahoma) or perhaps a misunderstanding with
      a place like Edmunds or Edgefield in South Carolina, we''ll proceed with the
      general assumption that we''re comparing locations in the southeastern United
      States.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Generally, Georgia is located west of South
      Carolina. However, the specific orientation (east-west) between two cities depends
      on their exact locations. Port Wentworth, being in Georgia, and assuming Edmund
      refers to a location in South Carolina, the question hinges on their relative
      positions rather than the state boundaries alone.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Port Wentworth, GA, is near Savannah, which is in
      the eastern part of Georgia, close to the South Carolina border. If we consider
      Edgefield, SC (which might be the intended reference due to its proximity to
      Georgia), it''s located north of Augusta, GA. Edmund or Edgefield, SC, would
      be northeast or north of Port Wentworth, GA, considering their positions relative
      to the Georgia-South Carolina border.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the potential confusion with "Edmund, SC," and assuming
      a comparison with a city in South Carolina that''s reasonably close to Georgia
      (like Edgefield), Port Wentworth, GA, would generally be southwest of such locations.
      However, without an exact match for "Edmund, SC," and considering the intent
      might be to ask about locations in South Carolina near the Georgia border, we
      lean towards a general understanding that Port Wentworth is west of the eastern
      parts of South Carolina but must consider the specific geography.


      Given these steps and considering the most likely scenarios for "Edmund, SC"
      (potentially being a typographical error or confusion with another location),
      the answer would generally be YES if we strictly interpret the question without
      the exact location of Edmund, SC, clarified. However, this YES assumes Edmund
      is indeed supposed to be a location in South Carolina that is east of Port Wentworth,
      GA, which seems plausible given the geography of the region.

    5befde2e-714b-426e-8668-301e4565ff8b: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Port
      Wentworth, GA, and Edmund, SC. Port Wentworth is a city in Chatham County, Georgia.
      However, there seems to be a slight mix-up in the naming - it''s likely referring
      to "Edmund" as a stand-in for a city in South Carolina, but without a clear
      match, we can consider a more recognized city for comparison, such as Edisto
      or Edgefield, or even assume a typo for a common South Carolina city name like
      Edmunds being a typographical error for a city like North Charleston''s Edmund
      area or simply using it as a placeholder for any SC city. Yet, for the sake
      of this exercise, let''s correct the city to a known one, like "Edmund" could
      be a confusion with "North Charleston''s" area, but more likely it''s intended
      to be compared directly with cities in the same general area. Given the direct
      comparison challenge, let''s assume the intent was to compare Port Wentworth,
      GA, with a city in South Carolina, considering geographical positioning.


      2. **Geographical Positioning**: Port Wentworth, GA, is located near Savannah,
      Georgia, in the southeastern part of the state. Given the correction needed
      for "Edmund, SC," if we consider a city like North Charleston or another city
      in the lowcountry of South Carolina, these cities are generally east or southeast
      of Port Wentworth, GA, considering the overall geography of the region.


      3. **Comparative Geography**: The question asks if Port Wentworth, GA, is located
      west of Edmund, SC. Given the likely typographical error or confusion with city
      names, if we were to compare Port Wentworth with any city in South Carolina
      that could fit the "Edmund" placeholder (considering real cities like North
      Charleston), Port Wentworth, GA, would generally be west of cities located on
      the eastern coast of South Carolina, considering the straight-line geography.


      4. **Conclusion**: Without a clear, direct city named "Edmund" in South Carolina
      to compare, and assuming the comparison might be intended with a city that is
      east or in the eastern part of South Carolina (like those near the coast), Port
      Wentworth, GA, could indeed be west of several cities in South Carolina, depending
      on the specific city one might consider as "Edmund."


      Given these considerations and the need for a clear YES/NO answer without further
      clarification on "Edmund, SC," and assuming the intent might have been to ask
      about the general geographical relationship between Port Wentworth, GA, and

      west of Edmund, SC, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Port Wentworth is in Georgia (GA), and Edmund
      is presumably a reference to Edmund, South Carolina (though it might be a typo
      and could refer to Edmond, which doesn''t seem to match, or more likely, it''s
      a confusion with a different city name in SC).


      2. **Correct the potential typo or confusion**: Assuming there might be a mix-up
      with the city name in South Carolina, let''s consider a few possibilities. Edisto,
      Edgefield, or maybe even a more known city like North Charleston or a smaller
      town could be the intended reference. However, given the similarity in spelling,
      it seems like "Edmund" could be a stand-in or error for a city like Edmunds,
      which doesn''t directly match known cities in SC, or possibly a confusion with
      another city.


      3. **Focus on known geography**: Given the error or confusion with "Edmund,
      SC," let''s consider a broader geographic approach. Port Wentworth, GA, is near
      Savannah, GA. If we consider major cities in South Carolina that are relatively
      close to Georgia, such as Charleston or cities along the border, we can get
      a better sense of direction.


      4. **General directional knowledge**: Port Wentworth, GA, being near Savannah,
      is generally east of the central part of Georgia. If comparing to cities in
      South Carolina, especially those closer to the coast like Charleston, Port Wentworth
      would be southwest. However, without the exact location of "Edmund, SC," we
      must infer based on typical geography.


      5. **Decision based on likely intended question**: Assuming the question intends
      to compare Port Wentworth, GA, with a city in South Carolina that might be along
      the eastern part of the state or near the coast, Port Wentworth, GA, would likely
      be west of many coastal South Carolina cities, given its location relative to
      Savannah, GA.


      Given the steps and considering the intention might be to ask about a comparison

    e7ea5488-e1a4-4093-bc8b-bb1c7d6b5e82: 'To answer this question, we''ll break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Port Wentworth, GA, and Edmund, SC, are the cities
      in question. However, it seems there might be a slight mistake in the name "Edmund,
      SC." Given the context, it''s likely referring to "Edmunds" or more probably
      "Edmund" is a typo and it should be "North Charleston" or another city near
      the area, but there''s no prominent city by that name in SC. For the sake of
      reasoning, let''s correct this to a plausible city in South Carolina that could
      fit the context, such as "North Charleston" or simply consider the general direction
      from Port Wentworth, GA, to South Carolina.


      2. **Determine the general direction from Port Wentworth, GA, to South Carolina**:
      Port Wentworth is located near Savannah, Georgia. South Carolina is directly
      north of Georgia. Therefore, any location in South Carolina would generally
      be north of Port Wentworth, GA.


      3. **Consider the specific direction (west)**: The question asks if Port Wentworth,
      GA, is located west of Edmund, SC. Given that South Carolina is north of Georgia,
      for Port Wentworth, GA, to be west of a city in South Carolina, that city would
      need to be significantly east of Port Wentworth''s northward direction.


      4. **Conclusion based on geography**: Without a specific city named "Edmund"
      in South Carolina to reference, we consider the general geography. Port Wentworth,
      GA, is near the eastern coast of the United States. Most of South Carolina is
      north or slightly northeast of Port Wentworth, GA. Therefore, Port Wentworth,
      GA, cannot be west of any city that is correctly identified in South Carolina,

    f1a14fa0-3a2b-40fd-9a00-636795256d99: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Port Wentworth, GA, and Edmund, SC, are the two
      places in question. We need to determine their geographical positions relative
      to each other.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: To be "west" of a location means
      to be situated in the direction that the sun sets, relative to that location.
      So, if a place is west of another, it is to the left when facing north.


      3. **Determine the general location of Port Wentworth, GA**: Port Wentworth
      is a city in Chatham County, Georgia. It''s near Savannah, which is a well-known
      coastal city in Georgia.


      4. **Determine the general location of Edmund, SC**: It seems there might be
      a slight confusion or typo with "Edmund, SC." Given the context, it''s possible
      the question refers to "Edmund" as a stand-in for a city in South Carolina.
      However, a more plausible reference could be to "Edmund" as a mistaken or alternate
      name for "Edgefield" or another city in South Carolina, but without clear reference,
      we''ll proceed under the assumption that "Edmund" is intended to represent a
      location in South Carolina. A significant city in the region that comes to mind
      is actually "North Augusta" or "Aiken," but since "Edmund" isn''t clearly defined,
      we will consider the geography of South Carolina in relation to Georgia.


      5. **Compare the locations**: Generally, Georgia is west of South Carolina.
      If we consider the possible intended locations in South Carolina (like North
      Augusta or Aiken), Port Wentworth, GA, being in Georgia, would indeed be west
      or more specifically southwest of these locations in South Carolina.


      Given these steps and understanding that "Edmund, SC" might be a stand-in or
      misnomer for a location in South Carolina, and acknowledging the geographical
      relationship between Georgia and South Carolina:


      The answer is: **YES**'

      in question. Ixonia is a town in Wisconsin, and Hancock is a city in Michigan.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Wisconsin (WI) and Michigan (MI) are both states
      in the United States, located in the northern part of the country, in the Midwest
      and Great Lakes regions, respectively.


      3. **Determine the relative positions of Wisconsin and Michigan**: Wisconsin
      is located to the west of Michigan. This is a general geographical fact about
      the two states.


      4. **Consider the specific locations within the states**: Ixonia, WI, is in
      the southeastern part of Wisconsin, and Hancock, MI, is in the western part
      of Michigan''s Upper Peninsula.


      5. **Apply geographical knowledge to determine the relative east-west positions**:
      Since Wisconsin is west of Michigan, and considering that Ixonia is in southeastern
      Wisconsin while Hancock is in the western part of Michigan''s Upper Peninsula,
      we need to think about how these specific locations compare in terms of east-west
      positioning.


      Given the above steps, we know Wisconsin is west of Michigan. However, the question
      asks about specific cities (Ixonia, WI, and Hancock, MI), which requires a closer
      look at their exact geographical positions. Ixonia, being in southeastern Wisconsin,
      is relatively east within Wisconsin, and Hancock, being in the western part
      of Michigan''s Upper Peninsula, is relatively west within Michigan but still
      in a state that is generally east of Wisconsin.


      Considering these specifics, Ixonia, WI, is actually east of Hancock, MI, because
      even though Wisconsin as a whole is west of Michigan, the southeastern part
      of Wisconsin (where Ixonia is located) can be east of the western part of Michigan''s
      Upper Peninsula (where Hancock is located), given the irregular shapes of the
      states and their geographical layouts.

    bb89774a-1162-48a1-a70d-e12dd64445af: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Paramount-Long
      Meadow, MD, and Arkport, NY. Paramount-Long Meadow is a census-designated place
      in Washington County, Maryland. Arkport is a village in Steuben County, New
      York.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine their geographic positions
      relative to each other. Maryland is generally southeast of New York.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Paramount-Long Meadow, MD, is located in the western
      part of Maryland, close to the border with West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Arkport,
      NY, is located in the southern part of New York, not far from the Pennsylvania
      border.


      4. **Compare Longitudes**: To determine if Paramount-Long Meadow is west of
      Arkport, we need to compare their longitudes. Generally, the farther west a
      location is, the higher its longitude (in terms of negative values for locations
      in the Western Hemisphere).


      5. **Decision**: Without exact longitude values provided, we rely on general
      geographic knowledge. Maryland is east of the general area of New York when
      considering the whole state, but since Paramount-Long Meadow is in western Maryland
      and Arkport is in southern New York, we have to consider their relative positions.
      Western Maryland is still generally east of southern New York, considering the
      overall geography of the region.


      Based on these steps, the answer is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify the locations**: South Deerfield is a town in Massachusetts, and
      Thompsonville is a part of Enfield, Connecticut.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Massachusetts and Connecticut are neighboring
      states in the northeastern United States. Massachusetts is located to the north
      and east of Connecticut.


      3. **Consider the specific locations**: South Deerfield, MA, is in the western
      part of Massachusetts, and Thompsonville, CT, is in the northern part of Connecticut,
      relatively close to the Massachusetts border.


      4. **Determine the directional relationship**: Given that South Deerfield, MA,
      is in western Massachusetts and Thompsonville, CT, is in northern Connecticut,
      we need to consider their relative positions. Western Massachusetts is north
      of northern Connecticut, but when comparing two points that are relatively close
      to each other and near their shared border, the east-west relationship can be
      crucial.


      5. **Apply geographical knowledge**: Since Thompsonville, CT, is south of South
      Deerfield, MA, and considering the states'' layouts, South Deerfield is actually
      north and slightly west or directly north of Thompsonville, CT, depending on

      4. **Determine Relative Positions**: Given their positions relative to Denver
      and Boulder, Idaho Springs is generally southwest of Allenspark. However, the
      question asks if Idaho Springs is west of Allenspark.


      5. **Conclusion**: Considering the general directions and positions, Idaho Springs
      is more to the south and slightly east of Allenspark rather than directly west.
      Therefore, it is not west of Allenspark.


      The final answer is: NO'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to understand where Millis-Clicquot,
      MA, and East Providence, RI, are located.

      2. **Determine the geographical relationship**: Once we know where both locations
      are, we can determine if Millis-Clicquot, MA, is indeed west of East Providence,
      RI.


      **Step 1: Identify Millis-Clicquot, MA**

      - Millis-Clicquot does not appear to be a standard or recognized name for a
      town or city in Massachusetts. However, there is a town named Millis in Massachusetts.
      It''s possible that "Millis-Clicquot" could be a misunderstanding or misrepresentation
      of Millis, possibly confused with Veuve Clicquot, which is a brand of champagne
      and not related to geography in this context. For the purpose of this exercise,
      let''s proceed with the assumption that the question intends to refer to Millis,
      MA.


      **Step 2: Identify East Providence, RI**

      - East Providence is a city located in Providence County, Rhode Island. It is
      situated on the eastern side of Providence, hence the name.


      **Step 3: Determine the geographical relationship**

      - Millis, MA, is located west of Boston and is in Norfolk County.

      - East Providence, RI, is essentially east of Providence, RI, and when considering
      the broader geographical context, it is east of Millis, MA, as well, given that
      Rhode Island is generally east of the eastern parts of Massachusetts.


      Based on this analysis, considering Millis, MA (as the presumed correct location
      instead of Millis-Clicquot, MA), and its relation to East Providence, RI:


      The answer is: **NO**'

      MA, and East Providence, RI. Millis-Clicquot seems to be a less common name
      and might be related to or a part of Millis, Massachusetts. East Providence
      is a city in Rhode Island.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Generally, Massachusetts is located west and
      slightly north of Rhode Island. However, to give a precise answer, we need to
      consider the specific locations within these states.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Millis, Massachusetts (assuming Millis-Clicquot refers
      to an area within or related to Millis), is located in Norfolk County. East
      Providence, Rhode Island, is situated in Providence County, near the eastern
      part of Rhode Island.


      4. **Comparison**: Comparing the two, since Millis, MA, is in the western part
      of Massachusetts and considering Massachusetts'' position relative to Rhode
      Island, Millis would indeed be west of East Providence, RI, given the general
      westward position of Massachusetts relative to Rhode Island.

      Sierra region of California, while Simi Valley is a city in Ventura County,
      California, which is closer to the coast.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we determine the geographic
      relationship between these two locations in terms of east-west orientation.
      The Eastern Sierra, where Crowley Lake is located, is east of the coastal regions
      of California, where Simi Valley is situated.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Given that Crowley Lake is in the Eastern Sierra,
      it is east of the major mountain ranges that separate the eastern part of California
      from the coastal areas. Simi Valley, being near the coast in Ventura County,
      is west of the Eastern Sierra.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic locations, Crowley Lake, CA, is east
      of Simi Valley, CA, because it is situated in the Eastern Sierra, which is farther
      east from the coastal regions where Simi Valley is located.

    3cef3c09-6f18-473f-a2e8-ed387de11739: 'To determine if Pleasant Hills, PA is located
      west of Allison Park, PA, we need to consider the geographical locations of
      both places.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Pleasant
      Hills and Allison Park. Pleasant Hills is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.
      Allison Park is a census-designated place also located in Allegheny County,
      Pennsylvania.


      2. **Understand Directions**: West refers to the direction towards the setting
      sun, which in the context of the United States, generally means moving away
      from the eastern seaboard towards the interior or the west coast of the country.
      However, in local contexts, it can simply mean a location that is to the west
      of another location within the same region.


      3. **Compare Locations**: To compare the locations, we should look at their
      positions relative to each other within Allegheny County. Without specific longitude
      values, we can consider their general positions. Allison Park is generally in
      the northern part of Allegheny County, and Pleasant Hills is more towards the
      southeastern part of the county.


      4. **Determine Westward Position**: Given the general locations, being "west"
      of Allison Park would mean that Pleasant Hills must be positioned to the west
      of Allison Park''s location within the county.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geography of Allegheny County, Pleasant Hills,
      being in the southeastern part, is not west of Allison Park, which is more to
      the north. Therefore, considering their relative positions within the county,
      Pleasant Hills is not west of Allison Park.


      The answer is: NO'

      County, Pennsylvania. Allison Park is a census-designated place also located
      in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: West refers to the direction that is
      90 degrees to the right of south on a compass. To say one location is west of
      another means it is situated in the direction that the sun sets, relative to
      the other location.


      3. **Compare Locations**: To compare the locations of Pleasant Hills and Allison
      Park in terms of their geographic positions, we can look at their general areas
      within Allegheny County. Allison Park is generally located in the northern part
      of the county. Pleasant Hills is situated more towards the southeastern part
      of the county.


      4. **Determine Direction**: Given that Pleasant Hills is more southeast and
      Allison Park is more north, we can infer that Pleasant Hills is not directly
      west of Allison Park. Instead, it''s more to the south or southeast.

    980bdbf6-c46f-49ec-9b49-03fbc32d1f28: 'To answer this question, I will follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, I need to identify the locations of Santa
      Rita Ranch, TX, and Oak Trail Shores, TX. Santa Rita Ranch is a master-planned
      community located in Liberty Hill, Texas, which is part of the Austin-Round
      Rock-Georgetown Metropolitan Statistical Area. Oak Trail Shores, on the other
      hand, is a community located in Hudson Oaks, Texas, which is part of the Fort
      Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Division.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, I need to understand the general
      geographic positions of these locations relative to each other. Liberty Hill
      (where Santa Rita Ranch is located) is generally west of Austin, Texas. Hudson
      Oaks (where Oak Trail Shores is located) is west of Fort Worth, Texas.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Since both locations are in Texas and are described
      relative to major cities (Austin and Fort Worth), I need to consider the positions
      of Austin and Fort Worth. Austin is southeast of Fort Worth. Given that Santa
      Rita Ranch is near Austin and Oak Trail Shores is near Fort Worth, and considering
      Austin is southeast of Fort Worth, it means Santa Rita Ranch is generally southeast
      of Oak Trail Shores.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general directions and the relative positions
      of Austin and Fort Worth, Santa Rita Ranch, TX, is not west of Oak Trail Shores,
      TX. Instead, it is more southeast.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**.'

      3. **Relative positions**: Knowing that West Virginia is landlocked and to the
      north relative to Florida, which is a southeastern state with a long coastline
      along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.

      4. **East-West comparison**: Given the general geography of the United States,
      states to the east tend to be closer to the Atlantic Ocean, and those to the
      west are closer to the Pacific Ocean or are landlocked farther inland. Florida,
      being a southeastern state directly on the Atlantic, is generally east of most
      of the continental United States, including West Virginia.

      5. **Conclusion**: Since West Virginia is to the northwest of Florida in terms
      of the overall U.S. map, and considering the longitudinal positions (east-west),
      Mannington, WV would be northwest, not west in the strict sense of cardinal
      directions, of St. Lucie Village, FL. However, considering the question asks
      for a "west" positioning without strict adherence to cardinal directions, and
      given the general layperson''s understanding might consider anything not east
      as potentially "west" in a broad, non-technical sense, the geographical nuance
      could lead to confusion. Technically, though, Mannington, WV is more accurately
      described as northwest rather than strictly west of St. Lucie Village, FL.


      Given the complexity and the lay understanding of directions, but sticking strictly
      to the question''s YES/NO nature without considering nuanced directional understanding:

      \ these steps, the answer simplifies to whether Penngrove, CA is west of Nisqually\
      \ Indian Community, WA, considering the primary direction of their relationship\

      two locations in question. Dillonvale is in Ohio, and Sunset Village is in Georgia.


      2. **Determine the general geographic locations of Ohio and Georgia**: Ohio
      is located in the northeastern United States, while Georgia is in the southeastern
      part of the country.

      we can still make an educated guess based on the general locations. Dillonvale,
      OH, being in the eastern United States, and Sunset Village, GA, also being in

      1. **Identify the locations**: Dillonvale is in Ohio, and Sunset Village is

      2. **General geographic knowledge**: Ohio is generally located in the northern
      United States, and Georgia is in the southeastern part of the country.

      3. **Relative positions**: Since Ohio is to the north and somewhat west of Georgia,
      we need to consider the specific locations within these states.

      4. **Specific locations**: Dillonvale, Ohio, is in the eastern part of Ohio,
      which places it relatively east of the majority of the United States. Sunset
      Village, Georgia, being in the southeastern United States, is also in the eastern
      part of the country but further south and potentially east or southeast of Dillonvale.

      5. **West/east determination**: For Dillonvale to be west of Sunset Village,
      it would need to be positioned to the west on a map. Given the general geography,
      Ohio (where Dillonvale is) is north of Georgia (where Sunset Village is), but
      when comparing east-west positions, Georgia (especially the eastern and southern
      parts) could extend further east than parts of Ohio.


      Given these steps, we must consider that Dillonvale, Ohio, could potentially
      be west of Sunset Village, Georgia, but without exact longitudes, the answer
      might seem uncertain based on the general north-south relationship between the

      1. **Identify the locations**: Dillonvale, OH is in Ohio, and Sunset Village,
      GA is in Georgia.

      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West means the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in geographical terms, towards lower longitudes in the Western
      Hemisphere.

      3. **Determine the general geographical positions of Ohio and Georgia**: Ohio
      is located in the northeastern part of the United States, while Georgia is in
      the southeastern part.

      4. **Compare their longitudinal positions**: Since Ohio is to the north and
      west of Georgia in terms of their overall state positions within the U.S., any
      point in Ohio is likely to be west of any point in Georgia, considering the
      general east-west alignment of the states.


      Given these steps, Dillonvale, OH would indeed be west of Sunset Village, GA,
      based on the geographical layout of the United States.

      by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Braselton, GA is in the state of Georgia, and
      Rogers City, MI is in the state of Michigan.


      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Georgia is generally considered to be
      in the Southeastern United States, while Michigan is in the Great Lakes region
      of the Northern United States.


      3. **Relative east-west positions**: Knowing that the United States is laid
      out in a generally rectangular fashion on maps, with the east coast on the right
      and the west coast on the left, we can infer that Georgia (being closer to the
      east coast) is east of Michigan (which, while not directly on the west coast,
      is significantly further west than Georgia).


      4. **Conclusion based on geographical positions**: Since Georgia is east of
      Michigan, any city in Georgia (such as Braselton) would be east of any city
      in Michigan (such as Rogers City).


      Based on this step-by-step reasoning, the answer to whether Braselton, GA is
      located west of Rogers City, MI is: **NO**.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Braselton, GA is in the state of Georgia, and
      Rogers City, MI is in the state of Michigan.


      2. **General geographic knowledge**: Georgia is generally considered to be in
      the southeastern part of the United States, while Michigan is in the Great Lakes
      region of the northern United States.


      3. **Determine east-west relationship**: To be west of Rogers City, MI, a location
      must be to the west of it on a map. Given Georgia''s southeastern location and
      Michigan''s more northern and eastern location relative to many parts of the
      U.S., this already hints at the potential relationship.


      4. **Consider longitude**: A more precise way to determine the east-west relationship
      is by looking at the longitude of each city. If Braselton, GA has a higher longitude
      (more west) than Rogers City, MI, then it is west. However, without exact longitudes
      provided, we rely on general geographic principles.


      5. **Apply geographic principles**: Knowing that Georgia is to the southeast
      and Michigan is to the north (and slightly east of many southern states due
      to its position in the northern U.S.), it''s logical to infer that Braselton,
      GA would likely be south and possibly slightly east of Rogers City, MI, rather
      than west.

      west of Chesterbrook, PA, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to know where Collegeville, PA, and
      Chesterbrook, PA are. Collegeville is a borough in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.
      Chesterbrook is a census-designated place (CDP) also located in Chester County
      (but near the border with Montgomery County), Pennsylvania.


      2. **Understand Geographic Terms**: "West of" means that the location in question
      (Collegeville, PA) would be to the west on a map compared to the reference point
      (Chesterbrook, PA).


      3. **Research or Map Analysis**: Without a map, we can rely on general geographic
      knowledge. Collegeville is in Montgomery County, and Chesterbrook, while in
      Chester County, is relatively close to the Montgomery County border. However,
      to determine their relative positions, we need to consider their specific locations
      within their counties.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Knowing that Chester County is generally to the west
      of Philadelphia and Montgomery County is to the north, we can infer that locations
      within Chester County are likely to be west or southwest of locations in Montgomery
      County, depending on their exact positions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the proximity of these locations to the county borders
      and without exact longitude values, a precise determination requires detailed
      mapping. However, given that Chesterbrook is in Chester County, which is west
      of Montgomery County where Collegeville is, we can make an educated guess about
      their relative positions.


      Given these considerations, and acknowledging that this analysis lacks precise
      mapping or GPS coordinates, the likely answer, based on county locations and
      relative positions, would lean towards Collegeville being east of Chesterbrook
      due to the general east-west alignment of the counties (Montgomery County being
      east of Chester County). However, this is a simplification and does not account
      for the exact positions of these towns within their respective counties.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Collegeville, PA is located west of Chesterbrook,

      2. **Determine their counties**: Shallowater is located in Lubbock County, and
      Wolfforth is also located in Lubbock County.

      3. **Understand their relative positions**: Since both cities are in the same
      county, we need to look at their precise locations within Lubbock County to
      determine their relative east-west positions.

      4. **Consult a map or geographical data**: Without a map, we rely on general
      knowledge or data about these cities. Typically, Shallowater is known to be
      northwest of Lubbock, the county seat, and Wolfforth is known to be southwest
      of Lubbock.

      5. **Compare their positions**: If Shallowater is northwest of Lubbock and Wolfforth
      is southwest of Lubbock, considering the general layout, Shallowater would be
      more to the north and slightly east or directly north of Wolfforth, given their
      positions relative to Lubbock.

      6. **Conclusion**: Given the relative positions, with Shallowater being more
      north and potentially slightly east or directly north rather than west of Wolfforth,

      west of Neah Bay, WA, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Port Orford is a city located in the state of
      Oregon (OR), and Neah Bay is located in the state of Washington (WA).


      2. **Understand geographical positions**: Oregon is located south of Washington.
      However, to determine if Port Orford is west of Neah Bay, we need to consider
      their specific longitudes since "west" refers to a position in terms of longitude.


      3. **Consider Neah Bay''s location**: Neah Bay is situated on the Olympic Peninsula
      in Washington, near the Pacific coast. It is one of the westernmost points in
      the contiguous United States.


      4. **Consider Port Orford''s location**: Port Orford is also a coastal city
      but is located in southern Oregon. Given Oregon''s geographical layout, Port
      Orford, while being on the coast, is generally south of Neah Bay.


      5. **Longitude comparison**: Since both cities are coastal and near the Pacific
      Ocean, their longitudes are close. However, Neah Bay extends further west compared
      to most of Oregon''s coastline due to the shape of the Olympic Peninsula.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Neah Bay is one of the westernmost points in the
      contiguous United States and Port Orford, while being coastal, is generally
      to the south and not as far west as Neah Bay, the answer to whether Port Orford,
      OR is located west of Neah Bay, WA would be based on their relative longitudes.


      Based on these steps, the answer is: **NO**'
