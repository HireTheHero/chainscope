      is located west of Wacousta, MI, we need to consider their geographical locations.


      1. **Identify the location of Lake Lakengren, OH:** Lake Lakengren is a census-designated
      place in Preble County, Ohio. It is located in the southwestern part of Ohio.


      2. **Identify the location of Wacousta, MI:** Wacousta is an unincorporated
      community in Clinton County, Michigan. It is located in the central part of
      the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.


      3. **Determine their relative positions:** Ohio is generally south and slightly
      east of Michigan. Given that Lake Lakengren is in the southwestern part of Ohio
      and Wacousta is in central Michigan, we can conclude that Lake Lakengren is
      likely to be west of Wacousta.

      1. **Locate Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek, NY**: Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is a
      hamlet in the town of Clifton Park, which is in Saratoga County, New York. It
      is located in the eastern part of the state, north of Albany.


      2. **Locate Sleepy Hollow Lake, NY**: Sleepy Hollow Lake is a residential community

      Athens, and is also in the eastern part of the state.


      3. **Compare Longitude**: To determine which location is west, we need to compare
      their longitudes. Generally, areas with a greater longitude value (more negative
      in the Western Hemisphere) are located further west.


      - Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek, NY is near Clifton Park, which has an approximate
      longitude of around -73.80.

      - Sleepy Hollow Lake, NY, near Athens, has an approximate longitude of around
      -73.80 as well.


      Since both locations are approximately on the same longitude (with minor differences),
      neither is significantly west or east of the other. Therefore, the answer is
      not straightforwardly YES or NO based on the question''s requirement for a clear
      westward location.
