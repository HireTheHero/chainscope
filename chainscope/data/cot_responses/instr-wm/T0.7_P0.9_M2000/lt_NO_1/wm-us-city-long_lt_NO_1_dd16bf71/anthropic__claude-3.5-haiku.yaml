      1. First, I''ll locate Penngrove, CA on a map

      - Penngrove is in Sonoma County, California, in the northern part of the state

      - It is located in the San Francisco Bay Area region

      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Penngrove is in northern California

      - Nisqually Indian Community is in western Washington

      - California is south of Washington

      - Within their respective states, Penngrove is further west than the Nisqually
