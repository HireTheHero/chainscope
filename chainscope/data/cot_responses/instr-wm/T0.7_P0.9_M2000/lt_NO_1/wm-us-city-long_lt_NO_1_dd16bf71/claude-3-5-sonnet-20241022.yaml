      1. First, let me recall the general geography:

      - Sully is in Iowa (IA)

      - Lindstrom is in Minnesota (MN)


      2. Minnesota is generally north of Iowa


      3. However, for east/west positioning:

      - Sully, IA is in central Iowa

      - Lindstrom, MN is in eastern Minnesota, close to the Wisconsin border


      4. Cities near the Wisconsin border are quite far east

      - Lindstrom is only about 40 miles from Wisconsin

      - Sully is in central Iowa, well west of the Mississippi River


      5. Therefore, even though they''re in different states, Sully, IA would be west
      of Lindstrom, MN

      2. To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their relative
      positions:

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of New Jersey

      - Since Raubsville is in eastern PA, near the NJ border, and Carlls Corner is
      in southern NJ, Raubsville would still be west of Carlls Corner


      3. Looking at their specific locations:

      - Raubsville is in the eastern edge of PA

      - Carlls Corner is in Cumberland County, NJ, which is in the southern part of
      the state

      - Even though Raubsville is quite far east in PA, any point in PA is still west
      of southern NJ locations


      YES, Raubsville, PA is located west of Carlls Corner, NJ.'

      - Mannington, WV is in northern West Virginia

      - St. Lucie Village, FL is on the eastern coast of Florida


      2) Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - West Virginia is significantly further north than Florida

      - Los Fresnos, being on the eastern edge of Texas, is significantly further
      east than Healdton


      Therefore, Healdton, OK is west of Los Fresnos, TX.
