      YES, Musaler is located west of Aparan.'
    fc14cee7-b137-4cca-a14d-88df792c2599: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Musaler and Aparan are both located in Armenia


      2) Musaler is in western Armenia, near Mount Aragats


      3) Aparan is located in the Aragatsotn Province, in central Armenia


      4) Looking at their relative positions:

      - Musaler is in the western part of Armenia

      - Aparan is more towards the central part of Armenia

      1. First, I need to locate both places:

      - Brownsboro, Texas is in eastern Texas

      - Rogers County, Oklahoma is in northeastern Oklahoma


      2. To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their relative
      positions:

      - Brownsboro, TX is located in Henderson County, Texas

      - When comparing their positions, Brownsboro, TX is actually southeast of Rogers
      County, OK

      - Being southeast means it is east, not west of Rogers County


      3. Since Brownsboro is east (not west) of Rogers County, the answer is clear.


      NO'

      2. Next, let me recall where San Benito County is located:

      - San Benito County is on the Central Coast

      - It''s inland from Monterey Bay

      - It''s in the western part of California


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Grass Valley is much further east in California, being in the Sierra foothills

      - San Benito County is closer to the Pacific coast

      - Therefore, Grass Valley must be east of San Benito County, not west

    ed5aba92-b09f-4a42-b334-4ff19b31a486: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me locate both places:

      - Magor is in Monmouthshire, Wales, near the Severn Estuary

      - Craven Arms is in Shropshire, England


      2. To determine their relative positions:

      - Magor is in southeast Wales

      - Craven Arms is in central Shropshire


      3. Looking at their positions on a map:

      - Magor is positioned further west than Craven Arms

      - Craven Arms sits more to the east in the English Midlands


      Therefore: YES, Magor is located west of Craven Arms.'
