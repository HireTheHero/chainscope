      of East Garo Hills district, we need to understand the geographical locations
      of both places and then compare their positions.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Goalpara is a district in the Indian state of
      Assam, located in the northeastern part of the country. East Garo Hills district
      is also a district in the state of Meghalaya, India, which is adjacent to Assam.


      2. **Consider their geographical positions**: Both Goalpara and East Garo Hills
      district are located in the northeastern part of India. However, Goalpara is
      in Assam, which is to the east of Meghalaya where East Garo Hills district is
      located.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Since Goalpara is in Assam and East Garo Hills
      district is in Meghalaya, and Meghalaya is to the west of Assam, Goalpara is
      located to the east of East Garo Hills district.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

    0ee21512-45f8-4be2-8b02-bb8552c6cec7: 'To determine whether Boone County, Nebraska
      is located west of Antelope County, Nebraska, we need to understand the geography
      of Nebraska and the relative positions of these two counties within the state.


      1. **Geography of Nebraska**: Nebraska is a state in the Midwestern United States.
      It is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east, Missouri to the
      southeast, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest, and Wyoming to the
      west.


      2. **Location of Boone County**: Boone County is located in the northeastern
      part of Nebraska. It is bordered by Madison County to the east, Platte County
      to the south, Nance County to the southwest, Wheeler County to the west, and
      Holt County to the north.


      3. **Location of Antelope County**: Antelope County is also located in the northeastern
      part of Nebraska. It is bordered by Knox County to the north, Cedar County to
      the east, Pierce County to the southeast, Madison County to the south, Boone
      County to the southwest, and Holt County to the west.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Given the above information, we can see that Boone
      County is directly west of Antelope County. This is evident from the fact that
      Antelope County borders Boone County to the southwest.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geography of Nebraska and the relative positions

      is indeed located west of Antelope County, Nebraska.
