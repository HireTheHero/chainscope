      \ by step to determine whether Bombo, Uganda is located west of Apac.\n\n###\
      \ Step 1: Understand the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to know where Bombo and\
      \ Apac are located in Uganda.\n\n- **Bombo**: From what I recall, Bombo is a\
      \ town in central Uganda, situated in the Luwero District. It's known for its\
      \ historical significance, particularly during the Ugandan Bush War.\n  \n-\
      \ **Apac**: Apac is a town in northern Uganda and serves as the main municipality\
      \ of Apac District.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Both Towns on a Map\n\nTo determine\
      \ their relative positions, I should visualize or refer to a map of Uganda.\n\
      \n- **Bombo's Position**: Central Uganda, slightly north of Kampala, the capital\
      \ city.\n  \n- **Apac's Position**: Northern Uganda, more towards the northwest\
      \ relative to Kampala.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Relative Directions\n\n\
      Now, I need to figure out if Bombo is west of Apac.\n\n- From Kampala (central\
      \ point):\n  - Bombo is to the north.\n  - Apac is to the northwest.\n\nBut\
      \ wait, this seems contradictory because both are north of Kampala, but Apac\
      \ is further northwest.\n\nLet's consider:\n\n- If Apac is northwest of Kampala,\
      \ and Bombo is north of Kampala, then Bombo would be east of Apac because northwest\
      \ implies a direction that is both north and west.\n\n### Step 4: Verify with\
      \ Coordinates (Optional)\n\nTo be more precise, I can look up the geographic\
      \ coordinates:\n\n- **Bombo**: Approximately 0.5833\xB0 N, 32.5333\xB0 E\n-\
      \ **Apac**: Approximately 1.9833\xB0 N, 32.5333\xB0 E\n\nComparing these:\n\n\
      - Both are around 32.5333\xB0 E longitude.\n- Bombo is at 0.5833\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      - Apac is at 1.9833\xB0 N latitude.\n\nSince both have the same longitude but\
      \ Apac has a higher latitude (more north), Bombo is south of Apac, not west.\n\
      \nWait, this contradicts my earlier assumption based on the northwest direction.\n\
      \nLet me double-check.\n\nGiven that both have the same longitude, their east-west\
      \ position is the same. The difference is in latitude, indicating a north-south\
      \ relationship.\n\nSo, Bombo is south of Apac, not west.\n\n### Step 5: Re-evaluate\
      \ Initial Assumptions\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in step 3 by assuming Apac\
      \ is northwest of Kampala. Let's reassess:\n\n- Kampala: 0.3136\xB0 N, 32.5811\xB0\
      \ E\n- Bombo: 0.5833\xB0 N, 32.5333\xB0 E\n- Apac: 1.9833\xB0 N, 32.5333\xB0\
      \ E\n\nComparing these:\n\n- Both Bombo and Apac are east of Kampala since their\
      \ longitudes are similar.\n- Apac is further north than Bombo.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Bombo is south of Apac, not west.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nBased on the\
      \ coordinates and relative positions:\n\n- Bombo and Apac share the same longitude,\
      \ meaning they are directly north-south of each other.\n- Bombo is at a lower\
      \ latitude than Apac, placing it south of Apac.\n\nTherefore, Bombo is **not**\
      \ west of Apac; it is directly south of Apac.\n\n**Final Answer: NO**"
    f94ad65c-6651-41d7-8a4b-dcb4b03e6fea: 'To determine whether Bombo, Uganda is located
      west of Apac, we need to analyze the geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Locate Bombo, Uganda**: Bombo is a town in the Central Region of Uganda,
      approximately 33 kilometers (20.5 miles) north of Kampala, the capital city.
      It lies to the northeast of Kampala.


      2. **Locate Apac, Uganda**: Apac is a town in the Northern Region of Uganda,
      situated northwest of Kampala. It is approximately 250 kilometers (155 miles)
      north of Kampala.


      3. **Compare their positions relative to Kampala**: Since Bombo is northeast
      of Kampala and Apac is northwest of Kampala, Bombo is further east than Apac.

      Generally, places with lower longitude values are further west. Botley, Hampshire,
      has a longitude of approximately -1.28 degrees, while Potto, North Yorkshire,
      has a longitude of approximately -1.22 degrees.


      ### Step 5: Conclusion

      Since -1.28 degrees is further west than -1.22 degrees, Botley, Hampshire, is
      indeed located west of Potto, North Yorkshire.


      Final Answer: YES.'

    ad8204e8-b5bc-475e-af53-b417b7d12e6f: "Alright, I'm trying to figure out if Collins,\
      \ Iowa is located west of Colo, Iowa. I'm not entirely sure about the exact\
      \ locations of these towns in Iowa, but I'll break it down step by step to find\
      \ the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Locate Iowa on a Map\nFirst, I need to know where\
      \ Iowa is in the United States. Iowa is a state located in the Midwestern region\
      \ of the US. It's bordered by Minnesota to the north, Wisconsin and Illinois\
      \ to the east, Missouri to the south, and Nebraska and South Dakota to the west.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Identify the General Locations of Collins and Colo\nNext, I need\
      \ to find out where Collins and Colo are within Iowa. Since I don't have a map\
      \ in front of me, I'll try to recall or imagine their positions.\n\n- **Collins,\
      \ Iowa**: I think Collins is located in the central part of Iowa.\n- **Colo,\
      \ Iowa**: I believe Colo is also in central Iowa, possibly a bit north of Collins.\n\
      \n### Step 3: Determine Their Relative Positions\nNow, I need to figure out\
      \ if Collins is west of Colo.\n\nSince both are in central Iowa, the key is\
      \ to see their east-west alignment.\n\nIf Collins is more towards the western\
      \ side of Iowa compared to Colo, then Collins is west of Colo. Conversely, if\
      \ Colo is further west than Collins, then Collins is east of Colo.\n\n### Step\
      \ 4: Use Mental Mapping\nLet's try to visualize a rough map:\n\n- Imagine Iowa\
      \ as a rectangle with the western border closer to Nebraska.\n- If Collins is\
      \ in the central part but slightly west, and Colo is more central or slightly\
      \ east, then Collins would be west of Colo.\n\nAlternatively, if Colo is actually\
      \ further west than Collins, then Collins would be east of Colo.\n\n### Step\
      \ 5: Seek Confirmation\nTo be sure, I recall that Colo is located near the intersection\
      \ of Interstate 35 and U.S. Route 30, which is in the central part of Iowa.\
      \ Collins is situated a bit southwest of Colo.\n\nThis suggests that Collins\
      \ is indeed west of Colo.\n\n### Step 6: Final Verification\nTo confirm, let's\
      \ think about the coordinates:\n\n- **Colo, Iowa**: Approximately 42.0167\xB0\
      \ N, 93.3178\xB0 W\n- **Collins, Iowa**: Approximately 41.9028\xB0 N, 93.3061\xB0\
      \ W\n\nComparing the longitude:\n\n- Colo: 93.3178\xB0 W\n- Collins: 93.3061\xB0\
      \ W\n\nSince 93.3061\xB0 W is slightly less west than 93.3178\xB0 W, Collins\
      \ is actually a bit east of Colo.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier assumption.\
      \ Let me double-check.\n\nActually, the lower the longitude number (in the western\
      \ hemisphere), the further west the location is. So, 93.3178\xB0 W is further\
      \ west than 93.3061\xB0 W.\n\nTherefore, Colo (93.3178\xB0 W) is further west\
      \ than Collins (93.3061\xB0 W).\n\n### Step 7: Correct Conclusion\nBased on\
      \ the longitude coordinates:\n\n- Colo is located at 93.3178\xB0 W\n- Collins\
      \ is located at 93.3061\xB0 W\n\nSince 93.3178\xB0 W is further west than 93.3061\xB0\
      \ W, **Colo is west of Collins**, meaning **Collins is east of Colo**.\n\n###\
      \ Final Answer\n**NO**, Collins, Iowa is not located west of Colo, Iowa; it\
      \ is located east of Colo."

      \ by step. The goal is to determine whether Sanmenxia is located west of Tumed\
      \ Left Banner. To do this, we'll need to:\n\n1. **Identify the locations of\
      \ Sanmenxia and Tumed Left Banner.**\n2. **Understand their geographical coordinates\
      \ (latitude and longitude).**\n3. **Compare their longitudes to determine which\
      \ one is further west.**\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Locations\n\n**Sanmenxia:**\n\
      Sanmenxia is a prefecture-level city in the western part of Henan Province,\
      \ China. It's known for its strategic location along the Yellow River and its\
      \ historical significance.\n\n**Tumed Left Banner:**\nTumed Left Banner, also\
      \ known as Tumed Zuoqi, is a county-level division in Inner Mongolia Autonomous\
      \ Region, China. It's part of the Hohhot prefecture-level city.\n\n### Step\
      \ 2: Understanding Geographical Coordinates\n\nTo compare their positions accurately,\
      \ we need to look at their latitudes and longitudes.\n\n**Sanmenxia:**\n - Latitude:\
      \ Approximately 34.76\xB0 N\n - Longitude: Approximately 111.19\xB0 E\n\n**Tumed\
      \ Left Banner:**\n - Latitude: Approximately 40.84\xB0 N\n - Longitude: Approximately\
      \ 111.65\xB0 E\n\n### Step 3: Comparing the Longitudes\n\nThe key to determining\
      \ which location is further west lies in their longitudes. In geography:\n\n\
      - **Lower longitude values** indicate a position further **west**.\n- **Higher\
      \ longitude values** indicate a position further **east**.\n\nLet's compare:\n\
      \n - Sanmenxia: 111.19\xB0 E\n - Tumed Left Banner: 111.65\xB0 E\n\nSince 111.19\xB0\
      \ E is less than 111.65\xB0 E, Sanmenxia has a lower longitude value.\n\n###\
      \ Conclusion\n\nBased on the comparison of longitudes:\n\n- **Sanmenxia (111.19\xB0\

    dd58f89b-87b5-4f42-8715-881239d50707: 'Alright, let''s tackle this question step
      by step. The goal is to determine whether North Region, Singapore is located
      west of Hougang. To answer this, we''ll need to understand the geographical
      layout of Singapore, specifically the locations of North Region and Hougang.


      ### Step 1: Understanding Singapore''s Regions


      Singapore is divided into five main regions:


      1. **Central Region**

      2. **East Region**

      3. **North Region**

      4. **North-East Region**

      5. **West Region**


      Each region consists of several planning areas and neighborhoods.


      ### Step 2: Locating Hougang


      Hougang is a planning area and a residential town situated in the North-East
      Region of Singapore. It''s known for its HDB flats, shopping malls, and local
      markets.


      ### Step 3: Locating North Region


      The North Region of Singapore includes areas like Woodlands, Sembawang, Yishun,
      and Kranji. It''s situated in the northern part of Singapore, bordering Malaysia.


      ### Step 4: Determining the Relative Positions


      To determine if North Region is west of Hougang, we need to look at their positions
      relative to each other.


      - **Hougang** is in the North-East Region, which is to the east of the Central
      Region.

      - **North Region** is directly north of the Central Region.


      ### Step 5: Analyzing the Directions


      If we visualize Singapore''s map:


      - **North Region** is to the north.

      - **Hougang** is in the northeast.


      Given that the North Region is north of the Central Region and Hougang is northeast
      of the Central Region, it implies that North Region is to the west of Hougang.


      ### Step 6: Conclusion


      Based on the geographical positioning:


      - **North Region** is located to the **west** of **Hougang**.


      **Final Answer:** YES, North Region, Singapore is located west of Hougang.'

    dd6b392f-b048-4cdd-81ce-8db87e14a078: 'Alright, let''s tackle this question step
      by step. The goal is to determine whether Fuga Island is located west of Yuli,
      Hualien. To answer this, we''ll need to gather some geographical information
      about both locations.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Locations


      **Fuga Island:**

      First, I need to find out where Fuga Island is located. A quick search reveals
      that Fuga Island is part of the Philippines. It''s situated in the northern
      part of the country, specifically in the Cagayan province.


      **Yuli, Hualien:**

      Next, Yuli is a township in Hualien County, which is located on the eastern
      side of Taiwan. Hualien County is known for its scenic landscapes and is on
      the Pacific coast of Taiwan.


      ### Step 2: Determine the Relative Positions


      Now that we''ve identified both locations, we need to determine their positions
      relative to each other.


      **Philippines and Taiwan:**

      The Philippines is an archipelago located to the southeast of Taiwan. Specifically,
      the northern part of the Philippines, where Fuga Island is, is situated to the
      south of Taiwan.


      **Yuli, Hualien''s Location:**

      Yuli is on the eastern coast of Taiwan, facing the Pacific Ocean.


      ### Step 3: Analyzing the Directions


      To find out if Fuga Island is west of Yuli, Hualien, we need to consider the
      relative positioning:


      - **Yuli, Hualien** is on the eastern side of Taiwan.

      - **Fuga Island** is to the south of Taiwan, in the northern Philippines.


      From Yuli, looking westward would mean looking towards the interior of Taiwan
      and then further west towards mainland China and other western regions.


      Since Fuga Island is to the south of Taiwan, it doesn''t lie directly west of
      Yuli but rather to the south or southeast.


      ### Step 4: Conclusion


      Based on the geographical positions:


      - Yuli, Hualien is in eastern Taiwan.

      - Fuga Island is in the northern Philippines, to the south of Taiwan.


      Therefore, Fuga Island is not located west of Yuli, Hualien; it is situated
      to the south or southeast.


      **Final Answer:** NO.'
