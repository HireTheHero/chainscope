    2610ecd6-cb31-468d-8b41-06c8a1380ab8: 'To determine whether Scott Island is located
      west of Rabi Island, we need to consider their geographical locations.


      1. **Identify the location of Scott Island**: Scott Island is a small, uninhabited
      island in the Southern Ocean, part of the Ross Dependency claimed by New Zealand.
      It is located at approximately 67 degrees south latitude and 179 degrees west
      longitude.


      2. **Identify the location of Rabi Island**: Rabi Island is located in the Pacific
      Ocean and is part of Fiji. It is situated at approximately 16 degrees south
      latitude and 179 degrees east longitude.


      3. **Compare their longitudes**: Scott Island is at 179 degrees west longitude,
      while Rabi Island is at 179 degrees east longitude. The 180-degree meridian
      separates the eastern and western hemispheres.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Scott Island, being at 179 degrees
      west, is just west of the 180-degree meridian. Rabi Island, at 179 degrees east,
      is just east of the 180-degree meridian.


      Based on these locations, Scott Island is situated to the west of Rabi Island.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.'

      \ in the southwestern part of Nigeria, on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\
      \n2. **Locate Rou\xEFba**: Rou\xEFba is a suburb of Algiers, the capital city\
      \ of Algeria. Algiers is located in the northern part of Algeria, along the\
      \ Mediterranean coast.\n\n3. **Compare their longitudinal positions**: \n  \
      \ - Apapa (Lagos) is approximately at 3.4\xB0 East longitude.\n   - Rou\xEF\
      ba (Algiers) is approximately at 3.3\xB0 East longitude.\n\nSince the longitudinal\
      \ coordinate for Apapa is slightly more than that of Rou\xEFba, Apapa is located\
      \ slightly east of Rou\xEFba.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: NO."
