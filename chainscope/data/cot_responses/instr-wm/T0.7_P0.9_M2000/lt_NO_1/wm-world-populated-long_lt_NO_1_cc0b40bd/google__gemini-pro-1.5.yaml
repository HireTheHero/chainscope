    050b5bf2-6040-427f-b407-fa61ef475b2b: '1. **Locate Scott Island:** Scott Island
      is a small, uninhabited island located in the Southern Ocean, near Antarctica.

      2. **Locate Rabi Island:** Rabi Island is part of Fiji, located in the South
      Pacific Ocean.

      3. **Determine Longitude:**  Scott Island is far east of the prime meridian
      (180 degrees longitude), while Rabi Island is west of it.  Moving westward from
      Rabi Island across the Pacific would eventually lead to Scott Island.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

    1dc66129-0d56-4b5d-862d-dbe2e91a6888: '1. **Locate Scott Island:** Scott Island
      is a small, uninhabited island located in the Southern Ocean, near Antarctica.


      2. **Locate Rabi Island:** Rabi Island is part of Fiji, located in the South
      Pacific Ocean.


      3. **Consider Longitude:**  West of a location means it has a lower longitude.  Since
      Scott Island is close to Antarctica and Rabi Island is in the Pacific, Scott
      Island is much further east (closer to 180 degrees longitude) than Rabi Island
      (around 170 degrees East).


      Therefore, Scott Island is *east* of Rabi Island.

      2. **Locate Rabi Island:** Rabi Island is part of Fiji, located in the South
      Pacific Ocean.


      3. **Determine relative longitude:**  Longitude is the east-west measurement
      on the Earth.  Since Scott Island is near Antarctica, it''s far to the east
      of Fiji, which is in the Pacific.


      4. **West vs. East:** The question asks if Scott Island is *west* of Rabi Island.  Since
      Scott Island is *east* of Rabi Island, the answer is no.


      NO

      Yorkshire is in the north.  Generally, locations further south will be west
      of locations further north on a map of England. However, a more precise answer
      requires a closer look, as England isn''t perfectly oriented north-south.


      4. **More precise positioning:** Checking a map shows that while Horndean is
      south of Skipwith, it''s also significantly *east*.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.

      3. **Relative positions:** Hampshire is in the south of England, and North Yorkshire
      is in the north of England.  Generally, locations in Hampshire will be east
      of those in Yorkshire due to the curvature of the UK coastline.

      2. **Wisconsin vs. Illinois:** Wisconsin is directly west of most of Illinois.


      3. **Specific Locations (approximate):** Stevens Point is somewhat north within
      Wisconsin. Peoria Heights is rather centrally located in Illinois, not especially
      far north or south.


      4. **North/South difference:** Because Stevens Point is further north, it might
      make it seem like it''s not as directly west of Peoria Heights. However, Wisconsin
      as a whole is west of Illinois. Unless Stevens Point is extraordinarily far
      north, it will still be west of Peoria Heights.


      5. **Conclusion:** Stevens Point is likely west of Peoria Heights.

      the state lines jog eastward as you go north.  So simply knowing that Stevens
      Point is in Wisconsin and Peoria Heights is in Illinois isn''t enough.


      3. **Relative Longitude:** We need to consider their longitude.  Stevens Point
      is further north than Peoria Heights.  The question is whether that northerly
      position puts Stevens Point far enough west to overcome the eastward jog in
      the state line.  A quick check of a map reveals Stevens Point is at roughly
      -89.5 degrees longitude and Peoria Heights is at roughly -89.6 degrees longitude.
