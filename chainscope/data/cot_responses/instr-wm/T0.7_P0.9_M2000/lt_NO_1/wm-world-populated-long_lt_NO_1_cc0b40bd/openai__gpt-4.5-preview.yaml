      4. The West Bank, including Beitunia, is situated clearly southwest of Ukraine''s
      Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

      5. Therefore, Beitunia is not located west of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, but rather
      southwest (more to the south and west).


      Since the question specifically asks if Beitunia is located west of Zaporizhzhia
      Oblast, and Beitunia is actually southwest, the answer would still be "YES,"
      because "southwest" is still partially westward.

      Answer: YES'
    ce9a5ed8-18bb-409e-ab2f-ab1bfe27d785: 'Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. Horndean is located in Hampshire, England.

      2. Skipwith is located in North Yorkshire, England.

      3. Hampshire is situated in southern England, while North Yorkshire is further
      north.

      4. To determine whether Horndean is west of Skipwith, we need to consider their
      relative positions longitudinally (east-west axis).

      5. Hampshire (Horndean) lies roughly southwest of North Yorkshire (Skipwith).
      However, because England narrows slightly towards the south and west, Hampshire
      generally lies to the west of North Yorkshire.

      6. More specifically, Skipwith is located in eastern North Yorkshire, near York.
      Horndean is located in southern Hampshire, near Portsmouth, which is indeed
      further west compared to eastern North Yorkshire.


      Therefore, Horndean is indeed located west of Skipwith.

      2. Pugwash, Nova Scotia is located further north and somewhat westward along
      Nova Scotia''s Northumberland Shore, facing Prince Edward Island.

      3. Nova Scotia is oriented in a northeast-southwest direction, meaning that
      some places on the northern coast (like Pugwash) can actually be located more
      westward than places on the southern/eastern coast (like Bedford).

      4. Checking a map or recalling geographic knowledge: Bedford (near Halifax)
      is situated toward the southeastern coast of Nova Scotia, while Pugwash is indeed
      located further north and west on the Northumberland Strait shoreline.

      Step 1: Bedford is part of the Halifax Regional Municipality, located near Halifax,
      Nova Scotia, Canada. Bedford is situated approximately in the central-southern
      part of Nova Scotia.


      Step 2: Pugwash is located on the north shore of Nova Scotia, along the Northumberland
      Strait, in Cumberland County. It is situated generally further north and slightly
      west of the Halifax area.


      Step 3: Given that Bedford (Halifax area) is towards the southeastern side of
      Nova Scotia, and Pugwash is along the northern coast, it seems likely that Bedford
      is located somewhat east or southeast of Pugwash.


      Step 4: Considering that Pugwash is on Nova Scotia''s north shore and Bedford
      is located more toward the southeastern coast near Halifax, Bedford would generally
      lie east (and slightly south) of Pugwash, not west.


      Thus, the answer to the question "Is Bedford, Nova Scotia located west of Pugwash,

      - Thingangyun Township is also located in Myanmar, specifically it is one of
      the townships in Yangon city.

      Step 1: Identify locations of both towns:

      - Vincentown, New Jersey, is located in Burlington County, in the southern-central
      portion of New Jersey.

      - Branchville, New Jersey, is located in Sussex County, in the northwestern
      portion of New Jersey.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions geographically:

      - Burlington County (Vincentown) lies in the central-southern region of New
      Jersey.

      - Sussex County (Branchville) lies in the far northwestern region of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Evaluate the longitude (east-west position):

      - Northwestern New Jersey (Branchville) is generally further west compared to
      the central or southern parts of New Jersey (Vincentown).

      - Thus, we can infer that Branchville is likely more to the west, and Vincentown
      is likely more east.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places:

      - Vincentown is located in southern-central New Jersey, within Burlington County.

      - Branchville is located in northern New Jersey, within Sussex County.


      Step 2: Consider geographic orientation:

      - Burlington County (Vincentown) is generally in the southern-central region
      of New Jersey.

      - Sussex County (Branchville) is located in the northern region of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Check their relative east-west positions:

      Typically, northern Sussex County towns like Branchville are situated toward
      the northwest portion of New Jersey. Vincentown, being in Burlington County,
      is located more centrally or slightly towards the south-central area of the
      state.

      \n2. Consider the relative positions:\n   - Generally speaking, North America\
      \ is located north of South America. But the question asks specifically about\
      \ the west-east direction.\n   - Chile is located along the western coast of\

      2. Craven Arms is located in Shropshire, England. Shropshire is located to the
      north-east of Monmouthshire.

      3. We must determine if Magor (in southeast Wales) is situated west of Craven
      Arms (in Shropshire, England).

      4. Shropshire, including Craven Arms, is generally located to the northeast
      of Monmouthshire.

      5. Given that Magor is in Monmouthshire, which lies to the southwest of Craven
      Arms, it follows that Magor must indeed be to the west (and south) of Craven
      Arms.


      Conclusion:

      YES'
    fe9f574d-dfce-4448-811c-e9820082d8a7: 'Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. Magor is located in Monmouthshire, which is in southeastern Wales, near the
      Wales-England border.

      2. Craven Arms is located in Shropshire, England, which lies to the north and
      slightly east of Monmouthshire.

      3. Generally speaking, Shropshire (where Craven Arms is located) is situated
      to the northeast of Monmouthshire.

      4. Thus, Magor, being in southeastern Wales, is likely located to the south
      and west of Craven Arms.


      Therefore, Magor, Monmouthshire is indeed located west of Craven Arms.
