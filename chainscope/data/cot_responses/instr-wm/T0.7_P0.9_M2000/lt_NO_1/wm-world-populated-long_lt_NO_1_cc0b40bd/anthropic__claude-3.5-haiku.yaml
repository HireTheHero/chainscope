    ef1a0154-e953-491b-8462-11899ac93326: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to identify where Bagha Upazila and Mahishadal are located.


      2. Bagha Upazila is a subdivision (upazila) located in Rajshahi District, Bangladesh.


      3. Mahishadal is a community development block located in Purba Medinipur District,
      West Bengal, India.


      4. These locations are in different countries and different regions - Bangladesh
      and India.


      5. More specifically, Bagha Upazila is in the western part of Bangladesh, while
      Mahishadal is in eastern India.


      6. To determine if Bagha Upazila is west of Mahishadal, I need to compare their
      geographical positions.


      7. Given their locations in different countries and regions, Bagha Upazila is
      actually east of Mahishadal, not west.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I need to locate Sarrin and Lushoto geographically.


      2. Sarrin is a location in Syria, in the northern part of the country.


      3. Lushoto is a town in northeastern Tanzania, located in the Usambara Mountains.


      4. Syria is in the Middle East, while Tanzania is in East Africa.


      5. These locations are on different continents, with Syria being much further
      west than Tanzania.


      6. Therefore, Sarrin is indeed located west of Lushoto.

    faa8548f-b68e-4eef-a49e-10c5b831e4a0: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Matsudo and Urayasu on a map of Japan.


      2. Both cities are located in Chiba Prefecture, which is east of Tokyo.


      3. Specifically, Matsudo is located in the northwestern part of Chiba Prefecture.


      4. Urayasu is located in the southwestern part of Chiba Prefecture, closer to
      Tokyo Bay.
