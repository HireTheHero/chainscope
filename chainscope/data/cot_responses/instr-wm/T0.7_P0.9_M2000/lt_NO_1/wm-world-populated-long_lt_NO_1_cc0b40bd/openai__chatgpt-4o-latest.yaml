      1. **Little Silver, New Jersey** is a borough located in Monmouth County, along
      the eastern side of New Jersey, near the Atlantic Ocean.

      2. **Cornwall, New York** is a town in Orange County, New York, situated along

      - Little Silver is in eastern New Jersey, closer to the coast.

      - Cornwall is in southeastern New York, but further inland and to the west of
