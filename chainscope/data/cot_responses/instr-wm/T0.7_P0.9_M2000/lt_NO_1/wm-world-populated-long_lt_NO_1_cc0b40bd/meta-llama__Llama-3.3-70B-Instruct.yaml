    2d3ec8ba-8204-4d50-a5aa-cccffab62ffb: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Scott Island and Rabi Island**: First, we need to know where these
      islands are located. Scott Island is a small island in the Ross Sea, Antarctica.
      Rabi Island, on the other hand, is located in the Pacific Ocean and is part
      of Fiji.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: To determine if Scott Island is west
      of Rabi Island, we need to understand the geographic layout. The Antarctic region
      (where Scott Island is located) is generally southeast of the Pacific Islands
      (where Rabi Island is located).


      3. **Consider Longitudes**: The longitude of a place tells us how far east or
      west it is from the prime meridian. Scott Island, being in Antarctica, has a
      longitude that would place it generally east of many Pacific islands, given
      the way the Earth is mapped and considering the longitudinal span of the Pacific
      Ocean.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Given that Scott Island is in the Antarctic region
      and Rabi Island is in the Pacific, near Fiji, we can determine their relative
      positions. Antarctica is generally southwest of Fiji, but considering the curvature
      of the Earth and the longitudinal positions, Scott Island would likely be more
      southeast or even due south of Rabi Island rather than directly west.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations and understanding of
      directions, it''s unlikely that Scott Island is directly west of Rabi Island.
      The positions of these islands suggest that Scott Island is more to the south
      or southeast of Rabi Island, rather than directly west.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      2. **Consider geographical positions**: Antarctica, where Scott Island is located,
      is at the bottom of the world, surrounded by the Southern Ocean. Fiji, where
      Rabi Island is situated, is in the Pacific, north of New Zealand.


      3. **Determine the direction**: Given that Antarctica is south and Fiji is north,
      we can conclude that Scott Island (in Antarctica) is south of Rabi Island (in
      Fiji).


      4. **West or East**: Considering the general geography, Fiji is west of the
      International Date Line, which roughly passes through the middle of the Pacific
      Ocean. Antarctica, being at the bottom of the world, spans across the South
      Pole and thus can be both east and west of the Date Line, but for the area where

      1. **Scott Island**: Scott Island is a small island in the Ross Sea, which is

    77105013-86cd-4953-8b99-997addc9fb32: "To determine if Bombo, Uganda is located\
      \ west of Apac, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Locations**:\
      \ First, we need to identify the locations of Bombo and Apac on a map. Bombo\
      \ is a town in Luweero District in the Central Region of Uganda, and Apac is\
      \ a town in Apac District in the Northern Region of Uganda.\n\n2. **Understand\
      \ Geographic Directions**: West refers to the direction towards the setting\
      \ sun, which is to the left when facing north.\n\n3. **Determine Relative Positions**:\
      \ \n   - Bombo, being in the Central Region, is relatively closer to the center\
      \ of Uganda.\n   - Apac, being in the Northern Region, is positioned northwards\
      \ compared to the central region.\n\n4. **Consider Uganda's Geography**: Uganda\
      \ is a landlocked country located in East Africa. Its geography includes various\
      \ regions, with the central region being more towards the southern part of the\
      \ country and the northern region being, as the name suggests, towards the north.\n\
      \n5. **Apply Geographic Knowledge**: Knowing that Bombo is in the central part\
      \ and Apac is in the northern part doesn't directly tell us the east-west relationship\
      \ but knowing Uganda's layout, the northern region stretches both east and west\
      \ of the central region. However, considering the country's shape and the typical\
      \ layout of its regions, moving from the central region towards the north would\
      \ generally involve moving in a northerly direction, with less emphasis on east-west\
      \ movement in this context.\n\n6. **Specific Locations**: \n   - Bombo is situated\
      \ approximately at 0.5833\xB0 N, 32.5333\xB0 E.\n   - Apac is situated approximately\
      \ at 1.9833\xB0 N, 32.5333\xB0 E.\n\n7. **Comparison**: Given the longitude\
      \ (east-west coordinate) for both locations is approximately the same (32.5333\xB0\
      \ E), this means they are roughly on the same east-west line. The difference\
      \ lies primarily in their latitude (north-south coordinate), with Apac being\
      \ significantly north of Bombo.\n\nBased on these steps, since Bombo and Apac\
      \ share approximately the same longitude (east-west position) but differ significantly\
      \ in latitude (north-south position), the question of whether Bombo is west\
      \ of Apac can be answered by understanding that their east-west positions are\
      \ roughly the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Bombo, Uganda is located\
      \ west of Apac is: **NO**"

      \ District in the Central Region of Uganda.\n   - Apac is a town in Apac District\
      \ in the Northern Region of Uganda.\n\n2. **Understand Geography**: Next, understanding\
      \ the geography of Uganda is crucial. Uganda is divided into several regions,\
      \ and the country's geography can help determine the relative positions of towns\
      \ and cities.\n\n3. **Determine Cardinal Directions**: \n   - The Central Region,\

      \   - The Northern Region, where Apac is located, as the name suggests, is towards\
      \ the north of Uganda.\n\n4. **Relative Positions**: \n   - Considering the\
      \ general layout of Uganda, moving from the Central Region to the Northern Region\

      \   - Western Asia is generally southeast of Eastern Europe. \n   - Therefore,\
      \ considering the geographical layout, Beitunia (in Western Asia) would be southeast\
      \ or south of Zaporizhzhia Oblast (in Eastern Europe), not west.\n\nBased on\

      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: We need to determine the geographic positions
      of Harrisville and Walloon. Harrisville is situated in the Scenic Rim Region,

      2. **Determine geographic positions**: Next, we should determine their geographic
      positions. Without specific geographic coordinates, we rely on general knowledge
      about these places. Harrisville is known to be in the Scenic Rim Region of Queensland,

      to the south and slightly west of Brisbane but is east of Walloon when considering
      the direct line from Walloon to Harrisville. However, given the context and

      directions from one another.


      3. **Reference Points**: If specific geographic coordinates are not available,

    ff1f7c3d-bf15-440d-a71f-cfb44b3026d8: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Forbes is a town in New South Wales, Australia.
      Whitemark is a town on Flinders Island, which is part of Tasmania, Australia.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: "West of" means that the location
      in question (Forbes) would be to the left (or on the western side) when looking
      at a map of Australia with north at the top.


      3. **Consider the general geography of Australia**: New South Wales is a state
      on the mainland of Australia, located to the north of Tasmania. Tasmania, where
      Whitemark is situated, is an island state south of the mainland.


      4. **Specific locations**: Forbes, New South Wales, is inland within the state,
      far from the coastal areas near Tasmania. Whitemark, being on Flinders Island,
      Tasmania, is to the south of the Australian mainland.


      5. **Comparative locations**: Given that Tasmania (and thus Whitemark) is south
      of mainland Australia, and knowing that Forbes is on the mainland, we can deduce
      that Forbes is indeed west and significantly north of Whitemark, given the geography
      of Australia.


      6. **Conclusion**: Considering the above steps, Forbes, New South Wales, is
      indeed located west (and also north) of Whitemark, Tasmania.

      west of Bhaktapur District, let''s break down the steps to understand the geographical
      context and relationship between these locations.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Barajamda and Bhaktapur
      District are. Barajamda is not a widely recognized location in global geography
      without more specific context, but assuming it refers to a place within Nepal
      (as Bhaktapur District is in Nepal), we can proceed. Bhaktapur District is one
      of the 77 districts of Nepal, located in the Bagmati Province.


      2. **Understand Geographical Context**: Nepal is a country located in South
      Asia, bordered by China to the north and India to the south, east, and west.
      Bhaktapur District is situated near the capital city of Nepal, Kathmandu, within
      the Kathmandu Valley.


      3. **Location of Barajamda**: Without specific details on Barajamda, if we consider
      it could be anywhere in Nepal, we need to understand Nepal''s geography. Nepal
      stretches from east to west, with its easternmost part closer to India''s state
      of Bihar and its westernmost part closer to India''s state of Uttarakhand.


      4. **Determine Direction**: To say Barajamda is west of Bhaktapur District,
      we need to establish their relative positions. Bhaktapur District is in the
      central part of Nepal, near Kathmandu. If Barajamda is also in Nepal, for it
      to be west of Bhaktapur District, it would need to be located in a region that
      is towards the west of the Kathmandu Valley.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without the exact location
      of Barajamda, it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if
      we consider the general geography of Nepal and assume Barajamda could be a lesser-known
      location within the country, the answer would depend on its specific location

      2. **Geographical Context**: Understanding that Bhaktapur District is in Nepal,
      we can infer that Barajamda is also likely to be in Nepal or at least in the
      broader South Asian region, given the context of the question.


      3. **Directional Analysis**: The question asks if Barajamda is located west
      of Bhaktapur District. This requires knowing the geographical positions of both
      places relative to each other.


      4. **Research or Knowledge**: Without specific knowledge of Barajamda''s location,
      one would typically need to consult a map or a geographical database to determine
      its position relative to Bhaktapur District.

      5. **Relative Positions**: To say if Barajamda is west of Bhaktapur District,
      we must know their relative positions. If both are in Nepal, we can use Nepal''s
      geography to understand their positions. Bhaktapur District is near Kathmandu,
      which is relatively central in Nepal.


      6. **Nepal''s Geography**: Nepal stretches from east to west, with its width
      being less than its length. Knowing the specific locations within Nepal can
      help determine if one place is west of another.


      7. **Conclusion Based on Known Data**: Without exact coordinates or a detailed

      2. **Research Barajamda**: Given that Barajamda is not widely recognized, we
      need to establish its geographical location. After research, it appears that
      Barajamda could be related to or near the city of Jamshedpur in the state of
      Jharkhand, India, or it might be a reference to a specific area within or near
      Jamshedpur. However, without precise coordinates or a clear definition, this
      step involves some uncertainty.


      3. **Determine Direction**: Once we have an approximate location for Barajamda,
      we need to determine its direction relative to Bhaktapur District, Nepal. If
      Barajamda is indeed near Jamshedpur, India, we then compare its location to
      Bhaktapur District.


      4. **Geographical Comparison**: Bhaktapur District is located in the eastern

      the answer to whether Barajamda is located west of Bhaktapur District would
      be **NO**.'
    f6914b56-9478-466c-8951-168a5965ade9: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Barajamda and Bhaktapur
      District are. Barajamda is not a widely known location, so it might require
      specific knowledge or research. Bhaktapur District, however, is known to be
      in Nepal.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Understanding that Bhaktapur District is in Nepal,
      we need to establish the geographical context of Barajamda in relation to Nepal
      or specifically Bhaktapur District.


      3. **Research Barajamda**: Since Barajamda is not immediately recognizable,
      we need to find out more about it. After research, it appears that Barajamda
      could be related to places in India, given the context of similar names or the
      requirement for geographical comparison with a district in Nepal.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Once we have identified both locations, we compare
      their geographical positions. Bhaktapur District is in the eastern part of Nepal.
      If Barajamda is in India, we need to determine its general location in relation
      to Nepal.


      5. **West of Bhaktapur District**: Considering Nepal''s geographical position,
      places to the west of Bhaktapur District would generally be within Nepal itself
      or potentially in northern India, depending on the specific location within
      those countries.


      Given these steps and without specific details on Barajamda''s exact location,
      we must rely on general geographical knowledge and the assumption that Barajamda
      could be in a region of India that is west of Nepal.


      **Conclusion**: Without precise information on Barajamda''s location, it''s
      challenging to definitively answer. However, if we consider Barajamda to be
      in India and given that parts of India are indeed west of Nepal, we can make
      an educated guess based on typical geographical layouts.

      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine their geographic positions.

      3. **Consider Specific Locations**: Now, considering their specific locations
      within the UK, Meifod is in western Wales, and Anthorn is in northwest England.
      However, the question of whether Meifod is west of Anthorn depends on their

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Carrickalinga
      and Laura, South Australia. Carrickalinga is a small coastal town, while Laura
      is an inland town.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: Understanding the basic geographic
      directions (north, south, east, west) is crucial. West means the direction towards
      the setting sun, or in the context of a map, to the left when the top of the
      map points towards the north.


      3. **Research or Recall Location Details**: Without specific geographic knowledge
      or a map, one might not immediately know the exact locations. However, knowing
      that Carrickalinga is a coastal town suggests it''s near the ocean, which in
      South Australia, would generally be to the south or southwest of inland areas.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Laura, South Australia, is known to be in the Mid
      North region of the state, which places it somewhat inland and north of the
      coastal regions. Carrickalinga, being on the coast, is south of Adelaide, the
      capital city of South Australia.


      5. **Determine Direction**: Given that Carrickalinga is on the coast and Laura
      is further inland and to the north, the question of whether Carrickalinga is
      west of Laura depends on their exact positions relative to each other. Generally,
      coastal areas in South Australia trend southwest from the capital, Adelaide.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Geography**: Given the geography of South Australia,
      if Carrickalinga is southwest of Adelaide and Laura is north of Adelaide but
      inland, it suggests Carrickalinga could indeed be west or more accurately, southwest
      of Laura. However, the precise direction (west) depends on their relative positions.


      Given the steps and without precise coordinates or a detailed map, one would
      lean towards a general understanding of South Australian geography to make an
      educated guess. However, the direct question asks for a yes or no based on being

      Carrickalinga is a small town on the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia,
      known for its beach and tourist attractions. Laura, on the other hand, is a
      town located in the Mid North region of South Australia.


      Given the general knowledge of South Australian geography:

      - The Fleurieu Peninsula, where Carrickalinga is located, is south of Adelaide.

      - Laura is situated more towards the north, in the Mid North region, which places
      it north of the Fleurieu Peninsula.


      Considering the directional layout of South Australia:

      - North to south, Laura would be above (north of) Carrickalinga.

      - East to west, since Carrickalinga is on the Fleurieu Peninsula, which is not
      far from the coast and somewhat southeast of Laura, we need to establish if
      it''s west or east of Laura.


      Given that the Fleurieu Peninsula is generally southeast of the Adelaide region

      Victoria. Knowing that NSW is generally north and slightly east of Victoria,
      we must consider the specific locations. Darlington Point is situated in the
      western part of NSW, relatively close to the Victorian border but more to the
      north.


      4. **Comparison**: Since Walkerville is in Victoria, which is southeast of NSW,
      and considering Darlington Point''s location in western NSW, it''s logical to
      infer that Darlington Point would be more to the north and slightly west of
      Walkerville, given the general geography of southeastern Australia.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geography, Darlington Point, being in western NSW,
      is indeed more to the north but also west of Walkerville, Victoria, when considering
      the broader geographic context of the two states.

      Darlington Point and Walkerville, Victoria. Darlington Point is a small town
      in New South Wales, Australia, and Walkerville is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria,
      Australia.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, I determine their geographic positions
      relative to each other. Darlington Point is in New South Wales, which is generally
      to the north of Victoria. Walkerville, being in Victoria, is to the south of
      New South Wales.


      3. **Consider Direction**: Since the question asks if Darlington Point is located
      west of Walkerville, I need to consider their relative east-west positions.
      New South Wales, where Darlington Point is located, is to the east of South
      Australia but generally north of Victoria. Victoria, where Walkerville is, is
      in the southeastern part of Australia.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Considering the specific locations, Darlington Point
      in New South Wales is not directly west of Walkerville, Victoria. Given the
      geography of Australia, with New South Wales to the north and northeast of Victoria,
      Darlington Point would be more to the north or northeast of Walkerville rather
      than directly west.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic positions and considering the directions,
      Darlington Point is not located west of Walkerville, Victoria.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Sans
      Souci and Berowra Heights in New South Wales, Australia.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Sans Souci is a suburb in southern Sydney, located
      on the Georges River. Berowra Heights is a suburb in northern Sydney.


      3. **Directional Analysis**: To determine if Sans Souci is west of Berowra Heights,
      we need to consider their relative positions. Generally, southern Sydney is
      south of northern Sydney.


      4. **Cardinal Directions in Sydney**: In the context of Sydney, moving from
      the northern suburbs to the southern suburbs involves moving southwards. The
      question of being "west" involves a different cardinal direction.


      5. **Specific Locations**: Berowra Heights is located in the north of Sydney,
      near the Hawkesbury River and the Blue Mountains. Sans Souci, being in southern
      Sydney, would be south or possibly southwest of Berowra Heights but not directly
      west.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical layout of Sydney and the relative
      positions of Sans Souci and Berowra Heights, Sans Souci is not west of Berowra
      Heights. It is more accurately described as being to the south or southwest.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Bagha Upazila and Mahishadal. Bagha Upazila is located in Rajshahi District,
      Bangladesh. Mahishadal, on the other hand, is a community development block
      in the Purba Medinipur district of West Bengal, India.


      2. **Understand Geography**: Understanding the geography or the layout of these
      areas is crucial. Bangladesh is a country located to the east of India, and
      specifically, the Rajshahi Division where Bagha Upazila is situated, is in the
      western part of Bangladesh but still east of the Indian state of West Bengal
      where Mahishadal is located.


      3. **Determine Direction**: Since Bagha Upazila is in Bangladesh and Mahishadal
      is in the Indian state of West Bengal, and given that Bangladesh is generally
      east of West Bengal, we can infer that Bagha Upazila would be east of Mahishadal,

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, identify the locations of Llanddewi Brefi
      and Llangyfelach. Both are places in Wales, UK.


      2. **Llanddewi Brefi Location**: Llanddewi Brefi is a village in Ceredigion,
      Wales. It is known for being the location where Saint David, the patron saint
      of Wales, is said to have preached.


      3. **Llangyfelach Location**: Llangyfelach is a village and community in Swansea,

      the geography of Wales, is generally northwest of Swansea. However, since Llangyfelach
      is in Swansea, which is more to the south, and considering the layout of Wales,
      Llanddewi Brefi would indeed be more to the northwest, which includes a western
      component relative to a location in southern Wales like Llangyfelach.


      Therefore, considering the general geography of Wales and the relative positions
      of Ceredigion and Swansea, Llanddewi Brefi is indeed located west of Llangyfelach
      when considering their positions within Wales.


      **YES**'
    328d30b4-83c6-4397-b096-115a71ed9714: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Llanddewi
      Brefi and Llangyfelach. Both are places in Wales, UK.


      2. **Llanddewi Brefi Location**: Llanddewi Brefi is a village in Ceredigion,
      Wales. It''s known for being the site where Saint David, the patron saint of
      Wales, is said to have preached to a large crowd, resulting in a miracle that
      allowed everyone to see and hear him.


      3. **Llangyfelach Location**: Llangyfelach is a village and community in Swansea,
      Wales. It is situated a few miles north of Swansea city center.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Llanddewi Brefi is west of Llangyfelach,
      we need to understand the geography of Wales. Ceredigion, where Llanddewi Brefi
      is located, is generally to the north of Swansea, where Llangyfelach is situated.
      However, considering the west/east axis, Swansea (and thus Llangyfelach) is
      to the south of Ceredigion but also more to the west when comparing the two
      regions'' general positions in Wales.


      5. **Determine Direction**: Given the geography of Wales, Ceredigion (where
      Llanddewi Brefi is located) is actually more to the west than the area around
      Swansea (where Llangyfelach is located) when considering their positions on
      a map of Wales. However, the specific locations and their relative positions
      must be considered accurately. Given that both locations are in western Wales
      but Llangyfelach is in the southwest part of Wales and Llanddewi Brefi is more
      northwest, Llanddewi Brefi can be considered north and slightly west or directly
      north of Llangyfelach, depending on the exact coordinates.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions, considering the general
      layout of Wales and the specific locations of Llanddewi Brefi and Llangyfelach,
      Llanddewi Brefi is generally north and possibly slightly west of Llangyfelach
      but not directly west in a straightforward manner. However, when considering
      the question''s framing about being "west of," the answer could depend on how
      one interprets the geographical relationship. For simplicity and based on the
      general understanding that Llanddewi Brefi is more to the northwest of Llangyfelach,
      the direct answer to whether it is west might be affirmative in a broad geographical
      sense but requires acknowledging the nuance of their relative positions.


      The final answer is: YES'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Stevens Point is a city in Wisconsin, and Peoria
      Heights is a village in Illinois.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: West means the direction in which
      the sun sets, which is the opposite of east.


      3. **Determine the general geographical positions of Wisconsin and Illinois**:
      Wisconsin is generally located northwest of Illinois.


      4. **Consider the specific locations of Stevens Point and Peoria Heights**:
      Stevens Point is in central Wisconsin, and Peoria Heights is in central Illinois.


      5. **Compare their longitudinal positions**: Without exact longitudes, we can
      reason that if Stevens Point is more to the west than Peoria Heights based on
      their states'' general positions and considering that both are in the central
      parts of their respective states.

      positions step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Stevens Point is a city in Wisconsin, and Peoria
      Heights is a village in Illinois.


      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Wisconsin is generally located northwest
      of Illinois in the United States.


      3. **Specific locations**: Stevens Point, Wisconsin, is in the central part
      of Wisconsin. Peoria Heights, Illinois, is in the central part of Illinois.


      4. **Comparing longitudes**: To determine if one location is west of another,
      we compare their longitudes. The more west a location is, the higher its longitude
      (in terms of negative values for locations west of the Prime Meridian in the
      Western Hemisphere).


      5. **Stevens Point, Wisconsin''s longitude**: Approximately -89.6 degrees West.


      6. **Peoria Heights, Illinois''s longitude**: Approximately -89.6 degrees West
      as well, given Peoria''s longitude.


      7. **Latitude consideration**: Since both locations have roughly the same longitude,
      we consider their latitudes. Stevens Point, Wisconsin, is at a higher latitude
      (approximately 44.5 degrees North) than Peoria Heights, Illinois (approximately
      40.7 degrees North), indicating Stevens Point is north of Peoria Heights but
      does not directly inform us about east-west positioning.


      8. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations have approximately the same longitude,
      Stevens Point, Wisconsin, cannot be definitively described as west of Peoria
      Heights, Illinois, based solely on longitude. However, considering typical geographical
      understanding, locations with the same longitude are not "west" or "east" of

      located west of Pugwash, Nova Scotia, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Bedford and Pugwash are both in Nova Scotia,
      Canada.

      2. **Understand the geography of Nova Scotia**: Nova Scotia is a province located
      in eastern Canada, part of the Maritime provinces. It has a distinct geography
      with various regions, including the Annapolis Valley, Cape Breton, and the Halifax
      area where Bedford is located.

      3. **Determine the general location of Bedford**: Bedford is a suburban community
      of Halifax, the largest city in Nova Scotia. It is located on the northwestern
      end of Bedford Basin, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean, near Halifax.

      4. **Determine the general location of Pugwash**: Pugwash is a village located
      in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. It is known for the Thinkers'' Lodge, a National
      Historic Site of Canada, and is situated on the Northumberland Strait, which
      separates Nova Scotia from Prince Edward Island.

      5. **Compare the locations**: To determine if Bedford is west of Pugwash, consider
      that Bedford is near Halifax, which is in the southern part of the province.
      Pugwash, being in Cumberland County, is more to the north and east of Halifax,
      considering the overall geography of Nova Scotia.

      6. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given that Bedford is near Halifax in
      the southern part of the province and Pugwash is more to the north and on the
      eastern side of the province along the Northumberland Strait, Bedford would
      not be west of Pugwash but rather more south or southwest in relation to Pugwash.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis, the answer is: **NO**'
    bcfa1359-e579-47a7-9f2e-52e5ec2a6b2c: 'To answer this question, we need to determine

      1. **Identify the locations**: Bedford is a suburban community of Halifax, located
      on the northwestern end of Bedford Basin, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean, in
      Nova Scotia, Canada. Pugwash, on the other hand, is a village located in Cumberland
      County, Nova Scotia, known for its harbor and as the site of the Thinkers''
      Lodge, where international thinkers have met to discuss global issues.


      2. **Determine the geographical relation**: Bedford is part of the Halifax Regional
      Municipality, which is in the central part of the province, closer to the Atlantic
      coast. Pugwash is also located on the Atlantic coast but is situated more to
      the north and east of Bedford, in a different county.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Since Bedford is in the Halifax area, which
      is more southwest compared to the rest of the province, and Pugwash is northeast
      of Halifax, we need to determine if Bedford is west of Pugwash.


      Considering the general geography of Nova Scotia:

      - Bedford is near Halifax, which is in the southwestern part of the province.

      - Pugwash is in the northern part of the province, which makes it east and somewhat
      north of Halifax.


      Given these positions:

      - Bedford is generally southwest of Pugwash, making it west but also somewhat
      south of Pugwash.


      Therefore, based on geographical locations, Bedford, Nova Scotia is indeed **west**
      of Pugwash, Nova Scotia, but also importantly, it is south. However, the question
      only asks about the west/east relationship.

    7604c7a2-1ee8-49a3-932c-8c3d638b957a: 'To solve this, let''s break down the steps
      needed to determine if Barwala, Hisar is located west of Nalwa:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Barwala,
      Hisar, and Nalwa. Barwala is a city in the Hisar district of Haryana, India.
      Nalwa is also a place in Haryana, India.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we determine their geographical positions
      relative to each other. Hisar district, where Barwala is located, is in the
      western part of Haryana. Nalwa, being part of the same state, needs to be pinpointed
      in relation to Hisar district.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Without the exact coordinates, we rely on the general
      geography of Haryana. Hisar district is known to be in the western part of the
      state. Nalwa is often associated with the Hisar district itself or nearby areas,
      suggesting that both places could be relatively close or within the same broader
      geographical area.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both Barwala and Nalwa are within the Hisar district
      or very close to it, and considering the geography of Haryana, we can make an
      educated guess about their relative positions. However, without exact or specific
      locations, it''s a bit challenging. But if we consider the possibility that
      Nalwa could be a smaller location within or near Hisar district, Barwala, being
      in Hisar, might not necessarily be directly west or east without precise coordinates.


      However, considering the general layout and assuming Nalwa is not significantly
      to the west of Hisar''s main areas, and acknowledging the lack of precise information
      about Nalwa''s exact location relative to Barwala:

      west of Bhivpuri, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Sahiwal
      District and Bhivpuri. Sahiwal District is located in Pakistan, specifically
      in the Punjab province. Bhivpuri, on the other hand, is a town in the state
      of Maharashtra, India.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine their geographic positions.
      Sahiwal District, being in Pakistan, is generally west of India due to the countries''
      border locations. Bhivpuri, being in the state of Maharashtra, which is on the
      western side of India, still places it east of Pakistan.


      3. **Compare Specific Locations**: Considering the specific locations within
      their respective countries, Sahiwal District in Pakistan is west of the Indian
      border. Bhivpuri, in Maharashtra, India, while on the western side of India,
      is still to the east of Pakistan''s eastern border.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Sahiwal District is in Pakistan and Bhivpuri is
      in India, and considering the general geography of the region where Pakistan
      is west of India, it follows that Sahiwal District would indeed be west of Bhivpuri.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      is in India, specifically in the state of Maharashtra.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand their geographical
      positions relative to each other. Sahiwal District in Pakistan is generally
      west of India.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Bhivpuri is located in the Raigad district of Maharashtra,

      India.


      4. **Comparison**: Since Sahiwal District is in Pakistan and Pakistan is west
      of India, and Bhivpuri is on the western side of India, we need to determine
      if Sahiwal District is west of Bhivpuri.


      5. **Geographical Context**: Pakistan shares its eastern border with India.
      Given that Sahiwal District is in Pakistan, which is to the west of the entire
      Indian subcontinent, it implies that Sahiwal District is indeed west of Bhivpuri,
      considering Bhivpuri''s location within India.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Sahiwal District
      and Bhivpuri are located. Sahiwal District is in Pakistan, and Bhivpuri is a
      town in India, specifically in the state of Maharashtra.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we consider their geographical positions
      relative to each other. Pakistan is generally west and northwest of India. However,
      the specific locations of Sahiwal District and Bhivpuri need to be considered
      for an accurate assessment.


      3. **Sahiwal District''s Location**: Sahiwal District is located in the Punjab
      province of Pakistan. Punjab, Pakistan, shares a border with the Indian states
      of Punjab and Rajasthan to the east.


      4. **Bhivpuri''s Location**: Bhivpuri is located in the state of Maharashtra,
      India. Maharashtra is situated to the southeast of Pakistan, with the Arabian
      Sea to its west.


      5. **Relative Positions**: Given that Sahiwal District is in the Punjab province
      of Pakistan and Bhivpuri is in Maharashtra, India, we need to determine their
      relative east-west positions. Pakistan, including Sahiwal District, is generally
      northwest of India. However, when comparing specific locations, we must account
      for the geography of the region. Sahiwal District is north of Bhivpuri, considering
      Pakistan''s northwestern position relative to India. The question, however,
      is about being west of Bhivpuri.


      6. **Conclusion**: Since Pakistan is northwest of India, and considering the
      geographical layout, parts of Pakistan (including areas like Sahiwal District)
      can indeed be west or northwest of certain parts of India, depending on the
      specific locations being compared. Bhivpuri, being in Maharashtra, is relatively
      to the southeast of Sahiwal District. Therefore, Sahiwal District, being in

      directly west. However, considering "west" in a broad sense, parts of Pennsylvania
      could indeed be west of parts of Virginia, depending on the specific locations
      within each state. Given the specific locations of Confluence, PA, and Big Island,
      VA, Confluence is not directly west but is more northwest. For the purpose of
      this question, which seems to seek a simple directional relationship without
      considering latitude, we''ll interpret "west" in a general directional sense.


      Given these steps and understanding that the question is about a general westward
      direction without strict geographical precision, the answer is: YES'

      1. **Confluence, Pennsylvania**: This is a borough in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.
      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern part of the United States.


      2. **Big Island, Virginia**: This is a census-designated place in Bedford County,
      Virginia. Virginia is located to the south of Pennsylvania but is still considered
      part of the Eastern United States.


      Given these locations:

      - Pennsylvania is generally northeast of Virginia.

      - Confluence, being in Pennsylvania, would be northeast of Big Island, Virginia,
      because Pennsylvania is northeast of Virginia.


      Now, considering the question of whether Confluence, Pennsylvania is located
      west of Big Island, Virginia:

      - Since Confluence, Pennsylvania is northeast of Big Island, Virginia, it cannot
      be west of it. West would imply that Confluence is to the left (or in a more
      westerly direction) of Big Island on a map, which contradicts the actual northeast
      positioning.


      Therefore, considering the geographical positions:

      of Thingangyun Township, we need to understand the geographical locations of
      both places.


      1. **Identify Pyinmana''s Location**: Pyinmana is a town in the Mandalay Region
      of Myanmar (Burma). It is known for being the location of the new capital city
      of Myanmar, Naypyidaw, which was officially inaugurated in 2006.


      2. **Identify Thingangyun Township''s Location**: Thingangyun Township is a
      township in Yangon Region, Myanmar. Yangon (formerly Rangoon) is the largest
      city in Myanmar and is located in the southern part of the country.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: To determine if Pyinmana is west of Thingangyun
      Township, we must understand the general geography of Myanmar. Yangon, where
      Thingangyun Township is located, is situated in the southern part of Myanmar,
      near the coast of the Bay of Bengal. Pyinmana, being in the Mandalay Region,
      is more centrally located within Myanmar but is north of Yangon.


      4. **Consider Cardinal Directions**: Given that Pyinmana is in the central part
      of Myanmar but more to the north relative to Yangon, and considering the geography
      of Myanmar, we can infer the relative positions. The question asks if Pyinmana
      is west of Thingangyun Township. Since Thingangyun is near Yangon in the south
      and Pyinmana is more central-north, the primary consideration is the east-west
      relationship rather than the north-south.


      Given these considerations, Pyinmana is generally north of Yangon (and thus
      Thingangyun Township), but the question is about the east-west axis. Yangon
      is relatively east or southeast compared to much of the rest of Myanmar due
      to its coastal location on the Bay of Bengal. Therefore, a location that is
      more central or even north-central in Myanmar could indeed be west of Yangon,
      depending on the specific locations.


      **Conclusion**: Given that Pyinmana is more central-north in Myanmar and Thingangyun
      Township is in the Yangon area, which is more southeast, Pyinmana can indeed
      be considered west of Thingangyun Township when looking at the broader geographical
      context of Myanmar.

      relative positions. The central part of Myanmar (where Pyinmana is) is generally
      north of the southern regions (like Yangon, where Thingangyun Township is).


      4. **East-West Orientation**: Considering the east-west orientation, Yangon
      (and thus Thingangyun Township) is located near the western coast of Myanmar,

      central part of the country, is not directly west or east of Yangon in a straightforward
      manner but is positioned more northward.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout of Myanmar, Pyinmana (central
      Myanmar) is not directly west of Thingangyun Township (southern Myanmar). Instead,
      Pyinmana is more northward in relation to Thingangyun Township. Therefore, considering

      Myanmar (Burma). Thingangyun Township, on the other hand, is a township located
      in Yangon, Myanmar.


      2. **Understand Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the geographical
      layout of Myanmar. Yangon, where Thingangyun Township is located, is in the
      southern part of the country, near the coast. Naypyidaw, where Pyinmana is situated,
      is more centrally located in Myanmar.


      3. **Determine Direction**: Given the central location of Pyinmana (Naypyidaw)
      and the southern coastal location of Thingangyun Township (Yangon), we need
      to determine if Pyinmana is west of Thingangyun Township. Since Yangon is generally
      south of Naypyidaw, and considering Myanmar''s geography, Pyinmana would be
      more northward and possibly slightly east of Yangon, rather than strictly west.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions and the direction from

      of Thingangyun Township, we need to understand the geographical locations of
      both places.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we identify the locations. Pyinmana is a town
      in the Mandalay Region of Myanmar (Burma). Thingangyun Township is located in
      Yangon (Rangoon), which is the largest city in Myanmar and a significant economic
      hub, situated in the southern part of the country.


      2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we consider the geographic relationship
      between the Mandalay Region (where Pyinmana is located) and Yangon (where Thingangyun
      Township is located). Mandalay is generally located in the north-central part
      of Myanmar, while Yangon is in the south, near the coast.


      3. **Consider Cardinal Directions**: Knowing the general locations, we consider
      the cardinal directions. "West" implies that Pyinmana would need to be situated
      to the west of Thingangyun Township. Given that Yangon (and thus Thingangyun
      Township) is south and near the coast, and Mandalay (and thus Pyinmana) is more
      north and central, Pyinmana is not directly west of Thingangyun Township but
      rather more northward and possibly slightly west, depending on the exact longitude
      and latitude of each location.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Geography**: Considering Myanmar''s geography, Pyinmana,
      being in the Mandalay Region, is generally north of Yangon. While it might be
      slightly west due to the country''s shape and the relative positions of these
      cities, the primary directional difference is north-south rather than east-west.


      Given the above steps and understanding that "west of" implies a specific directional
      relationship that might not perfectly align with the general north-south distinction
      between Mandalay and Yangon, the question seems to ask for a precise directional
      relationship that doesn''t account for the complexity of their geographical
      positions.

      3. **Determine Direction**: To determine if one location is west of another,
      we must consider their relative positions. Given that Vincentown is in Burlington
      County and Branchville is in Sussex County, we need to understand the layout
      of these counties within New Jersey.


      4. **Burlington vs. Sussex County Locations**: Burlington County, where Vincentown
      is located, is situated more to the southeast of New Jersey, closer to the coastal
      areas. Sussex County, where Branchville is located, is in the northwestern part
      of the state, closer to the New York state border and the mountainous regions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the above steps, since Sussex County (where Branchville
      is) is generally northwest of Burlington County (where Vincentown is), this
      implies that Branchville is more to the northwest (and thus more westward in
      the context of New Jersey''s geography) than Vincentown.


      Therefore, considering the relative positions of Vincentown and Branchville
      within New Jersey, the answer is: **NO**.'

      4. **Consider the general geography of these counties**: Burlington County is
      generally located in the central part of New Jersey, while Sussex County is
      in the northwestern part of the state.

      5. **Compare the locations**: Given that Vincentown is in Burlington County
      and Branchville is in Sussex County, and knowing the relative positions of these

      4. **County Locations**: Burlington County, where Vincentown is located, is
      in the central part of New Jersey, closer to the eastern side of the state but
      more centrally aligned. Sussex County, where Branchville is located, is in the
      northwestern part of New Jersey, bordering both Pennsylvania to the west and
      New York to the north.


      5. **Comparative Locations**: Given the locations of Vincentown in Burlington

      60 kilometers southeast of Melbourne''s central business district.


      2. **Identify Wandong**: Wandong is a town in Victoria, Australia. It is located
      in the Shire of Mitchell, which is to the north of Melbourne.


      3. **Determine the relative locations**: Since Mount Martha is on the Mornington
      Peninsula, southeast of Melbourne, and Wandong is to the north of Melbourne,
      we need to consider their positions relative to each other.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Considering Melbourne as a reference point, Mount
      Martha is southeast, and Wandong is north. This means Wandong is generally west
      and slightly north of Mount Martha, but more importantly, it is west in relation
      to Mount Martha''s position southeast of Melbourne.


      Given the above steps, the answer to whether Mount Martha, Victoria is located
      west of Wandong is:


      NO'

      \n1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Coligny,\
      \ North West, and Stepan. Coligny is a town in the North West province of South\
      \ Africa. Stepan, without more context, could refer to several places, but a\
      \ notable one is Stepan, a village in Ukraine, or it might refer to Stepanakert,\
      \ the capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Without a specific Stepan, it's\
      \ challenging, but for the sake of argument, let's consider Stepan as Stepanakert\
      \ or a similar location in Eastern Europe/Caucasus.\n\n2. **Determine Geographic\
      \ Coordinates**: To understand their relative positions, we should know their\
      \ geographic coordinates. Coligny, North West, South Africa, is approximately\
      \ at 26.3333\xB0 S, 25.4667\xB0 E. Stepanakert (as a potential Stepan) is at\
      \ 39.8153\xB0 N, 46.7522\xB0 E.\n\n3. **Compare Longitudes**: To determine if\
      \ one location is west of another, we compare their longitudes. The location\
      \ with the lower longitude (more westward) is west of the location with the\
      \ higher longitude. Coligny's longitude is 25.4667\xB0 E, and Stepanakert's\
      \ is 46.7522\xB0 E.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since Coligny's longitude (25.4667\xB0\
      \ E) is less than Stepanakert's (46.7522\xB0 E), Coligny is indeed west of Stepanakert.\n\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations mentioned
      - Coligny, North West, and Stepan. Coligny is a town in the North West province
      of South Africa. Stepan, however, is not a widely recognized geographical location
      without more context. It''s possible that "Stepan" could refer to a less common
      place name or a misspelling/error in the question. Without clear identification
      of Stepan, it''s challenging to proceed with geographical comparisons directly.


      2. **Assume Stepan''s Location**: Since the exact location of Stepan is not
      provided, we must consider if there''s any Stepan that could be relevant. If
      Stepan refers to a specific, identifiable location (which is not provided in
      the question), we would need its geographical coordinates or a description to
      understand its position relative to Coligny, North West.


      3. **Geographical Comparison**: Assuming Stepan could be identified and is a
      real location, to determine if Coligny, North West is located west of it, we
      would compare their longitudes. Places further west have higher longitudes when
      considering locations in the same hemisphere.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Without the specific location of
      Stepan or more details about it, we cannot accurately determine its geographical
      position relative to Coligny, North West. Therefore, based on the information
      given, we cannot definitively say yes or no to whether Coligny, North West is
      located west of Stepan.


      However, given the constraints of the question requiring a YES or NO answer
      and the lack of specific information about Stepan''s location, the most appropriate
      response based on the steps taken would have to be a guess or an acknowledgment
      that the question cannot be accurately answered with the provided information.

      nia is located, is generally east of Rio Grande do Sul, where Cambar\xE1 do\
      \ Sul is located, due to Brazil's overall east-west orientation along the coastline\
      \ and the positioning of these states within the country.\n\nBased on this step-by-step\
      \ analysis, we can conclude that Cambar\xE1 do Sul, being in the southern state\
      \ of Rio Grande do Sul, would typically be southwest or south (in a broad sense)\
      \ of Maced\xF4nia in S\xE3o Paulo, but not directly west, as Brazil's geography\
      \ and the states' positions relative to each other do not align in a straightforward\

      the locations of Slab City and Lomira, Wisconsin, and then compare their positions.


      1. **Identify Locations**: The first step is to identify where Slab City and
      Lomira, Wisconsin, are located. Lomira is a village in Dodge County, Wisconsin.
      However, Slab City, Wisconsin, is not a well-documented location in the traditional
      sense, as "Slab City" is more commonly known as a community in California, not
      Wisconsin. It''s possible that "Slab City" in Wisconsin could refer to a different
      kind of location or a misunderstanding since Slab City is famously known in
      California as a snowbird community.


      2. **Clarify Slab City, Wisconsin**: Given the confusion, let''s consider that
      if there''s a "Slab City" in Wisconsin, it might not be as widely recognized
      or could be a mistake. The well-known Slab City is in Imperial County, California,
      and is not related to Wisconsin.


      3. **Assume Hypothetical Location**: If we were to hypothetically assume there
      is a Slab City in Wisconsin (which is not a recognized location), determining
      its exact position would be necessary to compare it to Lomira. Without specific

      4. **Compare Locations**: Normally, to determine if one location is west of
      another, we would compare their longitudes (with west being a lower longitude).
      However, without a confirmed location for Slab City in Wisconsin, this comparison
      cannot be accurately made.

      a potential issue with the premise of the question as it pertains to Wisconsin.
      Lomira, however, is indeed a village in Wisconsin.


      2. **Consider the geography of Wisconsin**: Since Slab City is not in Wisconsin

      would still need to understand that the question might be based on incorrect

      3. **Evaluate the question''s premise**: Given that Slab City is actually in
      California, the question about its location relative to Lomira, Wisconsin, seems
      to be based on a false premise. However, to answer the question as it''s posed,

      to verify the existence and location of Slab City, Wisconsin.


      2. **Verify Slab City''s existence and location**: After researching, it appears
      there might be confusion. Slab City is actually known to be in California, not

      a Slab City in Wisconsin, it''s not widely recognized or documented in available
      sources.


      3. **Determine the relevance of Slab City, California, to the question**: Since
      the question specifically asks about Slab City, Wisconsin, and given that the
      well-known Slab City is in California, we must assume the question pertains
      to a possible location within Wisconsin. Without a confirmed location of a "Slab
      City" in Wisconsin, it''s challenging to proceed with geographical comparisons.


      4. **Consider geographical context**: Generally, to determine if one location

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Ghorahi
      and Bhadohi district. Ghorahi is a municipality in Dang District of Nepal, and
      Bhadohi district is in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine the geographic positions
      of these locations. Nepal is generally east of India, but since we are comparing
      specific locations within these countries, we need more precise information.
      Ghorahi, being in Nepal, would generally be northeast of most parts of Uttar
      Pradesh, India, considering Nepal''s geographic position relative to India.


      3. **Specific Locations Comparison**: Now, comparing the specific locations,
      Bhadohi district is in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh. Ghorahi, being in
      western Nepal, is more westward than Bhadohi district, considering the general
      geography of the region. Nepal''s western parts are closer to the Indian state
      of Uttar Pradesh than its eastern parts.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Ghorahi is in western Nepal and Bhadohi district

      1. **Identify the locations**: Ghorahi and Bhadohi district are the two places
      we need to consider. Ghorahi is a city in Nepal, and Bhadohi district is in
      the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.


      2. **Consider geographical context**: Nepal is located north of India. Given
      that Ghorahi is in Nepal and Bhadohi district is in India, we''re comparing
      locations across an international border.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Nepal is north of India, any
      location in Nepal is generally north of locations in the northern parts of India,
      including Uttar Pradesh.


      4. **Specific locations**: Without exact coordinates, we consider the general
      geography. Bhadohi district in Uttar Pradesh, India, is relatively eastward
      compared to many parts of Nepal due to India''s shape and Nepal''s position
      north of it.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given Nepal''s position north of India and considering the
      general east-west orientation of these countries, a location in Nepal (Ghorahi)
      could indeed be west of a location in eastern Uttar Pradesh, India (Bhadohi
      district), depending on their exact longitudes.


      However, without precise geographical coordinates or a detailed map, we can
      still make an educated guess. Bhadohi district is in the eastern part of Uttar
      Pradesh. Nepal stretches quite far eastward as well. But considering the general
      layout, it''s plausible for Ghorahi to be west of Bhadohi district due to Nepal''s
      geographical span and its position relative to eastern India.


      Given these steps, the answer would lean towards YES, considering Nepal''s geography
      and its position north of India, making it possible for Ghorahi to be west of

      Bhadohi district is in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.


      2. **Understand Geography**: Nepal is a country located in South Asia, bordering
      India to the south, among other countries. Uttar Pradesh is a state in northern
      India.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Considering the geography, Nepal is north of India.
      Therefore, any location in Nepal, including Ghorahi, would generally be north
      of locations in India, including Bhadohi district in Uttar Pradesh.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: The question asks about the east-west orientation,
      not the north-south. Given that Nepal and parts of northern India share a border,
      the east-west position can vary depending on the specific locations within these
      countries. However, in general, Nepal stretches east-west along the Himalayas,
      and locations within Nepal can be either east or west of locations in northern
      India, depending on their longitudinal position.


      5. **Specific Location Comparison**: To give a precise answer, we would ideally
      need the exact longitudinal positions of Ghorahi and Bhadohi district. However,
      without specific longitudinal data or detailed maps, we can still make an educated
      guess based on the general geography of the region.


      Given these steps and without exact coordinates, the question becomes challenging
      to answer with absolute certainty without more specific geographical data. However,
      considering the general geography and assuming a general knowledge of the region:


      - Ghorahi, Nepal, is generally north of Bhadohi district, Uttar Pradesh, India,
      due to Nepal''s position north of India.

      - Without exact longitudinal coordinates, determining if Ghorahi is specifically
      west of Bhadohi district requires more detailed geographical information.


      Given the general nature of the question and the need for more specific geographical
      data to accurately determine the east-west relationship between two points in
      different countries, I must rely on general knowledge and the understanding

      \ island located off the coast of County Kerry, in Ireland.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ Geographic Positions**:\n   - Liberia, where Montserrado County is located,\
      \ is in West Africa, which places it in the western part of the African continent\
      \ but east of the Atlantic Ocean.\n   - Little Skellig, being off the coast\
      \ of Ireland, is in Northwest Europe, west of the British Isles and directly\
      \ west of the European mainland.\n\n3. **Compare Positions**:\n   - Since Liberia\
      \ (and thus Montserrado County) is generally east of the Atlantic Ocean and\
      \ Little Skellig is west of the European mainland and directly west of the British\
      \ Isles, we need to consider their longitudinal positions relative to each other.\n\

      east-west positioning, given they are both in the southeastern region of Queensland.


      4. **Specific Location Comparison**: To accurately compare, consider that Amity
      Point on North Stradbroke Island is more to the east of the Queensland mainland
      because it is an island located off the eastern coast of Queensland. The Gold
      Coast, where Elanora is situated, although also in southeastern Queensland,
      would be westward of the island locations off the coast.


      Based on this reasoning, Elanora, being part of the Gold Coast and thus on the
      mainland, would indeed be west of Amity Point, which is on an island off the
      eastern coast of Queensland.

      3. **Determining West of Melbourne Beach**: To be west of Melbourne Beach, a
      location would need to be inland or towards the western part of Florida from
      Melbourne Beach''s position on the coast.


      4. **Possible Locations of Rodas**: Without specific information on Rodas, we

    c7bc44eb-9a6f-4c70-b849-49b9bd0221ad: 'To determine if Rodas is located west of
      Melbourne Beach, Florida, let''s break down the steps needed to find the answer:


      1. **Identify Rodas**: First, we need to identify what "Rodas" refers to. There
      could be multiple places with this name, so without more context, it''s challenging.
      However, a well-known location with a similar name is Rhodes (which in Spanish
      is "Rodas"), an island in Greece. But considering the context of Melbourne Beach,
      Florida, it''s possible "Rodas" could refer to something else, like a local
      business, a small town, or an incorrect spelling of "Rhodes," which doesn''t
      fit the geographical context of Florida.


      2. **Location of Melbourne Beach, Florida**: Melbourne Beach is a town in Brevard
      County, Florida, USA. It''s located on the eastern coast of Florida, directly
      on the Atlantic Ocean.


      3. **Comparative Location**: To be west of Melbourne Beach, Florida, Rodas would
      need to be inland from the Atlantic coast where Melbourne Beach is situated.
      Given that the most direct association with "Rodas" might be with the Greek
      island of Rhodes, which is in the Mediterranean and thus not relevant to the
      geography of Florida, there seems to be confusion in the question''s premise.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Likely Assumptions**: If we assume "Rodas" refers to
      a place within the context of Florida or North America, without a specific known
      location named Rodas that is widely recognized, it''s challenging to give a
      definitive geographical answer. However, considering the possibility of a typographical
      error or confusion with "Rhodes," which would still not apply directly to the
      Florida geography, we must rely on the assumption that Rodas, as intended by
      the question, is not a commonly recognized location in relation to Melbourne
      Beach, Florida.


      Given these steps and the lack of clear identification of "Rodas" in relation
      to known geographical locations near Melbourne Beach, Florida, the question
      seems to be based on an unclear premise. However, if we were to consider a hypothetical
      or any location actually named Rodas in Florida (of which there isn''t a widely
      recognized one), being west of Melbourne Beach would imply it''s inland from
      the coast where Melbourne Beach is located.


      Without a clear identification of "Rodas" and considering the need for a YES/NO
      answer, the safest assumption based on the information given and typical geographical
      knowledge would lean towards not having enough information to confirm "Rodas"
      as a location relative to Melbourne Beach, Florida. However, since the question
      demands a YES/NO answer and without specific details on Rodas, we must consider
      the context provided:


      **Answer: NO** (Based on the assumption that without clear identification of
      "Rodas" as a known location relative to Melbourne Beach, Florida, and considering
      typical geographical confusion, the question''s premise may be flawed.)'

      the steps:


      1. **Identify Rodas**: First, we need to know what or where Rodas is. Rodas
      could refer to a variety of places or things, but without context, the most
      straightforward assumption is that it''s a geographic location. However, without
      more specific information, this step is speculative.


      2. **Location of Melbourne Beach, Florida**: Melbourne Beach is a town in Brevard
      County, Florida, USA. It is located on the eastern coast of Florida, directly
      on the Atlantic Ocean.


      3. **Determine West of Melbourne Beach**: To be west of Melbourne Beach, a location
      would need to be inland or towards the western part of Florida, considering
      Melbourne Beach''s eastern coastal position.


      4. **Research on Rodas**: Assuming Rodas is a geographic location and without
      specific details, it''s challenging to pinpoint its exact location. Rodas could
      potentially refer to a place in the United States, the Caribbean, or even other
      parts of the world.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Assumptions**: Without the exact location of Rodas,
      it''s impossible to definitively say whether it is west of Melbourne Beach,
      Florida. However, for the sake of providing a YES or NO answer based on the
      information given (which is essentially none about Rodas'' location), we must
      make an assumption or acknowledge that the question cannot be accurately answered
      without further details.


      Given the lack of information about Rodas and considering the need for a definitive
      YES or NO answer, the most accurate response based on the provided steps and
      the requirement for a clear answer would be to acknowledge that we cannot determine
      the location of Rodas relative to Melbourne Beach, Florida, without more information.
      However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer:


      NO'
    dcbe9cf9-6b17-4033-b715-ed50ab834948: 'To answer whether Rodas is located west
      of Melbourne Beach, Florida, we need to follow a series of steps:


      1. **Identify Rodas**: First, we need to understand what or where Rodas is.
      Without specific context, it''s challenging to determine if Rodas refers to
      a city, island, or another geographical feature. However, assuming Rodas could
      refer to a place, we''ll proceed under the assumption that it might be related
      to "Rhodes," which is a well-known Greek island in the Aegean Sea.


      2. **Location of Melbourne Beach, Florida**: Melbourne Beach is a town in Brevard
      County, Florida, USA. It is located on the Atlantic coast of Florida, which
      means it is on the eastern side of the state.


      3. **Geographical Considerations**: If we consider Rhodes (potentially what
      "Rodas" refers to) as the point of reference, it is an island in the Aegean
      Sea, which is part of Greece. Greece is located in southeastern Europe, across
      the Mediterranean Sea from Africa and Asia, and to the east of the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      4. **West of Melbourne Beach, Florida**: To be west of Melbourne Beach, Florida,
      a location would need to be on the western side of it within the context of
      the United States or globally. Given Melbourne Beach''s eastern coastal location,
      places to its west would include parts of Florida, the United States, and potentially
      parts of the Americas or the Atlantic Ocean.


      5. **Comparative Geography**: Given the geographical locations, Rhodes (or a
      similarly named location, assuming Rodas refers to such a place) is in the eastern
      part of the Mediterranean, far to the east of Florida. Thus, it cannot be west
      of Melbourne Beach, Florida, as it is actually east of it when considering global
      geography.


      Based on these steps, the answer is: **NO**'

      Without specific information, it''s a bit challenging, but we can infer that
      Rodas could refer to a place, possibly an island, given the context of comparison

      2. **Location of Melbourne Beach, Florida**: Melbourne Beach is located on the
      east coast of Florida, USA. Knowing its exact position is crucial for comparison.


      3. **Determine the Location of Rodas**: Assuming Rodas refers to Rhodes, a Greek
      island in the southeastern Aegean Sea, we can proceed with the comparison. Rhodes
      is east of Florida if we consider the globe, as it is located near the southeastern
      coast of Greece.


      4. **Comparison**: Melbourne Beach, Florida, is on the eastern coast of the
      United States. Given that Rhodes (Rodas in some languages) is in the eastern
      part of the Mediterranean, it is actually east of Melbourne Beach, Florida,
      when considering a global map.

      Shulan, China**: Seoul, South Korea, is generally southeast of Shulan, China,
      considering the broader geographical layout of East Asia. South Korea is located
      on the Korean Peninsula, which is southeast of the Chinese mainland where Shulan
      is situated.


      4. **Specific Orientation**: Given that Seoul (and thus Yongsan District within
      it) is southeast of Shulan, we need to consider the cardinal directions. "West"
      refers to the direction towards the setting sun. If Yongsan District is southeast
      of Shulan, it cannot be west of Shulan.


      Based on the geographical relationship and the orientation between Yongsan District
      (Seoul, South Korea) and Shulan (Jilin Province, China), the answer to whether
      Yongsan District is located west of Shulan is:


      NO'

      East Sussex, and Coxheath. Crowhurst is a village in East Sussex, England. Coxheath
      is a village in Kent, England.


      2. **Understand Geography**: Next, understand the geography of these areas.
      East Sussex and Kent are neighboring counties in southeastern England. East
      Sussex is located to the southwest of Kent.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Now, let''s consider the specific locations of Crowhurst
      and Coxheath within their counties. Crowhurst is in the eastern part of East
      Sussex, close to the border with Kent. Coxheath is in the western part of Kent.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Given that East Sussex is generally southwest of
      Kent, a location in East Sussex would typically be southwest (or south) of a
      location in Kent, depending on their exact positions within their counties.
      However, considering Crowhurst is near the eastern border of East Sussex and
      Coxheath is in western Kent, their relative east-west positioning needs careful
      consideration.


      5. **Detailed Comparison**: Coxheath in Kent is to the northeast of Crowhurst
      in East Sussex because Kent is northeast of East Sussex, and within their respective
      areas, Coxheath is more westward in Kent, while Crowhurst, being in the east
      of East Sussex, places it relatively more eastward than Coxheath when comparing
      the two locations directly.

      down into the necessary steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Ein Jorjin and Qatrat
      al-Rihan are located. Without specific geographical knowledge or context, we
      must consider if these locations are well-known or if there''s any additional
      information provided about them.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Since no additional geographical context is provided,
      we need to rely on general knowledge or research about these places. Ein Jorjin
      and Qatrat al-Rihan are not widely recognized names without further context,
      suggesting they might be smaller or less internationally known locations.


      3. **Research or Knowledge Base**: Without a pre-existing knowledge base that
      includes these locations or access to real-time data, we cannot directly determine
      their geographical relationship (i.e., which one is west of the other).


      4. **Assumption Based on Naming**: Sometimes, names can give clues about locations,
      especially if they are in languages that are familiar or if they have been mentioned
      in historical or cultural contexts. However, without specific knowledge of the
      languages or contexts in which "Ein Jorjin" and "Qatrat al-Rihan" are used,

      research or access to a detailed geographical database that includes these locations,
      we cannot accurately determine if Ein Jorjin is located west of Qatrat al-Rihan
      based solely on the information provided.

      places might not be widely recognized, so we would typically look for them on
      a map or in a geographical database.


      2. **Understand Geographical Terms**: Understanding what "west of" means is
      crucial. In geography, when we say one location is west of another, it means
      the first location is situated in the direction of the setting sun relative
      to the second location.


      3. **Research Locations**: Since Ein Jorjin and Qatrat al-Rihan are not widely
      known locations without further context, we would need to research their exact
      positions. This could involve looking at detailed maps of the region they are
      in, assuming they are real and identifiable places.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Once the locations are identified, we would compare
      their positions relative to each other, focusing on their longitudinal coordinates

      locations of these places, I must provide a response based on the information

      3. **Relative Positions**: Without a map, determining if Ein Jorjin is west
      of Qatrat al-Rihan requires either prior knowledge of these specific locations
      or a method to research their relative positions. Given the nature of the question,
      it implies that both locations should be identifiable and their positions relative
      to each other determinable through geographic research or knowledge.

    b67bce18-f5d1-4b3f-862d-c4f5e4b032ae: 'To determine if Ein Jorjin is located west
      of Qatrat al-Rihan, we need to follow a series of logical steps considering
      geographical locations and their relations. However, without specific geographical
      data or context provided about Ein Jorjin and Qatrat al-Rihan, such as their
      countries, regions, or exact coordinates, we must rely on general geographical
      knowledge or assumptions based on typical naming conventions and possible locations.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, identify where Ein Jorjin and Qatrat al-Rihan
      are. Without specific information, we have to assume these are places that could
      be anywhere, but given the names, they might be located in regions where Arabic
      or similar languages are spoken, suggesting the Middle East or North Africa.


      2. **Determine Coordinates or Relative Positions**: Normally, to say if one
      place is west of another, we would need their geographical coordinates (latitude
      and longitude) or a map. Without these, we''re at a disadvantage.


      3. **Consider Naming Conventions**: Places with names like Ein Jorjin and Qatrat
      al-Rihan might suggest they are in areas where Arabic is spoken. However, this
      alone doesn''t give us their relative positions.


      4. **Research or Map Consultation**: In a typical scenario, we would consult
      a map or a geographical database to find out the exact locations and then determine
      their relative positions.


      Given the lack of specific information about these places and without the ability
      to consult external sources or databases directly within this response, we cannot
      accurately determine the relative positions of Ein Jorjin and Qatrat al-Rihan
      based solely on their names.


      However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and we cannot verify
      the information through standard means within this framework, I must provide
      an answer based on the process of elimination and the understanding that without
      concrete data, any answer would be speculative.


      Therefore, based on the inability to verify the locations and their relative
      positions, the most straightforward answer, given the constraints, would be
      to not assume any specific geographical relationship without evidence.

    d4075240-c2ff-4a50-b200-ee6c2692ee9b: 'To answer whether Pullambadi is located
      west of Sankarapuram, let''s break down the steps needed to determine this:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Pullambadi and Sankarapuram
      are located. Both places are in the state of Tamil Nadu, India.


      2. **Geographical Coordinates or Maps**: To determine their relative positions,
      it would be ideal to have their geographical coordinates or a map showing both
      locations. However, based on general knowledge, Pullambadi is known to be in
      the Tiruchirappalli district, and Sankarapuram is in the Kallakurichi district
      of Tamil Nadu.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Without exact coordinates, we rely on the general
      layout of Tamil Nadu''s districts. Tiruchirappalli district, where Pullambadi
      is located, is situated more to the south and slightly to the west of Kallakurichi
      district, where Sankarapuram is found.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general geographical layout and assuming no specific
      details contradict this arrangement, Pullambadi would be more to the south and
      possibly slightly to the west of Sankarapuram. However, the precise westward
      location depends on the exact positions within their respective districts.


      Given the information typically available and without precise coordinates, the
      answer leans towards Pullambadi being generally south and possibly slightly
      west of Sankarapuram, but to conclusively say it is west requires more specific
      geographical data.


      However, based on the general understanding and simplifying the question to
      a YES/NO answer without precise coordinates:


      YES'
    ecb9e4c5-4a23-42f3-882f-fb141b88da93: 'To answer whether Pullambadi is located
      west of Sankarapuram, we need to follow a logical process considering geographical
      locations and their relations. Here are the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Pullambadi and Sankarapuram
      are located. Pullambadi is a town in the Tiruchirappalli district of Tamil Nadu,
      India. Sankarapuram is a town in the Kallakurichi district of Tamil Nadu, India.


      2. **Understand Geographical Directions**: To determine if one location is west
      of another, we must understand the geographical layout. West refers to the direction
      towards the setting sun, which is the opposite of east.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: Without specific geographical coordinates,
      determining the exact relative positions requires general knowledge of the area''s
      layout. However, knowing that both places are in Tamil Nadu, we can consider
      the state''s geography. Tamil Nadu is a state in the southern part of India,
      with its eastern border along the Bay of Bengal.


      4. **Use Available Information**: Since I don''t have real-time access to specific
      maps or detailed geographical information about the relative positions of Pullambadi
      and Sankarapuram beyond their districts, I''ll rely on general principles. Typically,
      to say one place is west of another, it needs to be situated in a way that if
      you''re facing north, the western location would be to your left relative to
      the eastern location.


      5. **Consider District Locations**: Pullambadi is in Tiruchirappalli district,
      and Sankarapuram is in Kallakurichi district. Knowing the general layout of
      Tamil Nadu''s districts can help. Tiruchirappalli district is more central in
      Tamil Nadu, while Kallakurichi district is towards the north-east part of the
      state.


      6. **Make an Informed Guess**: Given the lack of precise geographical coordinates
      or a detailed map, making a definitive statement about their relative east-west
      positions requires some guesswork based on district locations. However, considering
      Tiruchirappalli''s central location and Kallakurichi being more to the northeast,
      it''s plausible that Pullambadi could be west of Sankarapuram, depending on
      their exact locations within their respective districts.


      Based on these steps and the general knowledge that Pullambadi is in a more
      central part of Tamil Nadu (Tiruchirappalli district) and Sankarapuram is in
      the Kallakurichi district which is towards the northeast, we can make an educated
      guess.

      down into the necessary steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify where Goalpara and
      East Garo Hills district are located. Goalpara is a district in the state of
      Assam, India. East Garo Hills is a district in the state of Meghalaya, India.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Knowing that both are districts in the northeastern
      part of India, we should consider their relative positions. Assam and Meghalaya
      are neighboring states, with Meghalaya being to the south of Assam.


      3. **Specific locations**: Goalpara is situated in the western part of Assam.
      East Garo Hills, being in Meghalaya, is generally south or southwest of Assam,
      considering the overall geography of the region.


      4. **Relative positions**: Given that Goalpara is in western Assam and East
      Garo Hills is in southern Meghalaya, we need to determine if Goalpara is west
      of East Garo Hills. Since East Garo Hills is more to the south and slightly
      to the east of the western part of Assam, we must consider the exact geographical
      positions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical layout, Goalpara, being in western
      Assam, would generally be north or northwest of East Garo Hills in Meghalaya.
      Considering the primary cardinal directions (north, south, east, west), if a
      location is more to the north, it doesn''t automatically mean it is west of
      another location that is more to the south and possibly slightly to the east.


      Given these steps and understanding that geographical positioning involves more
      nuanced directions than just north, south, east, and west, especially when considering
      states and districts'' irregular boundaries:


      The answer is: **NO**'

      Garo Hills district are located. Goalpara is a district in the state of Assam,
      India. East Garo Hills is a district in the state of Meghalaya, India.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Next, we need to consider the geographical positions
      of these districts relative to each other. Assam and Meghalaya are neighboring
      states in northeastern India.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Goalpara district is situated in the western part
      of Assam. East Garo Hills district is located in the western part of Meghalaya.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Considering the general geography of the region,
      Meghalaya is located south of Assam, and the western parts of both states share
      a border.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Goalpara is in western Assam and East Garo Hills
      is in western Meghalaya, and knowing that Meghalaya is generally south of Assam,
      Goalpara would indeed be located north (and slightly east or directly north,

      west.


      However, considering the general direction in a broad geographical context and
      the fact that these are large areas, the question seems to simplify the geography.
      In a strict sense, considering the primary cardinal directions (north, south,
      east, west), Goalpara is more to the north than to the west of East Garo Hills
      district.

      India. East Garo Hills is a district in the state of Meghalaya, India.


      2. **Understand Geographic Relationships**: Next, we need to understand the
      geographic relationship between Assam and Meghalaya. Meghalaya is located south
      of Assam.


      3. **Specific Location of Goalpara and East Garo Hills**: Goalpara district
      in Assam is located near the border with Meghalaya. East Garo Hills district
      in Meghalaya is situated in the eastern part of the Garo Hills region.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Considering the geography of the region, if we are
      looking at the relative positions of districts near the border of Assam and
      Meghalaya, we need to determine the exact positioning based on their geographical
      coordinates or known landmarks.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Geography**: Given that Goalpara is in Assam and East
      Garo Hills is in Meghalaya, and knowing the general layout of these states,
      we can proceed to the final determination. The states of Assam and Meghalaya
      share a border, and the positioning of districts along this border can vary.
      Without specific geographic coordinates, the general knowledge is that the Garo
      Hills region (including East Garo Hills) is south of the main part of Assam
      but can extend towards the western parts of Assam''s southern border.


      Given the general geographical layout and without precise coordinates, the answer
      might seem uncertain. However, knowing that Goalpara is situated in lower Assam
      near the international border with Bangladesh and considering the geography
      of the region, it is reasonable to deduce its position relative to East Garo
      Hills.


      Based on the general geography of the region, Goalpara is more likely to be
      located north or northwest rather than directly west of East Garo Hills, considering
      the orientation of the states and their shared border. However, the precise
      answer depends on the exact geographical locations and borders, which can be
      complex.


      Given the information typically available, **NO**, Goalpara is not located directly

      are. Levenshulme is a suburb of Manchester, England, and Burslem is a district
      in Stoke-on-Trent, England.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand their geographic
      positions relative to each other. Manchester, where Levenshulme is located,
      is generally northwest of Stoke-on-Trent, where Burslem is situated.


      3. **Consider Directions**: Since the question asks if Levenshulme is west of
      Burslem, we must consider the directions. West means the direction to the left
      when facing north.


      4. **Apply Knowledge**: Knowing Manchester is northwest of Stoke-on-Trent, this
      places Levenshulme (being part of Manchester) in a position that can be considered
      west or northwest relative to Burslem (in Stoke-on-Trent), depending on the
      exact locations. However, given the general direction from Stoke-on-Trent to
      Manchester is northwest, the direct line from Burslem to Levenshulme would indeed
      place Levenshulme more to the west than directly north of Burslem.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic positions and considering directions,
      Levenshulme is indeed located west of Burslem when looking at the broader geographic
      context of their locations within England.

      west of Colo, Iowa, let''s consider the geographical locations step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Collins,
      Iowa, and Colo, Iowa. Collins is a city located in Story County, Iowa. Colo
      is also a city in Story County, Iowa.


      2. **Compare Positions**: Since both cities are in the same county, we need
      to compare their positions relative to each other. This requires knowing the
      specific directions or the general layout of Story County.


      3. **Use Geographical References**: Without exact coordinates, we can consider
      major geographical references like roads, rivers, or other notable landmarks
      that might help in understanding the layout of the area.


      4. **Consider Mapping Data**: Typically, mapping data or a map of Story County,
      Iowa, would provide the most direct way to compare the locations. However, without
      access to real-time data or a map at this moment, we rely on general knowledge
      or prior research about these locations.


      Given that both Collins and Colo are in Story County, Iowa, and without specific
      details on their relative positions, one might typically consult a map for precise
      locations. However, considering general knowledge:


      - Collins, Iowa, is indeed located in Story County.

      - Colo, Iowa, is also in Story County.


      To give a definitive answer, we would ideally look at a map. However, based
      on the premise of the question and assuming it''s designed to test reasoning
      without requiring external data (like a map), we might infer that the question
      implies a scenario where Collins could be west of Colo based on their names
      being presented in a specific order or context that suggests a spatial relationship.


      But, without explicit information on their relative positions or a map to consult,
      the most accurate step would involve looking up the exact locations. Given the
      constraint to reason step by step without external data, we acknowledge the
      question''s structure implies a need to apply geographical knowledge or logic
      that might not be directly available.


      Therefore, based on the information given and the requirement to reason without
      external data, the answer would have to be based on any prior knowledge of Iowa''s
      geography or an understanding that without specific directional information,
      we cannot definitively conclude the relative positions of Collins and Colo,
      Iowa, solely from their names or the fact they are in the same county.


      Given these steps and acknowledging the limitations in our reasoning process
      without a map or specific directional data, the answer to whether Collins, Iowa,
      is located west of Colo, Iowa, would be speculative without further information.

      2. **Determine their relative positions**: Once identified, we need to determine
      their positions relative to each other, specifically which one is east and which
      one is west.


      3. **Compare their longitudes**: Since east-west positioning is essentially
      about longitude (with west having a lower longitude in the Western Hemisphere),
      comparing the longitudes of Collins and Colo will tell us which one is west.

      Tumed Left Banner is a banner (administrative division) in Inner Mongolia, China.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the general
      geographic positions of these locations relative to each other. Inner Mongolia,
      where Tumed Left Banner is located, is in the northern part of China. Henan
      Province, where Sanmenxia is located, is more centrally positioned but still
      to the south of Inner Mongolia.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: Since the question is about whether Sanmenxia is
      west of Tumed Left Banner, we need to consider their longitudes (east-west positioning).
      Generally, locations in Inner Mongolia are to the north and can extend both
      east and west across northern China. Henan Province is more to the east in the
      context of China''s geography.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Without exact coordinates, we rely on general geographic

    d216ac69-c491-4b78-975b-a5f62f45d0f7: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed to determine if Scole is located west of Clacton-on-Sea.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Scole and Clacton-on-Sea. Scole is a village in Norfolk, England, and Clacton-on-Sea
      is a seaside town in Essex, England.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine their geographic positions
      relative to each other. Norfolk, where Scole is located, is generally to the
      north and slightly west of Essex, where Clacton-on-Sea is located.


      3. **Consider Specific Locations**: Clacton-on-Sea is on the east coast of England,
      which means it is directly adjacent to the North Sea. Scole, being in Norfolk,
      is also in the eastern part of England but is positioned more to the north of
      Clacton-on-Sea rather than directly west.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Geography**: Given the geography of eastern England,
      with both locations being near the coast but Scole being more northward than
      westward of Clacton-on-Sea, we can conclude their relative positions.


      Based on the steps above, considering the general geography and the relative
      positions of Norfolk and Essex, we find that Scole is not directly west of Clacton-on-Sea
      but rather more to the north.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      \ If Fuga Island's longitude is less than Yuli, Hualien's, it would be west.\
      \ Without exact coordinates, we can generalize that the Babuyan Islands are\
      \ at a longitude roughly around 121.5\xB0E to 122\xB0E. Hualien County, Taiwan,\
      \ is approximately at 121.6\xB0E. This rough estimate suggests they are relatively\
      \ close in longitude, but the Philippines is generally at a lower latitude.\n\
      \n6. **Conclusion**: Considering the geography, Fuga Island is not directly\
      \ west of Yuli, Hualien, in the traditional sense of being purely to the west,\
      \ given the Philippines' position relative to Taiwan. However, the precise directional\
      \ relationship depends on exact coordinates. For simplicity, given the usual\
      \ understanding of \"west\" as directly to the west on a map, and considering\
      \ the general positions of these locations, Fuga Island is more to the south\
      \ or southeast of Taiwan rather than purely west. But, for the sake of this\
      \ question, considering \"west\" might imply a comparison of longitudes without\
      \ strict adherence to cardinal directions, the simplified answer would lean\
      \ towards \"no\" due to the lack of precise directional alignment in a cardinal\

      west of Yuli, Hualien, let''s break down the process:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify where Fuga Island
      and Yuli, Hualien are. Fuga Island is part of the Babuyan Islands in the Philippines.
      Yuli is a township in Hualien County, Taiwan.


      2. **Determine geographical positions**: Next, we determine the geographical
      positions of these locations. The Babuyan Islands, where Fuga Island is located,
      are in the northern part of the Philippines. Hualien County, where Yuli is situated,
      is on the eastern coast of Taiwan.


      3. **Compare geographical positions**: Now, compare their geographical positions.
      The Philippines is generally south of Taiwan. The Babuyan Islands, being in
      the northern Philippines, are still south but also somewhat east of Taiwan due
      to the geographical layout of these countries.


      4. **Specific location of Fuga Island and Yuli, Hualien**: Since Fuga Island
      is part of the Babuyan Islands in the Philippines and Yuli, Hualien is in eastern
      Taiwan, considering their longitudes, Fuga Island would be more to the south
      and slightly to the east of Yuli, Hualien, rather than directly west.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical layout and the positions of Fuga
      Island and Yuli, Hualien, Fuga Island is not located west of Yuli, Hualien.

      the locations of Matsudo and Urayasu and then compare their positions.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Matsudo and Urayasu are both cities in Japan.
      Matsudo is located in Chiba Prefecture, and Urayasu is also in Chiba Prefecture.


      2. **Determine their relative positions**: Since both cities are in the same
      prefecture, we need to consider their geographical positions within Chiba Prefecture.
      Matsudo is situated more inland, relatively north of Tokyo and somewhat west
      of the coastal areas of Chiba Prefecture. Urayasu, on the other hand, is known
      for being the location of Tokyo Disneyland and is situated near the coast, east
      of Tokyo.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Given that Matsudo is more inland and to the
      north relative to Tokyo, and Urayasu is to the east of Tokyo near the coast,
      we can deduce their relative east-west positions. Urayasu, being near the coast
      and east of Tokyo, would generally be east of Matsudo, considering Matsudo''s
      more inland and northern position relative to the Tokyo metropolitan area.

      \ Positions**:\n   - In many European cities, the historical or older parts\
      \ of the city are often located on higher ground due to defensive reasons. Gornji\
      \ Grad (Upper Town) in Zagreb is indeed situated on a hill, which historically\
      \ offered better defenses.\n   - Donji grad (Lower Town) is, as the name suggests,\
      \ located in a lower area of the city, which expanded outward from the original\
      \ upper town as the city grew.\n\n3. **Directions and Layout**:\n   - Without\
      \ specific geographical knowledge, one might initially think that \"Upper\"\
      \ and \"Lower\" refer to north and south or east and west. However, in the context\
      \ of Zagreb, these terms refer more to the elevation and the historical development\
      \ of the city rather than direct cardinal directions.\n   - Gornji Grad and\
      \ Donji grad are more adjacent to each other than directly north-south or east-west.\
      \ The city's layout is influenced by its history and geography, with the Sava\
      \ River to the south.\n\n4. **Specifics about Gornji Grad\u2013Medve\u0161\u010D\
      ak and Donji grad**:\n   - Gornji Grad is situated to the north of the main\
      \ Donji grad area. Medve\u0161\u010Dak, part of Gornji Grad\u2013Medve\u0161\
      \u010Dak, is known for its street and stadium (Stadion Maksimir), and it's generally\
      \ considered to be in the northern part of the city center.\n   - Donji grad,\
      \ the lower town, is more central and includes many of the city's main squares,\
      \ parks, and shopping areas. It's the heart of the city, with Gornji Grad being\
      \ more historic and elevated to its north.\n\nGiven this information, to answer\
      \ the question if Gornji Grad\u2013Medve\u0161\u010Dak is located west of Donji\
      \ grad, Zagreb, we consider the relative positions and geography of the city:\n\
      \n- **Conclusion**: Considering the general layout and relative positions, Gornji\
      \ Grad\u2013Medve\u0161\u010Dak is more north than directly west of Donji grad,\
      \ given the city's structure and historical development. However, without precise\
      \ geographical coordinates or a detailed map, one might argue based on the city's\
      \ layout and how streets and districts are arranged. For simplicity and based\
      \ on general knowledge of Zagreb's layout, it's more accurate to think of Gornji\
      \ Grad as being north rather than west of Donji grad. \n\nHowever, considering\
      \ the possibility of some westward extension of Gornji Grad\u2013Medve\u0161\
      \u010Dak relative to parts of Donji grad, and given the need for a YES/NO answer:\n\
      \nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$"

      \ what Gornji Grad\u2013Medve\u0161\u010Dak and Donji grad are. Both are districts\
      \ in Zagreb, Croatia. Gornji Grad translates to \"Upper Town,\" and Medve\u0161\

      \ Gornji Grad (part of Gornji Grad\u2013Medve\u0161\u010Dak district) is situated\
      \ on a hill overlooking the Sava River, which runs along the south side of Zagreb.\

      \ Given the layout of Zagreb, with Gornji Grad being part of the higher, northern\

      Karnataka, where Muddenahalli is located, is in the southwestern part of India.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Comparing their positions, Uttar Pradesh (and thus
      Sikandrabad) is generally northeast or north of Karnataka (and thus Muddenahalli)
      in terms of India''s overall geography.


      4. **West or East Determination**: Given that Sikandrabad is in the north and
      Muddenahalli is in the southwest, we can infer that Sikandrabad would be more
      to the east or northeast of Muddenahalli rather than directly west.

      2. **Determine Geographic Coordinates**: To understand their relative positions,
      it would be helpful to know their geographic coordinates. However, without specific
      coordinates provided, we can infer based on general geographic knowledge of

      other hand, is a town in the Blue Mountains area of New South Wales.


      2. **Determine the geographical location of Toomelah**: Toomelah is situated
      near the Queensland border in northern New South Wales.


      3. **Determine the geographical location of Woodford, New South Wales**: Woodford
      is located in the Blue Mountains, which places it west of Sydney but not as
      far west as the true western parts of New South Wales.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Given that Toomelah is in northern New South Wales
      near the Queensland border and Woodford is in the Blue Mountains, we need to
      consider their relative positions. The Blue Mountains, where Woodford is located,
      are to the west of the Sydney metropolitan area but still considered part of
      the eastern or coastal side of New South Wales.


      5. **Conclusion based on geographical orientation**: Toomelah, being near the
      Queensland border in northern New South Wales, would generally be north or slightly
      northeast of Woodford, New South Wales. Considering the question asks if Toomelah
      is west of Woodford, we need to assess their east-west alignment. Given the
      geography of New South Wales, Toomelah''s location near the Queensland border
      suggests it is more to the north than directly west of Woodford.


      Based on the steps and considering the geography, the answer to whether Toomelah
      is located west of Woodford, New South Wales, is: NO.'

      \ to Toomelah.\n\n4. **Directional Analysis**:\n   - To determine if Toomelah\
      \ is west of Woodford, we need to consider the directional relationship between\
      \ the two towns. Given that Toomelah is north and near the Queensland border,\
      \ and Woodford is west of Sydney (but still in the southeastern part of the\
      \ state), Toomelah would be more north than west in relation to many parts of\
      \ New South Wales, including the area where Woodford is located.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where Toomelah and Woodford,
      New South Wales are located. Toomelah is a small Australian Aboriginal community
      located in New South Wales. Woodford is also in New South Wales.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: Without specific coordinates, we rely on general
      knowledge of these places. Toomelah is known to be near the Queensland border,
      in the north of New South Wales. Woodford, on the other hand, is situated in
      the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Knowing the general areas, we can deduce their relative
      positions. The Blue Mountains, where Woodford is located, are west of the Sydney
      metropolitan area but still in the eastern part of New South Wales. Toomelah,
      being near the Queensland border in the north, would logically be more to the
      north than the west of Woodford, considering New South Wales'' geography.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Toomelah is more northwards and near the Queensland
      border, and considering Woodford''s location in the Blue Mountains, Toomelah
      would not be west of Woodford. Instead, it would be more northwards, possibly
      slightly east or directly north, depending on the exact locations.
