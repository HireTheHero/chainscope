      4. Without a confirmed release year for Rupkothar Golpo, I cannot definitively
      compare their release dates.


      5. Therefore, I do not have enough information to confidently answer whether
      Rupkothar Golpo was released earlier than There Goes My Baby.


      Given the instructions to provide a YES or NO answer, and recognizing the lack
      of complete information, I will answer:


      NO


      (Note: This NO is based on insufficient information, not a definitive chronological
      comparison)'

      - This is a 1969 biker film directed by Jack Starrett


      2. Next, I''ll find the release year for "Cat Feud"

      - This is an animated short directed by Chuck Jones

      - After checking, I find it was released in 1953


      3. Comparing the years:

      - "Run, Angel, Run!" was released in 1969

      - "Cat Feud" was released in 1953


      4. Since 1969 is later than 1953, "Run, Angel, Run!" was NOT released earlier
      than "Cat Feud"


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
