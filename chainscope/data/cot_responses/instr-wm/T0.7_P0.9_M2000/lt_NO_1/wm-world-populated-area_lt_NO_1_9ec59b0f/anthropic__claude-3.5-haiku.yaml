      - It is one of the five regions (provinces) of Turkmenistan


      3. Compare their areas:

      - Cunene Province area: approximately 87,342 square kilometers

      - Mary Region area: approximately 86,000 square kilometers


      4. Compare the areas:

      - Cunene Province (87,342 sq km) is slightly LARGER than Mary Region (86,000
      sq km)


      5. Answer the specific question: "Does Cunene Province have smaller area than
      Mary Region?"


      NO


      The reasoning shows that Cunene Province is slightly larger, so it does NOT
      have a smaller area than Mary Region.'
