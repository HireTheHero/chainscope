      1. Let me find information about Sobieszewo Island:

      - Sobieszewo Island is located in Poland

      - It has an area of approximately 35 square kilometers


      2. Let me find information about Johnsville, California:

      - Johnsville is a small unincorporated community in Plumas County, California

      - While I can find its location, I cannot find a reliable source for its exact
      area

      - It''s a very small community, likely just a few buildings and streets


      3. Reasoning:

      - Sobieszewo Island is a significant island with a known area of 35 square kilometers

      - Johnsville is a tiny unincorporated community that would likely only cover
      a fraction of a square kilometer

      - Therefore, Johnsville must be smaller than Sobieszewo Island

      1. First, I need to identify what Urbania and Yoro Department are:

      - Urbania - I cannot find reliable information about a place called Urbania

      - Yoro Department is an administrative department in Honduras


      2. Since I cannot find reliable information about Urbania''s area, I cannot
      make a valid comparison with Yoro Department''s area.


      3. Without being able to verify the area of one of the places, it''s impossible
      to make a definitive comparison.


      Given that I cannot verify the existence or area of Urbania, I cannot provide
      a definitive YES or NO answer to this question.

      - It is a village and civil parish in Oxfordshire, England

      - According to available data, its area is approximately 9.12 square kilometers


      2) Next, let me find information about Shirali

      - Shirali is a village in Karnataka, India

      - However, I cannot find reliable data about its exact area

      - According to available data, Berry Creek has an area of about 56.7 square
      miles


      2. Next, let me find the area of Achill Island

      - Achill Island is an island off the coast of County Mayo, Ireland

      - Achill Island has an area of about 57 square miles


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Berry Creek: 56.7 square miles

      - Achill Island: 57 square miles

      - 56.7 < 57


      Therefore, the answer is: YES


      Berry Creek, California does have a smaller area than Achill Island.'
