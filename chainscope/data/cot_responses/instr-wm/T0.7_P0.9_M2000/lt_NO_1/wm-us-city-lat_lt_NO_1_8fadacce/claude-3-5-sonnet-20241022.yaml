      - Cleary, MS is in central Mississippi, which is generally at a higher latitude

      Stock Island must be slightly north of Key West, not south of it


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      2. On Long Island, Suffolk County is east of Nassau County, but that''s not
      what we''re asking about


      3. Looking at their positions north-to-south:

      - Greenvale is on the North Shore of Long Island

      - Holtsville is more centrally located on Long Island, but slightly closer to
      the South Shore


      4. Therefore, Holtsville is positioned at a more southerly latitude than Greenvale


      Answer: YES'

      1. First, I need to locate both cities in New York state

      - Holtsville is in Suffolk County, Long Island

      - Greenvale is in Nassau County, Long Island


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Holtsville is in central Suffolk County

      - Greenvale is in northern Nassau County


      3. Considering Long Island''s geography:

      - Nassau County is west of Suffolk County

      - Holtsville and Greenvale are both on Long Island

      - Greenvale is closer to the North Shore of Long Island

      - Holtsville is more centrally located in Suffolk County


      4. Final analysis:

      - Since both are on Long Island and Greenvale is on the North Shore while Holtsville
      is more central, Holtsville must be south of Greenvale


      YES'
