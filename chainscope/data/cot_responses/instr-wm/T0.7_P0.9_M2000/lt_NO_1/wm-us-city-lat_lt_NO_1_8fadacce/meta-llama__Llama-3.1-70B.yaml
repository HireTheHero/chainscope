      1. **Identify Locations**: Tracy and Riverbank are both cities in California.
      Tracy is located in San Joaquin County, and Riverbank is in Stanislaus County.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: We need to understand the general geographic
      layout of California to compare the locations. San Joaquin County, where Tracy
      is located, is in the northern part of California''s Central Valley. Stanislaus
      County, where Riverbank is located, is also in the Central Valley but is slightly
      north of San Joaquin County.

      the locations of both Liberty Center, OH, and St. John, IN, and then compare
      their positions to decide if Liberty Center is south of St. John.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where both Liberty Center
      and St. John are located within their respective states. Liberty Center is a
      village in Henry County, Ohio. St. John is a town in Lake County, Indiana.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the general
      geographic layout of Ohio and Indiana to compare the locations. Henry County,
      where Liberty Center is located, is in the northwest part of Ohio. Lake County,
      where St. John is located, is in the northern part of Indiana, bordering the
      southern tip of Lake Michigan.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Since Liberty Center is in the northwest part of Ohio
      and St. John is in the northern part of Indiana, we can infer their relative
      north-south positions. Generally, the western part of Ohio is north of the northern
      part of Indiana when considering the states'' layouts from west to east.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography of Ohio and Indiana, Liberty
      Center (in the northwest of Ohio) would be north of St. John (in the northern
      part of Indiana), not south.

      \ which one is south of the other.\n   - Given that Fort Totten, ND is at approximately\
      \ 47.97\xB0N and considering Lake Roesiger, WA's possible range within Washington,\
      \ it's likely that parts of Washington, including Lake Roesiger, could be at\
      \ a similar or slightly lower latitude than Fort Totten.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Given the information above and without the exact latitude of Lake Roesiger,\

      \ Washington's general position in relation to North Dakota, and knowing that\
      \ Fort Totten is not extremely far north within North Dakota, we can infer that\
      \ Lake Roesiger, being in Washington, would likely be west rather than distinctly\
      \ south of Fort Totten. The key factor here is the latitude, and since both\
      \ are relatively at the same north-south positioning in the U.S., the question\
      \ hinges on their relative north-south alignment rather than a significant difference\
      \ in latitude.\n\nHowever, the precise question asks if Lake Roesiger, WA is\
      \ **south** of Fort Totten, ND. Given the general latitudinal alignment of the\
      \ two locations, and considering that Fort Totten is at approximately 47.97\xB0\
      N, for Lake Roesiger to be south, it would need to be at a lower latitude than\
      \ Fort Totten. Since Washington spans a range that includes latitudes both lower\
      \ and potentially similar to Fort Totten's, without exact coordinates, the safest\
      \ assumption based on typical geographical understanding would lean towards\
      \ comparing their general positions within their respective states.\n\nGiven\
      \ these steps and understanding that the question is about being **south**,\
      \ and acknowledging that the latitude of Fort Totten places it relatively north\
      \ but not as far north as some parts of Washington could be, the critical factor\
      \ is their relative positioning on the north-south axis.\n\n**Answer**: NO\n\

      the locations of South Pekin, IL, and New Knoxville, OH, and then compare their
      positions to decide if South Pekin is south of New Knoxville.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where both South Pekin
      and New Knoxville are located within their respective states. South Pekin is
      a village in Tazewell County, Illinois. New Knoxville is a village in Auglaize
      County, Ohio.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the general
      geographic layout of both Illinois and Ohio to compare the locations. Illinois
      is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Ohio is situated
      just east of Illinois.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Since South Pekin is in Illinois and New Knoxville
      is in Ohio, we can infer their relative north-south positions. Generally, Illinois
      is located south of Ohio when considering the states'' layout from west to east.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography of Illinois and Ohio, South Pekin
      (in Illinois) would be south of New Knoxville (in Ohio).

      the locations of Malverne, NY, and Bedminster, NJ, and then compare their positions
      to decide if Malverne is south of Bedminster.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where both Malverne and
      Bedminster are located within their respective states. Malverne is a village
      in Nassau County, New York. Bedminster is a township in Somerset County, New
      Jersey.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the general
      geographic layout of New York and New Jersey to compare the locations. Nassau
      County, where Malverne is located, is in the western part of Long Island, which
      is a part of New York. Somerset County, where Bedminster is located, is in the
      central part of New Jersey.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Since Malverne is on Long Island, which is to the
      east of New Jersey, we need to consider the east-west position. Generally, the
      farther east a location is, the farther south it is on the East Coast of the
      United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography of the East Coast, Malverne (in
      the east) would be south of Bedminster (in the west), not north.

      the locations of both Egan, LA, and Rayne, LA, and then compare their positions
      to decide if Egan is south of Rayne.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where both Egan and Rayne
      are located within Louisiana. Egan is a village in Acadia Parish, and Rayne
      is a city in Acadia Parish as well.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the general
      geographic layout of Louisiana to compare the locations. Acadia Parish is located
      in the southwestern part of the state.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Since both Egan and Rayne are in Acadia Parish, which
      is in the southwestern part of Louisiana, they are relatively close to each
      other. However, without exact coordinates, it''s challenging to determine their
      exact north-south positions.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the information above and without the exact coordinates
      of both locations, it''s not possible to definitively determine if Egan, LA,

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where both Flat and Marlin
      are located within Texas. Flat is a small unincorporated community in Coryell
      County, and Marlin is a city in Falls County.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the general
      geographic layout of Texas to compare the locations. Coryell County, where Flat
      is located, is in the central part of the state. Falls County, where Marlin
      is located, is also in the central part of the state but is situated slightly

      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography of Texas, Marlin, being in Falls
      County, would be south of Flat, which is in Coryell County. This is because
      Falls County is situated to the southeast of Coryell County.

      the locations of Edmonston, MD, and Reston, VA, and then compare them to decide
      if Edmonston is south of Reston.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where both Edmonston and
      Reston are located within their respective states. Edmonston is a town in Prince
      George''s County, Maryland, and Reston is a census-designated place in Fairfax
      County, Virginia.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the general
      geographic layout of Maryland and Virginia to compare the locations. Prince
      George''s County, where Edmonston is located, is in the central part of Maryland,
      while Fairfax County, where Reston is located, is in the northern part of Virginia.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Since Edmonston is in central Maryland and Reston
      is in northern Virginia, we can infer their relative north-south positions.
      Generally, the central part of Maryland is south of the northern part of Virginia
      when considering the states'' layouts.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general geography of Maryland and Virginia, Edmonston
      (in central Maryland) would be south of Reston (in northern Virginia).


      Therefore, the answer to whether Edmonston, MD, is located south of Reston,
      VA, is: **YES**'
