      3. **Compare the latitudes:** Both Midway South, TX, and Sunrise, FL, have latitudes
      around 26.2 degrees North. However, to determine which one is further south,
      a more precise comparison of their specific coordinates is necessary. Generally,

      similar latitudinal lines due to the curvature of the earth and the orientation
      of the states.


      Given the approximate latitudes, they are very close, but generally, parts of

      1. Identify the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Smith Mills,
      Massachusetts.

      2. Identify the geographical coordinates of Robbins, Illinois.

      3. Compare the latitudes of the two locations, since latitude determines how
      far north or south a place is.


      Smith Mills, MA is located in Massachusetts, which is in the northeastern part
      of the United States. Robbins, IL is located in Illinois, which is in the midwestern
      part of the United States. Generally, Massachusetts is north of Illinois.


      Based on the typical latitudinal positions of Massachusetts and Illinois:


      - Massachusetts (where Smith Mills is located) generally has a higher latitude
      (meaning it is further north).

      - Illinois (where Robbins is located) generally has a lower latitude (meaning
      it is further south).


      Therefore, Smith Mills, MA is located north of Robbins, IL.


      The answer is NO.'
