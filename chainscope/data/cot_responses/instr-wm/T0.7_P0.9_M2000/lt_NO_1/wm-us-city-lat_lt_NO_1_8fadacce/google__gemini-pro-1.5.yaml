      TX and Sunrise, FL.** Midway South, TX is in Texas, a state in the southern
      US. Sunrise, FL is in Florida, a state in the southeastern US.


      2. **Consider the general latitude of Texas vs. Florida.**  While both are southern
      states, Texas extends further west than Florida.  Florida''s eastern coast,
      where Sunrise is located, is generally at a higher latitude (further north)
      than much of Texas.


      3. **Determine if Midway South is significantly further south than Sunrise to
      overcome the longitudinal difference.**  While Texas does extend south, it''s
      not so drastically south of Florida that a city in Texas would be south of a
      city on Florida''s east coast.

      like a street name, not a city.  Missouri has many Shoal Creeks.  We need to

      Hendron, KY.


      2. **Hendron, KY:** This is a small town in Western Kentucky.


      3. **Relative Locations:** Western Kentucky is generally north of most of Missouri.  Therefore,
      it''s unlikely a location in Missouri would be south of a town in Western Kentucky.

      north of the Missouri state line.

      3. **Relative Locations:** We need to determine the general locations of Kansas
      City, MO and Hendron, KY. Kansas City is in western Missouri. Hendron, KY is
      in western Kentucky.

      north of Hendron, KY.

      it''s near in Missouri. A quick search shows Shoal Creek Drive exists in multiple
      Missouri cities, including Kansas City.  We need to be more specific, but we
      can assume for now it''s in Missouri.


      2. **Hendron, KY:** This is a very small town in Western Kentucky.


      3. **South of Hendron, KY:**  This refers to a geographical area generally below
      Hendron, KY on a map.


      4. **Is Shoal Creek Drive, MO south of Hendron, KY?** Missouri is generally
      west of Kentucky. While the western edge of Kentucky and the southeastern part
      of Missouri are close, most of Missouri is significantly north of the latitude
      of Hendron, KY.  Therefore, even if Shoal Creek Drive is in the southernmost
      part of Missouri, it''s unlikely to be south of Hendron, KY.


      NO.

    e62049d3-6de6-44be-84b7-172552620548: '1. **Shoal Creek Drive** seems like a street
      name, not a city.  Cities are generally larger and more encompassing than individual
      streets.  Missouri (MO) has many streets named Shoal Creek Drive.


      2. **Hendron, KY** appears to be a small unincorporated community in McCracken
      County, Kentucky.


      3. To compare locations, we need to compare the general area of Shoal Creek
      Drives in MO to Hendron, KY.  Missouri is generally west of Kentucky.  Therefore,
      any Shoal Creek Drive, MO, would likely be *west* of Hendron, KY, not south.


      4.  While some parts of Missouri might be slightly southwest of small portions
      of Kentucky along the border, it''s extremely unlikely any street named Shoal
      Creek Drive in Missouri would be directly south of Hendron, KY.

      parts of Louisiana *might* extend further south than the northernmost parts
      of Florida.  However, this is less likely for a city like Branford, which isn''t

      slightly more southerly latitude doesn''t place it south of Mount Healthy Heights.  Think
      of it like a diagonal line - even if one point is slightly lower on a map, if
