      1. First, I''ll locate both East Orosi and Sultana on a map of California.


      2. Both of these are small communities in Tulare County, in the Central Valley
      of California.


      3. Specifically, they are located in the same general area near the city of
      Orosi.


      4. Looking at their precise locations, East Orosi is located just north of Sultana.
