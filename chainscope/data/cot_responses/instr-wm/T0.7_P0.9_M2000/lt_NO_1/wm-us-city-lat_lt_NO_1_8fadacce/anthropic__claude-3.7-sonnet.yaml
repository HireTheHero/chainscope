      1) First, I need to determine the geographic positions of both West Chicago,
      IL and River Forest, IL.


      2) West Chicago is located in DuPage County in northeastern Illinois. It''s
      positioned in the western suburbs of Chicago.


      3) River Forest is also located in northeastern Illinois, specifically in Cook
      County. It''s an inner-ring suburb of Chicago, located just west of the city.


      4) When comparing their positions on a map, West Chicago is located further
      west of Chicago than River Forest.


      5) In terms of north-south positioning, West Chicago is located slightly north
      of River Forest.


      6) Therefore, West Chicago is NOT located south of River Forest - it''s actually
      slightly north of River Forest.

      Step 1: Let me identify the states. Mount Savage is in Maryland (MD), and Kettering

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states. Ohio is in the Midwest
      region, while Maryland is on the East Coast.


      Step 3: More specifically, Ohio is generally north of Maryland. Ohio borders
      Lake Erie to the north, and extends south to the Ohio River. Maryland is further
      south, bordering Pennsylvania to its north.


      Step 4: To be more precise about these specific cities:

      - Mount Savage, MD is in the northwestern part of Maryland

      - Kettering, OH is in the southwestern part of Ohio


      Step 5: Even though Mount Savage is in the northern part of Maryland and Kettering

      Step 1: Determine the location of Point Lookout, NY.

      Point Lookout is in New York state, specifically on Long Island. New York is
      in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Juniata, NE.

      Juniata is in Nebraska, which is in the central part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New York locations are generally in the northeastern US, with latitudes around
      40-44 degrees North.

      - Point Lookout, being on Long Island, is at approximately 40.6 degrees North
      latitude.

      degrees North.

      - Juniata, NE is at approximately 40.6 degrees North latitude.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      The latitudes are very similar, but Point Lookout, NY is slightly south of Juniata,
      NE. This is because while they have similar latitudes, the curvature of the
      Earth and the precise coordinates put Point Lookout marginally further south.

      - Goodrich, MI is located in the eastern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.

      - Palatine Bridge, NY is in eastern New York state.

      - New York extends further north than Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.

      - Palatine Bridge is in the Mohawk Valley region of New York, which is in the
      northern half of the state.

      - Goodrich, MI is in the southern half of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Buckhall, VA is in Virginia, which is a state in the southeastern United States.

      - South Shore, KY is in Kentucky, which is north of Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Virginia is located south of Kentucky on the map of the United States.

      - Kentucky borders Virginia''s northern border.


      Step 3: More specifically, Buckhall is in northern Virginia (in Prince William
      County), but even northern Virginia is still south of Kentucky.


      Step 4: South Shore, KY is in northeastern Kentucky along the Ohio River, at
      the Kentucky-Ohio border.


      Step 5: Comparing their positions, Buckhall, VA is indeed south of South Shore,
      KY because Virginia is south of Kentucky.

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both cities.

      - Buckhall, VA is in Virginia, which is on the east coast of the United States.

      - South Shore, KY is in Kentucky, which is inland and north of Virginia.


      Step 2: Let me consider their relative positions.

      - Virginia is generally south of Kentucky on a map.

      - Kentucky borders Virginia''s northern border (along with West Virginia).

      - South Shore, KY is likely in the eastern part of Kentucky, near the border
      with West Virginia.

      - Buckhall, VA is in northern Virginia.


      Step 3: Despite Buckhall being in northern Virginia, Virginia as a whole is
      south of Kentucky.

      - The northernmost parts of Virginia are still generally south of Kentucky locations.

      - South Shore, KY, being in Kentucky, would be north of locations in Virginia.


      Therefore, Buckhall, VA is located south of South Shore, KY.

      - South Shore, Kentucky is in northeastern Kentucky, along the Ohio River.


      Step 2: Let me determine their relative positions.

      - Virginia is south of Kentucky, as Kentucky is directly north of Virginia.

      - Buckhall is in northern Virginia, but still within Virginia.

      - South Shore is in northeastern Kentucky, along the Kentucky-Ohio border.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Even though Buckhall is in northern Virginia, Virginia as a whole is south
      of Kentucky.

      - South Shore is on the northern edge of Kentucky (along the Ohio River).

      - The northernmost parts of Virginia are still generally south of the southernmost
      parts of Kentucky.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geography.

      - Since Buckhall is in Virginia, which is south of Kentucky where South Shore
      is located, Buckhall is south of South Shore.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Kentucky is located inland, west of Virginia but still in the eastern half
      of the US


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - Virginia is generally south of Kentucky

      - Kentucky''s northern border is along the Ohio River, bordering Ohio

      - South Shore, KY is likely in northern Kentucky (given its name and the fact
      that it''s likely on the "south shore" of the Ohio River)

      - Buckhall, VA would be somewhere in Virginia, which is mostly south of Kentucky

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Grant, MN is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the northern United States.

      - Willamina, OR is in Oregon (OR), which is in the northwestern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Minnesota is generally located in the northern part of the contiguous United
      States, bordering Canada.

      - Oregon is on the west coast, but is further south than Minnesota.


      Step 3: Check specific locations.

      - Minnesota is entirely north of Oregon in terms of latitude.

      - Any city in Minnesota (including Grant) would be north of any city in Oregon
      (including Willamina).


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Grant, MN is in Minnesota, which is north of Oregon, Grant must be north
      of Willamina.

      - Therefore, Grant, MN is NOT south of Willamina, OR.

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both Emigsville, PA and Downingtown,
      PA.


      Step 2: Emigsville is located in York County in south-central Pennsylvania,
      near the city of York.


      Step 3: Downingtown is located in Chester County in southeastern Pennsylvania,

      Step 3: Identify the location of Stock Island, FL.

      Stock Island is one of the islands in the Florida Keys, located immediately
      east of Key West.


      Step 4: Determine their relative positions.

      In the Florida Keys, the islands generally run in a northeast to southwest direction.
      Since Stock Island is east of Key West, and the orientation of the Keys is northeast
      to southwest, Stock Island would be slightly northeast of Key West, not south
      of it.

      Step 1: Let me recall the geography of the Florida Keys.

      The Florida Keys are a string of islands extending southwest from the southern
      tip of the Florida peninsula.


      Step 2: Locate Key West, FL.

      Key West is famously the southernmost city in the continental United States
      and is located at the western end of the Florida Keys.

      Stock Island is one of the islands in the Florida Keys, located immediately
      east of Key West.


      Step 4: Determine their relative positions.

      Since the Florida Keys generally run in a southwest to northeast direction,

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of East Orosi, CA and Sultana, CA.


      Step 2: East Orosi is a small community in Tulare County, California, located
      in the San Joaquin Valley. It''s positioned near the foothills of the Sierra
      Nevada mountains.


      Step 3: Sultana is also a small community in Tulare County, California, located
      in the San Joaquin Valley.


      Step 4: Looking at their relative positions, East Orosi is located in northern
      Tulare County, while Sultana is located more centrally in Tulare County.


      Step 5: Specifically, East Orosi is located north of Sultana. East Orosi is
      near Orosi and Cutler, while Sultana is near Dinuba and closer to Visalia.


      Since East Orosi is north of Sultana (not south), the answer is:


      NO'

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both places in Georgia.

      - Locust Grove is a city in Henry County, Georgia, located in the north-central
      part of the state.

      - Heron Bay is not a city but a planned community/subdivision located in Locust
      Grove, GA.


      Step 2: Since Heron Bay is actually a community within Locust Grove, they essentially
      share the same general location, with Heron Bay being a specific area within
      the boundaries of Locust Grove.


      Step 3: If Heron Bay is a part of Locust Grove, then Locust Grove as a whole
      cannot be entirely south of Heron Bay. The city contains the community, so parts

      - Locust Grove is a city in Henry County, Georgia.

      - Heron Bay appears to be a residential community/subdivision, also in Georgia.


      Step 2: Determine their geographic coordinates.

      - Locust Grove is located in central Georgia, south of Atlanta.

      - Heron Bay is a community located in Locust Grove, GA.

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - White Cliffs is in New Mexico (NM)

      - Hydro is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Mexico is located to the west and southwest of Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is north and northeast of New Mexico


      Step 3: Based on the typical geography of these states:

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both cities.

      - Edmonston, MD is in Maryland (MD)

      - Reston, VA is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine their geographic coordinates.

      - Edmonston, MD is located in Prince George''s County, Maryland, near Washington
      DC, in the northeastern part of Maryland.

      - Reston, VA is located in Fairfax County, Virginia, also near Washington DC,
      in the northeastern part of Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider the relative positions of Maryland and Virginia.

      - Maryland is generally north and northeast of Virginia.

      - However, the DC area has complex geography where parts of Maryland wrap around
      DC.


      Step 4: Specifically for these two cities:

      - Edmonston is in the portion of Maryland that''s directly east/northeast of
      Washington DC.

      - Reston is in northern Virginia, west of Washington DC.

      - Edmonston is actually southeast of DC, while Reston is west/northwest of DC.


      Step 5: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Edmonston is slightly south of the main east-west line through DC.

      - Reston is north of this same line.


      Therefore, Edmonston, MD is indeed south of Reston, VA.

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between New York and Pennsylvania.

      - New York state is generally north of Pennsylvania state

      - Pennsylvania borders New York along its northern border


      Step 3: Check the specific locations of these cities.

      - Rye Brook, NY is in Westchester County in southeastern New York, near the
      Connecticut border

      - Mifflinville, PA is in Columbia County in eastern Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Rye Brook is located in the southern part of New York state

      - Mifflinville is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Cities in northeastern Pennsylvania are generally south of cities in southeastern
      New York


      Step 5: Make the determination based on their relative positions.

      \ 38.1\xB0N.\n- Cedar Ridge, CA is in Nevada County in northern California,\
      \ with a latitude of approximately 39.2\xB0N.\n\nStep 4: Compare the latitudes.\n\
      - Cuba, MO at about 38.1\xB0N is at a LOWER latitude than Cedar Ridge, CA at\
      \ about 39.2\xB0N.\n- Lower latitude means further south.\n\nTherefore, Cuba,\
      \ MO is located south of Cedar Ridge, CA.\n\nYES"
