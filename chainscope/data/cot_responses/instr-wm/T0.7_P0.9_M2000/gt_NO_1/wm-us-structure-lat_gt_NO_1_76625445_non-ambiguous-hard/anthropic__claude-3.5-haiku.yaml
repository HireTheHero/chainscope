      1. First, I''ll locate Brookville Lake Dam in Indiana

      - This dam is located in Franklin County, Indiana

      - It''s in the east-central part of Indiana


      2. Next, I''ll locate Allegheny Reservoir in Pennsylvania

      - This reservoir is located in northwestern Pennsylvania

      - It''s near the New York border in the northwestern part of the state


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Brookville Lake Dam is in east-central Indiana

      - Allegheny Reservoir is in northwestern Pennsylvania

      - These locations are in different regions of the US


      4. Determine the relative north-south positioning

      - East-central Indiana is generally south of northwestern Pennsylvania

      - This means Brookville Lake Dam is south of Allegheny Reservoir


      5. Therefore, the answer to "Is Brookville Lake Dam, IN located north of Allegheny
      Reservoir, PA?" is:


      NO'

      1. First, let''s locate Black Canyon Lake, Arizona:

      - Black Canyon Lake is located in Arizona, which is in the western United States

      - Arizona is a southwestern state


      2. Next, let''s locate Lake Centennial, Maryland:

      - Lake Centennial is located in Maryland, which is in the eastern United States

      - Maryland is on the east coast


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Arizona is west of Maryland

      - When comparing north/south positions, we need to look at their latitudes

      - Arizona is generally at a lower latitude (more south) than Maryland

      - This means locations in Arizona are typically south of locations in Maryland


      4. Therefore, Black Canyon Lake (Arizona) would be located SOUTH of Lake Centennial
      (Maryland)


      The answer to "Is Black Canyon Lake (Arizona), AZ located north of Lake Centennial

      2. Mountain Creek Lake is located in Texas, which is in the southern part of
      the United States.


      3. Stockton Lake is located in Missouri, which is in the central/midwestern
      part of the United States.


      4. Looking at a map, Missouri is north of Texas.


      5. This means that a location in Missouri would generally be north of a location

      1. Locate Truman Reservoir:

      - Truman Reservoir is located in Missouri

      - It is situated in west-central Missouri


      2. Locate Shasta Dam:

      - Shasta Dam is located in northern California

      - It is situated near Redding, California


      3. Compare geographical positions:

      - Missouri is east of California

      - Missouri is generally located in the central/midwestern part of the United

      - California is on the west coast

      - Missouri is at a lower latitude (further south) compared to California


      4. Determine relative north/south positioning:

      - Since Missouri is east and at a lower latitude than California, Truman Reservoir
      would be south of Shasta Dam

    afc2a4f6-220c-45f5-963f-ee242577367e: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Holiday Bowl (building) in California

      2. Then, I''ll locate Lake Bowen in South Carolina

      3. Then I''ll compare their geographical positions


      Step 1: Holiday Bowl is a specific building located in California, but I don''t
      know its precise coordinates.


      Step 2: Lake Bowen is located in Spartanburg County, South Carolina.


      Step 3: California is on the west coast of the United States, while South Carolina
      is on the east coast. They are in completely different geographical regions.


      More specifically:

      - California is west of the continental divide

      - South Carolina is east of the continental divide

      - The entire state of California is north of South Carolina


      Therefore, the building Holiday Bowl in California is definitely located north
      of Lake Bowen in South Carolina.


      Answer: YES'
