      has an area of approximately 148 square kilometers (57 square miles).


      2. **Berry Creek, California**: This is a small unincorporated community in
      Butte County, California. It is not an island or a large land area, but rather
      a community within a larger region. The area of Berry Creek as a community is
      not typically measured in the same way as an island or a distinct geographical
      entity like Achill Island. However, the general community area would be significantly
      smaller than an island like Achill.

      1. **Tumacacori, Arizona**: Tumacacori is a small census-designated place in
      Santa Cruz County, Arizona. It is known for the Tumacacori National Historical
      Park. The area of Tumacacori itself is relatively small, as it is more of a
      historic site and small community.


      2. **Cetara, Campania**: Cetara is a small town and comune in the province of
      Salerno, in the Campania region of Italy. It is situated on the Amalfi Coast
      and is known for its picturesque setting and fishing heritage.


      Given that both Tumacacori and Cetara are small in size, we need to compare
      their approximate areas. Tumacacori, as a census-designated place, is often
      measured in terms of the land area it covers, which is typically larger than
      a small Italian comune like Cetara.


      After analyzing the typical sizes of such locations:


      - Tumacacori, Arizona, has a land area that is likely larger than that of Cetara,
      Campania, given that it encompasses more open land and historical park areas.

      - Cetara, being on the Amalfi Coast, is a densely built-up small town with limited

      Campania.


      **YES**'
    173c8fd5-a27a-4897-b297-29e084f6ab04: 'To determine which location has a larger
      area, let''s break it down:


      1. **Tumacacori, Arizona**: This is a small community in southern Arizona, close
      to the Tumacacori National Historical Park. While specific area data for Tumacacori
      itself is not widely publicized, it is part of the larger Santa Cruz County.
      Generally, the community itself is relatively small.


      2. **Cetara, Campania**: This is a coastal town in Italy, part of the Salerno
      province in the Campania region. Cetara is known for its fishing and tourism,
      and like many coastal Italian towns, it tends to have a limited land area.


      Given the nature of both places:


      - Tumacacori, as part of a rural area in Arizona, likely has a larger land area
      compared to the densely populated and geographically constrained coastal town
      of Cetara in Italy.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**, Tumacacori, Arizona likely has a larger area
      than Cetara, Campania.'
    1e7fce3a-42e9-448e-9533-5bfe6867c496: 'To answer this question, we need to compare
      the land areas of Tumacacori, Arizona, and Cetara, Campania.


      1. **Tumacacori, Arizona**: Tumacacori is a small census-designated place (CDP)
      located in Santa Cruz County, Arizona. It is part of the Tumacacori-Carmen area.
      Generally, CDPs like Tumacacori tend to have relatively small land areas, often
      just covering the immediate settlement and surrounding vicinity.


      2. **Cetara, Campania**: Cetara is a small coastal town located in the region
      of Campania in Italy. It is part of the Amalfi Coast, known for its picturesque
      landscapes and relatively confined geography due to the coastal and mountainous
      terrain.


      3. **Comparison**: Typically, an area like Tumacacori in the United States,
      especially in a less densely populated state like Arizona, might cover a larger
      geographic area compared to a densely populated and geographically constrained
      coastal town like Cetara in Italy.


      Given these considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that Tumacacori, Arizona,
      likely has a larger area than Cetara, Campania.

    25edb4b7-0695-45f4-b309-dfeb530853bf: 'To answer the question of whether Madison
      Park, Baltimore has a larger area than Bethune, Colorado, we need to consider
      the following steps:


      1. **Identify Madison Park, Baltimore**: Madison Park is a neighborhood located
      in Baltimore, Maryland. It is not an independent city or town, but a part of
      the larger city of Baltimore.


      2. **Identify Bethune, Colorado**: Bethune is a small statutory town located
      in Kit Carson County, Colorado. It is an independent municipality with its own
      defined geographic boundaries.


      3. **Determine the Area of Madison Park, Baltimore**: As a neighborhood, Madison
      Park does not have officially defined boundaries for area measurement in the
      same way as an incorporated town or city. Neighborhoods in cities like Baltimore
      typically do not have their areas measured in the same explicit manner.


      4. **Determine the Area of Bethune, Colorado**: As of the latest available data,
      Bethune, Colorado covers an area of approximately 0.3 square miles (0.78 square
      kilometers).


      5. **Comparison**: Since Madison Park is a neighborhood and not an independent
      entity with a defined land area, it is not typically measured in square miles
      or kilometers like a town would be. Therefore, comparing the "area" of a neighborhood
      to that of a town is not straightforward or directly possible.


      Considering the above steps, it is not possible to make a direct comparison
      of area between a neighborhood (Madison Park) and a town (Bethune) because neighborhoods
      usually do not have official area measurements in the same way towns do.


      Thus, the answer to whether Madison Park, Baltimore has a larger area than Bethune,
      Colorado is: **NO** (in the sense that a direct comparison cannot be made, and
      Bethune has a defined area).'

      1. **Beilen**: Beilen is a town in the Netherlands, located within the municipality
      of Midden-Drenthe. The area of Beilen itself is not typically measured separately,
      as it is part of this larger municipality.


      2. **Roseto Valfortore**: Roseto Valfortore is a small town and comune in the
      province of Foggia, in the Apulia region of Italy. The area of Roseto Valfortore
      is approximately 50 square kilometers.


      Since Beilen is part of a larger municipality, comparing it accurately to Roseto
      Valfortore based on available common metrics may not be straightforward unless
      the specific area of Beilen alone is known. However, if considering the larger
      administrative area it is part of, Beilen''s encompassing area (Midden-Drenthe)
      is likely larger than the area of Roseto Valfortore.


      Given the lack of specific data solely for Beilen and typically larger area
      sizes of Dutch municipalities compared to small Italian communes, it is reasonable
      to conclude:

      Given that Beilen is a part of a municipality rather than an individual administrative
      unit like a comune, it is reasonable to consider that Roseto Valfortore, with

      1. **Tugela Ferry**: Tugela Ferry is a small town in South Africa, located in
      the KwaZulu-Natal province. It is primarily a rural area with limited urban
      development, which suggests that it likely covers a smaller geographical area
      typical for rural settlements.


      2. **Bettles, Alaska**: Bettles is a small city in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census
      Area of Alaska, United States. Bettles is known for its remote location and
      vast surrounding wilderness, which is characteristic of many Alaskan settlements.
      However, the actual municipal area of Bettles itself, as a defined city, is
      generally quite small.


      Based on the nature of these locations:


      - Tugela Ferry, being a rural settlement in South Africa, may not have a clearly
      defined boundary like a city, but it is not known for having a particularly
      large area.

      - Bettles, as a small city, might have a defined municipal boundary, but it

      Given the information, it is unclear without specific data on the exact area
      measurements, but generally speaking, the urban or municipal area of Bettles
      is likely to be small, similar to Tugela Ferry. However, in most cases, small
      towns and rural settlements tend to not have large defined areas.


      Thus, without exact figures, it is reasonable to assume that neither location
      has a significantly larger area than the other based on their characteristics.
      However, based on typical characteristics of rural settlements versus small

    c5ab332f-03e4-4b42-bda4-014671323152: 'To determine whether Tugela Ferry has a
      larger area than Bettles, Alaska, we need to consider the geographical size
      of each location.


      1. **Tugela Ferry**: This is a small town located in the province of KwaZulu-Natal,
      South Africa. It is known more as a rural settlement rather than a large area.


      2. **Bettles, Alaska**: This is a small city located in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census
      Area in Alaska, United States. As with many places in Alaska, it encompasses
      a larger geographical area due to the sparse population and expansive natural
      surroundings.


      Typically, rural settlements and small towns in South Africa, like Tugela Ferry,
      occupy less area compared to Alaskan cities which are often spread over larger
      expanses of land due to the nature of the Alaskan terrain and settlement patterns.


      Therefore, based on the typical characteristics of these two types of locations,
      Bettles, Alaska is likely to have a larger area than Tugela Ferry.


      NO, Tugela Ferry does not have a larger area than Bettles, Alaska.'
    e0ca7c1e-cce2-425e-a114-1ce58ca9c768: 'To determine whether Tugela Ferry has a
      larger area than Bettles, Alaska, we need to consider the size of both locations.


      1. **Tugela Ferry**: This is a small town located in South Africa, specifically
      in the KwaZulu-Natal province. It is not a large urban area and is mostly known
      for being a rural settlement.


      2. **Bettles, Alaska**: This is a small city in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area
      of Alaska, United States. It is also a relatively small settlement, primarily
      known for being a remote location.


      Now, let''s consider their relative sizes:


      - **Tugela Ferry**: As a rural town in South Africa, it does not cover a large
      area. Towns in rural South Africa typically cover smaller areas compared to
      larger urban areas.


      - **Bettles, Alaska**: Being a small city in Alaska, it also does not cover
      a large area. However, Alaskan cities and settlements often encompass larger
      land areas due to lower population density and more expansive boundaries.


      Given these considerations, it is likely that Bettles, Alaska, covers a larger
      area than Tugela Ferry because settlements in Alaska often have larger land
      areas despite small populations.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:


      **NO**. Tugela Ferry does not have a larger area than Bettles, Alaska.'

      England. Like Shirali, it is a village and thus also likely has a relatively
      small land area.


      Given that both Shirali and Brightwell-cum-Sotwell are villages, neither is
      known for vast land areas. However, specific data comparing their exact land
      areas isn''t typically readily available unless sourced from local administrative
      resources or specific geographical databases.


      Without precise measurements, it''s difficult to definitively say which village
      has a larger area. However, by general assumption based on the typical size
      of villages in their respective regions, the answer cannot be determined with
      certainty without specific data.


      Thus, without exact measurements, the appropriate response is:


      **NO**, there is insufficient information to definitively say that Shirali has
      a larger area than Brightwell-cum-Sotwell.'
