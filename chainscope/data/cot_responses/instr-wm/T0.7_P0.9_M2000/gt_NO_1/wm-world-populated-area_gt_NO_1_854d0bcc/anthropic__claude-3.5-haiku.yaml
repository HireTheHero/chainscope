      1. First, I''ll locate Tugela Ferry:

      - Tugela Ferry is a small town in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa

      - It is located in a rural area near the Tugela River


      2. Next, I''ll locate Bettles, Alaska:

      - Bettles is a small, remote town in Alaska, United States

      - It is located in the central part of Alaska


      3. To compare their areas, I''ll look up their geographic details:

      - Tugela Ferry is a small rural settlement, likely with a modest area

      - Bettles is a very small, remote Alaskan town with minimal developed area


      4. While I don''t have precise measurements, Alaskan towns, especially in remote
      areas, often have large municipal boundaries due to the sparse population and
      vast landscape


      5. Given the typical characteristics of Alaskan towns, it''s likely that Bettles,
      Alaska has a larger area than Tugela Ferry


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Tugela Ferry does not have a larger area than
      Bettles, Alaska.'
