      1. First, let me locate both parishes in Louisiana:

      - Morehouse Parish is in northeastern Louisiana

      - Morehouse Parish borders Arkansas on Louisiana''s northern border

      - Claiborne Parish also borders Arkansas on Louisiana''s northern border

      - Looking at their positions along this border, Morehouse Parish is to the east
      of Claiborne Parish

      2. Let me check their relative positions:

      - Foard County is located in the northern part of Texas, bordering Oklahoma

      - Wichita County is also located along the Oklahoma border

      - Wichita County is east of Foard County, but they are at roughly the same latitude


      3. Since they are at approximately the same latitude and are adjacent to Oklahoma,
      neither is truly "north" of the other - they are side by side.

      - Outagamie County is in east-central Wisconsin

      - Brown County is also in east-central Wisconsin


      2. Let me check their relative positions:

      - Outagamie County is directly west of Brown County

      - They share a border

      - Neither is significantly north or south of the other


      3. Looking more precisely:

      - Outagamie County is positioned alongside Brown County

      1. First, let me recall the location of these counties:

      - Golden Valley County, ND is in western North Dakota

      - Wibaux County, MT is in eastern Montana


      2. Since one county is in Montana and one is in North Dakota, I need to consider
      their relative positions along the MT-ND border.


      3. Key facts:

      - The Montana-North Dakota border runs straight north-south

      - Montana is west of North Dakota


      4. Therefore, these counties must be at similar latitudes since they''re both
      near the MT-ND border.


      5. Checking their specific locations:

      - Wibaux County, MT is directly adjacent to the ND border

      - Golden Valley County, ND is not on the MT border - it''s actually a bit south
      and east of Wibaux County


      Therefore: NO, Golden Valley County, ND is not north of Wibaux County, MT. It''s
      actually slightly south and east of it.
