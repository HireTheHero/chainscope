      1. **Location of Miami-Dade County**: Miami-Dade County is located in the southeastern
      part of Florida, along the Atlantic coast.


      2. **Location of Collier County**: Collier County is located in the southwestern
      part of Florida, along the Gulf of Mexico.


      3. **Relative Position**: Miami-Dade County is situated on the eastern side
      of the state, while Collier County is on the western side. To determine the
      north-south positioning, we need to compare their latitudinal positions.


      4. **Latitude Check**: Miami-Dade County, with Miami as its major city, is generally
      at a lower latitude (more southern) compared to Collier County, which includes
      areas like Naples.


      Based on this geographic reasoning, Miami-Dade County is located south of Collier
      County.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**. Miami-Dade County is not located
      north of Collier County.'
    e02f631b-6929-49ad-807e-db52b286e950: 'To determine whether Miami-Dade County
      is located north of Collier County in Florida, let''s go through the steps:


      1. **Identify the location of Miami-Dade County**: Miami-Dade County is located
      in the southeastern part of Florida, and it is part of the Miami metropolitan
      area. It is situated on the Atlantic coast.


      2. **Identify the location of Collier County**: Collier County is located in
      the southwestern part of Florida. It is on the Gulf of Mexico coast and includes
      the city of Naples.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Miami-Dade County is on the southeastern
      coast, while Collier County is on the southwestern coast. In terms of latitude
      (north-south position), Miami-Dade County is generally situated to the north
      of the southernmost parts of Collier County.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative positions, Miami-Dade County is located
      north of the southern areas of Collier County, but overall, the majority of
      Miami-Dade County is east and slightly south of the central parts of Collier
      County.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**, Miami-Dade County is not located north of Collier
      County.'

      locations.


      1. **Identify the location of Guilford County, NC**: Guilford County is located
      in the state of North Carolina, which is on the east coast of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Izard County, AR**: Izard County is located in
