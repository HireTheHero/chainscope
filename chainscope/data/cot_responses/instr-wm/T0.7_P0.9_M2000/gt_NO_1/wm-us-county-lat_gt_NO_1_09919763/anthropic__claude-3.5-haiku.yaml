      - It contains the city of Sevierville and is near the Great Smoky Mountains


      2. Next, I''ll locate Wake County, North Carolina on a map

      - Wake County is in central North Carolina

      - It contains the city of Raleigh, the state capital


      3. Comparing their geographical positions

      - Sevier County is in eastern Tennessee

      - Wake County is in central North Carolina

      - Tennessee is west of North Carolina

      - Sevier County is further north than Wake County

      - It includes the city of Gulfport and is in the southernmost part of Mississippi


      2. Next, I''ll locate East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana

      - This parish is in southeastern Louisiana

      - It contains the city of Baton Rouge

      - It is located inland from the Gulf Coast


      3. Comparing their geographical positions

      - Harrison County is south of East Baton Rouge Parish

      - Specifically, Harrison County is closer to the Gulf of Mexico, while East
      Baton Rouge Parish is further inland and north


      4. Therefore, Harrison County is NOT located north of East Baton Rouge Parish


      The answer is: NO'

      - Evangeline Parish is in central Louisiana, in the south-central part of the
      state


      2. Next, locate Pearl River County, Mississippi on a map

      - Pearl River County is in southeastern Mississippi, near the Louisiana border
      and the Gulf Coast


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Evangeline Parish is located more inland and further northwest

      - Pearl River County is located closer to the Gulf Coast and more to the southeast


      4. Determine their relative north-south positioning

      - Since Evangeline Parish is more northwest and Pearl River County is more southeast,
      Evangeline Parish is indeed NORTH of Pearl River County


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      5. Therefore, the statement "Pacific County, WA is located north of Lewis County,
      WA" is false.


      Answer: NO'
    f9082049-ea01-424f-9110-8dd7df98e7c9: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll visualize the location of Pacific County and Lewis County in
      Washington state.


      2. Pacific County is located in the southwestern part of Washington state, along
      the Pacific coast.


      3. Lewis County is located in the west-central part of Washington state, inland
      from the coast.


      4. When looking at a map of Washington, Pacific County is actually south of
      Lewis County.


      5. Therefore, Pacific County is NOT located north of Lewis County.


      The answer is: NO.'
