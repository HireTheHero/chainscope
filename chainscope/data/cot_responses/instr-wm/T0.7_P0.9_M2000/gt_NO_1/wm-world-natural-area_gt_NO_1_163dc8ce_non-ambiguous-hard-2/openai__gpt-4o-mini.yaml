      1. **Lake Caliraya**: Lake Caliraya is an artificial lake located in the Philippines.
      Its area is approximately 3,500 hectares, which is about 35 square kilometers.

      Now, comparing the two:


      - Lake Caliraya: ~35 square kilometers

      - Gulf of Oman: ~95,000 square kilometers


      Since 35 square kilometers is much smaller than 95,000 square kilometers, it
      is clear that Lake Caliraya does not have a larger area than the Gulf of Oman.
