      2. **What is the Java Sea?** It''s a sea in Indonesia.

      3. **How do we measure the area of a sea?**  We use square kilometers or square
      miles.


      **Now, we need to compare the areas:**


      * The Coleto Creek Reservoir is a relatively small body of water, located in
      Texas.

      * The Java Sea is a large body of water, located in Indonesia.


      **Based on this, we can conclude:**


      * The Coleto Creek Reservoir is smaller than the Java Sea.

      * The Java Sea is much larger than the Coleto Creek Reservoir.
