      answer.


      **Step 1: Find the longitude of Leavenworth County, KS.**

      Leavenworth County, KS is located in eastern Kansas. Its approximate longitude
      is **-95 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Find the longitude of Charles County, MD.**

      Charles County, MD is located in southern Maryland. Its approximate longitude
      is **-77 degrees West**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      * Leavenworth County, KS: -95 degrees West

      * Charles County, MD: -77 degrees West


      On a standard map, locations further *west* have a *more negative* or *larger
      negative* longitude value. Locations further *east* have a *less negative* or
      *smaller negative* longitude value (closer to 0).


      Since -95 is a more negative number than -77, Leavenworth County, KS is further
      west than Charles County, MD.


      **Step 4: Answer the question.**

      The question is: "Is Leavenworth County, KS located east of Charles County,
      MD?"


      Based on the longitudes, Leavenworth County, KS is *west* of Charles County,
      MD.

    e4e481e5-c084-4cb1-aa32-b298c211a12e: 'Let''s break this down to determine the
      answer.


      **Step 1: Find the approximate longitude of Love County, OK.**

      Love County, OK is located in south-central Oklahoma. A quick search or look
      at a map reveals that Oklahoma is in the Central Time Zone and is significantly
      west of the Mississippi River. Its longitude is roughly between 96 and 98 degrees
      West. For example, the county seat, Marietta, OK, is around 97.11 degrees West
      longitude.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of Bladen County, NC.**

      Bladen County, NC is located in southeastern North Carolina. North Carolina
      is on the East Coast of the United States and is in the Eastern Time Zone. Its
      longitude is roughly between 78 and 79 degrees West. For example, the county
      seat, Elizabethtown, NC, is around 78.61 degrees West longitude.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   Love County, OK: ~97 degrees West

      *   Bladen County, NC: ~78 degrees West


      **Step 4: Determine which is further east.**

      On a longitude scale, smaller negative numbers (or numbers closer to 0 for West
      longitudes) are further east.

      Since -78 is greater than -97 (or 78 West is closer to the Prime Meridian than
      97 West), Bladen County, NC, is significantly further east than Love County,
      OK.


      **Step 5: Answer the question.**

      The question is: "Is Love County, OK located east of Bladen County, NC?"

      Based on our comparison, Love County, OK is located **west** of Bladen County,
      NC.


      **NO**'

      **Step 2: Find the longitude of Amherst County, VA.**

      *   Woodson County, KS: -95.7 degrees West

      On a map, as you move west, the negative longitude values increase (become more
      negative). Conversely, as you move east, the negative longitude values decrease
      (become less negative).


      Since -79.2 is a "less negative" number than -95.7, Amherst County, VA is located

      1.  **Locate Woodson County, KS:** Woodson County is in the southeastern part
      of Kansas. Kansas is generally considered a "Midwestern" state, and it''s west
      of the Mississippi River.


      2.  **Locate Amherst County, VA:** Amherst County is in the central part of
      Virginia. Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States.


      3.  **Compare Longitudinal Positions:** Without needing exact longitudes, we
      know that Kansas is significantly to the west of Virginia. The entire state
      of Kansas lies west of the entire state of Virginia. Therefore, any county in
      Kansas will be west of any county in Virginia.

    11f0b4cb-cb19-4177-8437-5554cfe83e15: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Muskogee County, OK:** This county is in eastern Oklahoma.

      2.  **Locate Pamlico County, NC:** This county is on the coast of eastern North
      Carolina.

      3.  **Conceptualize their relative positions on a map of the US:** Oklahoma
      is to the west of North Carolina.

      4.  **Determine "east of":** For one location to be "east of" another, it must
      be further to the east.


      Since Oklahoma is west of North Carolina, any point in Oklahoma will be west
      of any point in North Carolina. Therefore, Muskogee County, OK is *not* located
      east of Pamlico County, NC. It is located west of Pamlico County, NC.

      is on the West Coast of the US. Plumas County is in northeastern California,

      2.  **Adams County, CO:** We need to know its general location. Colorado is

      3.  **Comparing "east of":** To be "east of" something, you must be further
      along the eastward progression across the globe. Since California is west of
      Colorado, any county in California will be west of any county in Colorado.


      Therefore, Plumas County, CA is *west* of Adams County, CO.

    b37105ea-b1b8-41f2-8d96-4b4871f744c0: 'Let''s break this down to determine the
      answer.


      **Step 1: Find the approximate longitude of Treasure County, MT.**

      Treasure County, MT is located in southeastern Montana. A quick search reveals
      that Montana is in the Mountain Time Zone, and its eastern border is around
      104 degrees West longitude. Treasure County is further west than that, so it
      would be roughly between 105 and 108 degrees West longitude.


      **Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of Alger County, MI.**

      Alger County, MI is located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Michigan is
      in the Eastern Time Zone (with some parts in Central Time, but Alger County
      is firmly in Eastern). The eastern border of Michigan is around 82 degrees West
      longitude. The western part of the Upper Peninsula extends to around 90 degrees
      West longitude. Alger County is roughly in the middle of the Upper Peninsula,
      so it would be around 86 to 88 degrees West longitude.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      * Treasure County, MT: Approximately 105-108 degrees West longitude

      * Alger County, MI: Approximately 86-88 degrees West longitude


      Remember, when dealing with West longitudes, a smaller number means it''s further
      east (closer to the Prime Meridian).


      Since 86-88 is a smaller number than 105-108, Alger County, MI is located further
      east than Treasure County, MT.


      **Step 4: Answer the question.**

      The question is: "Is Treasure County, MT located east of Alger County, MI?"


      Based on our comparison, Treasure County, MT is located *west* of Alger County,
      MI.

      * Beaufort County is on the southern coast of South Carolina.

      * 99.5 degrees West is a larger westward longitude than 80.7 degrees West.

      * Custer County, OK is in the western half of Oklahoma. Its longitude is approximately

      **Step 2: Locate Caswell County, NC**

      * Caswell County, NC is in the northern part of North Carolina, close to the
      Virginia border. Its longitude is approximately -79.3 degrees West.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      * Custer County, OK: -99.0 degrees West

      * Caswell County, NC: -79.3 degrees West


      **Step 4: Determine which is "east"**

      * On a globe or map, longitudes become *less negative (closer to 0)* as you
      move east from the Prime Meridian.

      * -79.3 is a larger (less negative) number than -99.0.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since -79.3 (Caswell County, NC) is to the east of -99.0 (Custer County, OK),
      it means Custer County, OK is located **west** of Caswell County, NC.
