      3. **Compare the longitudes**: Since Isanti County is in Minnesota and Granite
      County is in Montana, we need to consider their relative longitudes. Montana
      is significantly to the west of Minnesota, meaning that Granite County will
      have a higher longitude (more negative) than Isanti County.


      4. **Determine east-west positioning**: Given that Granite County is in Montana
      and Isanti County is in Minnesota, Granite County cannot be east of Isanti County
      since it is located to the west.

      of both counties.


      1. **Locate Treasure County, MT**: Treasure County is situated in the eastern
      part of Montana. It is bordered by the state of Wyoming to the south and is
      relatively far from the eastern border of the state.


      2. **Locate Alger County, MI**: Alger County is located in the Upper Peninsula
      of Michigan, which is north of the state of Wisconsin and east of the state
      of Minnesota. It is near the Great Lakes, specifically Lake Superior.


      3. **Determine their relative positions**: To see if Treasure County is east
      of Alger County, we can visualize or check a map. Since Treasure County is in
      eastern Montana and Alger County is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, we can
      determine that:


      - **Montana is west of Michigan**: This means that any county in Montana, including
      Treasure County, is generally located to the west of counties in Michigan.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Treasure County is located in Montana (west) and
      Alger County is in Michigan (east), Treasure County cannot be east of Alger
      County.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'
