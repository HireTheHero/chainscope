      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Rockwall County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern central part of
      the United States.

      - Saluda County is in South Carolina (SC), which is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      the west.

      - South Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard, significantly east of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - States on the east coast (like South Carolina) are generally east of central
      states (like Texas).

      - Therefore, Saluda County, SC would be east of Rockwall County, TX.


      NO, Rockwall County, TX is not located east of Saluda County, SC. It is located

      than Nebraska.


      Step 3: Since counties within these states will generally follow the same relative
      positioning as their states:

      - Sarpy County, being in Nebraska, must be west of Guernsey County, which is
      in Ohio.

      - Generally, Georgia is east of Texas.


      Step 2: Let''s consider the specific counties within their states.

      - Winkler County is in Texas, which is in the western part of the country.

      - Brantley County is in Georgia, which is in the eastern part of the country.


      Step 3: Let me think about the geographic layout more precisely.

      - Even the easternmost counties of Texas would be west of the westernmost counties
      of Georgia.

      - This is because the entire state of Georgia lies east of Texas, with several
      states (like Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) between them.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the geographic positions.

      - Since Winkler County is in Texas, and Brantley County is in Georgia, and Georgia
      is entirely east of Texas, Winkler County must be west of Brantley County.

      - Therefore, Winkler County, TX is NOT east of Brantley County, GA. It is west
      of it.

      Texas is in the south-central United States, while Georgia is in the southeastern

      Cimarron County is in the Oklahoma Panhandle, at the westernmost tip of the
      state. Oklahoma itself is in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Let me identify where McCreary County, Kentucky is located.

      McCreary County is in southern Kentucky, near the Tennessee border. Kentucky
      is in the east-central part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      The United States is generally oriented with west on the left and east on the
      right when looking at a map. Oklahoma is significantly west of Kentucky in the
      country. Since Cimarron County is at the western edge of Oklahoma, and McCreary
      County is in Kentucky (an eastern state relative to Oklahoma), Cimarron County
      must be west of McCreary County.


      Step 4: Determine the answer to the specific question.

      The question asks if Cimarron County, OK is located east of McCreary County,
      KY. Since Cimarron County is west of McCreary County (not east), the answer
      is:

      - Maryland is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Maryland is significantly east of Missouri

      - States on the East Coast (like Maryland) are east of central states (like
      Missouri)


      Step 4: Since counties are contained within their respective states, a county
      in Missouri would be west of a county in Maryland.

      - Reynolds County, being in Missouri, must be west of Wicomico County, which
      is in Maryland

      - Therefore, Reynolds County is NOT east of Wicomico County

      - States on the west coast (like Oregon) have lower longitudes than central
      states (like South Dakota).


      Step 3: Make the east/west comparison.

      - "East of" means having a higher longitude (further to the right on a standard
      US map).

      - Since Lane County, OR is on the west coast and Haakon County, SD is in the
      central US, Lane County is west of (not east of) Haakon County.


      NO, Lane County, OR is not located east of Haakon County, SD. It is located

      - Lane County is in Oregon (OR), which is a state on the West Coast of the United
      States.

      - Haakon County is in South Dakota (SD), which is a state in the Midwest/Great
      Plains region.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the U.S. map.

      - Oregon is significantly west of South Dakota on the U.S. map.

      - All counties in Oregon would be west of all counties in South Dakota.


      Step 3: Compare their positions based on longitude.

      - Western states like Oregon have lower (more negative) longitude values than
      Midwestern states like South Dakota.

      - Lane County, OR would have a more western (lower) longitude than Haakon County,
      SD.


      Step 4: Determine if "east of" applies.

      - "East of" means having a higher longitude value.

      - Since Lane County has a lower longitude value than Haakon County, it is not
      east of Haakon County.


      NO, Lane County, OR is not located east of Haakon County, SD. It is located
