      1. First, let''s locate Treasure County, Montana

      - Treasure County is located in southeastern Montana

      - It''s in the eastern part of the state


      2. Next, let''s locate Alger County, Michigan

      - Alger County is located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan

      - It''s in the northeastern part of Michigan


      3. To compare their locations, we need to look at their relative positions on
      a map

      - Montana is west of Michigan

      - Southeastern Montana is even further west than Alger County, Michigan


      4. So if Treasure County is in southeastern Montana, and Alger County is in
      northeastern Michigan, Treasure County would definitely be west of Alger County


      5. The question asks: "Is Treasure County, MT located east of Alger County,
      MI?"

      - Based on our reasoning, the answer is NO, Treasure County is west of Alger
      County, not east
