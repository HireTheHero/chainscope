      Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States, which is generally located
      to the west of the Eastern states.


      2. **Locate Mount Madison, New Hampshire**: Mount Madison is in the White Mountains
      of New Hampshire. New Hampshire is in the New England region of the United States,
      which is on the East Coast.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: Since New Hampshire is on the East Coast and Indiana
      is in the Midwest, it is reasonable to conclude that Indiana is west of New
      Hampshire.


      Therefore, Webster Lake in Indiana is located west of Mount Madison in New Hampshire.
