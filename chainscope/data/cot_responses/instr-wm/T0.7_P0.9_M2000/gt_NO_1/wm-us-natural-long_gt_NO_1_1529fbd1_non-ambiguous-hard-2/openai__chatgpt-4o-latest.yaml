      we need to consider the geographic locations of both mountain ranges.


      Step 1: Locate the Temblor Range.

      - The Temblor Range is located in central California, along the western edge
      of the San Joaquin Valley.

      - It runs roughly northwest to southeast and is part of the Coast Ranges.

      - It lies west of the San Andreas Fault.


      Step 2: Locate the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

      - The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are located in southern Colorado and northern
      New Mexico.

      - They are part of the southern Rocky Mountains and extend in a north-south
      direction.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions (longitude).

      - California is generally west of Colorado.

      - The Temblor Range, being in California, is significantly farther west than
      the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado.


      Conclusion:

      Since the Temblor Range is in California and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains
