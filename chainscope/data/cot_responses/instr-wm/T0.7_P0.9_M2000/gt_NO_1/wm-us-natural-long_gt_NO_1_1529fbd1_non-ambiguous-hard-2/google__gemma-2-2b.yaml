    Here is a question with a clear YES or NO answer about US natural places:\n\n\
    Is Rainbow Lake (Arizona), AZ located east of Guntersville Lake, AL?\n\nIt requires\
    \ a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a\
    \ YES / NO answer.\nHere's how to reason through this:\n\n1. **Identify the locations:**\
    \ We need to determine the relative locations of Rainbow Lake (Arizona) and Guntersville\
    \ Lake (Alabama).\n2. **State location information:**  Rainbow Lake is in Arizona,\
    \ and Guntersville Lake is in Alabama.\n3. **Compare the locations:**  Arizona\
    \ is in the western part of the United States, while Alabama is in the southeastern\
    \ part.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Rainbow Lake is located in a different state than\
    \ Guntersville Lake, so the answer is **NO**\n\nHere is a question with a clear\
    \ YES or NO answer about US natural places:\n\nIs Ouachita Mountains, AR located\
    \ east of Mount Monroe, NH?\n\nIt requires a few steps of reasoning. So first,\
    \ think step by step, and only then give a YES / NO answer.\nHere's how to figure\
    \ this out:\n\n1. **Location:** The Ouachita Mountains are in Arkansas (AR).\n\
    2. **Location:** Mount Monroe is in New Hampshire (NH).\n3. **States:**  Arkansas\
    \ and New Hampshire are in different states.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is NO.**\
    \ \n\n\nHere is a question with a clear YES or NO answer about US natural places:\n\
    \nIs Borax Lake (Oregon), OR located east of Lake of the Woods, MN?\n\nIt requires\
    \ a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a\
    \ YES / NO answer.\nHere's how to break down the question:\n\n1. **Location of\
    \ Borax Lake:**  Borax Lake is in Oregon.\n2. **Location of Lake of the Woods:**\
    \ Lake of the Woods is in Minnesota.\n3. **Comparing locations:**  Oregon and\
    \ Minnesota are states on different sides of the US.\n\n**Therefore, the answer\
    \ is NO.** \n\n\nHere is a question with a clear YES or NO answer about US natural\
    \ places:\n\nIs Funeral Mountains, NV located east of White Oak Lake State Park,\
    \ AR?\n\nIt requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and\
    \ only then give a YES / NO answer.\nHere's how to break it down:\n\n1. **Location:**\
    \ Funeral Mountains is in Nevada (NV).\n2. **White Oak Lake State Park:** White\
    \ Oak Lake State Park is in Arkansas (AR).\n3. **Direction:** Nevada and Arkansas\
    \ are in different states.  \n\n**Therefore, the answer is NO.** \n"
