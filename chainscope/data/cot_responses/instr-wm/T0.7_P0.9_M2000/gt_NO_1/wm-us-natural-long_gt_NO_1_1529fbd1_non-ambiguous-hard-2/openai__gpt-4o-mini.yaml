      steps:


      1. **Locate Rattlesnake Lake**: Rattlesnake Lake is situated in Washington state,

      2. **Locate Mummy Range**: The Mummy Range is located in Colorado, specifically

      3. **Determine Relative Position**: To ascertain whether Rattlesnake Lake is
      east of the Mummy Range, we need to compare their longitudes. Washington is
      to the northwest of Colorado, meaning that Rattlesnake Lake is generally west
      of the Mummy Range.

      Now, to determine if Boundary Bay is east of the Magdalena Mountains, we check

      - Since Boundary Bay is in the northwest and the Magdalena Mountains are in
      the southwest, Boundary Bay is actually to the northwest of the Magdalena Mountains
