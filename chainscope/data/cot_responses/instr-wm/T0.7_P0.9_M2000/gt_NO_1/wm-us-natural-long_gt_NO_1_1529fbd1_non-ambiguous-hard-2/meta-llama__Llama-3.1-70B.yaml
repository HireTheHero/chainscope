      2. **Understand Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to understand the general
      geography of the United States. Oregon is located in the western part of the
      United States, while Minnesota is located in the northern part.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Since Oregon (where Borax Lake is located) is west
      of Minnesota (where Lake of the Woods is located), we can deduce that Borax
      Lake is not east of Lake of the Woods.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Borax Lake (Oregon), OR is located
      east of Lake of the Woods, MN is: **NO**'

      located in Wyoming (WY), which is in the western part of the United States.


      2. **Understand the general geography**: Washington is located in the Pacific
      Northwest region, while Wyoming is located in the Mountain West region.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given the general geography, Washington is located
