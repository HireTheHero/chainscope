      States. New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern
      United States.

      4.  **Compare Longitudes:** Geographically, the entire state of Indiana is located

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to compare the positions of Barbee Lake,
      IN, and Mount Clay, NH.

      2.  **Locate the states:** Barbee Lake is in Indiana (IN). Mount Clay is in
      New Hampshire (NH).

      1.  **Identify the first location:** Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming), WY. This
      is in the state of Wyoming.

      2.  **Identify the second location:** Misquah Hills, MN. This is in the state
      of Minnesota.

      3.  **Determine the relative location of the states:** Compare the geographical
      location of Wyoming (WY) and Minnesota (MN) within the United States. Wyoming
      is a western state, while Minnesota is a midwestern state.

      4.  **Establish East/West relationship:** Looking at a map of the US, Minnesota
      is located significantly east of Wyoming.

      5.  **Apply to the specific features:** Since the Misquah Hills are in Minnesota
      and the Sierra Madre Range is in Wyoming, the Misquah Hills (MN) are east of
      the Sierra Madre Range (WY).

      6.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if the Sierra Madre Range (WY)

      3.  **Compare the states:** Nevada (NV) is a state in the Western United States.
      Texas (TX) is a state in the South Central United States.

      4.  **Determine relative longitude:** Geographically, Nevada is significantly
      west of Texas.

      5.  **Apply to specific locations:** Therefore, the Grapevine Mountains in Nevada
      must be west of Joe Pool Lake in Texas.

      6.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if the Grapevine Mountains are
      *east* of Joe Pool Lake. Since they are west, the answer is no.


      NO'

      1.  **Identify Location 1:** Grapevine Mountains, NV. These mountains are located
      on the border of Nevada and California, within Death Valley National Park.

      2.  **Identify Location 2:** Joe Pool Lake, TX. This lake is located in the
      Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex area in Texas.

      3.  **Determine Relative Positions:** Nevada (and the California border area
      where the mountains are) is geographically west of Texas.

      4.  **Compare East/West:** Since Nevada is west of Texas, the Grapevine Mountains
      are west of Joe Pool Lake.

      5.  **Answer the Question:** The question asks if the Grapevine Mountains are
      *east* of Joe Pool Lake. This is the opposite of their actual relative position.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'
