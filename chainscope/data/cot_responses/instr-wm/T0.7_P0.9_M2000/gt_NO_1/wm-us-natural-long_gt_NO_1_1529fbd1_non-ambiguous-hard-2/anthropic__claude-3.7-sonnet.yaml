      Henry Hagg Lake is located in Washington County, Oregon, in the northwestern\
      \ part of the state. Oregon is on the west coast of the United States, and locations\
      \ in Oregon generally have longitudes around 120-124\xB0W.\n\nStep 2: Let me\
      \ identify the approximate longitude of Christmas Mountains, TX.\nChristmas\
      \ Mountains are located in west Texas, near Big Bend National Park. Texas extends\
      \ from roughly 93\xB0W to 106\xB0W longitude, and the western part of Texas\
      \ where these mountains are located would be closer to 103-105\xB0W.\n\nStep\
      \ 3: Compare the longitudes.\nSince Henry Hagg Lake is in western Oregon (approximately\
      \ 123\xB0W), and Christmas Mountains are in western Texas (approximately 103\xB0\
      W), Henry Hagg Lake is further west (has a higher western longitude number)\
      \ than Christmas Mountains.\n\nStep 4: Determine east-west relationship.\nPlaces\
      \ with higher western longitude numbers are further west. Since Henry Hagg Lake\
      \ has a higher western longitude (around 123\xB0W) than Christmas Mountains\
      \ (around 103\xB0W), Henry Hagg Lake is west of Christmas Mountains, not east.\n\
      \nNO, Henry Hagg Lake, OR is not located east of Christmas Mountains, TX. It\
      \ is located west of them."

      Lake (Michigan), MI?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. Marston Lake is in Colorado (CO), which is in the western part of the United
      States.

      2. Gun Lake is in Michigan (MI), which is in the eastern/midwestern part of
      the United States.

      3. When comparing east-west positions in the US, we need to consider longitude
      (east-west coordinates).

      4. States further east have higher longitude values (less negative or higher
      positive numbers).

      5. Colorado is significantly west of Michigan.

      6. Therefore, any lake in Colorado would be west of a lake in Michigan.

      7. Since Marston Lake is in Colorado, it must be west of Gun Lake in Michigan.

      8. If Marston Lake is west of Gun Lake, then it cannot be east of Gun Lake.

      - Nevada is located in the western part of the continental US.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central part of the continental US, much
      further east than Nevada.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the continental US, you would encounter Nevada
      before Arkansas.

      - This means Nevada (and anything in it) is west of Arkansas (and anything in
      it).

      - Therefore, Funeral Mountains in Nevada must be west of White Oak Lake State
      Park in Arkansas, not east of it.


      NO, Funeral Mountains, NV is not located east of White Oak Lake State Park,
      AR. It is located west of it.'

      - White Oak Lake State Park is in Arkansas (AR), which is in the south-central
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general west-to-east arrangement of these states.

      - Nevada is located in the western part of the United States, bordering California.

      - Arkansas is located much further east, in the south-central region of the
      United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter Nevada
      well before reaching Arkansas.

      - Therefore, Nevada (where Funeral Mountains is located) is west of Arkansas
      (where White Oak Lake State Park is located).


      Step 4: Answer the specific question.

      - If Nevada is west of Arkansas, then Funeral Mountains (in Nevada) must be

      Step 1: Consider the general geographic locations of Georgia and Maine within
      the United States.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Maine is located in the northeastern United States, at the easternmost point
      of the contiguous US.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positions.

      - States along the eastern seaboard generally follow the coastline, which runs
      northeast to southwest.

      - Maine is the northeasternmost state in the contiguous US.

      - Georgia is significantly further south and somewhat further west than Maine.


      Step 3: Consider the longitudes.

      - Places in Maine will generally have more easterly longitudes (smaller negative
      numbers) than places in Georgia.

      - Pushaw Lake in Maine would be further east (closer to the Atlantic Ocean)
      than Jackson Lake in Georgia.


      Therefore, Jackson Lake in Georgia would be WEST of Pushaw Lake in Maine, not
      east of it.
