      east of 10598, NY.


      Step 1: Let me identify where these zip codes are located.

      - 44627 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 10598 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Ohio and New York.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - New York is generally located to the east of Ohio

      - When comparing states on the east coast (like NY) with Midwest states (like
      OH), the east coast states are further east


      Step 4: Since 10598 is in New York and 44627 is in Ohio, and New York is east
      of Ohio, then 44627, OH must be west of 10598, NY (not east of it).

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Ohio and New York.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Ohio is located in the midwestern United States, west of New York


      Step 3: In the United States, eastern locations are generally further east in
      longitude than western locations.

      - Since Ohio is west of New York, zip codes in Ohio would generally be west
      of zip codes in New York

      - This means 44627, OH would be west of 10598, NY, not east of it


      Step 4: Verify if there could be any exceptions based on the specific zip codes.

      - Even considering the specific locations within each state, Ohio is entirely
      west of New York, so no Ohio zip code would be east of a New York zip code


      Therefore, 44627, OH is not located east of 10598, NY.

      - 12010 is in Amsterdam, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a map.

      - Illinois is west of New York

      - Therefore, any location in Illinois would be west of any location in New York


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 60087 (Waukegan, IL) is in Illinois, and 12010 (Amsterdam, NY) is in
      New York, the Illinois location must be west of the New York location.

      - If 60087 is west of 12010, then 60087 cannot be east of 12010.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 44116 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      - 18037 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Ohio is generally located west of Pennsylvania in the United States

      - Pennsylvania borders Ohio to the east

      - This means that locations in Ohio are typically west of locations in Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      part of Ohio

      - 18037 appears to be in eastern Pennsylvania

      - Even though 44116 is in northeastern Ohio, Pennsylvania is still east of Ohio


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, a zip code in Ohio (44116) would be west
      of a zip code in Pennsylvania (18037)

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 28403 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      North Carolina and South Carolina are both on the East Coast of the United States,
      with North Carolina directly north of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow geographic patterns. The
      first digit indicates a broad region (2 is for the mid-Atlantic region including
      both NC and SC).

      The first three digits (293 vs 284) typically indicate more specific areas within
      those states.


      Step 4: Compare the relative positions.

      North Carolina zip codes starting with 284 are typically in the southeastern
      part of NC (Wilmington area).

      South Carolina zip codes starting with 293 are typically in the northwestern
      part of SC (Spartanburg area).

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 28403 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between North Carolina
      and South Carolina.

      - North Carolina and South Carolina are both on the East Coast of the US.

      - South Carolina is located south of North Carolina.

      - The coastlines of both states run roughly northeast to southwest.


      Step 3: Consider zip code numbering patterns.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west.

      - Lower zip code numbers tend to be in the eastern parts of the country.

      - 28403 (NC) has a lower number than 29388 (SC).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since 29388 has a higher zip code number than 28403, it suggests 29388 is
      likely west of 28403.

      - Additionally, while SC is south of NC, the specific locations within each
      state matter.

      - The zip code 28403 is likely in eastern NC (possibly near the coast), while
      29388 is likely in western SC.

      Carolina (SC).

      - South Carolina is generally south of North Carolina.

      - On the east coast, being "east" typically means being closer to the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Step 2: Let me think about the numbering system of zip codes.

      - In the eastern United States, lower zip code numbers are generally assigned
      to areas further north and east.

      - Higher zip code numbers tend to be further south and west.


      Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 29388 (SC) has a higher first digit than 28403 (NC): 29xxx vs 28xxx

      with lower numbers in the western part)

      - 11783 is in Long Island, NY (zip codes starting with 11 are typically in the

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 15690 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 11783 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Understand US zip code patterns.

      - The first digit in a zip code generally indicates geographic region

      - Lower first digits tend to be in the eastern US

      - Higher first digits tend to be in the western and central US


      Step 3: Compare the first digits.

      - 15690 starts with "1"

      - 11783 starts with "1"

      - Both being in the "1" region suggests they''re both in the eastern US


      Step 4: Look more closely at the second digit.

      - 15690 has "5" as second digit

      - 11783 has "1" as second digit

      - Within the same first-digit region, higher second digits typically indicate
      locations further west


      Step 5: Consider the geographic relationship between PA and NY.

      - Pennsylvania is generally west and south of New York

      - Given both zip codes are in the eastern part of their respective states (based
      on the "1" first digit), the general state relationship likely applies

      - 15690 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 11783 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Understand US zip code geography.

      - In the US zip code system, codes generally increase from east to west.

      - Lower zip codes are typically in the eastern parts of the country.

      - The first digit indicates the general region (1 = Northeast region).


      Step 3: Compare the zip codes.

      - Both start with "1" so they''re both in the Northeast region.

      - 11783 has a lower number than 15690.

      - Since lower numbers are generally more eastern, 11783 (NY) is likely east
      of 15690 (PA).


      Step 4: Verify with state geography.

      - New York is generally east of Pennsylvania, especially when considering areas
      with these zip codes.

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between PA and NJ.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is located inland, west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - Zip codes starting with "07" are in northern New Jersey

      - Zip codes starting with "15" are in western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area)


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Western Pennsylvania is clearly west of northern New Jersey

      - For a location in PA to be east of a location in NJ would be geographically
      unusual, as PA is generally west of NJ


      Step 5: Make a conclusion based on the geographic positions.

      Since 15139 (PA) is in western Pennsylvania, and 07432 (NJ) is in northern New
      Jersey, and Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, the PA location must be west
      of the NJ location, not east.

      - 29072 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - South Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on the map.

      - Arkansas is west of the Mississippi River

      - South Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas, bordering the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      - When comparing locations in the continental US, places further east have higher
      longitude values (less negative or more positive)

      - South Carolina is much further east than Arkansas


      Therefore, 72023, AR is NOT east of 29072, SC. In fact, it''s the opposite -

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Ohio is inland, west of New Jersey

      - States on the East Coast (like NJ) are generally east of Midwestern states
      (like OH)


      Step 4: Determine the direction.

      - Moving from Ohio to New Jersey would be traveling eastward

      - Moving from New Jersey to Ohio would be traveling westward

      - Therefore, New Jersey is east of Ohio


      Since 44012, OH is in Ohio and 07092, NJ is in New Jersey, and New Jersey is
      east of Ohio, the zip code 07092, NJ must be east of 44012, OH.

    bb6e0b32-246c-4115-99da-c81e3fbbe66d: '# Is 44012, OH located east of 07092, NJ?


      To solve this problem, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) 44012 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      2) 07092 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      3) Geographically, New Jersey is located on the eastern coast of the United
      States

      4) Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New Jersey

      5) All of New Jersey is east of all of Ohio on a map of the United States

      6) Therefore, any location in Ohio (including 44012) would be west of any location
      in New Jersey (including 07092)

      7) If 44012, OH is west of 07092, NJ, then 07092, NJ is east of 44012, OH


      ## Answer:

      NO (44012, OH is not located east of 07092, NJ - it''s located west of it)'

      would suggest that the Texas zip code is west of the Louisiana zip code.


      3. For a Texas location to be east of a Louisiana location, it would need to
      be in the easternmost part of Texas while the Louisiana location would need
      to be in the westernmost part of Louisiana, AND the Texas location would need
      to extend further east than the Louisiana location.


      4. However, this is not the case with these specific zip codes. 77388 is in

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 18218 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 06379 is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Understand the geographic relationship between these states.

      Connecticut is located in New England, in the northeastern United States.

      Pennsylvania is located southwest of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Determine the directional relationship.

      If Pennsylvania is southwest of Connecticut, then Connecticut is northeast of
      Pennsylvania.

      This means Connecticut is both north and east of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 18218, PA is in Pennsylvania and 06379, CT is in Connecticut, the general
      geographic relationship between the states applies to these zip codes.


      Therefore, 18218, PA is NOT east of 06379, CT. In fact, it''s the opposite -
      06379, CT is east of 18218, PA.

      - 17970 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 06250 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Consider the relative geographic positions of Pennsylvania and Connecticut.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States

      Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States, while Pennsylvania

      Step 3: Consider the directional relationship.

      When we say "east of," we''re asking if 17970, PA is positioned to the east
      of 06250, CT. Since Pennsylvania as a state is west of Connecticut, it''s unlikely
      that a Pennsylvania zip code would be east of a Connecticut zip code.


      Step 4: To be thorough, I should note that zip codes near state borders could
      potentially create exceptions to the general state positioning, but these states
      don''t share a border, and the zip codes aren''t in unusual locations that would

      - 70444 is in Louisiana, which is entirely east of Texas


      Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on relative positions.

      - Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these specific zip codes follow the
      standard geographical distribution, 79762 (TX) must be west of 70444 (LA), not
      east of it.

      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - The "79" prefix in 79762 suggests it''s in western Texas (zip codes generally
      increase from east to west).

      - The "70" prefix in 70444 suggests it''s in eastern Louisiana.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and 79762 is in Texas while 70444 is in
      Louisiana, the zip code 79762 cannot be east of 70444.

      - Rather, 79762 (TX) is west of 70444 (LA).

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative geographic positions. In the United

      - North Carolina (NC) is directly north of South Carolina (SC)

      - On the East Coast, lower zip codes are generally further north than higher
      zip codes


      Step 3: Comparing the zip codes:

      - 29067 (SC) has a higher number than 28512 (NC)

      - This suggests 29067 is further south


      Step 4: Regarding east-west positioning:

      - Both states are on the East Coast

      - South Carolina is generally positioned slightly east of North Carolina due
      to the coastline''s angle

      - Without specific city information, I can rely on the general geographic relationship
      between the states


      Based on the typical geographic arrangement of these states, where South Carolina
      tends to be southeast of North Carolina, and considering the zip code pattern,

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - North Carolina and South Carolina are neighboring states

      - South Carolina is generally south of North Carolina

      - The coastlines of both states run roughly northeast to southwest


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west

      - Lower zip codes in this region (starting with 28xxx) are typically more eastern
      than higher zip codes (starting with 29xxx)

      - 28512 (NC) has a lower number than 29067 (SC)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these patterns.

      Since 28512 has a lower zip code number than 29067, and given the general pattern

      if 29067, SC is east of 28512, NC.


      Step 1: Let me identify the geographic relationship between South Carolina (SC)
      and North Carolina (NC).

      South Carolina is generally south of North Carolina, with both states sharing
      a border. When looking at the Atlantic coast, South Carolina is south and slightly
      east of North Carolina.


      Step 2: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow geographic patterns. Lower
      numbers tend to be in the eastern parts of the country, while higher numbers
      are more western.


      Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes.

      29067 (SC) has a higher first digit than 28512 (NC). The first digits (2 in
      both cases) indicate they''re in the same general eastern region. The second
      digits (9 vs 8) suggest that 29067 is likely south and potentially slightly
      west of 28512.


      Step 4: Check the actual locations.

      29067 is in South Carolina, while 28512 is in North Carolina. Based on zip code
      patterns, 29067 would be south of 28512. However, to determine east/west positioning,
      we need to consider that 29067 (SC) is likely in the interior of South Carolina,
      while 28512 (NC) is likely closer to the coast in North Carolina.


      Given that North Carolina''s eastern coastline extends further east than South
      Carolina''s, and the zip code patterns suggest 28512 is in eastern NC while
      29067 is more central SC, 28512 NC is likely further east.

      - 29067 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      South Carolina is generally located south of North Carolina. However, the question
      asks about east-west positioning, not north-south.


      Step 3: Consider the numbering system of zip codes.

      In the eastern United States, zip codes generally increase as you move south
      and west. Lower numbers tend to be in the northeast, with higher numbers in
      the southwest.


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      But looking at the second digit: 9 vs 8

      The second digit of the SC zip code (9) is higher than the NC zip code (8)


      Since zip codes in this region generally increase as you move west, and 29067

      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbering system.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow patterns where codes in

      Step 4: Compare the zip codes.

      - 29067 (SC) starts with 290xx

      - 28512 (NC) starts with 285xx

      The 290xx series is generally south/east of the 285xx series.


      Step 5: Consider the state boundaries.

      Since South Carolina is generally south and slightly east of North Carolina,

      Missouri to the east of Kansas)


      Step 3: Since 67218 is in Kansas and 63670 is in Missouri, and Missouri is east
      of Kansas, it''s very likely that the zip code in Kansas is west of the zip
      code in Missouri, not east.


      Step 4: To be thorough, I should consider that zip codes near state borders
      could potentially break this pattern, but the zip codes given (67218 and 63670)

      side.


      Step 2: Generally, zip codes in the US increase as you go from east to west.
      Lower zip codes tend to be in the eastern parts of the country, while higher

      in Pennsylvania is located east of the zip code 07871 in New Jersey.


      Step 1: Let me think about the general geographic relationship between Pennsylvania
      (PA) and New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the
      United States, while Pennsylvania is located to the west of New Jersey.


      Step 2: Looking at the zip code patterns, the first digit of a zip code generally
      indicates the region, moving from east to west across the United States. Lower
      first digits (0, 1) are typically in the eastern part of the country, while
      higher first digits (8, 9) are in the western part.


      Step 3: The zip code 07871 (NJ) starts with "0", which corresponds to the northeastern
      region including New Jersey.


      Step 4: The zip code 15057 (PA) starts with "1", which corresponds to areas
      including Pennsylvania.


      Step 5: Since the zip code 15057 is in Pennsylvania, which is west of New Jersey,
      and 07871 is in New Jersey, the Pennsylvania location must be west of the New

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 15057 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 07871 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - The first digit in US zip codes generally indicates geographic region, with

      - 0xxxx zip codes are in the easternmost region (including NJ)

      - 1xxxx zip codes are in the next region westward (including PA)


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since 07871 is in New Jersey, which is east of Pennsylvania, and 15057 is
      in Pennsylvania, which is west of New Jersey, the PA location must be west of
      the NJ location.

      - If 15057, PA is west of 07871, NJ, then 07871, NJ is east of 15057, PA.

      - Therefore, 15057, PA is NOT east of 07871, NJ.

      - 42431 is a zip code in Kentucky (KY)

      - 24201 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states

      Kentucky is generally west of Virginia in the United States. Virginia is on

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 73025 is a ZIP code in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 72114 is a ZIP code in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Oklahoma is located west of Arkansas in the United States.

      - Arkansas borders Oklahoma''s eastern side.


      Step 3: Analyze ZIP code patterns.

      - ZIP codes generally increase as you move from east to west in the US.

      - 73025 (Oklahoma) has a higher number than 72114 (Arkansas).

      - This suggests 73025 is likely west of 72114, not east.


      Step 4: Confirm with state positions.

      - Since Oklahoma is positioned west of Arkansas, and these ZIP codes follow
      the standard pattern, 73025 in Oklahoma would be west of 72114 in Arkansas.

      if 76114, TX is east of 31210, GA.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 76114 is a ZIP code in Texas (TX)

      - 31210 is a ZIP code in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - On a US map, Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas


      Step 3: More specifically, US ZIP codes generally follow a pattern where:

      - Lower numbers in the first digit tend to be in the eastern US

      - Higher numbers in the first digit tend to be in the western US

      - The "7" in 76114 indicates a more western location than the "3" in 31210


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Texas is west of Georgia, and the ZIP code patterns confirm this (7xxxx
      vs 3xxxx), 76114 in Texas must be west of 31210 in Georgia.

      - If 76114 is west of 31210, then it cannot be east of it.
