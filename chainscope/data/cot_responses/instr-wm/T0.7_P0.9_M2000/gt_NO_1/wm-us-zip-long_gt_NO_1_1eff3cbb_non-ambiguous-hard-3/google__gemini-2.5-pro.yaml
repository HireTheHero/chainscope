      \nMy initial assessment indicates the core inquiry is geographical, specifically\
      \ comparing the east-west positions of two US zip codes. I've begun to pinpoint\
      \ the required data - geographical coordinates are essential. The next step\
      \ involves determining how to efficiently and accurately obtain these coordinates.\n\
      \n\n**Calculating Relative Positions**\n\nI've successfully pinpointed the geographical\
      \ coordinates (specifically, the longitudes) for the two zip codes in question.\
      \ I've found Gnadenhutten, OH (44627) to be at approximately 81.43\xB0 W and\
      \ Yorktown Heights, NY (10598) to be at approximately 73.78\xB0 W. Now, it's\
      \ a matter of comparing these values to determine the relative east-west positions.\
      \ A more negative (lesser) longitude means more westerly. Therefore, since 81.43\
      \ > 73.78, Gnadenhutten is, in fact, located West of Yorktown.\n\n\n**Clarifying\
      \ Geographical Relationships**\n\nI'm now solidifying my reasoning, going step-by-step\
      \ to be extra clear. I've broken down the problem into location identification,\
      \ data retrieval (longitudes), and direct comparison. I've concluded that Gnadenhutten\
      \ (44627) is west of Yorktown Heights (10598), and I'm crafting the response\
      \ accordingly. I'm focusing on ensuring each step is easy to follow and the\
      \ logic is transparent.\n\n\n**Formulating a Concise Response**\n\nI've completed\
      \ the data retrieval and comparison. Now, I'm focusing on crafting a clear,\
      \ step-by-step response for the user, ensuring the logic is readily understood.\
      \ I've considered the optimal phrasing to make the geographical relationship\
      \ between the zip codes transparent, and I'll deliver a definitive 'No' answer,\
      \ supported by the calculated longitudes and reasoning.\n\n\n</think>Here is\

      \ Ohio.\n3.  The zip code 10598 is for Yorktown Heights, New York.\n4.  To determine\
      \ which location is further east, we compare their longitudes. In the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, a smaller longitude value means a location is further east.\n\
      5.  Gnadenhutten, OH is at approximately 81.4\xB0 West longitude.\n6.  Yorktown\
      \ Heights, NY is at approximately 73.8\xB0 West longitude.\n7.  Since 73.8 is\
      \ a smaller number than 81.4, Yorktown Heights, NY is east of Gnadenhutten,\
      \ OH. Therefore, 44627, OH is located west of 10598, NY.\n\nNO"

      \ **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 10598 is the zip code for\

      I''m focusing on the user''s need to determine the relative geographic position
      of two zip codes. My current thinking revolves around deconstructing this question
      to identify the required facts. I''ve begun to recognize the core challenge:
      understanding what geographic data is needed to compare the locations of these
      two distinct zip codes. I''m moving toward pinpointing what data I''ll need
      to use to make a solid comparison.



      **Determining Geographic Relationships**


      I''ve made headway in understanding the user''s question, breaking it down into
      manageable steps. Now, I''m defining the geographic information needed for comparison,
      focusing on longitude to determine "east of." I''ve located the states for both
      zip codes: Michigan (MI) and New Hampshire (NH). The goal is to compare their
      longitude, now. The map shows NH clearly east of MI.



      **Refining the Response Structure**


      I''ve worked to refine the structure of my response, ensuring a clear and concise
      presentation. The logic steps have been organized to guide a user. I''ll provide
      an easily understood answer at the end. I''m now certain of the final answer.
      Michigan is west of New Hampshire, therefore 49337 is not east of 03303. I can
      now proceed to compose the final message in the requested format.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, identify the location of zip code 49337, MI. This zip code is in
      Michigan.

      2.  Next, identify the location of zip code 03303, NH. This zip code is in New
      Hampshire.

      3.  Finally, compare the geographical locations of these two states. New Hampshire
      is in the New England region on the East Coast of the United States. Michigan
      is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.

      4.  On a map of the United States, Michigan is located to the west of New Hampshire.


      Therefore, 49337, MI is **not** east of 03303, NH.

      My focus is on understanding the geographical relationship between two US zip
      codes. I''ve pinpointed the key question: determining if zip code 49337 is east
      of 03303. The answer needs to be a straightforward YES or NO. My goal now is
      to map out the best approach to figure this out.



      **Mapping the Geographical Focus**


      I''m now zeroing in on the geographical coordinates for both zip codes. I''ve
      confirmed 49337 is in Moline, Michigan, and 03303 is in Concord, New Hampshire.
      It''s clear that Michigan is in the Midwest, and New Hampshire is on the East
      Coast. My next step is to obtain precise longitudes to definitively answer the
      user''s question, and will involve pulling coordinate data from a reliable source.



      **Formulating a Definitive Answer**


      My approach is now structured: I''ve confirmed zip code 49337 is in Moline,
      Michigan, and 03303 is in Concord, New Hampshire. Michigan is in the Midwest,
      and New Hampshire is on the East Coast. My current step involves pinpointing
      longitudes for each to ascertain the exact eastern position. I plan to use these
      coordinates to definitively provide the required YES or NO answer, confirming
      if 49337 is east of 03303.



      **Formulating the Definitive Answer**


      My thought process is progressing methodically. I''ve pinpointed the location
      of both zip codes and determined their relationship geographically. The next
      step, comparing longitudes, confirms New Hampshire''s eastern position. This
      will allow me to provide a definite YES/NO answer that is both accurate and
      justifiable based on the evidence.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of the first zip code:** 49337 is a US zip code
      for Moline, Michigan.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 03303 is a US zip code
      for Concord, New Hampshire.

      3.  **Compare the states:** New Hampshire is a state in the New England region
      on the East Coast of the United States. Michigan is a state in the Midwestern
      United States.

      4.  **Determine relative position:** On a map of the United States, the entire
      state of Michigan is located to the west of the entire state of New Hampshire.
      Therefore, 49337, MI is west of 03303, NH.

      PA, west of New Jersey. Harrington Park, NJ, is in northeastern NJ, near NYC.
      Since PA is west of NJ, 17202 is west of 07640. The answer will be "NO". The
      reasoning for this involved two primary geographical lookups to determine the
      positions.



      **Revising the Geographical Conclusion**


      I''ve made a crucial correction to my previous geographical comparison. The
      earlier assessment mistakenly concluded that the question''s premise was incorrect.
      I''ve re-evaluated my analysis. I now see that Chambersburg, PA (17202) is indeed
      west of Harrington Park, NJ (07640). This means the answer is "NO," 17202 is
      not east of 07640.



      **Synthesizing the Reasoning**

      now I''m considering presenting the geographical data to give context to the
      solution. The core challenge is making sure the method is clear and appropriate.



      **Evaluating Geographical Data**


      I''ve determined Indianapolis, IN (46222) and Marmora, NJ (08221). Having identified
      the locations, I can compare them. Indiana is west of New Jersey. The next step
      is to formulate the "NO" answer. This requires an understanding of how to definitively
      express east-west relationships.



      **Determining the Logical Response**


      I''ve finalized my reasoning and confirmed the geographical relationship.  My
      final answer is "NO,"  as the Indiana zip code is west of the New Jersey zip
      code. I considered providing a brief explanation, but the simple answer is sufficient
      given the context.



      **Finalizing Response Delivery**


      I''ve crafted a comprehensive "NO" answer, incorporating all the research steps.
      The goal now is to refine the presentation for clarity and conciseness, given
      the user''s expertise. I aim to deliver a definitive "NO" and potentially a
      brief, explanatory summary, should that be needed. I feel confident in my geographic
      reasoning.

      15690 (PA) and 11783 (NY), indicates that they are both within the Northeastern
      United States. However, the initial method alone does not give sufficient information
      to determine which zip code is located more east. The specific cities or regions
      associated with these zip codes, in relation to longitude, will be crucial.



      **Comparing Eastward Positioning**


      I''ve successfully identified the specific locations represented by the zip
      codes: 15690 corresponds to Vandergrift, PA, while 11783 represents Smithtown,
      NY.  My current focus is on comparing their eastward positioning.  I''ve cross-referenced
      each location against a geographical map.  Vandergrift lies within Western Pennsylvania,
      while Smithtown is located on Long Island, New York. Given this comparison,
      I can conclude the zip code in NY is located significantly east of the PA zip
      code.

      I''ve zeroed in on the core question: Is zip code 15690, PA east of 11783, NY?
      I''m now deconstructing the input, focusing on the zip codes themselves as a
      starting point. Zip code 1.



      **Assessing Zip Code Locations**


      I''ve successfully identified the two zip codes and their corresponding locations:
      15690, Vandergrift, PA, and 11783, Sayville, NY. I''m focusing on their geographic
      placement now, specifically their longitude. The Pennsylvania location is in
      Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, while the New York location is on Long
      Island, which is far east.




      **Formulating a Response**


      I''m now putting together the final answer and rationale, having confirmed the
      locations of both zip codes. I''ve broken down the steps clearly, ensuring I
      address the spatial relationship between Vandergrift, PA, and Sayville, NY.
      I''m focusing on providing a logical, step-by-step argument.



      **Concluding the Spatial Analysis**


      I''ve finalized my reasoning and confirmed the answer. I''ve located the two
      zip codes: Vandergrift, PA, and Sayville, NY. Their positions are clear. I concluded
      that, based on their relative longitudinal positions, Vandergrift, PA (15690)
      is west of Sayville, NY (11783), confirming a ''NO'' answer to the initial question.
      All steps and the final answer have been verified.



      **Synthesizing the Spatial Analysis**


      The task has been distilled: Determine the relative easternmost position of
      two US zip codes. I''ve broken down the steps and identified the cities. Now,
      I''m working to consolidate all the information into a single, cohesive response.
      My focus is on synthesizing the findings and generating the final "yes" or "no"
      answer, ensuring each step is clearly articulated and easily understood.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the geographical location associated with the
      zip code 15690, PA. This zip code corresponds to Vandergrift, Pennsylvania,
      which is located in the western part of the state, near Pittsburgh.


      2.  Next, we identify the location for 11783, NY. This zip code corresponds
      to Sayville, New York, which is located on the south shore of Long Island.


      3.  Finally, we compare these two locations on a map. Long Island, NY, is on
      the Atlantic coast, which is significantly farther east than Western Pennsylvania.
      Therefore, 15690, PA is located well to the west of 11783, NY.

      I''m zeroing in on the core question: figuring out if the user''s two zip codes
      are east or west of each other geographically. Right now, I''ve just started
      deconstructing the inputs: 15690.



      **Assessing Geographic Proximity**


      I''ve located Vandergrift, PA (15690), situated near Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania.
      Now, I''m focusing on the second zip code, 11783, to determine its location.
      I''m aiming to visualize the relative positions of these two locales. Once I
      have both locations, I can compare their positions on a general east-west plane
      to assess which is more eastward.



      **Determining Eastward Placement**


      I''ve located both zip codes: Vandergrift, PA (15690) and Ronkonkoma, NY (11783).
      My mental map places Ronkonkoma significantly east of Vandergrift. I''ve now
      determined that Ronkonkoma, not Vandergrift, is more eastward. Therefore, 15690,
      PA is *not* east of 11783, NY. I''m confident in my conclusion.



      **Analyzing the Spatial Relationship**


      I''m now fully confident in my final determination. After locating both zip
      codes and comparing them, I''ve confirmed that Vandergrift, PA, is west of Ronkonkoma,
      NY. My evaluation aligns precisely with the user''s initial inquiry, definitively
      concluding that the statement "15690 is east of 11783" is false.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of zip code 15690.** This zip code is for Vandergrift,

      2.  **Identify the location of zip code 11783.** This zip code is for Ronkonkoma,
      New York, which is located on Long Island, in the eastern part of the state.

      3.  **Compare the two locations.** Western Pennsylvania is geographically west
      of Long Island, New York. Therefore, Vandergrift, PA is west of Ronkonkoma,
      NY.

      the user''s question into manageable parts. I need to pinpoint the geographic
      locations tied to each ZIP code. Pennsylvania (PA) and New York (NY) are significant
      in this. Next, I''ll devise a method to determine the relative east-west positioning
      of these points.



      **Refining the Reasoning**


      I''ve now broken down the task into atomic steps. Identifying the precise cities
      linked to each ZIP code is key. I''ve located Vandergrift, PA, and Selden, NY.
      Then, I will work on the relative positioning: Long Island versus Western Pennsylvania.
      Finally, I''ll construct a logical response.



      **Analyzing the Question''s Structure**


      I''m now dissecting the user''s prompt into distinct, actionable components.
      My focus is on defining the core query and isolating its key elements: ZIP codes
      and the spatial relation in question. I have formulated a step-by-step method

      I''ve zeroed in on the core inquiry: determining if 97239 is east of 99324.
      To solve this, I''m now breaking down the problem. First, I need to figure out
      how to represent the location of each ZIP code geographically. Then, I need
      to figure out how to compare these locations. I''m thinking of using a coordinate
      system, and comparing the longitude values.



      **Analyzing Longitude Data**


      I''ve gathered the longitudes for the two ZIP codes: -122.67 degrees for Portland,
      OR (97239) and -118.34 degrees for College Place, WA (99324). Since -118.34
      is greater (less negative) than -122.67, I can confidently state that 99324
      is indeed located east of 97239.



      **Verifying Geographic Relationships**


      I''m now articulating my reasoning more clearly. By comparing longitudes, I
      determined 99324 (College Place) is east of 97239 (Portland). I''m focusing
      on crafting a succinct and accurate response, ensuring I directly answer the
      user''s initial query about relative locations. I''m double-checking the phrasing
      to avoid any ambiguity.

      \ is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the location of the first\
      \ ZIP code:** 97239 is a ZIP code for Portland, Oregon. Portland's longitude\
      \ is approximately 122.67\xB0 West.\n\n2.  **Identify the location of the second\
      \ ZIP code:** 99324 is a ZIP code for College Place, Washington, which is adjacent\
      \ to Walla Walla in the southeastern part of the state. Its longitude is approximately\
      \ 118.38\xB0 West.\n\n3.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine which location\
      \ is further east, we compare their longitudes. In the Western Hemisphere, a\
      \ smaller number (a less negative one) indicates a location further to the east.\n\
      \n4.  **Conclusion:** Since 118.38\xB0 W is a smaller number than 122.67\xB0\
      \ W, College Place, WA (99324) is located east of Portland, OR (97239). Therefore,\
      \ 97239 is west of 99324.\n\nNO"

      I''ve now methodically broken down the problem into manageable steps. My next
      phase involved identifying the cities and states associated with the zip codes.
      After that, I successfully located the longitudes for Bruce, MS, and Raleigh,

      **Synthesizing Final Conclusions**


      I''ve meticulously assessed the geographical positions. I started by identifying
      the states and then the specific cities within the zip codes. After that, I
      compared their geographical positions, and have determined the final answer.
      The final step involves formatting the answer by retracing the key steps in

      to the user.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we identify the city and state for each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 38611 is for Byhalia, Mississippi (MS).

      3.  The zip code 27604 is for Raleigh, North Carolina (NC).

      4.  Next, we compare the geographical locations of these two states. North Carolina
      is an Atlantic coast state, while Mississippi is located further west, bordered
      by the Mississippi River.

      5.  Therefore, any location in Mississippi is west of any location in North
      Carolina.

      6.  This means that Byhalia, MS is located west of Raleigh, NC.

      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, identify the location associated with the zip code 46617, IN. This
      zip code is for South Bend, Indiana.

      2.  Next, identify the location associated with the zip code 06770, CT. This
      zip code is for New Milford, Connecticut.

      3.  Now, compare the geographical locations of Indiana and Connecticut on a
      map of the United States.

      4.  Indiana is a state in the Midwest, while Connecticut is a state in the Northeast,
      on the Atlantic coast.

      I''ve begun to outline the core task: determining the relative east-west positions
      of two distinct zip codes. To do this effectively, I must first extract geographical
      coordinates for each. This will then facilitate a comparison, likely involving
      longitude values, to discern which lies further east.



      **Mapping the Coordinates**


      I''ve successfully identified the cities associated with both zip codes: South
      Bend, IN (46617) and New Milford, CT (06770). My focus now is on gathering the
      longitude coordinates for each. I''ll utilize online resources to determine
      these values, enabling a direct comparison. I understand that Indiana is in
      the Midwest and Connecticut is in New England.



      **Outlining the Logical Flow**


      The logical steps are now clear. I''ve sketched out the process: identify cities
      via zip codes, determine general locations (Indiana, Connecticut), and then,
      using U.S. map knowledge, deduce the relative east-west positions. I anticipate
      comparing these general areas, not exacting coordinates, to answer the core
      question. I''ll use the states themselves to compare positions.



      **Decomposing the Core Question**


      I''ve drilled down into the specifics. I understand the central issue is a comparison
      of longitudes, because "east of" equates to a greater longitude. I''ve now broken
      down the information needed: locations of the zip codes, 46617 and 06770. I''ll
      use these locations to establish which one has the higher longitude, thereby
      allowing me to answer the core question accurately.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, identify the location associated with each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 46617 is for South Bend, Indiana (IN).

      3.  The zip code 06770 is for New Milford, Connecticut (CT).

      4.  Next, compare the geographical locations of the states. Indiana is a state
      in the Midwestern United States. Connecticut is a state on the East Coast.

      5.  On a map of the United States, the entire state of Connecticut is located
      to the east of the entire state of Indiana.

      6.  Therefore, South Bend, IN is located west of New Milford, CT.

      \ Next is the crucial longitude calculation, with both zip codes now associated\
      \ with West longitudes. I'm building my conclusion by demonstrating how the\
      \ more negative longitude of Hillsboro, NM, confirms its position west of Longview,\
      \ TX.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Locations**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the precise\
      \ locations associated with the zip codes. I've successfully connected 88048\
      \ to Hillsboro, New Mexico, and 75604 to Longview, Texas. My analysis confirms\
      \ that Hillsboro, NM, is indeed located west of Longview, TX, building on the\
      \ initial assessment, and I'm prepared for a formal response.\n\n\n</think>Here\
      \ is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  First, we need to identify the geographical\
      \ location of each zip code.\n2.  The zip code 88048 corresponds to Hillsboro,\
      \ New Mexico.\n3.  The zip code 75604 corresponds to Longview, Texas.\n4.  Geographically,\
      \ the state of New Mexico is located entirely to the west of the state of Texas.\n\
      5.  Therefore, Hillsboro, NM must be west of Longview, TX. To be more precise,\
      \ Hillsboro, NM is at a longitude of approximately 107.6\xB0W, while Longview,\
      \ TX is at a longitude of approximately 94.7\xB0W. A more negative (or larger\

      I''m now zeroing in on the central issue: figuring out if the Colorado zip code,
      80130, lies eastward of the Missouri zip code, 64701. I''ve broken down the
      user''s request into its core components. Next step, I must determine how to
      analyze this geographic comparison, perhaps by using latitude and longitude
      coordinates.



      **Refining the Approach**


      I''m now zeroing in on the geographical relationship.  I''ve pinpointed that
      80130 is in CO and 64701 is in MO. The US map visualization is crucial. It''s
      clear that MO is east of CO. Therefore, any location in MO is further east than
      any location in CO, including the specific zip codes. It is time to conclude
      the answer.



      **Clarifying the Conclusion**


      I''ve just refined the final answer''s clarity. Now, I''m ensuring the response
      states the reasoning concisely, making the answer unambiguous. I''ve formulated
      a straightforward "YES/NO" conclusion. The double-check is underway to solidify
      my confidence, and I can say the map visualization helped. I will re-test the
      reasoning steps and then provide the final answer.



      **Solidifying the Conclusion**


      I''m now fully confident in the conclusion.  The path to the answer is clear,
      from state positions to a definitive "NO." My reasoning is sound,  starting
      with the initial breakdown of the zip codes. I''ve re-examined the logic, and

      involves deconstructing the request, starting with pinpointing the input zip
      codes. I''m now comparing and contrasting geographical data to determine their
      relative East/West positioning. I''m focusing on geographical coordinates to
      establish a clear answer.



      **Evaluating State Locations**


      Now, I''m digging deeper into the locations. I''ve broken down the request into
      key components, specifically identifying the zip codes and the ''east of'' relationship.
      I know that 80130 is Larkspur, CO, and 64701 is Adrian, MO. My next move is
      to leverage a US map to determine their relative positioning, by focusing on
      the location of Colorado and Missouri.



      **Evaluating Stepwise Reasoning**


      I''m now crafting a step-by-step response, starting with identifying the core
      zip codes: 80130 (Larkspur, CO) and 64701 (Adrian, MO).  I''m focusing on geographical
      data, mapping their states to pinpoint their East/West relationship. My reasoning
      will clearly state that Missouri is east of Colorado, thus, 80130 is not east
      of 64701. I''m finalizing a presentation format that lays out the logic in detail,
      followed by a succinct ''no'' as the answer.



      **Constructing a Concise Response**


      I''ve established a clear step-by-step logic, detailing the locations and geographic
      positioning. It''s now finalized. I identified the zip codes'' locations, compared
      their states'' positions, and drafted a structured reasoning. The response will
      be presented clearly, followed by a simple "NO" to the query. My approach is
      now fully integrated.

      1.  First, we need to identify the locations associated with each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 80130 is for Larkspur, Colorado (CO).

      3.  The zip code 64701 is for Adrian, Missouri (MO).

      4.  Next, we need to compare the geographical locations of these two states.
      On a map of the United States, the state of Missouri is located to the east
      of the state of Colorado.

      5.  Therefore, any location in Colorado is west of any location in Missouri.
      This means Larkspur, CO is west of Adrian, MO.

      to ascertain the relative east-west positions.



      **Determining Eastward Positions**


      I''ve established both locations: Willowick, Ohio (zip code 44095) and Midtown
      Manhattan, New York City (zip code 10162). Based on my analysis, I''ve determined
      that Willowick is in the Midwest, west of New York. Thus, zip code 44095 is
      undeniably west of zip code 10162. My process is complete.

      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, identify the city and state for each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 68152 is located in Omaha, Nebraska.

      3.  The zip code 48219 is located in Detroit, Michigan.

      4.  The question is therefore asking: Is Omaha, Nebraska located east of Detroit,
      Michigan?

      5.  By looking at a map of the United States, Michigan is located to the east
      of Nebraska. Therefore, Detroit is east of Omaha.

      6.  This means Omaha, Nebraska (68152) is located **west** of Detroit, Michigan
      (48219).

      the specific coordinates associated with each zip code to accurately determine
      their east-west relationship.



      **Confirming Geographic Positioning**


      I''ve refined my approach, starting with the core question: Is 68152 east of
      48219? I identified the zip codes and their states. Then, I leveraged general
      knowledge and quick searches to pinpoint Omaha, Nebraska (68152) and Detroit,
      Michigan (48219). Now, I''m focusing on their relative longitude to answer the
      "east of" question precisely, knowing that a greater longitude indicates being
      further east.



      **Refining Geographic Comparison**


      I''m now fully immersed in the core comparison: determining if zip code 68152
      is east of 48219. I''ve successfully pinpointed Omaha, NE, and Detroit, MI,
      respectively, as the corresponding cities. My current focus is on pinpointing

      My initial assessment is that the user''s primary concern revolves around determining
      the relative geographical positions of two zip codes: 15468, PA, and 07440,
      NJ. I''ve begun to break down the input, identifying the two zip codes. This
      is the first step towards resolving the geographical query.



      **Re-evaluating Geographical Data**


      I''ve refined the approach. My focus has shifted to pinpointing the geographical
      coordinates associated with each zip code. I''ve successfully extracted both
      zip codes and their corresponding states. Now, I''m delving into pinpointing
      the cities or towns, and counties, to establish a better comparison. I''ve learned
      that 15468, PA corresponds to New Geneva, PA and 07440, NJ belongs to Ramsey,
      NJ. This more granular data will allow a more accurate assessment.



      **Refining Geographical Positioning**


      I''m now integrating the geographical data for both zip codes to establish a
      direct comparison. I''ve pinpointed New Geneva, PA, and Ramsey, NJ. Having located
      them, I can visualize their relative positions. Pennsylvania is indeed west
      of New Jersey. Therefore, New Geneva, PA, will not be east of Ramsey, NJ. The
      answer is NO.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the geographical location of the zip code 15468,

      **Mapping Zip Codes Geographically**


      I''ve progressed by identifying the cities associated with the zip codes: Kalamazoo,
      MI (49009), and Boxborough, MA (01719). Now I''m examining the geographical
      positions of these cities relative to each other. My plan is to then compare
      state locations, because I know that Massachusetts is in the East and Michigan
      is west of the former.



      **Determining Relative Locations**


      I''ve now expanded my analysis with concrete city names: Kalamazoo, Michigan,
      and Boxborough, Massachusetts. Through geographical comparison, it''s clear
      that Massachusetts resides east of Michigan. This has helped to inform my conclusion,
      which is that Kalamazoo, MI is *not* east of Boxborough, MA, as I know the opposite
      is true.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of 49009, MI:** This zip code corresponds to Kalamazoo,
      Michigan.

      2.  **Identify the location of 01719, MA:** This zip code corresponds to Boxborough,
      Massachusetts.

      3.  **Compare the states:** Michigan (MI) is a state in the Midwestern United
      States. Massachusetts (MA) is a state on the East Coast of the United States.

      4.  **Determine relative position:** Geographically, the entire state of Massachusetts
      is located to the east of the entire state of Michigan. Therefore, Boxborough,
      MA is east of Kalamazoo, MI.

      5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Kalamazoo, MI is *east* of
      Boxborough, MA. This is false.

      I''m now focusing on the crucial initial step: pinpointing the user''s fundamental
      query. It''s quite straightforward: determine if zip code 73142 is positioned
      eastward compared to 30534. The ultimate goal is a succinct "YES" or "NO" reply,
      which streamlines the entire process.



      **Outlining the Solution Steps**


      I''ve refined the problem-solving approach. First, I broke the problem into
      four manageable steps: pinpointing locations, determining relative geographical
      positions, and then formulating the final "YES/NO" answer. I''ve successfully
      identified Oklahoma City, OK and Dahlonega, GA. My next move involves determining
      their relative positions.



      **Evaluating the Geographic Positions**


      I''ve completely worked through the problem''s core. I''ve determined that Oklahoma
      City, OK, (73142) is west of Dahlonega, GA, (30534). I''ve carefully laid out
      the logic for clarity and, now, I''m prepared to generate the final "NO" answer
      and its justification for the user. I''m quite confident in my assessment.

      1.  **Identify the location of the first zip code:** 73142 is a zip code for
      Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

      2.  **Identify the location of the second zip code:** 30534 is a zip code for
      Dahlonega, Georgia.

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations:** On a map of the United States, the
      state of Oklahoma is located to the west of the state of Georgia. Therefore,
      Oklahoma City, OK is west of Dahlonega, GA.

      4.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Oklahoma City, OK
      (73142) is **east of** Dahlonega, GA (30534). Since Oklahoma City is to the
      west, the statement is false.

      I''m starting by unpacking the central question: determining the relative east-west
      positions of two zip codes. I know I need a clear "YES" or "NO" response, but
      the logic needs to be transparent. I''m thinking about the best way to illustrate
      my reasoning without excessive detail. My focus now is on finding a reliable
      method to compare the longitude of each zip code.



      **Analyzing Location Comparisons**


      I''ve broken down the inputs and now pinpointed the cities: Spring Valley, OH,
      and Havertown, PA. The core task is now clear: comparing their longitudes. I
      plan to search for the exact coordinates of each city to accurately answer the
      east-west question. Finding reliable coordinate data is key, and I am looking
      into the best methods of ensuring data integrity.



      **Evaluating Stepwise Conclusions**


      I''ve now documented the entire process from start to finish, including pinpointing
      both locations and illustrating the geography-based comparison. The key is now
      to distill all that into a step-by-step structure. My latest effort focuses
      on refining the narrative, making sure the reasoning is transparent and the
      conclusion crystal clear, which is "NO".



      **Formulating a Step-by-Step Answer**


      I''ve outlined all the necessary steps, beginning with pinpointing Spring Valley,
      OH and Havertown, PA, and then comparing their geographical positions. I''m
      confident in the logic. Now, I''m putting together the final response by writing
      the narrative, and structuring a step-by-step breakdown. The final step will
      be the "NO" answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the city and state for the zip code 45371. This
      zip code corresponds to Spring Valley, Ohio.

      2.  Next, we identify the city and state for the zip code 19043. This zip code
      corresponds to Havertown, Pennsylvania.

      3.  Finally, we compare the geographical locations of these two places. The
      state of Ohio is located entirely to the west of the state of Pennsylvania.
      Therefore, Spring Valley, Ohio, is west of Havertown, Pennsylvania.


      The question asks if 45371, OH is located **east** of 19043, PA. Since Ohio
      is west of Pennsylvania, the statement is false.

      query. I''m currently working on the execution of those steps, and I''m now
      focused on identifying locations and their geographical relationships. I''ve
      double-checked my reasoning for accuracy.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, identify the location associated with the zip code 66220, KS. This
      zip code is for Stilwell, Kansas.

      2.  Next, identify the location associated with the zip code 26041, WV. This
      zip code is for Follansbee, West Virginia.

      3.  Finally, compare the geographical locations of Kansas and West Virginia
      on a map of the United States. Kansas is a state in the Midwest, while West
      Virginia is a state in the Appalachian region of the Eastern US.

      4.  Therefore, Kansas is located to the west of West Virginia.

      zip codes, found their longitudes, and have made the comparison: Glennie, MI
      is *west* of Montpelier, VT. The formatting is underway. My answer will be precise
      and structured, including a "NO" for clarity.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, identify the location associated with the zip code 48624, MI. This
      zip code corresponds to Glennie, Michigan.

      2.  Next, identify the location associated with the zip code 05602, VT. This
      zip code corresponds to Montpelier, Vermont.

      3.  Finally, determine the geographical relationship between Michigan and Vermont.
      On a map of the United States, the state of Vermont is located to the east of
      the state of Michigan.

      4.  Therefore, Montpelier, VT is east of Glennie, MI. The question asks if Glennie,
      MI is east of Montpelier, VT, which is the opposite.

      I''ve started by zeroing in on the fundamental question: is the Louisiana zip
      code east of the Florida one? The task seems straightforward, and I''m now deconstructing
      the core request into smaller, more manageable parts. I''m currently strategizing
      the best approach to achieve a definitive "YES" or "NO" output.



      **Mapping Relative Coordinates**


      I''ve broken down the "east of" query into manageable steps. Identifying the
      zip codes'' locations was the initial phase. Now I''m working on establishing
      longitude comparisons, specifically mapping Louisiana''s west-of-Florida relationship.
      I''ve verified that St. Augustine is east of Lake Charles, confirming my approach.



      **Evaluating Longitudinal Relationships**


      I''ve finalized the logic. I''ve zeroed in on the fact that the user needs a
      "YES" or "NO". I''ve determined I must compare the longitudes, which meant pinpointing
      the cities associated with each zip code. After this, I formulated step-by-step
      reasoning. I am now ready to provide the answer.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we need to identify the locations associated with each zip code.

      2.  The zip code 70647 is for Lake Charles, Louisiana.

      3.  The zip code 32095 is for St. Augustine, Florida.

      4.  Next, we compare the geographical positions of these two locations.

      5.  Louisiana is a state located to the west of Florida. More specifically,
      Lake Charles, LA is on the Gulf Coast, while St. Augustine, FL is on the Atlantic
      coast.

      6.  Therefore, Lake Charles, LA (70647) is located west of St. Augustine, FL
      (32095).

      \nI'm currently focused on the core question: Determining if ZIP code 77045\
      \ is east of 32603. I've broken this down. I realize I need to understand the\
      \ geographic location of each ZIP code to determine relative east-west positioning.\
      \ I am now working on finding accurate longitude coordinates for each ZIP code.\n\
      \n\n**Defining Coordinate Requirements**\n\nI've determined I need the longitude\
      \ coordinates for both ZIP codes.  I've found 77045 is in Houston, TX, with\
      \ an approximate longitude of 95.36\xB0 W. Now, I'm working to locate the city\

      \ comparison. I've realized I need to be careful with the directionality of\
      \ West longitude.\n\n\n**Refining the East-West Comparison**\n\nI've determined\
      \ that 77045 (Houston, TX) is at approximately 95.36\xB0 W and 32603 (Gainesville,\
      \ FL) is at approximately 82.32\xB0 W. I've re-confirmed that a smaller West\

      \ 77045 (Houston, TX: ~29.65\xB0 N, -95.42\xB0 W) and 32603 (Gainesville, FL:\
      \ ~29.65\xB0 N, -82.32\xB0 W). The negative sign confirms these are west longitudes.\
      \ By comparing -95.42\xB0 and -82.32\xB0, I see that -82.32\xB0 (Gainesville)\

      \ West, while Gainesville, FL is at a longitude of approximately 82.3\xB0 West.\
      \ Locations with a smaller West longitude are further east.\n4.  **Conclusion:**\
      \ Since Florida is geographically east of Texas, 32603, FL is east of 77045,\
      \ TX. Therefore, 77045, TX is not located east of 32603, FL.\n\nNO"

      data efficiently and reliably.

      I''ve now moved beyond the initial information gathering. I''ve established
      that the task requires comparing the longitudes of Wichita, KS, and Sainte Genevieve,
      MO, after using zip codes to identify these locations. My next step is to actually
      get the longitude coordinates of both locations. I am now focusing on the best
      way to compare those coordinates.



      **Evaluating Positional Comparisons**


      I''ve now completely formalized the argument to answer the user''s question.
      The core of my reasoning is based on the relative east-west positions of Kansas
      and Missouri. I concluded that, based on their state positions, Wichita, KS,
      is west of Sainte Genevieve, MO. I''ve now confirmed this with longitude values.
      Therefore, the zip code in Kansas (67218) is not east of the zip code in Missouri

      values and formalized my response structure.

      I''m currently focused on the user''s core inquiry: determining if zip code
      15057 in Pennsylvania lies east of zip code 07871 in New Jersey. My goal is
      to craft a clear "YES" or "NO" response, supported by readily understandable
      reasoning. I am currently considering the best method to calculate the geographic
      location.



      **Mapping Geographical Positions**


      I''ve successfully identified the locations for both zip codes. Library, PA
      (15057) is in Western Pennsylvania, and Sparta, NJ (07871) is in northwestern
      New Jersey. Now, I''m focusing on comparing their geographical coordinates to
      determine the precise east-west relationship. My analysis will clearly show
      which location is further east. The final step involves formulating a definitive
      YES or NO answer for the user''s question.



      **Reaching a Conclusion**


      I have completed all the problem steps. I now have all the necessary information
      to formulate a definitive answer to the user''s inquiry. I''ve determined that
      Sparta, NJ (07871) is east of Library, PA (15057). Therefore, the answer to
      the question "Is 15057, PA located east of 07871, NJ?" is NO.



      **Refining the Response**


      I''ve finalized my response. After meticulous comparison, I concluded that Library,
      PA (15057) lies west of Sparta, NJ (07871). I''ve prepared a concise, logical
      explanation for the user, culminating in a definitive "NO" answer. The reasoning
      is clear: Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, thus Library is west of Sparta.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of zip code 15057, PA.** This zip code corresponds
      to Library, Pennsylvania, which is located in Allegheny County in the western
      part of the state, near Pittsburgh.

      2.  **Identify the location of zip code 07871, NJ.** This zip code corresponds
      to Sparta, New Jersey, which is located in Sussex County in the northwestern
      part of the state.

      3.  **Compare the geographical positions.** The entire state of New Jersey is
      located to the east of the entire state of Pennsylvania. Therefore, any location
      in Pennsylvania, especially one in the western part like Library, will be west
      of any location in New Jersey.

      \ of New Jersey.\n    *   Therefore, a location in western Pennsylvania (like\
      \ Mc Kees Rocks) must be west of a location in New Jersey (like Sparta).\n\n\
      3.  **Compare the longitudes for confirmation:**\n    *   The approximate longitude\

      of zip codes 15057 and 07871. I need to get the longitude for both zip codes
      to calculate their relation.



      **Pinpointing Eastward Progression**


      I''ve determined that zip code 15057 is in Library, PA, near Pittsburgh. And
      zip code 07871 is in Sparta, NJ. Geographically, New Jersey is consistently
      east of Pennsylvania. Therefore, Sparta, NJ is east of Library, PA. I''m ready
      to confirm this with an "YES" response.



      **Refining East/West Comparison**


      I''ve refined the approach. I''ve pinpointed the locations of each zip code:
      Library, PA, and Sparta, NJ. A careful geographical comparison revealed Pennsylvania
      is west of New Jersey. Therefore, Library, PA is west of Sparta, NJ. The question

      I''m zeroing in on the core question: Determining the relative east/west positioning
      of two US ZIP codes. I''ve begun deconstructing the input: 85735, AZ and 76008,
      TX. The "AZ" and "TX" readily identify states. My next step will be to explore
      how I can use this state information, in conjunction with the ZIP codes, to
      arrive at an answer.



      **Determining Relative Positioning**


      I''ve successfully identified the two ZIP codes and their respective states,
      Arizona and Texas. I quickly determined that Arizona is west of Texas. Now,
      my next move is to link this state-level geographical relationship directly
      to the specific ZIP codes. I''ll need to confirm that my state-based deduction
      translates directly to the east/west positioning of these two ZIP code locations.



      **Confirming Logical Flow**


      The structure is set! I''ve solidified the step-by-step reasoning needed to
      produce a clear "NO" answer. The logic proceeds as: zip code to state, state
      to relative geographic position, then conclusion. The final response will follow
      this clear explanation.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, we identify the state for each zip code. 85735 is in Arizona (AZ)
      and 76008 is in Texas (TX).

      2.  Next, we determine the geographical relationship between these two states
      on a map of the United States.

      3.  The state of Arizona is located entirely to the west of the state of Texas.

      4.  Therefore, any location in Arizona (like 85735) must be west of any location
      in Texas (like 76008). The question asks if it is to the east.

      next step is to devise a plan to crack this geographical nut. I''m thinking
      of breaking down the problem into manageable parts to avoid any unnecessary
      errors.



      **Mapping Out The Strategy**


      I''ve refined my approach. First, I''ll identify the core cities for each zip
      code. Then I will compare the cities. I found that 91780 is Temple City, CA,
      and 85396 is Buckeye, AZ. Now, I''ll compare these two cities to reach a conclusion.



      **Finalizing The Solution**


      I''ve methodically worked through the locations and made a conclusive determination.
      California, specifically Temple City (91780), is west of Arizona, which includes
      Buckeye (85396). Thus, the answer to the question is clearly NO. Now I''m ready
      to provide the complete, reasoned answer.



      **Synthesizing The Solution**


      I''ve organized my findings to produce a clear response. I confirmed Temple
      City, CA (91780), lies west of Buckeye, AZ (85396), by examining both city locations
      and then their longitudes. Consequently, the definitive answer is NO, neatly
      answering the initial query with supporting evidence.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  First, identify the location associated with the zip code 91780, CA. This
      zip code corresponds to Temple City, California.

      2.  Next, identify the location associated with the zip code 85396, AZ. This

      \    *   The zip code 38834 is located in Corinth, Mississippi.\n\n2.  Next,\
      \ we need to determine the longitude of each location. Longitude measures how\

      \ (73025) has a longitude of approximately -97.48\xB0 W, while North Little\
      \ Rock, Arkansas (72114) is around -92.26\xB0 W. Now, the comparison is straightforward:\
      \ I need to assess which location is further east based on their longitudes.\n\
      \n\n**Comparing Longitudes Conclusively**\n\nI've determined Edmond, Oklahoma's\
      \ longitude to be roughly -97.48\xB0 W and North Little Rock, Arkansas's to\

      \ 97.5\xB0 W longitude.\n    *   North Little Rock, AR is at approximately 92.3\xB0\
      \ W longitude.\n\n3.  Finally, compare their longitudes. On a map, locations\
      \ with a smaller negative longitude are further east. Since -92.3 is a smaller\
      \ negative number than -97.5, North Little Rock, AR is located east of Edmond,\
      \ OK. This means Edmond, OK is located **west** of North Little Rock, AR.\n\n\
