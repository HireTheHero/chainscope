      of 06250, CT, we need to analyze the locations of these zip codes.


      1. **Identify the location of 17970, PA**: The zip code 17970 corresponds to
      Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Pottsville is located in the central part of Pennsylvania,
      towards the east but not at the far eastern edge.


      2. **Identify the location of 06250, CT**: The zip code 06250 corresponds to
      Willimantic, Connecticut. Willimantic is located in the northeastern part of
      Connecticut.


      3. **Compare the two locations**: Connecticut is generally to the east of Pennsylvania.
      Willimantic, CT (06250) is positioned to the east of Pottsville, PA (17970).

      Since -84.5379 (New Lebanon, OH) is greater than -89.5886 (Peoria, IL), it indicates
      that New Lebanon is to the east of Peoria.


      Therefore, 61614, IL is not located east of 45342, OH.


      The answer is: **NO**.'

      2. **Locate 18240, PA**: This zip code is in the Hazleton area in eastern Pennsylvania.


      Now, we can assess their relative positions:


      - **Illinois (61611)** is generally west of Pennsylvania (18240).

      - **Pennsylvania** is located to the east of Illinois.


      Therefore, 61611, IL is not east of 18240, PA; rather, it is located to the
      west of it.

      2. **Locate 08028, NJ**: This zip code is in New Jersey, specifically in the
      area of Hainesport.


      Next, we assess the positions of these two locations based on their geographical
      coordinates:

      - Cincinnati, OH (45204) is situated in the southwestern part of Ohio.

      - Hainesport, NJ (08028) is located in the central part of New Jersey, which
      is east of Ohio.


      Now, we consider the relative east-west positioning:

      - Ohio is generally west of New Jersey. Thus, Cincinnati (45204) would be to
      the west of Hainesport (08028).


      Based on this reasoning, we conclude that 45204, OH is not east of 08028, NJ.

      1. **76114, TX**: This ZIP code is in Fort Worth, Texas, which is located in
      the north-central part of Texas.


      2. **31210, GA**: This ZIP code corresponds to an area in Macon, Georgia, which
      is situated in the central region of Georgia.


      Next, we need to assess their relative positions:


      - Texas is to the west of Georgia.

      - Fort Worth (76114, TX) is significantly west of Macon (31210, GA).


      Given that Fort Worth, TX, is west of Macon, GA, it follows that 76114, TX cannot
      be east of 31210, GA.


      Thus, the answer to the question is:


      **NO**.'
