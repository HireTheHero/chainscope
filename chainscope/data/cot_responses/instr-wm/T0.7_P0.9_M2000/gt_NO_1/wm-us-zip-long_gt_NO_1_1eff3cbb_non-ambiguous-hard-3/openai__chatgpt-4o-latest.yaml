      - ZIP code 91780 corresponds to Temple City, California.

      - ZIP code 85396 corresponds to Buckeye, Arizona.


      **Step 2: Find the longitude of each location.**

      - Temple City, CA (91780) is located at approximately 118.057 longitude (West).

      - Buckeye, AZ (85396) is located at approximately 112.642 longitude (West).


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      - Since both longitudes are west, the smaller the number, the farther east the
      location is.

      - 112.642 (Buckeye, AZ) is less than 118.057 (Temple City, CA), meaning Buckeye
      is farther east than Temple City.


      **Conclusion:**

      Temple City (91780) is west of Buckeye (85396).

      to compare their geographic longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.

      - 74105 is a zip code in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

      - 38834 is a zip code in Corinth, Mississippi.


      Step 2: Understand geographic orientation.

      - The United States is in the Western Hemisphere, so longitudes are negative.

      - A location is considered "east" if its longitude is numerically greater (i.e.,
      less negative) than that of another location.


      Step 3: Find the approximate longitudes of each location.

      - Tulsa, OK (74105) is approximately at longitude -95.95.

      - Corinth, MS (38834) is approximately at longitude -88.52.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      - -88.52 (Corinth) is greater than -95.95 (Tulsa), which means Corinth is further
      east than Tulsa.


      Therefore, Tulsa, OK (74105) is west of Corinth, MS (38834).
