      5.  **Apply this to the specific ZIP codes:** Since Gulfport, MS (39530) is
      generally east of New Caney, TX (77340) on the US map, it means that 77340,
      TX is *west* of 39530, MS.


      Therefore, for 77340, TX to be *east* of 39530, MS, it would need to be located

    94aa27d6-a3c8-4efc-9b5e-a4f9eb8f4e28: 'Let''s break this down step-by-step to
      arrive at the YES/NO answer.


      **Step 1: Determine the general location of each zip code.**


      *   **30354, GA:** This zip code is in Georgia, specifically within the Atlanta
      metropolitan area.

      *   **29405, SC:** This zip code is in South Carolina, specifically within the
      Charleston metropolitan area.


      **Step 2: Understand the geographical relationship between Georgia and South
      Carolina.**


      *   South Carolina is generally located *east* of Georgia. The two states share
      a border, and as you move from West to East across the US, you would typically
      encounter Georgia before South Carolina.


      **Step 3: Consider the specific cities/regions within each state.**


      *   Atlanta, GA (where 30354 is located) is in the *western* part of Georgia,
      relatively far from the eastern border with South Carolina.

      *   Charleston, SC (where 29405 is located) is on the *coast* of South Carolina,
      which is its easternmost point.


      **Step 4: Compare the relative longitudes.**


      Without looking up exact longitudes, we can infer:


      *   Atlanta, GA is significantly inland and westward within its state.

      *   Charleston, SC is a coastal city, meaning it''s very far east within its
      state, and also far east of inland Georgia.


      Therefore, 29405, SC (Charleston) is clearly to the east of 30354, GA (Atlanta).


      **Conclusion:**


      Since 29405, SC is east of 30354, GA, then 30354, GA is *not* located east of
      29405, SC.

      \ Key Information for Each Zip Code:**\n    *   30354, GA\n    *   29405, SC\n\
      \n3.  **Strategy for East/West Comparison:** The most reliable way to compare\
      \ east/west positions is to look at their longitudes. A more eastern location\
      \ will have a longitude closer to 0 (or a less negative number if using negative\
      \ for West, which is common).\n\n4.  **Find the Geographic Coordinates (Longitude)\
      \ for Each Zip Code:**\n\n    *   **For 30354, GA:** A quick search (e.g., Google\

      \ longitude**. (This is in the Atlanta area).\n\n    *   **For 29405, SC:**\
      \ A quick search (e.g., Google Maps, zip code lookup) reveals its centroid is\
      \ approximately around **-79.94\xB0 longitude**. (This is in the Charleston\
      \ area).\n\n5.  **Compare the Longitudes:**\n    *   -84.40\xB0 (30354, GA)\n\
      \    *   -79.94\xB0 (29405, SC)\n\n    On a number line, -79.94 is to the right\
      \ of -84.40. In geographical terms, a longitude closer to 0 (or less negative)\
      \ is further East.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Conclusion based on Comparison:**\n\
      \    Since -79.94\xB0 is greater (less negative) than -84.40\xB0, 29405, SC\
      \ is located *east* of 30354, GA.\n\n7.  **Answer the Original Question:** The\

      **Step 1: Locate 77388, TX**

      *   This zip code is for The Woodlands, Texas.

      *   The Woodlands is located north of Houston.

      *   Geographically, it''s in Southeast Texas.

      *   Its approximate longitude is around -95.4 degrees West.


      **Step 2: Locate 70712, LA**

      *   This zip code is for Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

      *   Geographically, it''s in Southeast Louisiana.

      *   Its approximate longitude is around -91.1 degrees West.


      **Step 3: Compare Latitudes/Longitudes to determine East/West**

      *   When comparing East and West, we look at longitude.

      *   Numbers closer to 0 (the Prime Meridian) are further East.

      *   Numbers that are more negative (further from 0 when going west) are further
      West.

      *   -95.4 degrees West (The Woodlands, TX)

      *   -91.1 degrees West (Baton Rouge, LA)


      Since -91.1 is greater than -95.4 (i.e., closer to 0), Baton Rouge, LA is *east*
      of The Woodlands, TX.


      Therefore, The Woodlands, TX (77388) is *west* of Baton Rouge, LA (70712).

      *   38611 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS).

      *   27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC).


      **Step 2: Determine the general geographical relationship between Mississippi
      and North Carolina.**

      *   Mississippi is a state in the southeastern United States, located to the
      *west* of North Carolina. North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, while Mississippi
      is further inland and to the west.


      **Step 3: Consider if specific zip codes within these states could alter the
      general relationship.**

      *   While a state like California might have easternmost points that are east
      of a westernmost point in a state like Nevada, the general east-west relationship
      between Mississippi and North Carolina is quite clear. Mississippi is fundamentally
      to the west of North Carolina.

      *   Even the easternmost point of Mississippi would still be west of the westernmost
      point of North Carolina.


      **Step 4: Conclude based on the geographical relationship.**

      Since Mississippi is located to the west of North Carolina, any location within
      Mississippi will be to the west of any location within North Carolina.

      answer.


      **Step 1: Understand the Question**

      The question asks for a directional comparison between two specific US zip codes:
      88048, NM and 75604, TX. We need to determine if the New Mexico zip code is
      geographically to the east of the Texas zip code.


      **Step 2: Locate the Zip Codes (Approximate)**


      *   **88048, NM:** This zip code is in New Mexico. A quick search reveals it''s
      associated with **Lordsburg, NM**. Lordsburg is in the southwestern part of
      New Mexico, quite close to the Arizona border.


      *   **75604, TX:** This zip code is in Texas. A quick search reveals it''s associated
      with **Longview, TX**. Longview is in East Texas, roughly halfway between Dallas
      and Shreveport, LA.


      **Step 3: Compare Longitudinal Positions**


      *   **Lordsburg, NM (88048):** Being in far western New Mexico, its longitude
      will be significantly *west*. (Around 108-109 degrees West).


      *   **Longview, TX (75604):** Being in East Texas, its longitude will be significantly
      *east* compared to Lordsburg. (Around 94-95 degrees West).


      **Step 4: Determine East/West Relationship**


      Since Lordsburg, NM, is at a longitude further west (a higher negative number
      if you think of it that way, or simply "more to the west" on a map) than Longview,
      TX, it means Longview, TX, is to the east of Lordsburg, NM.


      Therefore, 88048, NM is *not* located east of 75604, TX. It''s located west
      of it.

      the second zip code (10162, NY).


      **Step 2: Determine the general location of each zip code.**


      *   **44095, OH:** This zip code is for Willowick, Ohio. Ohio is a Midwestern
      state, located roughly in the center-east of the US.

      *   **10162, NY:** This zip code is for New York, NY. Specifically, it''s a
      P.O. Box zip code in the Midtown Manhattan area. New York is an East Coast state.


      **Step 3: Compare the relative longitudes.**


      *   New York City (and generally New York State) is further east than Ohio.

      *   Geographically, if you were to draw a vertical line of longitude, New York
      City would be to the right (east) of most of Ohio.


      **Step 4: Formulate the comparison.**

      and subsequent digits narrow it down. Generally, lower first digits are on the
      East Coast and higher first digits are on the West Coast, but this is a very
      broad generalization and doesn''t hold true for precise comparisons within states
      or even across adjacent states.

      **Step 1: Understand what the question is asking.**

      It''s asking if one specific zip code location is geographically to the east
      of another specific zip code location.


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate location of 44095, OH.**

      A quick search reveals that 44095 is a zip code for Willoughby, Ohio. Ohio is
      in the Midwest/East North Central region of the US.


      **Step 3: Determine the approximate location of 10162, NY.**

      A quick search reveals that 10162 is a zip code for New York, New York, specifically
      a PO Box address in Manhattan. New York City is on the East Coast of the US.


      **Step 4: Compare the relative longitudes.**

      Ohio is generally west of New York State. While New York City is on the eastern
      edge of New York State, and Willoughby, OH is in eastern Ohio, the entire state
      of Ohio lies to the west of the entire state of New York. Therefore, any point
      in Ohio will be to the west of any point in New York.


      **Step 5: Formulate the answer.**

      Since Willoughby, OH (44095) is in Ohio and New York, NY (10162) is in New York,
      and Ohio is geographically west of New York, 44095, OH cannot be located east
      of 10162, NY.

      68152, NE is located east of 48219, MI.


      **Step 1: Determine the general location of each zip code.**


      *   **68152, NE:** This zip code is in Nebraska. Nebraska is a state in the
      central United States.

      *   **48219, MI:** This zip code is in Michigan. Michigan is a state in the
      Great Lakes region, generally considered part of the Midwest or East North Central
      United States.


      **Step 2: Compare the general longitudinal positions of Nebraska and Michigan.**


      *   Nebraska is west of the Mississippi River.

      *   Michigan is east of the Mississippi River (the lower peninsula, where Detroit
      and most of Michigan''s population is, is significantly east).


      **Step 3: Conclude the relative east/west position.**


      Since Nebraska is generally west of Michigan, a zip code in Nebraska will be
      west of a zip code in Michigan.


      **Step 4: Formulate the answer.**


      No, 68152, NE is not located east of 48219, MI. It is located west.

      **Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.**

      *   73142 is a ZIP code in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

      *   30534 is a ZIP code in Cornelia, Georgia.


      **Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of each state.**

      *   Oklahoma (OK) is located in the South Central United States.

      *   Georgia (GA) is located in the Southeastern United States.


      **Step 3: Compare their longitudes.**

      Without needing precise coordinates, we know that states in the South Central
      US (like Oklahoma) are generally *west* of states in the Southeast US (like
      Georgia). Think of a map of the United States: Georgia is clearly to the east
      of Oklahoma.


      **Step 4: Answer the question.**

      The question asks if 73142, OK is located *east* of 30534, GA. Based on our
      comparison, Oklahoma is west of Georgia.

      \ for zip codes?** Zip codes are geographically assigned. Generally, lower numbers\
      \ tend to be further east in the US (especially for the first digit or two,\
      \ which often corresponds to a state or region). However, this isn't a hard\
      \ andand-fast rule for *all* digits or across state lines, and it's not precise\
      \ enough for a definitive \"east of\" without more information.\n\n3.  **The\
      \ best way to determine relative east-west position:** Use a mapping tool or\
      \ look up the actual geographic coordinates (longitude) of the centers of these\
      \ zip codes.\n\n4.  **Look up the locations:**\n    *   35954, AL (Albertville,\
      \ Alabama)\n    *   28457, NC (Oak Island, North Carolina)\n\n5.  **Determine\
      \ longitude (the key for east-west):**\n    *   The approximate center of 35954,\
      \ AL is around **-86.2\xB0 W longitude**.\n    *   The approximate center of\
      \ 28457, NC is around **-78.1\xB0 W longitude**.\n\n6.  **Compare longitudes:**\n\
      \    *   -86.2\xB0 W (Alabama)\n    *   -78.1\xB0 W (North Carolina)\n\n   \
      \ Remember that for West longitude, a *smaller* absolute number means it's further\
      \ *east* (closer to the Prime Meridian).\n\n    Since -78.1 is greater than\
      \ -86.2 (or, thinking about it as distance from 0, -78.1 is closer to 0 than\
      \ -86.2, and 0 is the Prime Meridian), 28457, NC is further east than 35954,\
      \ AL.\n\n7.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if 35954, AL is *east*\
      \ of 28457, NC. Based on our longitude comparison, 35954, AL is *west* of 28457,\
      \ NC.\n\n**NO**"

      **Step 1: Understand the nature of zip codes and location.**

      US zip codes are generally assigned in a way that the first digit broadly corresponds
      to a region of the US, moving from East to West.

      * 0 (Northeast)

      * 1 (East)

      * 2 (Southeast)

      * 3 (Southeast)

      * 4 (Midwest)

      * 5 (Midwest)

      * 6 (Midwest)

      * 7 (South Central)

      * 8 (Mountain West)

      * 9 (Pacific West)


      **Step 2: Analyze the first digit of each zip code.**

      * 48624 (MI) starts with ''4''. This generally places it in the Midwest.

      * 05602 (VT) starts with ''0''. This generally places it in the Northeast.


      **Step 3: Determine relative East/West position based on the first digit.**

      A zip code starting with ''0'' (Northeast) will be further East than a zip code
      starting with ''4'' (Midwest).


      **Step 4: Formulate the answer.**

      If 05602 (VT) is in the Northeast and 48624 (MI) is in the Midwest, then 48624
      (MI) is **west** of 05602 (VT).

      1.  **Identify the states:** We have Illinois (IL) and Ohio (OH).

      east of Illinois.

      3.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While zip codes can be large and sometimes
      cross state lines or have unusual shapes, the primary determinant of "east of"
      or "west of" for locations in different states is the relative position of those
      states on a map.


      Since Illinois is geographically to the *west* of Ohio, any point in Illinois
      will be west of any point in Ohio, assuming standard geographical understanding
      and not considering extremely precise, tiny, or unusual border anomalies that
      wouldn''t affect the general "east/west" relationship of entire states.

      42431, KY is located east of 24201, VA.


      **Step 1: Understand Zip Codes and Geography**

      US zip codes are generally assigned in a way that the first digit broadly corresponds
      to a region of the country, moving from east to west.

      *   0xxxx-1xxxx: Northeastern US

      *   2xxxx-3xxxx: Southeastern US

      *   4xxxx-5xxxx: Midwestern US

      *   6xxxx-7xxxx: Central US

      *   8xxxx-9xxxx: Western US


      **Step 2: Locate 24201, VA**

      *   The first digit is ''2''. This places it in the Southeastern US.

      *   Specifically, 24201 is Bristol, Virginia. Bristol is located in southwestern
      Virginia, close to the Tennessee border.


      **Step 3: Locate 42431, KY**

      *   The first digit is ''4''. This places it in the Midwestern US.

      *   Specifically, 42431 is Madisonville, Kentucky. Madisonville is located in
      western Kentucky.


      **Step 4: Compare Geographical Positions**

      *   Bristol, VA (24201) is in southwestern Virginia.

      *   Madisonville, KY (42431) is in western Kentucky.


      If you look at a map, Virginia is *east* of Kentucky. Therefore, any location
      in western Kentucky will be *west* of any location in southwestern Virginia.


      **Step 5: Formulate the Answer**

      The question asks if 42431, KY is located east of 24201, VA. Based on the geographical
      positions:

      *   Virginia is east of Kentucky.

      *   So, a location in Kentucky (like Madisonville) cannot be east of a location
      in Virginia (like Bristol). It will be west.

      42431, KY is located east of 24201, VA.


      **Step 1: Understand Zip Code Geography**

      US zip codes are generally assigned in a way that the first digit indicates
      a group of states, and subsequent digits narrow down the location. The first
      digit tends to increase as you move west across the US, but this is a very broad
      generalization. More importantly, the *first three digits* often define a Sectional
      Center Facility (SCF) or a major processing area.


      **Step 2: Locate 42431, KY**

      * The "42" prefix for Kentucky zip codes generally corresponds to the western
      and central parts of the state.

      * Specifically, 42431 is for Providence, KY.

      * Using a map, Providence, KY is located in western Kentucky. Its approximate
      longitude is around -87.7 degrees.


      **Step 3: Locate 24201, VA**

      * The "24" prefix for Virginia zip codes generally corresponds to the western
      and southwestern parts of the state, particularly the Appalachian region.

      * Specifically, 24201 is for Abingdon, VA.

      * Using a map, Abingdon, VA is located in southwestern Virginia. Its approximate
      longitude is around -81.9 degrees.


      **Step 4: Compare Longitudes**

      * Providence, KY (42431): approximately -87.7 degrees longitude

      * Abingdon, VA (24201): approximately -81.9 degrees longitude


      On a longitude scale, a higher (less negative) number indicates a location further
      east.

      -81.9 is greater than -87.7.


      **Step 5: Determine Relative Position**

      Since -81.9 degrees (Abingdon, VA) is to the east of -87.7 degrees (Providence,
      KY), it means that Providence, KY (42431) is *west* of Abingdon, VA (24201).


      Therefore, 42431, KY is NOT located east of 24201, VA.

      42431, KY is located east of 24201, VA.


      **Step 1: Understand Zip Code Geography**

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where the first digit often indicates
      a group of states, and subsequent digits narrow down the location within those
      states. Generally, lower first digits are in the east, and higher first digits
      are in the west.


      **Step 2: Locate 42431, KY**

      *   The first digit "4" generally corresponds to states in the central-east/southeast
      region of the US.

      *   Kentucky (KY) is a state in this region.

      *   42431 is a specific zip code within Kentucky.


      **Step 3: Locate 24201, VA**

      *   The first digit "2" generally corresponds to states in the southeastern
      US.

      *   Virginia (VA) is a state in this region.

      *   24201 is a specific zip code within Virginia.


      **Step 4: Compare Geographic Positions**

      *   Virginia (VA) is generally located *east* of Kentucky (KY). If you look
      at a map, Virginia''s eastern border is the Atlantic Ocean, while Kentucky is
      landlocked and further west.

      *   Therefore, a location in Virginia, especially one with a lower starting
      zip code (which tends to be further east within the US system), is highly likely
      to be east of a location in Kentucky.


      **Step 5: Confirm with a Quick Check (Mental Map or Actual Map)**

      If you visualize or quickly check a map of the US:

      *   Virginia is on the Atlantic coast.

      *   Kentucky is inland, to the west of Virginia.


      Given this, any point in Kentucky will be to the west of any point in Virginia.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Virginia is geographically to the east of Kentucky, any location in Kentucky
      will be to the west of any location in Virginia. Therefore, 42431, KY is *not*
      located east of 24201, VA. It is located west of it.

      * 85396 is a zip code for Yuma, Arizona.

      * Yuma, AZ is located in southwestern Arizona, near the California border.

      * Its approximate longitude is -114.62 degrees West.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      * A more negative longitude (e.g., -117.86) means the location is further west.

      * A less negative longitude (e.g., -114.62) means the location is further east.


      Since -117.86 (Walnut, CA) is a more negative number than -114.62 (Yuma, AZ),
      Walnut, CA is *west* of Yuma, AZ.

      a sequence (like 0xxxx) are in the east, and higher zip codes (like 9xxxx) are
      in the west. This is a very broad generalization, as zip codes are assigned
      geographically, but not in a perfectly linear east-to-west fashion across the
      entire country. However, for comparing a 0xxxx zip to a 6xxxx zip, this general
      rule holds true.


      3.  **Locate 07070, NJ:** This zip code is in New Jersey, which is on the East
      Coast of the United States. The "07xxx" prefix clearly places it in the eastern
      part of the country.


      4.  **Locate 60652, IL:** This zip code is in Illinois, specifically Chicago.
      Illinois is in the Midwest of the United States. The "60xxx" prefix places it
