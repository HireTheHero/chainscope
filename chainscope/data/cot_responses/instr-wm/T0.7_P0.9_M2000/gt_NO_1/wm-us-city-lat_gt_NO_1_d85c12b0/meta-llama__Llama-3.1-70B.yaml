      - Copper Canyon, TX is a town in Denton County, which is also in the northern
      part of Texas.


      Given these relative positions within Texas, it''s likely that Lucas is generally
      north of Copper Canyon, as they are both in the northern part of the state.


      4. **Specific locations within Texas**:

      - Lucas, TX is approximately 20 miles northeast of Dallas, a major city in the
      northern part of Texas.

      - Copper Canyon, TX is approximately 20 miles north of Dallas.


      5. **Conclusion**:

      Given the general positions within Texas and the fact that both Lucas and Copper
      Canyon are in the northern part of the state, it''s reasonable to conclude that
      Lucas, TX is likely north of Copper Canyon, TX.


      However, the precise answer depends on the exact locations of these two towns
      within Texas. Since they are both in the northern part of the state, there''s
      a possibility that Copper Canyon could be at a similar latitude or even slightly
      north of Lucas if it''s located in the northern part of Denton County and Lucas
      is in the southern part of Collin County.


      Given the steps and considering the general geographic information without specific
      coordinates, the answer leans towards "YES" because, generally, Lucas is north
      of Copper Canyon based on their relative positions within the northern part
      of Texas. However, without exact coordinates, this conclusion is based on the
      general relationship between the two locations within the state rather than
      precise location data.


      **Answer: YES**

      of Copper Canyon, TX, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lucas and Copper Canyon are both in Texas (TX).


      2. **Understand the general geographic positions**: Texas is a large state in
      the southern United States. Its northern and southern boundaries can be quite
      far apart.


      3. **Consider the specific locations**: Without precise coordinates, we can
      only rely on general knowledge of the state''s geography.


      4. **Assess north-south orientation**: To determine if one location is north

      north of Kewaskum, WI, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Theresa and Kewaskum are both in Wisconsin (WI),
      which is a state in the Midwestern United States.


      2. **Understand geographical positions**: Wisconsin is generally located in
      the northern part of the United States, but we need to compare the specific
      locations within the state.


      3. **Use geographical references**: Without specific coordinates or a detailed
      map, we can rely on general geographical knowledge of Wisconsin''s layout. Theresa
      and Kewaskum are both in the southeastern part of Wisconsin.


      4. **Compare relative positions**: Based on general knowledge of Wisconsin''s
      geography, Kewaskum is generally located north of Theresa. Kewaskum is closer
      to the northern border of the state, while Theresa is more towards the center.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general geographical positions of Theresa and Kewaskum
      within Wisconsin, it''s reasonable to conclude that Kewaskum is located north
      of Theresa.


      Therefore, the answer to the question, "Is Theresa, WI located north of Kewaskum,

      \ Texas is in the southwestern United States, and Florida is in the southeastern\
      \ United States.\n\n3. **Consider the latitudes**: To be north, Port Lavaca\
      \ must have a higher latitude than Paradise Heights. Without specific coordinates,\
      \ we rely on general knowledge:\n   - Texas' latitude ranges approximately from\
      \ 25.5\xB0N to 36.5\xB0N.\n   - Florida's latitude ranges approximately from\
      \ 24.5\xB0N to 31\xB0N.\n\n4. **Specific locations within the states**:\n  \

      located in the southeastern part of the United States. It has a relatively narrow
      north-south extent compared to its east-west extent.


      3. **Consider the relative positions of Fort Lawn and Gayle Mill within South
      Carolina**: Without specific coordinates, we can use general knowledge about
      the state''s geography. Fort Lawn is in Chester County, which is in the northern
      part of South Carolina. Gayle Mill is in Greenville County, which is in the
      northwestern part of the state, but closer to the center.


      4. **Compare the latitudes**: To be north, Fort Lawn must have a higher latitude
      than Gayle Mill.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of South Carolina and the
      relative positions of Fort Lawn and Gayle Mill within the state, it is likely
      that Fort Lawn is located north of Gayle Mill. However, without exact coordinates,
      it''s not possible to give a definitive answer. The general north-south orientation
      of the state and the positions of the two locations suggest that Fort Lawn is
      indeed north of Gayle Mill.

      \ in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\n2. **Understand general geographical positions**:\
      \ Colorado is generally located west of Ohio, and within the United States,\
      \ locations to the west are generally considered to be north of locations to\
      \ the east. This is because the United States is oriented roughly north-south\
      \ along the eastern part of the country.\n\n3. **Specific locations within their\
      \ respective states**: Fruita, CO is in the western part of Colorado, while\
      \ Bridgetown, OH is in the southwestern part of Ohio. Considering the general\
      \ orientation of the United States, this suggests that Fruita, CO is likely\
      \ north of Bridgetown, OH.\n\n4. **Consider latitude**: To determine if one\
      \ location is north of another, we need to compare their latitudes. The higher\
      \ the latitude, the further north a location is.\n\nWithout specific coordinates,\
      \ we rely on general knowledge:\n- Colorado's latitude ranges approximately\
      \ from 37\xB0N to 41\xB0N.\n- Ohio's latitude ranges approximately from 38.4\xB0\
      N to 42\xB0N.\n\nGiven these ranges, it's possible for parts of Ohio to be north\
      \ of parts of Colorado, but without specific latitudes for Fruita and Bridgetown,\
      \ we must consider their relative positions based on their states.\n\n5. **Specific\
      \ locations within the states**:\n   - Fruita, CO is in the western part of\
      \ Colorado. Assuming it's not at the very southern tip of CO, its latitude would\
      \ likely be higher than the southern parts of Ohio.\n   - Bridgetown, OH, being\
      \ in the southwestern part of Ohio, could be at various latitudes within the\
      \ state but is likely more south than north given Ohio's geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion\
      \ based on state-level geography**:\nGiven the general westward position of\
      \ Colorado relative to Ohio and without specific information on the exact locations\
      \ of Fruita and Bridgetown, it's reasonable to infer that Fruita, CO, is likely\
      \ north of Bridgetown, OH, based solely on the states' general geographic relationship.\n\
      \nHowever, the precise answer depends on the exact latitudes of these two locations.\
      \ Since Ohio can extend as far north as Colorado, there's a possibility, depending\
      \ on the exact locations within their respective states, that Bridgetown could\
      \ be at a similar latitude or even slightly north of Fruita if it's located\
      \ in the northern part of Ohio and Fruita is in the southern part of Colorado.\n\
      \nGiven the steps and considering the general geographic information without\

      \ Texas.\n   - Vienna Bend, LA: This is a community in Natchitoches Parish,\
      \ Louisiana.\n\n2. **Understand the general geographical context**:\n   - Texas\
      \ (TX) is a state located in the southern United States, sharing a border with\
      \ Louisiana (LA) to the east.\n\n3. **Determine the relative positions of Texas\
      \ and Louisiana**:\n   - Texas is generally west and slightly south of Louisiana.\
      \ However, this doesn't necessarily mean that every location in Texas is north\
      \ of every location in Louisiana.\n\n4. **Consider specific locations within\
      \ each state**:\n   - Santa Anna, TX is in central Texas, which is still west\
      \ of Louisiana but not as far south as the southern tip of Texas.\n   - Vienna\
      \ Bend, LA is in northwestern Louisiana, which is relatively close to the border\
      \ with Texas.\n\n5. **Compare the latitudes**:\n   - To determine if one location\
      \ is north of another, we need to compare their latitudes. The higher the latitude,\
      \ the further north a location is.\n   - Texas's latitude ranges approximately\
      \ from 25.8\xB0N to 36.5\xB0N.\n   - Louisiana's latitude ranges approximately\
      \ from 28.9\xB0N to 33.0\xB0N.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the latitude\
      \ of Santa Anna, TX (in central Texas) is likely higher than the latitude of\
      \ Vienna Bend, LA (in northwestern Louisiana), it indicates that Santa Anna,\
      \ TX is likely located north of Vienna Bend, LA.\n\nTherefore, the answer to\
