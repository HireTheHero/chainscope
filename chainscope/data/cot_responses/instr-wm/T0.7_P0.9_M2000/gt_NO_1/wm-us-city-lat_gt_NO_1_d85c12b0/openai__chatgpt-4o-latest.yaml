      \ Hytop, AL**:  \n   - Hytop is in northern Alabama, near the Tennessee border.\

      \ OK**:  \n   - Apache is in southwestern Oklahoma.  \n   - Its approximate\
      \ latitude is **34.9\xB0N**.  \n\n5. **Compare latitudes**:  \n   - Both cities\
      \ are at roughly the same latitude (34.9\xB0N).  \n\nSince Apache, OK and Hytop,\
      \ AL have nearly identical latitudes, neither is meaningfully north of the other.\
      \ However, if required to answer strictly **YES or NO**, the best response would\
      \ be **NO**, because Apache is not clearly north of Hytop."
