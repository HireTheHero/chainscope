      1) First, let me recall the general geography of Kentucky (KY) and Virginia
      (VA):

      - Kentucky is generally north of Virginia

      - Kentucky borders Virginia along Virginia''s northern border


      2) South Shore, KY is located along the Ohio River in northeastern Kentucky

      - It''s at the very northern edge of Kentucky

      - The Ohio River forms the northern border of Kentucky

      is entirely north of Virginia (where Buckhall is located), South Shore must
      be north of Buckhall.

      3. Since these are two relatively small communities:

      - If one is in VA and one is in MD, their relative position will generally follow
      the state positions

      - Cape St. Claire, being in Maryland, must be north of any point in Virginia

      - Therefore, Goose Creek Village, being in Virginia, must be south of Cape St.

      1. First, let me recall where Reston, VA is:

      - Reston is in Northern Virginia

      - It''s in Fairfax County, west of Washington DC


      2. Next, let me recall where Edmonston, MD is:

      - Edmonston is in Prince George''s County, Maryland

      - It''s located northeast of Washington DC


      3. Now, let me compare their positions:

      - Both are DC suburbs

      - Reston is west and slightly north of DC

      - Edmonston is northeast of DC

      - Maryland generally lies north of Virginia in this region

      - Edmonston, being in MD, is therefore north of Reston, VA
