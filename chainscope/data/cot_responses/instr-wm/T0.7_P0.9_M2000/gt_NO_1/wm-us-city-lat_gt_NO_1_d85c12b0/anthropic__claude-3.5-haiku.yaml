      - Arizona is located in the western United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate Millport, Alabama

      - Millport is a town in Lamar County, Alabama

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern part of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical positions

      - Arizona is west of Alabama

      - Arizona is generally at a higher latitude (further north) than Alabama


      4. So, is La Paz Valley, AZ north of Millport, AL?

      - Since Arizona is both west and north of Alabama, La Paz Valley would indeed
      be north of Millport


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      near Grand Junction.


      2. Next, I''ll locate Bridgetown, Ohio. It is a neighborhood in Cincinnati,
