      2. Midway South, TX is in Texas.

      3. Florida is generally east of Texas.  Latitude is the north-south measure.

      4. Therefore, the question of whether Sunrise is *north* of Midway South depends
      on their relative latitudes.  Being further east doesn''t automatically make
      it north.

      5.  One needs to look up the latitudes of both cities to be certain.


      However, given the general location of Florida relative to Texas, it''s highly
      likely Sunrise, FL is further north than a town in southern Texas.


      I will therefore guess YES, though checking latitudes would be ideal for certainty.

    f1b089e6-ba9e-418e-9da4-b6e02361580e: '1. Fruita, CO is in Colorado.

      2. Bridgetown, OH is in Ohio.

      3. Colorado is west of Ohio.

      4. Latitude lines run east-west.  Therefore, a city''s north/south position
      is determined by its latitude.

      5.  Being further west doesn''t necessarily mean a city is further north. I
      need to consider the latitudes of the two cities.


      Therefore, simply knowing that Colorado is west of Ohio doesn''t give me the
      answer. I need more information.  I cannot answer YES or NO definitively without
      looking up the latitudes.
