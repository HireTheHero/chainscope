      2. Next, I''ll locate Holy Trinity Church in Manhattan

      - There are multiple churches with this name, but I''ll assume the one in Manhattan

      - Holy Trinity Church is located at 213 W 82nd Street on the Upper West Side


      3. Comparing their locations

      - 75 Rockefeller Plaza is in Midtown, around 50th Street

      - Holy Trinity Church is on 82nd Street

      - Both are in Manhattan, but in different neighborhoods


      4. Determining east/west position

      - 75 Rockefeller Plaza is east of Holy Trinity Church

      - This is because Rockefeller Plaza is closer to the East River, while Holy
      Trinity Church is further west


      5. Checking the reasoning

      - The location of 75 Rockefeller Plaza is definitively east of Holy Trinity
      Church


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
    a447aef2-60a6-4337-bfca-7c341d06f579: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate 75 Rockefeller Plaza:

      - This is in Midtown Manhattan

      - Specifically at Rockefeller Center

      - Located between 5th and 6th Avenues


      2. Next, locate Holy Trinity Church in Manhattan:

      - This church is located at 213 West 82nd Street

      - This is in the Upper West Side neighborhood


      3. Compare their geographic positions:

      - 75 Rockefeller Plaza is around 51st Street

      - Holy Trinity Church is at 82nd Street

      - This means 75 Rockefeller Plaza is significantly south of the church


      4. Consider east/west positioning:

      - 75 Rockefeller Plaza is between 5th and 6th Avenues

      - Holy Trinity Church is on West 82nd Street

      - This means 75 Rockefeller Plaza is east of the church''s location


      5. Conclusion:

      - 75 Rockefeller Plaza is indeed east of Holy Trinity Church

      in the Minato ward of Tokyo.


      3. Ginza Six is a large commercial complex located in the Ginza district, which
      is also in the Chuo ward of Tokyo.


      4. Looking at a map of Tokyo, Shiodome is west of Ginza.


      5. Therefore, Nittele Tower is west of Ginza Six, not east.


      The answer is: NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate Stratford International station and St James'' Church,
      Louth on a map.


      2. Stratford International station is located in East London, specifically in
      the Stratford area of the London Borough of Newham.


      3. St James'' Church is located in Louth, a town in Lincolnshire, which is in
