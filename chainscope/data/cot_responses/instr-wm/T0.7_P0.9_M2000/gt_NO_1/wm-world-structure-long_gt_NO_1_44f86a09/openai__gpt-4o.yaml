      is west of central London.

      - Tadworth is south of London, and generally slightly to the east when compared

      2. **Locate Tadworth railway station**: Tadworth railway station is located

      Now, considering east/west orientation:


      - Dollis Hill, being part of northwest London, is generally to the west of central
      London.

      1. **Location of Tianjin Modern City Office Tower**: The Tianjin Modern City
      Office Tower is located in Tianjin, a major city in northern China.


      2. **Location of the Great Wall of China**: The Great Wall of China stretches
      across northern China, running from west to east. It historically marks the
      boundary of the Chinese empire against northern invasions. The eastern parts
      of the wall are located near the Bohai Sea, which is also near Tianjin.


      3. **Relative Position**: Tianjin is located southeast of Beijing and relatively
      close to the eastern end of the Great Wall.
