      2) Next, I need to determine where Mustafa Castle is located

      - I''m not completely certain about the exact location of Mustafa Castle


      3) Without knowing the precise location of Mustafa Castle, I cannot determine
      whether Asan Barrage is east or west of it


      4) Therefore, I cannot make a definitive comparison of their relative positions


      Given this analysis, I cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer due to insufficient
      information about the location of Mustafa Castle.'

      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Shasta Dam is in Northern California, near Redding

      - Glide Memorial Church is in San Francisco


      2. Let me consider their relative positions:

      - San Francisco is on the west coast of California

      - Shasta Dam is inland, in the Sacramento River watershed

      - When comparing locations in California, anything inland is generally east
      of coastal locations


      3. Therefore, since Shasta Dam is inland from San Francisco (where Glide Memorial
      Church is), it must be east of the church.

    c6c1a6fb-1419-4733-a3cc-0e8d7e29a26f: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me locate both places in Arizona:

      - Cathedral of Saint Augustine is in downtown Tucson

      - Sahuarita Lake is in Sahuarita, a town south of Tucson


      2) Let me consider their positions:

      - The Cathedral of Saint Augustine is located in central Tucson

      - Sahuarita Lake is located in Sahuarita, which is slightly southeast of Tucson


      3) Looking more specifically at their relative positions:

      - The Cathedral is near Stone Avenue and Congress Street in Tucson

      - Sahuarita Lake is west of I-19 in Sahuarita

      - The Cathedral is actually west of I-19


      4) Final comparison:

      Since the Cathedral is west of I-19, and Sahuarita Lake is also west of I-19
      but further south, the Cathedral is not east of the lake.


      NO'

      - It''s located in downtown Tucson

      - Downtown Tucson is in the central part of the city


      2) Now, let me recall where Sahuarita Lake is:

      - Sahuarita Lake is in the town of Sahuarita

      - Sahuarita is located south of Tucson


      3) For east/west positioning:

      - Both Sahuarita Lake and the Cathedral are roughly along the same north-south
      corridor in the Santa Cruz Valley

      - Neither is significantly east or west of the other

      - They both lie close to I-19''s path


      4) However, since the Cathedral is in central Tucson, it sits slightly to the

      - In Manhattan, lower numbered avenues are further east


      6. Since 75 Rockefeller Plaza (between 5th-6th Aves) is east of Holy Trinity
      Church (near 8th Ave), the answer is:


      YES'
    5b0aee7f-6484-4569-a06d-feb2e066e185: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) 75 Rockefeller Plaza is located at 51st Street between 5th and 6th Avenues
      in Manhattan


      2) Holy Trinity Church (also known as Holy Trinity Lutheran Church) is located
      at 65th Street and Central Park West in Manhattan


      3) In Manhattan:

      - 5th/6th Avenues are east of Central Park West

      - Rockefeller Plaza (between 5th and 6th) is therefore east of Central Park

      - Holy Trinity Church is between 1st and 2nd Avenues on the Upper East Side

      - Being between 1st and 2nd Avenues means Holy Trinity is further east than

      - Altitude by Shangri-La is a luxury apartment complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka

      - The Sri Lankan Parliament Building is in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, which
      is the administrative capital


      2) Looking at their relative positions:

      - Altitude is located in central Colombo

      - The Parliament Building is in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, which is east of
      Colombo


      3) Therefore:

      - Since Altitude is in Colombo, and the Parliament Building is east of Colombo,
      Altitude must be west of the Parliament Building
