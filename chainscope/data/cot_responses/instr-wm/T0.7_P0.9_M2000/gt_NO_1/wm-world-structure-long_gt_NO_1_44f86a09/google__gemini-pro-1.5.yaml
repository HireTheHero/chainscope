      is a palace in Denmark. Gothenburg Cathedral is in Gothenburg, Sweden.


      2. **Relative positions of Denmark and Sweden:** Denmark is generally east of
      Sweden.


      3. **Specific locations within the countries:** While Denmark is mostly east
      of Sweden,  Ledreborg is on the island of Zealand.  Gothenburg is on the western
      coast of Sweden. The curvature of the coastline means Gothenburg is actually
      slightly north of Zealand. Ledreborg is thus slightly south and significantly
      east of Gothenburg.

      2. **Determine East/West Positioning:**  A quick map search shows St Machar''s
      Cathedral is slightly northeast of Kirk of St Nicholas. "Northeast" implies
      it is *both* north *and* east.


      3. **Evaluate the question:** The question asks if St Machar''s is *east* of
      St Nicholas. Since it is northeast, it is indeed east (as well as north).

      east than Seventeenth Church *along those respective streets*.

      75 Rockefeller Plaza is part of Rockefeller Center, which is generally between

      run north-south in Manhattan, and Broadway generally runs diagonally, but in

      located at Broadway and Wall Street.  Sixth Avenue is further east than Broadway,

      2. **Establish a general east-west orientation:**  Rockefeller Plaza is generally

      Plaza *might* be north of the church, but doesn''t tell us about east/west.

      3. **More precise locations:**  75 Rockefeller Plaza is between 51st and 52nd
      Streets, closer to 6th Avenue. Holy Trinity Church is at Wall Street and Broadway.

      4. **East-West comparison:** 6th Avenue is west of Broadway.

      3. **Determine East/West relationship:** If Altitude''s longitude is greater
      than the Parliament building''s, it''s east.


      Using a map or online search:


      * Altitude (Colombo City Centre) is located in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

      * The Sri Lankan Parliament Building is located in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte,
      Sri Lanka.


      Checking their locations reveals Altitude is in Colombo and the Parliament building
      is in a suburb of Colombo called Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte.  Colombo is west
      of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte.


      Therefore, Altitude is *west* of the Sri Lankan Parliament Building.


      NO

      2. **Stepney Green Station:** Located in East London, specifically Stepney.  Considerably
      closer to central London than Surrey Quays.


      3. **East of:**  On a map, East is to the right.  Therefore, something east
      of Stepney Green would be further right on the map.


      4. **Relative Locations:** Visualizing a map of London, Surrey Quays is south-east
      of central London, while Stepney Green is east-north-east of central London.
      Surrey Quays lies to the south and slightly east of Stepney Green.


      Therefore, Surrey Quays is *partially* east of Stepney Green, but also significantly
      south.  While it has an easterly component, it''s not purely east.

    78d50e17-a571-437a-9cb5-ac26377d76e4: '1. **Locate Yan Yean Reservoir:** Yan Yean
      Reservoir is located in north-central Victoria, Australia.


      2. **Locate Crossway Baptist Church:**  There are multiple Crossway Baptist
      Churches. Assuming the question refers to the prominent one in Melbourne, Australia.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Melbourne is generally south-east of Yan
      Yean Reservoir.


      4. **Consider "east":**  While Melbourne is south-EAST, the reservoir is significantly
      further north.  Therefore, Yan Yean Reservoir is not strictly *east* of the
      church in Melbourne. It''s more north-east.

      2. **Locate Crossway Baptist Church:** There are multiple Crossway Baptist Churches.
      I need to assume the question refers to the one most likely related to Yan Yean
      Reservoir due to proximity. A quick search reveals a Crossway Baptist Church
      in Doreen, Victoria, Australia.  This is a reasonable assumption given the location
      of the reservoir.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Doreen is generally south-west of Yan Yean
      Reservoir.


      4. **Answer the question:** Therefore, Yan Yean Reservoir is *not* east of Crossway
      Baptist Church (Doreen).

    ba938b3b-7dac-4d5e-b57d-31f901e94802: '1. **Locate Yan Yean Reservoir:**  Yan
      Yean Reservoir is located in Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne.


      2. **Locate Crossway Baptist Church:** There are likely multiple churches with
      this name.  Assuming the question refers to the prominent one in Burwood East,
      Victoria, Australia (a suburb of Melbourne).


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Burwood East is east of the Melbourne city
      center, while Yan Yean Reservoir is north of the city center.  Therefore, the
      reservoir is generally north-west of Burwood East.

    c57ad264-97ec-437c-abfe-2d871a7e70b1: '1. **Find the locations:** We need to determine
      the locations of Yan Yean Reservoir and Crossway Baptist Church.  A quick search
      shows Yan Yean Reservoir is in Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne.  Crossway
      Baptist Church appears to have several locations.  We''ll assume the question
      refers to the one in Burwood East, Victoria, Australia, also near Melbourne.


      2. **Determine relative positions:** Using a map (e.g., Google Maps), we can
      see that Yan Yean Reservoir is generally north of Melbourne, and Burwood East
      (where Crossway Baptist Church is located) is east of Melbourne.


      3. **East or not?**  Since Yan Yean Reservoir is north of Melbourne and Crossway
      Baptist Church is east of Melbourne, the reservoir is *not* east of the church.  It''s
      more north-west relative to the church.


      NO

      2. **Locate Crossway Baptist Church:** There are several Crossway Baptist Churches.
      Assuming the question refers to the one also in Melbourne, it''s located in
      the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne.


      3. **Compare East/West positioning:** Yan Yean Reservoir is considerably north
      and slightly west of Melbourne''s eastern suburbs.  Therefore, it lies to the
      west (and north) of Crossway Baptist Church (Melbourne).
