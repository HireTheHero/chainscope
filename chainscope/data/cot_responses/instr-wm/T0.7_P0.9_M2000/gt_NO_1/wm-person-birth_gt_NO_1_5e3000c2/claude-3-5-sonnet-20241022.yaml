      2) Agis III was king of Sparta from 338 BC to 331 BC

      the Great


      4) However, Agis III''s birth date is not precisely known, but he must have
      been born before becoming king in 338 BC


      5) Since Agis III had to be old enough to become king by 338 BC, he was almost

      1) Wu Shihuo was the father of Wu Zetian (624-705 CE), who became China''s only
      female emperor.


      2) Given that Wu Zetian was born in 624 CE, Wu Shihuo must have been born sometime
      in the late 6th century CE.


      3) Chu Liang lived during the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE).


      4) Therefore, Wu Shihuo (late 6th century CE) lived about 1000 years after Chu
      Liang (around 500 BCE).


      NO - Wu Shihuo was not born later than Chu Liang. I made a mistake in my reasoning.
      Chu Liang came first chronologically, so Wu Shihuo was actually born later.


      YES - Wu Shihuo was born later than Chu Liang.'

      3. Sabinus of Piacenza was a bishop of Piacenza who died around 420 CE. His
      birth date is not precisely known but he lived in the late 4th/early 5th century.


      4. Given that Huiyuan was born in 334 CE, and Sabinus was active in the late
      4th century, it''s very likely that Sabinus was born after 334 CE.


      Therefore: YES, Sabinus of Piacenza was most likely born later than Huiyuan.'

      1. First, let me identify when these people lived:


      2. Sabinus of Piacenza was a 4th century Christian bishop who died around 420
      CE. He likely was born in the mid-4th century (around 330-350 CE).


      3. Huiyuan was a Chinese Buddhist monk who lived from 334 to 416 CE. His birth
      date is well documented.


      4. Since Sabinus was born around 330-350 CE, and Huiyuan was born in 334 CE,
      they were roughly contemporaries.


      5. Based on the estimated birth date of Sabinus (330-350) and the precise birth
      date of Huiyuan (334), Sabinus was likely born before or around the same time
      as Huiyuan.


      NO (Sabinus was not born later than Huiyuan)'

      3. Huiyuan was a Chinese Buddhist monk who lived from 334 to 416 CE

      - Huiyuan: born in 334 CE, died in 416 CE


      5. While we don''t know Sabinus''s exact birth date, since they were contemporaries

      maturity, they were likely born within a few decades of each other.

      - Zbigniew ze Szczyrzyca was born around 1380

      - Anne of Bavaria (assuming this refers to Anne of Bavaria, Duchess of Luxembourg)
      was born in 1329

      - His birth date would have been in the late 7th century, likely around 680-690
      AD


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Saint Othmar was born around 689 AD

      - Hugbert was likely born around 680-690 AD

      - While exact birth dates are uncertain, they appear to be rough contemporaries


      4. Given the uncertainty and the close dates, we cannot definitively say that
      Saint Othmar was born later than Hugbert.


      NO (though with low confidence due to uncertain birth dates)'

      * Zhang Xian: ~200-114 BCE (over 2000 years ago)

      * Yan Shu: 991-1055 CE (about 1000 years ago)

      * Zhang Xian lived more than 1000 years BEFORE Yan Shu


      Answer: NO (Zhang Xian was born earlier, not later, than Yan Shu)'
