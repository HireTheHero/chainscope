      under the warlord Sun Quan of the state of Eastern Wu.

      - Sima Lang was a Chinese official during the Western Jin dynasty.

      1. **Marina of Aguas Santas**: I couldn''t find specific information about Marina
      of Aguas Santas. However, the title "Marina of Aguas Santas" suggests a connection
      to Aguas Santas, a town in Portugal. It''s possible that she was a local saint
      or figure associated with this region.


      2. **Lucian of Samosata**: Lucian of Samosata was a Syrian rhetorician and satirist
      who lived in the 2nd century AD. He was born around 125 AD in Samosata, which
      was then part of the Roman Empire.


      Given the lack of specific information about Marina of Aguas Santas, it''s challenging
      to compare her birth date with Lucian of Samosata. However, since Lucian of
      Samosata lived in the 2nd century AD, it''s likely that he was born before any
      figure associated with Aguas Santas, which is a town in modern-day Portugal.
      Portugal, as a nation, was not established until the 12th century, and the history
      of Aguas Santas is likely tied to the medieval period and beyond.


      Therefore, based on the available information and historical context, it''s
      reasonable to conclude that Lucian of Samosata was born earlier than Marina
      of Aguas Santas, if she is indeed a historical figure associated with Aguas
      Santas.

    1bb96c81-c038-47d1-ada5-2f0af5351e42: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the birth years of Yan Ying and Anaxandridas II.


      1. **Identify Yan Ying**: Yan Ying was a Chinese philosopher who lived during
      the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. He is known for his contributions
      to Confucianism and is often referred to as "Yanzi." Unfortunately, the exact
      birth year of Yan Ying is not well-documented, but he is believed to have lived
      around the 6th century BCE.


      2. **Identify Anaxandridas II**: Anaxandridas II was a king of Sparta who ruled
      during the 6th century BCE. He is mentioned in ancient Greek texts, including
      those of Herodotus. The exact birth year of Anaxandridas II is also not precisely
      known, but he was likely born sometime in the 6th century BCE.


      3. **Compare Birth Years**: Given that both Yan Ying and Anaxandridas II lived
      during the 6th century BCE, it''s challenging to determine which one was born
      later without more specific information. However, it''s worth noting that the
      6th century BCE spans 100 years, from 600 BCE to 501 BCE. So, if we assume that
      both figures were born somewhere within this century, it''s plausible that one
      could have been born later than the other.


      Based on the available information and the steps outlined above, it''s difficult
      to definitively answer whether Yan Ying was born later than Anaxandridas II.
      The lack of precise birth years for both individuals makes it challenging to
      provide a clear YES or NO answer.


      However, if we consider the broad time frame of the 6th century BCE and the
      possibility that one was born later than the other, it''s plausible to conclude
      that either one could have been born later than the other. Without more specific
      information, the answer would be speculative.

      1. **Identify Diogenes of Sinope**: Diogenes of Sinope was a Greek philosopher
      who lived in the 4th century BCE. He is considered one of the founders of the
      Cynic school of philosophy. His exact birth date is not known, but it is estimated
      to be around 412 BCE.


      2. **Identify Abdashtart I**: Abdashtart I was a Phoenician king of Sidon who
      reigned from 366 to 352 BCE. His birth date is not precisely known, but it is
      estimated to be around 390 BCE.


      3. **Compare Birth Dates**: Since Diogenes of Sinope was born around 412 BCE
      and Abdashtart I was born around 390 BCE, we can conclude that Diogenes of Sinope

      1. **Identify Xuanzang**: Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk, scholar, traveler,
      and translator who is known for his travels to India and his translations of
      Buddhist texts. He was born in 602 AD and died in 664 AD.


      2. **Identify Li Daozong**: Li Daozong was a Tang dynasty emperor of China who
      ruled from 763 to 779 AD. His birth date is not well-documented, but he was
      born during the Tang dynasty, which lasted from 618 to 907 AD.


      Given the birth dates:

      - Xuanzang was born in 602 AD.

      - Li Daozong was born sometime during the Tang dynasty, which started in 618
      AD.


      Since 602 AD (Xuanzang) is earlier than 618 AD (start of Tang dynasty when Li
      Daozong was born), the answer is: **NO**'

      Step 1: Identify the birth date of Theophanes of Mytilene. Theophanes of Mytilene
      was a Greek historian who lived during the 1st century BCE. He was a contemporary
      of Julius Caesar and is known for writing a history of the Gallic Wars. Unfortunately,

      Step 2: Identify the birth date of Cleopatra VI of Egypt. Cleopatra VI of Egypt
      was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty and the sister of Cleopatra VII, the famous
      queen of Egypt. She was born around 69 BCE.


      Step 3: Compare the birth dates. Since Theophanes of Mytilene''s birth date
      is not known, we cannot directly compare his birth date with Cleopatra VI of
      Egypt. However, we can make an educated guess based on the historical context.


      Theophanes of Mytilene was a contemporary of Julius Caesar, who lived from 100

      during the 1st century BCE. Cleopatra VI of Egypt was born around 69 BCE, which

      the birth dates of Wu Shihuo and Chu Liang.


      1. **Identify Wu Shihuo**: Wu Shihuo was a Chinese poet and painter during the
      Qing dynasty. He was born in 1659 and died in 1723.


      2. **Identify Chu Liang**: I couldn''t find any information on a historical
      figure named Chu Liang. However, there was a Chu Liang, also known as Chu Liang-shih,
      who was a Chinese poet during the Tang dynasty. He was born in 734 and died
      in 804.


      Given the birth dates:

      - Wu Shihuo was born in 1659.

      - Chu Liang was born in 734.


      Since 1659 (Wu Shihuo) is later than 734 (Chu Liang), the answer is: **YES**'

      the birth dates of Chadae and Liu Qing.


      1. **Identify Chadae**: Chadae is a historical figure from the Goguryeo period
      of Korean history. However, I couldn''t find any specific information about
      his birth date. The Goguryeo period spanned from 37 BCE to 668 CE, so Chadae''s
      birth date is likely within this range.


      2. **Identify Liu Qing**: Liu Qing was a Chinese official who lived during the
      Eastern Han dynasty. He was born in 78 CE and died in 139 CE.


      Given the birth dates:

      - Chadae: Unknown, but likely within the Goguryeo period (37 BCE to 668 CE).

      - Liu Qing: 78 CE.


      Since we don''t have a specific birth date for Chadae, we can''t definitively
      compare his birth date with Liu Qing''s. However, we know that Liu Qing was
      born in 78 CE, which falls within the Goguryeo period. Therefore, it''s possible
      that Chadae was born later than Liu Qing, but we can''t be certain without more
      specific information about Chadae''s birth date.

      and model. She was born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey.


      2. **Identify Bernd Baumgartl**: I couldn''t find any information about a historical
      figure named Bernd Baumgartl. It''s possible that this is a fictional character
      or a person who is not well-known in history.


      Given the birth dates:

      - Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963.


      Since Bernd Baumgartl''s birth date is not known, I cannot compare it to Whitney
      Houston''s birth date. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the
      question.
