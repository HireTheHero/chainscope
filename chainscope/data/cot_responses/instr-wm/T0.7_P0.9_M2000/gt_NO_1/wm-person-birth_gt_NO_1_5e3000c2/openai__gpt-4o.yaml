      during the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was born in the year 171 AD.


      2. **Zhu Ling**: Zhu Ling was a military general who served under the warlord
      Cao Cao during the late Eastern Han dynasty. There is limited information about
      his exact birth year. However, it''s generally understood that he was active
      during the same period as Sima Lang and Cao Cao, which suggests he was born
      around the same era or possibly a bit later.


      Given the lack of specific information about Zhu Ling''s birth year, but knowing
      that he was active during the same period, it is more likely that Zhu Ling was
      born later than 171 AD, the birth year of Sima Lang.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **YES**.'

      2. **Tang Situi**: Tang Situi was a Chinese official and scholar during the
      Ming dynasty. The Ming dynasty lasted from 1368 to 1644. Without exact birth
      details, we can infer that Tang Situi was likely born sometime in the late 14th
      century or early 15th century.


      Comparing the two:


      - Adeliza Basset was likely born in the early to mid-12th century.

      - Tang Situi was likely born in the late 14th century or early 15th century.


      Based on these estimations, Tang Situi was born significantly later than Adeliza
      Basset.


      **Answer: YES**'
    cc398723-0821-48ad-914b-84661b7d7083: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the birth years of both Tang Situi and Adeliza Basset.


      1. **Tang Situi**: Tang Situi was a Chinese scholar and official during the
      Yuan dynasty. The Yuan dynasty lasted from 1271 to 1368. However, specific birth
      and death years for Tang Situi are not widely documented, making it difficult
      to pinpoint his exact birth year. For the sake of this reasoning, we can assume
      he was active during the 13th or 14th century.


      2. **Adeliza Basset**: Adeliza Basset was an English noblewoman who lived during
      the 12th century. She is known to have been active during the reign of King
      Stephen of England, who ruled from 1135 to 1154. Therefore, Adeliza Basset was
      likely born in the early 12th century.


      Based on the above information, Tang Situi, who was active during the 13th or
      14th century, was almost certainly born later than Adeliza Basset, who lived
      during the early to mid-12th century.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      YES.'

      1. Wu Shihuo: He was the father of Wu Zetian, the only female emperor of China.
      Wu Shihuo lived during the Tang Dynasty. His exact birth year is not well-documented,
      but he lived during the early 7th century, dying in 635 AD.


      2. Chu Liang: There is no widely recognized historical figure by the name of
      Chu Liang. However, if you are referring to Chu Suiliang, a notable official

      - Wu Shihuo lived and was active in the early 7th century but lacks a specific
      birth year in available historical records.

      - Chu Suiliang was born in 596 AD.


      Given that Wu Shihuo''s fatherhood of Wu Zetian and his death in 635 suggest
      he was born around the late 6th century or very early 7th century, it is reasonable
      to conclude that Chu Suiliang was born earlier than Wu Shihuo.

      there might be some confusion or lack of information about his exact birth date.

      Shihuo was born later.

      figure from a similar or earlier period in China, it is likely that Yang Cishan
      was born later. However, without specific information about Yang Cishan, we
      cannot definitively conclude his birth year relative to Aimar V.


      Based on what is generally known:

      - **Aimar V of Limoges** is likely to have been born in the 12th century.

      - **Yang Cishan** is not clearly identified in common historical records available,
      making it hard to pinpoint a birth year.


      Given the limitations in identifying Yang Cishan without additional context,
      I cannot definitively say YES or NO. However, based on general historical timelines,
      many figures with the surname Yang in Chinese history could have been born after
      the 12th century. Therefore, assuming Yang Cishan is not an early historical
      figure, the answer would likely be:


      **YES**'

      that Sun Guoting was born before Abbas ibn Ali.


      Thus, the answer is NO, Sun Guoting was not born later than Abbas ibn Ali.'
