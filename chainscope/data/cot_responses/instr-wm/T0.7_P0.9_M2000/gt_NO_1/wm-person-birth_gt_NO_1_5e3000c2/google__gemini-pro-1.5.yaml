      need to know if he was born *later* than Joseph of Tiberias was *born*.

      Albrecht III (if 1413 is correct) or after (if closer to 1418).  However, even
      taking the earliest possible date for Wenceslaus, there is a very small window

      Zhang Qian was a Chinese diplomat and explorer who lived during the Han dynasty.
      His journeys are generally placed in the 2nd century BCE.  More specifically,
      he''s considered to have lived approximately between 164 BCE and 113 BCE.


      2. **Find approximate dates for Judah Maccabee:** Judah Maccabee was a Jewish
      leader who led the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire. He lived in
      the 2nd century BCE and died around 160 BCE.


      3. **Compare the dates:**  Zhang Qian lived approximately between 164 BCE and
      113 BCE. Judah Maccabee died around 160 BCE.  Therefore, there is an overlap
      in their lifetimes.  Zhang Qian''s earliest birth year (164 BCE) is after Judah
      Maccabee''s death (around 160 BCE).
