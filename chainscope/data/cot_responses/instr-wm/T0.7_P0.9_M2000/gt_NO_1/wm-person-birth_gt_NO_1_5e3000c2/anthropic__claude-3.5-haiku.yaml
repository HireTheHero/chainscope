    acfffa08-b33f-43b7-8da2-5b7d93caff89: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Arsinoe III and Ptolemy IV Philopator were both members of the Ptolemaic
      dynasty of Egypt.


      2. Ptolemy IV Philopator was Arsinoe III''s husband and also her brother (as
      was common in Ptolemaic royal marriages).


      3. Arsinoe III was actually the daughter of Ptolemy III Euergetes and Berenice
      II.


      4. Ptolemy IV Philopator was the son of the same parents, Ptolemy III and Berenice
      II.


      5. Since they were siblings born to the same parents, Arsinoe III could not
      have been born later than Ptolemy IV.


      6. In fact, Ptolemy IV was the older sibling who became pharaoh, and he married
      his sister Arsinoe III.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Arsinoe III was not born later than Ptolemy IV
      Philopator.'

      4. Since she was his sister, she would have been born around the same time or
