      Logan County.


      2. **Strait of Sicily**: The Strait of Sicily is a body of water that separates
      the island of Sicily from the southern coast of mainland Italy.


      Next, we need to assess the relative positions of these two locations:


      - Indian Lake is in the Northern Hemisphere, specifically in North America.

      - The Strait of Sicily is located in the Mediterranean Sea, between Italy and
      Sicily, also in the Northern Hemisphere but in Europe.


      Given that Ohio is located much further west than Italy, and the Strait of Sicily
      is to the east of Indian Lake, we can conclude that Indian Lake is not east
      of the Strait of Sicily.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'

      Therefore, since Jyotisar is to the east of Qattara Depression, the answer to
      the question "Is Qattara Depression located east of Jyotisar?" is:


      **NO**.'

      is located east of Jyotisar, we need to identify the locations of both places:


      1. **Qattara Depression:** This is located in the northwestern part of Egypt,
      specifically in the Western Desert. It is one of the lowest points in Africa
      and is known for its unique geological features.


      2. **Jyotisar:** This is a village in India, located in the state of Gujarat.
      It is known for its historical significance and is situated southwest of the
      Qattara Depression.


      Next, we analyze their relative positions:


      - Given that the Qattara Depression is in Egypt and Jyotisar is in India, they
      are situated in different countries and continents.

      - Specifically, Jyotisar is located to the southeast of the Qattara Depression.

      fact that they are in different countries, it is not meaningful to establish
      a directional relationship (such as east or west) between them.


      Based on this reasoning, since they are not in the same geographical context,
      the question of whether Rewalsar Lake is east of the Yatsugatake Mountains does
      not apply in a conventional sense.

      of the Indian subcontinent.

      - **Taurus Mountains** in Turkey are situated to the west of the Indian subcontinent.


      Given that Turkey is to the west of India, it follows that the Taurus Mountains
      cannot be east of Brahma Sarovar.

      1. **Brahma Sarovar** is located in India, specifically in the state of Haryana,
      near the town of Thanesar.


      2. **Taurus Mountains** (or Toros Mountains) are located in southern Turkey.


      Now, we need to assess their relative positions:


      - Brahma Sarovar is in India, which is to the east of Turkey.

      - The Taurus Mountains are situated in Turkey, which lies to the west of India.


      Given this information:


      - Turkey (where the Taurus Mountains are located) is west of India (where Brahma
      Sarovar is located).


      Thus, the Taurus Mountains cannot be east of Brahma Sarovar.


      The answer is **NO**.'
