      Step 1: Shadow Mountain Lake is located in Grand County, Colorado, in the western
      United States.


      Step 2: Sourland Mountain is located in central New Jersey, in the eastern United
      States.


      Step 3: Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Colorado is in the central-western
      part of the United States, Sourland Mountain is significantly farther east than
      Shadow Mountain Lake.


      Therefore, Shadow Mountain Lake is not east of Sourland Mountain.

      city.


      Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


      - Japan is located to the east of Nepal on the world map.

      - Therefore, Lake Okutama, being in Japan, is significantly east of Nagdaha
      in Nepal.

    0e49073d-5db7-4aa7-842d-efde5729dd39: 'To determine whether the Calapooya Mountains
      are located east of Wazee Lake, we need to:


      1. Identify the location of the Calapooya Mountains.

      2. Identify the location of Wazee Lake.

      3. Compare their relative positions to assess if the Calapooya Mountains are
      east of Wazee Lake.


      Step 1: The Calapooya Mountains are a mountain range located in southwestern
      Oregon, in the United States. They lie primarily in Douglas and Lane counties.


      Step 2: Wazee Lake is located in Jackson County, Wisconsin, also in the United
      States. It is known as the deepest lake in Wisconsin and was formed from a former
      iron mine.


      Step 3: Now, compare their locations:

      - The Calapooya Mountains are in Oregon, on the west coast of the U.S.

      - Wazee Lake is in Wisconsin, which is in the north-central part of the U.S.,
      significantly east of Oregon.


      Therefore, the Calapooya Mountains are west of Wazee Lake.


      Answer: NO.'

      Now, consider the relative positions:


      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States.


      Therefore, geographically, Briones Reservoir is located significantly to the
      west of Lake Tillery.


      So, the answer to the question "Is Briones Reservoir located east of Lake Tillery?"
      is:


      **NO**.'

      1. Identify the location of Briones Reservoir.

      2. Identify the location of Lake Tillery.

      3. Compare their longitudes to determine relative east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Briones Reservoir is located in Contra Costa County, in northern California,
      USA. It is part of the East Bay region near San Francisco.


      Step 2: Lake Tillery is located in North Carolina, USA. It is along the Pee
      Dee River in the central part of the state.


      Step 3: Now compare their geographic positions:

      - Briones Reservoir (California) is far west in the United States.

      - Lake Tillery (North Carolina) is on the east coast of the United States.


      Since California is west of North Carolina, Briones Reservoir is west of Lake
      Tillery.
