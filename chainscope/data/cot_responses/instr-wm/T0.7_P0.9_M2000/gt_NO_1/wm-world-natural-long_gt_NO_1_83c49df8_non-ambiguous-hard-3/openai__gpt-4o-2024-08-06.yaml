      2. **Sourland Mountain:** This is a mountain ridge located in central New Jersey,
      United States. It stretches across parts of Hunterdon, Mercer, and Somerset
      counties.


      Next, we need to establish the relative positions of Colorado and New Jersey
      within the United States:


      - Colorado is located in the western part of the United States.

      - New Jersey is located in the eastern part of the United States.


      Given these locations, Shadow Mountain Lake in Colorado is west of Sourland
      Mountain in New Jersey.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Shadow Mountain Lake located east
      of Sourland Mountain?" is:


      NO.'
    adeb9e7e-7c00-496f-8e93-5ba021056281: 'To determine whether Shadow Mountain Lake

      of lakes in the Rocky Mountain region.


      2. **Sourland Mountain** is located in New Jersey, USA. It is part of a small
      mountain range in the northeastern United States.


      Now, considering the general geography of the United States:


      - Colorado is located in the western part of the United States.

      - New Jersey is located in the eastern part of the United States.


      Given this information, Shadow Mountain Lake, being in Colorado, is west of
      Sourland Mountain, which is in New Jersey.


      So, the answer to the question is NO. Shadow Mountain Lake is not located east
      of Sourland Mountain.'

      1. **Locate the Strait of Sicily:** The Strait of Sicily is located in the Mediterranean
      Sea between the island of Sicily (part of Italy) and the North African coast.
      It is situated at approximately 12-13 degrees east longitude.


      2. **Locate Indian Lake, Ohio:** Indian Lake is in the United States, specifically

      The longitude for Indian Lake, Ohio, is approximately 83-84 degrees west.


      3. **Compare the Longitudes:** The Strait of Sicily is at about 12-13 degrees
      east, while Indian Lake, Ohio, is at about 83-84 degrees west.


      Since west longitudes increase from the Prime Meridian (0 degrees) moving westward
      and east longitudes increase moving eastward from the Prime Meridian, all locations
      in the Western Hemisphere (like Indian Lake, Ohio) are west of locations in
      the Eastern Hemisphere (like the Strait of Sicily).


      Therefore, Indian Lake, Ohio, is located west of the Strait of Sicily.

      the Central Panay Mountain Range is in the Philippines (Asia), they are on different
      continents.


      4. **Relative Positioning**: Lake Hayq is geographically located far west of

      - The Gulf of Mannar, being between India and Sri Lanka, is situated to the
      northwest of the Philippines.

      - Lake Balanan is located in the Philippines, which is to the east of India

      Wheeler Lake, but a well-known Wheeler Lake is located in the Mosquito Range
      of the Rocky Mountains in central Colorado, near the town of Alma.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Boca Reservoir, being in California,
      is located west of the Rocky Mountains and therefore west of Colorado. Consequently,
      Boca Reservoir is west of Wheeler Lake in Colorado.

      in Jasper National Park in the province of Alberta, Canada. Alberta is in the
      western part of Canada.


      2. **Identify the location of Cobequid Bay**: Cobequid Bay is part of the larger
