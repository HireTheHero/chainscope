      determine the relative locations of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Lac Courte Oreilles.

      Lac Courte Oreilles is a lake located in northwestern Wisconsin, USA, in North
      America.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lough Sheelin.

      Lough Sheelin is a lake located in Ireland, in western Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a global map.

      When looking at a world map, North America is to the west of Europe across the
      Atlantic Ocean. Wisconsin, USA (where Lac Courte Oreilles is located) is in
      the central-eastern part of North America, while Ireland (where Lough Sheelin
      is located) is in western Europe.


      Step 4: Determine east-west relationship.

      Since Ireland is east of Wisconsin across the Atlantic Ocean, Lough Sheelin
      is east of Lac Courte Oreilles.


      NO (Lac Courte Oreilles is not east of Lough Sheelin; rather, it is west of
      Lough Sheelin)'

      Step 1: Identify the location of Lac Courte Oreilles.

      Lac Courte Oreilles is a lake located in northwestern Wisconsin in the United
      States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lough Sheelin.

      Lough Sheelin is a lake located in Ireland, in the northern central part of
      the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Wisconsin is in North America, which is west of Ireland (which is in Europe).
      The United States is west of Ireland across the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, Lac
      Courte Oreilles (in Wisconsin, USA) is west of Lough Sheelin (in Ireland).


      Step 4: Answer the specific question: Is Lac Courte Oreilles located east of
      Lough Sheelin?

      Since Lac Courte Oreilles is west of Lough Sheelin (not east), the answer is:


      NO'

      The United States is located in the Western Hemisphere, while Ireland is in
      the Eastern Hemisphere. On a world map, Ireland (and thus Lough Sheelin) is
      east of Wisconsin (and thus Lac Courte Oreilles).

      Detroit Lake could refer to a lake in Oregon or Minnesota. The more well-known
      Detroit Lake is in Oregon, located in the western part of the state in the Cascade

      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - If we''re referring to Detroit Lake in Oregon: Oregon is on the west coast
      of the United States, while Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region. Oregon
      is definitely west of Michigan, so Detroit Lake in Oregon would be west of Walloon
      Lake in Michigan.

      - If we''re referring to Detroit Lake in Minnesota: Minnesota is west of Michigan,
      so Detroit Lake in Minnesota would also be west of Walloon Lake in Michigan.


      In either case, Detroit Lake (whether in Oregon or Minnesota) is located west

      Step 1: Determine the location of Lake Habbaniyah.

      Lake Habbaniyah is located in Iraq, in the Middle East. Specifically, it''s
      in western Iraq, near the city of Fallujah.


      Step 2: Determine the location of the Tanggula Mountains.

      The Tanggula Mountains are located in Asia, specifically on the border between
      Tibet (China) and Qinghai province in China. They are part of the Tibetan Plateau.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Iraq is in the Middle East, while the Tanggula Mountains are in central/eastern
      Asia. Looking at a world map, Iraq is significantly west of Tibet/China.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Lake Habbaniyah is in Iraq (Middle East) and the Tanggula Mountains are
      in Tibet/China (further east in Asia), Lake Habbaniyah is located WEST of the
      Tanggula Mountains, not east.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Hamun Lake.

      Hamun Lake (also called Hamun-e Helmand) is a shallow lake/wetland system located
      primarily in eastern Iran and western Afghanistan, near their border.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Karbi Anglong Plateau.

      Karbi Anglong Plateau is located in northeastern India, specifically in the
      state of Assam.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Iran and Afghanistan are in the Middle East/Central Asia region.

      - India is in South Asia, east of the Middle East.

      - Specifically, northeastern India (where Karbi Anglong is) is located significantly
      east of Iran/Afghanistan (where Hamun Lake is).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Hamun Lake is in Iran/Afghanistan and Karbi Anglong Plateau is in northeastern
      India, Hamun Lake is located to the west of Karbi Anglong Plateau, not to the

      Hamun Lake (also called Hamun-e Helmand) is a seasonal lake and wetland area
      primarily located in eastern Iran and western Afghanistan, near the borders
      with Pakistan.


      Step 2: Locate Karbi Anglong Plateau.

      Karbi Anglong Plateau is located in the northeastern Indian state of Assam.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Hamun Lake is in eastern Iran/western Afghanistan, which places it in the
      Middle East/Central Asia region.

      - Karbi Anglong Plateau is in northeastern India, which is in South Asia.

      - Geographically, northeastern India (where Karbi Anglong is) lies east of Iran
      and Afghanistan (where Hamun Lake is).


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Karbi Anglong Plateau is located east of Hamun Lake (not the other way
      around), Hamun Lake is NOT east of Karbi Anglong Plateau.

      - Hamun Lake (also called Hamun-e Helmand) is located in eastern Iran and western
      Afghanistan, in a basin on the Iran-Afghanistan border.

      - Karbi Anglong Plateau is located in the northeastern Indian state of Assam.

      - Iran and Afghanistan are in West Asia/Middle East.

      - Assam, India is in South Asia, specifically in the northeastern part of India.

      - Geographically, northeastern India (where Karbi Anglong is) is east of Iran/Afghanistan
      (where Hamun Lake is).


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      - Hamun Lake is further west (in Iran/Afghanistan)

      - Karbi Anglong Plateau is further east (in northeastern India)

      Step 1: Identify the location of Loch Long.

      Loch Long is a sea loch located in Scotland, United Kingdom, in western Europe.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Seliger.

      Lake Seliger is located in Russia, in eastern Europe.

      The United Kingdom (where Loch Long is) is located in western Europe, while
      Russia (where Lake Seliger is) is located in eastern Europe. Moving from west
      to east in Europe, we would go from the UK toward Russia.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Loch Long is in the UK (western Europe) and Lake Seliger is in Russia
      (eastern Europe), Loch Long must be west of Lake Seliger, not east of it.

      - Packwood Lake is located in Washington state, in the western United States.

      - Navesink Highlands (also called Atlantic Highlands or Navesink Hills) is located
      in New Jersey, on the eastern coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Washington state is on the west coast of the United States.

      - New Jersey is on the east coast of the United States.

      - Moving from east to west across the continental United States, you would encounter
      New Jersey first, then Washington state much later.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since Washington (where Packwood Lake is) is west of New Jersey (where Navesink
      Highlands is), Packwood Lake must be west of Navesink Highlands, not east.
