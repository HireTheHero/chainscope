      to determine its general longitude. Spain is in Western Europe, so Puig Campana
      will have a longitude close to 0 degrees, but slightly East (positive).


      2. **Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains:** Located in Tibet. Tibet is east of Spain,
      and well into the Eastern Hemisphere. Therefore, Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains
      will have a significantly positive longitude, much greater than Puig Campana''s.


      3. **Eastward Direction:**  Moving eastward means increasing longitude.


      4. **Comparison:** Since Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains has a greater longitude
      than Puig Campana, Puig Campana is *west* of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains.
