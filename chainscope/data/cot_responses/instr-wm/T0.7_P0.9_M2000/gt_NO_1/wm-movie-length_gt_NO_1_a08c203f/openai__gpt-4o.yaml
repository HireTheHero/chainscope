      in 1962. Most Tom and Jerry shorts from this era are around 6 to 7 minutes long.


      2. **Friz Freleng''s "Devil''s Feud Cake"**: This is a Looney Tunes short featuring
      Yosemite Sam and the Tasmanian Devil, released in 1963. The runtime of this
      short is around 7 minutes.


      Comparing the typical runtimes, both cartoons are approximately the same length.
      However, without precise times for each, it''s reasonable to conclude that neither
      is significantly longer than the other based on typical runtimes for shorts
      from this era.


      Therefore, the answer is NO; "Tall in the Trap" is not longer than "Devil''s
      Feud Cake."'

      look at the runtimes of both animated shorts.


      1. **Tall in the Trap**: This is a Tom and Jerry cartoon directed by Gene Deitch,
      released in 1962. Most of the Tom and Jerry shorts directed by Deitch are around
      6 to 7 minutes long.


      2. **Devil''s Feud Cake**: This is a Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Friz Freleng,
      released in 1963. Typical Looney Tunes shorts from this era are approximately
      6 to 8 minutes long.


      Both cartoons are in a similar range of runtime, but there is no standard official
      source detailing the exact length of every single short. However, generally
      speaking, Looney Tunes shorts, like "Devil''s Feud Cake," can be slightly longer
      than the Tom and Jerry shorts by Gene Deitch.


      Given this general understanding, it''s reasonable to conclude that they are
      approximately the same length, but "Devil''s Feud Cake" could be slightly longer.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, Gene Deitch''s "Tall in the Trap"
      is not longer than Friz Freleng''s "Devil''s Feud Cake."'

      the total runtime of Alper Mestci''s Sijjin series with the total runtime of
      the Housefull franchise directed by Sajid Khan.


      1. **Sijjin Series**: Alper Mestci directed a series of horror films known as
      Sijjin (or Siccin). As of my last update, there are six films in the Sijjin
      series. We would need to know the runtime of each film and sum them up to get
      the total runtime for the series.


      2. **Housefull Franchise**: Sajid Khan directed the first two films of the Housefull
      franchise: Housefull (2010) and Housefull 2 (2012). The franchise continued
      with other directors, but we need to focus on the films directed by Sajid Khan
      only.


      3. **Comparison**: After calculating the total runtime of the Sijjin series
      and the Housefull films directed by Sajid Khan, we compare the two.


      Given that the Sijjin series consists of multiple films and Sajid Khan directed
      only the first two films in the Housefull franchise, it is likely that the Sijjin
      series has a longer total runtime.

      Golden Collection: Volume 3" is longer than the "Race" franchise''s movie "Race
      2," we need to look at the runtime of each.


      1. **Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3**: This is a collection
      of animated shorts, and while the exact runtime can vary based on the specific
      shorts included, generally, these types of DVD collections can have a runtime
      of several hours, often around 300-400 minutes or more.


      2. **Race 2**: This is a standalone film in the "Race" franchise and has a typical
      feature film length. "Race 2" has a runtime of approximately 150 minutes.


      Given these estimations, the collection of shorts in "Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes
      Golden Collection: Volume 3" is likely to be significantly longer than the runtime
      of the single film "Race 2."


      Therefore, the answer is YES, "Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection:

      1. **Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3**: This is a collection
      of animated shorts, not a single movie. The Looney Tunes Golden Collection:
      Volume 3 typically contains several hours of content since it includes multiple
      animated shorts from the Looney Tunes series.


      2. **Race 2''s Race franchise**: The Race franchise consists of several Bollywood
      films. As of now, the Race franchise includes three main films: "Race" (2008),
      "Race 2" (2013), and "Race 3" (2018). Each movie is typically about 2 to 2.5
      hours long.


      3. **Comparison**: The total runtime of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection:
      Volume 3, which includes multiple shorts, is likely to be comparable to or longer

      feature-length films, would have a combined runtime significantly longer than
      the total runtime of the Looney Tunes collection.

      animated shorts. The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 consists of multiple
      discs with numerous short films, amounting to several hours of content.


      2. **Race 2** - This is a Bollywood film released in 2013. The runtime of "Race

      To answer the question, we compare the runtime of the entire "Looney Tunes Golden

      1. "Southern Fried Rabbit" is a Merrie Melodies cartoon released in 1953. Like
      most Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes shorts from that era, it typically runs
      around 7 to 8 minutes.


      2. "The Mouse from H.U.N.G.E.R" is a Tom and Jerry cartoon released in 1967.
      Standard Tom and Jerry shorts also run approximately 7 to 8 minutes in length.

      are likely very close, typically around the same length. However, there is no
      specific evidence to suggest that one is definitively longer than the other

      Therefore, without precise runtime data, it''s not possible to definitively
      state that one is longer than the other based on typical lengths for shorts

      different from each other, typically adhering to the standard format.


      Based on their nature and typical runtime, "Zipping Along" and "Scrambled Aches"
      are roughly the same length, with no significant difference in runtime that
      would result in one being notably longer than the other.


      Thus, the answer is NO, "Zipping Along" is not longer than "Scrambled Aches."'
    f8f45107-1497-4935-9af2-8102e3cfb481: 'To determine whether "Zipping Along" is
      longer than "Scrambled Aches," let''s first identify the lengths of each cartoon.


      1. **"Zipping Along"** - Directed by Chuck Jones, this cartoon was released
      in 1953. It is a typical Warner Bros. animated short featuring Wile E. Coyote
      and the Road Runner. Most of these cartoons run approximately 6-7 minutes.


      2. **"Scrambled Aches"** - Also directed by Chuck Jones, this cartoon was released
      in 1957. Like "Zipping Along," it features Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner
      and typically runs around 6-7 minutes as well.


      Both cartoons are standard short films produced by Warner Bros. during this
      era and usually have a similar runtime. Therefore, they should each be around
      6-7 minutes long. Without specific minute details indicating a difference, we
      assume they are roughly the same length.


      Based on typical runtimes and without specific data indicating otherwise, the
      answer is:


      NO, "Zipping Along" is not longer than "Scrambled Aches."'

      1. **The Abominable Snow Rabbit (1961)**: This is a Looney Tunes cartoon featuring
      Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Typically, Looney Tunes shorts from this era run
      about 6 to 7 minutes in length.


      2. **Rabbit''s Feat (1960)**: This is another Looney Tunes cartoon featuring
      Bugs Bunny and Wile E. Coyote. Similarly, Looney Tunes shorts from this period
      also generally run about 6 to 7 minutes long.


      Both of these shorts are typical in length for Looney Tunes cartoons of their
