      2. Find their runtimes:

      - "And Quiet Flows the Don" is a three-part film with a total runtime of approximately
      330 minutes (5.5 hours)

      - "Fifty Shades of Grey" has a runtime of 125 minutes (about 2 hours)

      YES

      1. First, I need to find the runtime of "God of Gamblers 3: The Early Stage"
      (1996)

      - This Hong Kong film runs for approximately 100 minutes


      2. Next, I need to find the runtime of "Times Square" (1980)

      - This film runs for 111 minutes


      3. Now I can compare:

      - God of Gamblers 3: 100 minutes

      - Times Square: 111 minutes

      - 100 is less than 111


      Therefore, God of Gamblers 3: The Early Stage is NOT longer than Times Square.
