      need to find the duration of the Tamil film Pudhiya Mannargal, directed by Vikraman.

      2. **Find the runtime of Yuvakudu:** I need to find the duration of the Telugu
      film Yuvakudu, directed by A. Karunakaran.

      3. **Compare the runtimes:** Once I have both durations, I can compare them
      to see which is longer.


      Unfortunately, I don''t have access to a real-time database of movie runtimes.
      I''d need to look this information up online.  *Assuming* I find the information
      and Pudhiya Mannargal is longer, I''d answer YES, otherwise NO.  Without access
      to those durations, I can''t give a definitive answer.

      Hindi film "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" directed by Ashim Samanta.


      2. **Find the runtimes:** Research is needed to find the duration of each film.


      3. **Compare the runtimes:** Once the runtimes are known, we can compare them
      to determine which movie is longer.


      4. **Answer the question:** Based on the comparison, we can answer YES or NO.


      According to available information, "Om" has a runtime of approximately 2 hours
      and 30 minutes (150 minutes), while "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" appears to be a song,
      not a movie.  There is a movie called "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" released in 1972,
      however, this was directed by Ramanand Sagar, not Ashim Samanta.  Therefore,
      the question premise is flawed.


      However, assuming the question meant to compare Upendra''s "Om" to Ramanand
      Sagar''s "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho", further research indicates a runtime of approximately
      2 hours and 45 minutes (165 minutes) for the latter.


      Since 150 minutes (Om) is less than 165 minutes (Ankhon Mein Tum Ho), the answer
      is NO.

    c2e3cd68-3e2b-418f-95dd-e7cdb1402cef: '1. **Identify the movies:** We need to
      find the runtimes of the Kannada movie "Om" directed by Upendra and the Hindi
      song "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" (presumably from a movie, but likely referring to
      its music video length).


      2. **Recognize the unit mismatch:** Movie lengths are typically measured in
      minutes (or hours and minutes), while song lengths are usually in minutes and
      seconds.


      3. **Infer the question''s intent:** The question likely intends to compare
      the movie "Om" with the *movie* containing the song "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho", not
      just the song itself.  It''s unlikely someone would compare a movie''s length
      to a single song''s length.  Finding the movie associated with the song is crucial.  "Ankhon
      Mein Tum Ho" is from the Hindi film *Don*.


      4. **Find the runtimes:** Now we need the durations of *Om* and *Don* (1978).


      5. **Compare the runtimes:**  Assuming the runtime of *Om* is feature-film length
      (around 2-3 hours) and *Don* is also a standard feature film, it''s more likely
      than not that the movie *Om* is longer than the music video for the song, AND
      also longer than the movie *Don* itself. However, without the precise runtimes,
      a definitive answer is impossible.


      However, since the question specifically mentions Ashim Samanta''s "Ankhon Mein
      Tum Ho," it''s highly probable the question refers to the 1978 film *Don* directed
      by Chandra Barot, for which Ashim Samanta provided music.


      Assuming this is the intended comparison, research shows:


      * *Om* (1995) has a runtime of approximately 158 minutes.

      * *Don* (1978) has a runtime of approximately 141 minutes (some sources list
      it as 128 or 156 minutes).


      Therefore, depending on which source for *Don*''s runtime is used, *Om* could
      be either slightly longer or slightly shorter.


      With the most common runtimes found:

      cannot be made.  As the question asks if the *film* "Om" is longer than the
      *film* "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho", and the latter doesn''t appear to be a film, the

      sounds like a science fiction film.  This suggests a potential difference in
      typical runtimes.


      2. **Consider the nature of "Three from Prostokvashino":**  Being a series,
      it''s composed of multiple episodes.  The total runtime of the *entire series*
      would likely be longer than a single feature film.


      3. **The question''s ambiguity:** The question doesn''t specify a particular
      episode of "Three from Prostokvashino".  It''s comparing the series (presumably
      the total runtime of all episodes) to a single film.


      Therefore, assuming "Rendezvous in Space" is a single feature film and "Three
      from Prostokvashino" refers to the entire series, the answer is likely YES.

      2. **Consider the nature of "Three from Prostokvashino":**  While the series

      likely around 10-20 minutes each.


      3. **Consider likely runtime of "Rendezvous in Space":** Even a short science
      fiction film would likely be at least an hour long.

      when their runtimes are combined, would almost certainly be longer than a single
      film.

      from Prostokvashino" is an animated film series, while "Rendezvous in Space"
      sounds like a science fiction film.  It''s unusual to compare lengths across
      such different genres, especially since "Three from Prostokvashino" is a series.


      2. **Consider the "series" aspect:**  A series implies multiple episodes.  The
      total runtime of all "Three from Prostokvashino" episodes would likely be longer
      than a single feature film.


      3. **Look for information about "Rendezvous in Space":** A quick search doesn''t
      reveal a Frank Capra film with this title.  It''s possible this film doesn''t
      exist, or has a different title.


      4. **Conclusion:** Given that "Three from Prostokvashino" is a series and likely
      has a substantial cumulative runtime, even if "Rendezvous in Space" *does* exist,
      it''s highly probable that the total runtime of the Prostokvashino series is

      2. **Consider typical movie lengths:** Animated films, especially those aimed
      at children (like Prostokvashino likely is), tend to be shorter than feature-length
      science fiction films.


      3. **Look for information:** A quick search reveals "Three from Prostokvashino"
      refers to a series of three short animated films, each around 20 minutes long.  There''s
      no readily available information about a film called "Rendezvous in Space" by
      Frank Capra.  Capra is known for films like "It''s a Wonderful Life" which are
      standard feature-length.  It''s highly likely "Rendezvous in Space" doesn''t
      exist, or if it does, it''s likely a standard-length film.


      4. **Compare potential lengths:** Even if all three Prostokvashino films are

      2. **Consider the directors:** Vladimir Popov is known for animated shorts and

      3. **Research the films:**  A quick search reveals "Three from Prostokvashino"
      refers to a series of Soviet animated shorts, each around 20 minutes.  "Rendezvous

      sci-fi movie:** While animated movies can be feature-length, "Three from Prostokvashino"

      to a single movie (or perhaps a series treated as one entity).  We need its
      total runtime.


      2. **Sajid Khan''s Housefull Franchise:** This refers to multiple movies. We
      need the *combined* runtime of all the Housefull movies directed by Sajid Khan.


      3. **Comparison:** We need to compare the runtime of Sijjin to the sum of the
      runtimes of the Housefull movies directed by Sajid Khan.


      4. **Finding the data:**  We''ll need to look up the runtimes of these movies
      online.


      According to online sources:


      * **Sijjin (2014)** has a runtime of approximately 100 minutes.

      * **Housefull (2010)**, directed by Sajid Khan, has a runtime of approximately
      146 minutes.

      * **Housefull 2 (2012)**, directed by Sajid Khan, has a runtime of approximately
      156 minutes.

      * **Housefull 4 (2019)**, while part of the franchise, was *not* directed by
      Sajid Khan.


      Therefore, the combined runtime of Housefull movies directed by Sajid Khan is
      146 + 156 = 302 minutes.


      Since 100 minutes (Sijjin) is less than 302 minutes (Housefull franchise directed
      by Sajid Khan), the answer is NO.

      runtimes of all the *Sijjin* movies and compare that sum to the sum of the runtimes
      of all the *Housefull* movies.


      4. **Likely Scenario:**  Even if there are a couple of *Sijjin* movies, the
      combined runtime of multiple *Housefull* movies (there are four as of 2023)
      is almost certainly longer.

      have been several LEGO Star Wars movies and specials.


      3. **Compare Lengths:**  "Chicken Run" has a runtime of approximately 84 minutes.
      LEGO Star Wars movies and specials vary in length, but most are around 45-60
      minutes for specials, and the direct-to-video movies are around 75-90 minutes.  Without
      knowing *which* LEGO Star Wars project is being referred to, a precise comparison
      is difficult. However, "Chicken Run" is on the longer side compared to many
      LEGO Star Wars installments.


      4. **Consider Ambiguity:** Since the question is ambiguous about which LEGO
      Star Wars production is being referred to, it''s impossible to give a definitive

      Were-Rabbit," often referred to as "Aardman''s war stories," due to their challenging
      productions.  There''s no film specifically titled "Peter Lord''s War Story."  We

      are feature films, while Mark Hamill''s LEGO Star Wars involvements are typically
      shorter format projects.

      Wars projects.  It''s unclear which specific LEGO Star Wars project is being
      referred to, as there are many movies, specials, and series.  However, since
      the question compares it to a movie ("Chicken Run"), it''s reasonable to assume
      the question refers to a LEGO Star Wars movie or special, rather than a series.

      Herzog is known for documentaries, while Beast Wars II is an anime movie.

      2. **Consider typical lengths:** Documentaries can vary in length, but are often
      shorter than feature films. Anime movies, especially those based on series,
      can also vary.

      3. **Look for the specific lengths:**  How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck
      is a short film, around 30 minutes. Beast Wars II: Lio Convoy''s Close Call!
      is also relatively short, clocking in around an hour.

      Chuck."  A quick search reveals that while the tongue twister is associated
      with woodchucks, there''s no Werner Herzog film with that title. It''s likely
      a hypothetical question playing on the director''s known interest in nature
      documentaries.  So, we can assume this film doesn''t exist.


      2. **Beast Wars II film:** We need to confirm that *Beast Wars II: Lio Convoy''s
      Close Call!* is a real movie. A search confirms this is an anime film. Thus,
      it has a runtime.

      with a runtime of approximately 26 minutes.


      3. **Brad Armstrong''s Octomom Home Alone:**  This movie doesn''t appear to
      exist. A search reveals no such film by a director named Brad Armstrong, nor
      any pornographic parody film (which the title suggests) with that name.  Octomom
      (Nadya Suleman) was a figure in the news around 2009, but there''s no record
      of her involvement in a film of this title.


      4. **Comparison:** Since "Bob Godfrey''s Great" exists and has a runtime, and
      "Brad Armstrong''s Octomom Home Alone" seemingly doesn''t exist (and therefore
      has no runtime), we can''t compare their lengths.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Bob Godfrey''s Great *longer* than

      2. **"Bob Godfrey''s Great"**: This is a known animated short film from 1975,
      officially titled "Great" and directed by Bob Godfrey.  It runs approximately
      26 minutes.


      3. **"Brad Armstrong''s Octomom Home Alone"**: This sounds like a pornographic
      parody film.  Searching for this title reveals it is indeed a pornographic film,
      and such films are typically much shorter than traditional feature films or
      even animated shorts. While the exact runtime is difficult to verify publicly,
      it''s highly likely to be shorter than a 26-minute animated film.


      4. **Compare runtimes:** A ~26-minute film is almost certainly longer than a
      typical pornographic short.

      Armstrong, nor any film seemingly connecting Octomom (Nadya Suleman) to a "Home
      Alone" type plot.


      4. **Comparison:** Since "Bob Godfrey''s Great" exists and likely has a short
      runtime, and "Brad Armstrong''s Octomom Home Alone" doesn''t appear to exist
      (and thus has no runtime), "Great" is longer.

      3. **Compare runtimes (if possible):** Since "Octomom Home Alone" likely doesn''t
      exist as a standard film, it has no official runtime to compare with "Great".


      4. **Conclusion:**  Since one film exists with a runtime and the other likely
      doesn''t, a direct comparison is impossible.  Therefore, "Great" can be considered
      "longer" as it has an actual duration.



      NO.  The question implies a comparison of runtimes of two existing films. Since
      one likely doesn''t exist in the way the question implies, the premise is flawed,
      making a direct comparison and therefore a "yes" answer impossible.

      find the runtimes of "Bob Godfrey''s Great" and "Brad Armstrong''s Octomom Home
      Alone".


      2. **"Bob Godfrey''s Great"**: This is a known animated short film about Isambard
      Kingdom Brunel, and its runtime is readily available online.  It''s approximately
      26 minutes long.


      3. **"Brad Armstrong''s Octomom Home Alone"**:  This movie appears to be a pornographic
      film. Information on these types of films isn''t always readily indexed or consistently
      available.  However, searching suggests it''s part of the "Octomom Home Alone"
      series and these films appear to be shorter, likely under an hour, and possibly
      closer to the typical length for adult films (around 30-45 minutes, though this
      can vary). While a precise runtime is difficult to confirm without accessing
      the film itself, which isn''t appropriate, available information suggests it
      is unlikely to be longer than a typical feature film.


      4. **Comparison:** "Bob Godfrey''s Great" is approximately 26 minutes. While
      a precise runtime for "Brad Armstrong''s Octomom Home Alone" is difficult to
      find, evidence suggests it''s likely longer than 26 minutes.

    ed9b4392-33a0-4ca1-9c70-a234fc33f74f: '1. **Identify the movies:** Bob Godfrey''s
      Great is a known animated short film.  "Octomom Home Alone" sounds like a fictional
      movie, likely a joke referencing Nadya Suleman (the "Octomom") and the "Home
      Alone" franchise.  There''s no evidence a movie with that title exists.


      2. **Consider the lengths:**  Short films, by definition, are short. Even a
      "long" short film is unlikely to be more than 40 minutes. A feature film like
      those in the "Home Alone" series would typically be around 90-120 minutes.  Even
      if "Octomom Home Alone" *did* exist, it would likely be feature-length.


      3. **Compare (hypothetically):**  Even a longer short film is almost certainly
      shorter than a standard feature film.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

      2. **Bob Godfrey''s Great:** This is a known animated short film, approximately
      9 minutes long.


      3. **Brad Armstrong''s Octomom Home Alone:** This is a pornographic film.  Pornographic
      films can vary wildly in length.  However, the addition of "Octomom" to the
      title suggests this is likely a relatively short film, potentially designed
      for quick consumption.  While a precise runtime is difficult to verify without
      more specific information, it is likely within a range comparable to short films,
      perhaps even shorter.


      4. **Comparison:** 9 minutes (Great) vs. an unknown but likely shorter runtime
      (Octomom Home Alone).


      5. **Conclusion:**  It''s highly probable that "Bob Godfrey''s Great" is longer.

      series to compare it to the Looney Tunes collection.

      2. **Consider the format:** Bob Clampett''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection:

    63586a10-5f57-48a5-ae6f-66c2245bf9b4: '1. **Identify the works:** We''re comparing
      Michael Apted''s "The Chronicles of Narnia" and Bob Clampett''s "Looney Tunes
      Golden Collection: Volume 1."  It''s important to note that "The Chronicles
      of Narnia" is a series of films, not a single movie.  We need to clarify which
      Narnia film is being referenced.  For now, let''s assume it refers to the first
      film in the series, *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe* (2005), directed
      by Andrew Adamson, not Michael Apted. Michael Apted directed the *Up* series
      of documentaries.


      2. **Determine the format:** "Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1" is a
      DVD collection of short cartoons.


      3. **Consider the runtime:**  A single Narnia film will be much longer than
      any individual Looney Tunes short. The Looney Tunes collection, as a whole,
      compiles many shorts and likely has a total runtime longer than a single Narnia
      film.


      4. **Rephrase for clarity:** Is the runtime of *The Lion, the Witch, and the
      Wardrobe* (2005) longer than the total combined runtime of all the cartoons
      included on the "Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1" DVD?


      5. **Find Runtimes (estimated):** *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe* is
      approximately 2h 20min. The Looney Tunes collection is likely several hours
      long in total.

      *The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader*.  The entire *Chronicles
      of Narnia* film series, which includes films by other directors, is obviously
      longer than a single DVD collection. However, the question specifies *Michael
      Apted''s* Chronicles of Narnia, implying his single film.


      4. **Consider the Looney Tunes collection:**  A "Golden Collection" DVD volume
      usually contains numerous Looney Tunes shorts, totaling several hours of runtime.


      5. **Compare runtimes:** A single feature film like *The Voyage of the Dawn
      Treader* (roughly 113 minutes) is likely shorter than a multi-hour DVD collection

      *The Voyage of the Dawn Treader*, its runtime is feature-film length.  The Looney
      Tunes collection, while containing many shorts, is unlikely to exceed the runtime
      of a single feature film, let alone a whole series.


      4. **Focus on Apted''s film:** *The Voyage of the Dawn Treader* has a runtime
      of approximately 113 minutes.


      5. **Estimate the Looney Tunes runtime:**  Even if the Looney Tunes collection
      contains dozens of shorts, each short is typically only 7-8 minutes long.  It''s

    c8894b79-5e18-49f7-b2c8-469eb984ed06: '1. **Identify the movies:** "Dot in Space"
      is an animated film. "John Mulaney:" is a stand-up comedy special, not a movie.


      2. **Compare lengths of movies:**  We''re asked to compare lengths. Stand-up
      specials can have durations like movies, but the question specifically asks
      about "movies".


      3. **Conclusion:** Since "John Mulaney:" is not a movie, the comparison is invalid.  We
      cannot determine if "Dot in Space" is longer than it within the given framework.


      NO

      This refers to the trilogy of films based on Ayn Rand''s novel *Atlas Shrugged*.  While
      Paul Johansson directed *Atlas Shrugged: Part I*, the subsequent parts were
      directed by others.  However, the question seems to be referring to the total
      runtime of all three parts.


      2. **Andy Morahan''s *Goal!* Trilogy:**  This refers to the three football (soccer)
      films: *Goal! The Dream Begins*, *Goal! 2: Living the Dream*, and *Goal! III:
      Taking on the World*.  Andy Morahan directed the first two films, while the
      third was directed by Andrew Morahan (likely the same person, with a slightly
      different credited name). Again, the question implies the total runtime of the
      trilogy.


      3. **Longer than:** We need to determine if the combined runtime of the *Atlas
      Shrugged* films is greater than the combined runtime of the *Goal!* films.


      4. **Finding Runtimes:**  This requires research.  Online sources list the runtimes
      as follows (approximate, as different sources vary slightly):


      * *Atlas Shrugged: Part I*: 97 minutes

      * *Atlas Shrugged: Part II*: 112 minutes

      * *Atlas Shrugged: Part III*: 92 minutes

      * **Total Atlas Shrugged runtime:** 301 minutes


      * *Goal! The Dream Begins*: 118 minutes

      * *Goal! 2: Living the Dream*: 98 minutes

      * *Goal! III: Taking on the World*: Straight to video, varying reports from
      90-105 minutes. Let''s assume the longest reported time of 105 minutes.

      * **Total Goal! runtime:** 321 minutes



      5. **Comparison:** 301 minutes (Atlas Shrugged) is less than 321 minutes (Goal!).

    c2a18012-5061-4808-9b5d-ba15f4b108bf: '1. **Paul Johansson''s Atlas Shrugged:**
      This refers to the trilogy of films based on Ayn Rand''s novel *Atlas Shrugged*.  While
      Johansson directed Part I, the subsequent parts were directed by others.  The
      relevant information here is that the *Atlas Shrugged* adaptation is a trilogy.


      2. **Andy Morahan''s Goal! trilogy:** This refers to the *Goal!* trilogy of
      football (soccer) films.  Again, the key information is that it''s a trilogy.


      3. **Longer:**  The question asks about the *total* length of each trilogy.


      4. **Comparison:**  We''re comparing the total runtime of the *Atlas Shrugged*
      films with the total runtime of the *Goal!* films.


      To answer accurately, we''d need the exact runtimes of each film in both trilogies.
      However, the question only asks for a yes/no answer. Since both are trilogies,
      it''s plausible that one could be longer than the other.  Without the specific
      runtimes, we can''t definitively answer.


      However, if we assume the question intends to compare if *any single film* in
      the Atlas Shrugged series is longer than the *entire Goal! Trilogy* then the
      answer is likely NO.  It''s unusual for a single movie to be longer than three
      combined movies.


      Given the phrasing of the question, and without specific runtimes, I''ll assume
      it''s comparing the total runtimes of the trilogies.  Therefore, a YES or NO
      answer is impossible without more information.  I cannot give a YES/NO answer.
