      2. Next, I''ll locate Lyndon State College in Lyndonville, Vermont. Vermont
      is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      3. Looking at a map, Ohio is west of Vermont.


      4. Therefore, Xavier University (in Ohio) is west of Lyndon State College (in
      Vermont).


      5. The question asks if Xavier is east of Lyndon State College.


      6. Since Xavier is west of Lyndon State College, it is NOT east of it.
