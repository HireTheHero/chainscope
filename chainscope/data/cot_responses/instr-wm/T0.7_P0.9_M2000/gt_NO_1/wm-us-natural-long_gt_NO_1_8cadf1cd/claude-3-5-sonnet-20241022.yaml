      1) First, let me locate both lakes:

      - Green Lake is in central Wisconsin

      - Lake Decatur is in central Illinois


      2) To determine which is further east, I need to compare their locations relative
      to each other:

      - Wisconsin is directly north of Illinois

      - Both lakes are in roughly the central parts of their respective states

      - Since Wisconsin and Illinois share a roughly straight north-south border,
      lakes in the central parts of each state would be at approximately the same
      longitude


      3) Looking more precisely:

      - Green Lake, WI is slightly east of the center of Wisconsin

      - Lake Decatur, IL is very close to the center of Illinois


      4) Since Wisconsin''s central longitude is approximately the same as Illinois''s
      central longitude, and Green Lake is slightly east of center, while Lake Decatur
      is right in the center...


      YES, Green Lake is located east of Lake Decatur.'

      2) Orange Lake, NY is located in the Hudson Valley region of New York state

      3) Since Toms River is on the Atlantic coast, it must be east of most inland
      locations in the northeastern US

      4) Orange Lake, being in the Hudson Valley, is inland

      5) Any location on the Atlantic coast in NJ will be east of locations in the
      Hudson Valley of NY


      Therefore: YES, Toms River, NJ is located east of Orange Lake, NY.'

      1) First, let''s locate both places:

      - Toms River is located on the New Jersey coast

      - Orange Lake is located in Orange County, New York


      2) Think about their general positions:

      - Toms River is on the Atlantic coast of New Jersey

      - Orange Lake is inland in New York state, west of the Hudson River


      3) When comparing east-west positions:

      - Anything on the Atlantic coast is generally going to be further east than
      inland locations in NY

      - New Jersey''s coast is east of most of New York state

      - Orange Lake, being inland in NY, must be west of Toms River


      Therefore: YES, Toms River, NJ is located east of Orange Lake, NY.'
