      3. **River Flow:** The Colorado River generally flows south.  Therefore, anything
      south of something else on the river would be *downstream*.


      4. **East vs. Downstream:**  The question asks about East vs. West. While the
      river flows generally south in this area, it meanders.  Imperial Reservoir being
      downstream of Topock Gorge doesn''t automatically make it east.  However, a
      quick map check shows Imperial Reservoir is southeast of Topock Gorge.


      5. **Eastward Component:** Since Imperial Reservoir is *southeast* of Topock
      Gorge, it does have an eastward component.

      to find Glacial Lake Wisconsin and Lake Delton, both in Wisconsin.  Glacial
      Lake Wisconsin is a large prehistoric lake, now a region, rather than a single
      body of water. Lake Delton is a smaller, present-day lake.

      2. **Determine general area:** Glacial Lake Wisconsin is primarily located in
      central Wisconsin. Lake Delton is in Sauk County, in southern Wisconsin, specifically
      the Wisconsin Dells area.

      3. **Relative position:** Central Wisconsin is generally north and west of the
      Wisconsin Dells area.


      Therefore, Glacial Lake Wisconsin is *west* of Lake Delton.


      NO

    5198ecec-c450-46a0-a6b0-fdc090050c34: '1. **Locate Glacial Lake Wisconsin:** Glacial
      Lake Wisconsin is a large prehistoric lake that existed in central Wisconsin.
      Its remnants are now a wide, flat area along the Wisconsin River.  It''s generally
      considered to be centered around the Wisconsin Dells area.


      2. **Locate Lake Delton:** Lake Delton is a relatively small lake, a popular
      tourist destination, also located within the Wisconsin Dells area.


      3. **East vs. West:**  "East of" means to the right on a standard map.  So,
      the question is whether the general area of Glacial Lake Wisconsin lies to the
      right of Lake Delton on a map.


      4. **Relative Position:**  Lake Delton is nested within the much larger area
      that was once Glacial Lake Wisconsin.  Therefore, Glacial Lake Wisconsin surrounds
      Lake Delton, including areas both east and west of it.


      5. **Conclusion:** Because Glacial Lake Wisconsin surrounds Lake Delton, parts
      of it are indeed east of Lake Delton.



      YES

    59469a55-a124-4552-9393-0452b76cbfa8: '1. **Locate Glacial Lake Wisconsin:** Glacial
      Lake Wisconsin is a large prehistoric lake that existed in central Wisconsin.  Its
      basin now forms the Wisconsin River valley. The area generally referred to as
      Glacial Lake Wisconsin is centered around the town of Wisconsin Dells.


      2. **Locate Lake Delton:** Lake Delton is a much smaller lake, a popular tourist
      destination, also near Wisconsin Dells.


      3. **Relative Positions:**  Lake Delton is very close to the Wisconsin Dells,
      while the area encompassed by the former Glacial Lake Wisconsin extends both
      east and west of the Dells.  Therefore, part of what was Glacial Lake Wisconsin
      lies to the east of Lake Delton.


      YES

    7979bc93-e499-432f-a22b-4bb1f6f13626: '1. **Locate Glacial Lake Wisconsin:** Glacial
      Lake Wisconsin is a large prehistoric lake that existed in central Wisconsin.  Its
      former bed now forms the Wisconsin River valley, roughly between Wisconsin Dells
      and Portage.


      2. **Locate Lake Delton:** Lake Delton is a small, man-made lake near Wisconsin
      Dells.


      3. **Determine relative position:** The Wisconsin River flows roughly west-to-east
      through the Dells area. Lake Delton is just upstream (west) of the Dells themselves,
      while the former bed of Glacial Lake Wisconsin extends downstream (east) from
      the Dells.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

    8090c675-41ca-487d-980d-e90873444ed0: '1. **Locate Glacial Lake Wisconsin:** Glacial
      Lake Wisconsin is a prehistoric lake that existed during the last ice age. Its
      basin now forms the Wisconsin River valley, generally located in central Wisconsin.


      2. **Locate Lake Delton:** Lake Delton is a small lake in Sauk County, Wisconsin,
      a popular tourist destination.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions:**  Lake Delton is located within the bounds
      of what *was* Glacial Lake Wisconsin.  Therefore, Lake Delton cannot be east
      or west *of* Glacial Lake Wisconsin. It''s *inside* the former boundaries.

    b3652a3c-3b4c-414c-b3d7-4ee8d194a400: '1. **Locate Glacial Lake Wisconsin:** Glacial
      Lake Wisconsin is a large prehistoric lake that covered a significant portion
      of central Wisconsin.  Its remnants are now the Wisconsin River valley and surrounding
      areas.  It''s not a clearly defined lake anymore, but the general area is understood.


      2. **Locate Lake Delton:** Lake Delton is a relatively small lake in Sauk County,
      Wisconsin, a popular tourist destination.


      3. **East vs. West:**  The question asks if Glacial Lake Wisconsin is *east*
      of Lake Delton.  Thinking of a map, "east" means to the right.


      4. **Relative Positions:** Visualizing a map of Wisconsin, or looking one up,
      Lake Delton is within the area once covered by Glacial Lake Wisconsin, and near
      the eastern edge of that area.  Therefore, a large portion of the Glacial Lake
      Wisconsin area lies to the *west* (left) of Lake Delton.


      NO

      lake that covered much of central Wisconsin.  It no longer exists as a single
      body of water.  The remnants are scattered across the region.  The area it once
      covered is generally referred to as the "Glacial Lake Wisconsin area."


      2. Lake Delton is a relatively small lake in Sauk County, Wisconsin, a popular
      tourist destination.


      3.  The general area once covered by Glacial Lake Wisconsin is to the NORTHWEST
      of Lake Delton.

      Wisconsin.  While the lake no longer exists, its former basin is a well-defined
      geographic area.  It is generally considered to be in the area around what is
      now the Wisconsin River valley near Portage, Wisconsin.


      2. **Locate Lake Delton:** Lake Delton is a relatively small lake in Sauk County,
      Wisconsin, a popular tourist destination.


      3. **Determine relative positions:** Portage, WI (near Glacial Lake Wisconsin)

      3.  A map would clearly show that Delaware Bay is generally north of Rehoboth
      Bay. The NJ portion of Delaware Bay is northeast of Rehoboth Bay. "East" implies
      a primarily longitudinal difference. While there''s an eastern component to
      the location of Delaware Bay (NJ) relative to Rehoboth Bay, it''s primarily
      north/northeast.  Therefore, simply saying "east" isn''t entirely accurate.
