      FL is located east of Lake Monroe, FL, let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Locate Lake Monroe, FL**: Lake Monroe is a large lake in central Florida,
      located near the city of Sanford. It is part of the St. Johns River system.


      2. **Locate East Lake Tohopekaliga, FL**: East Lake Tohopekaliga (often called
      East Lake Toho) is located in Osceola County, Florida, southeast of the city
      of Kissimmee.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Lake Monroe is situated north of Orlando, while
      East Lake Tohopekaliga is located south of Orlando. To determine if East Lake
      Tohopekaliga is east of Lake Monroe, we need to consider their relative east-west
      positions.


      4. **Geographical orientation**: East Lake Tohopekaliga is indeed southeast
      of Lake Monroe. However, "east" specifically refers to the east-west axis. While
      East Lake Tohopekaliga is slightly south of Lake Monroe, it is also east of
      it.


      5. **Conclusion**: Yes, East Lake Tohopekaliga is located east of Lake Monroe.

      Idaho, near the Idaho-Montana border. It is oriented roughly north-south.


      2. **Locate Seven Devils Mountains**: The Seven Devils Mountains are in the
      western part of Idaho, near the Idaho-Oregon border. They are part of the Hells
      Canyon area.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Lake Pend Oreille is in the northeastern part
      of Idaho, while the Seven Devils Mountains are in the western part of the state.
      Therefore, the Seven Devils Mountains are **west** of Lake Pend Oreille, not
      east.

      a mountain range in western Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma. They are situated
      in the southern-central part of the United States.


      3. **Compare their relative positions**: Iowa is located in the Midwest, north
      of Arkansas. The Iowa River is in the eastern part of Iowa, while the Ouachita
      Mountains are in the southern part of Arkansas. Arkansas is generally south
      and slightly east of Iowa.

      Arkansas is south and slightly east of Iowa, the Ouachita Mountains (in Arkansas)
      are indeed east of the Iowa River (in Iowa).

      Wisconsin. Wisconsin is in the northern part of the United States, specifically
      in the Midwest region.

      3. **Compare their locations**: Wisconsin is north of Louisiana, but the key
      question is whether Lake Wissota is **east** of Lake Verret. Looking at a map,
      Wisconsin is generally to the northeast of Louisiana. However, Lake Wissota
      is located in the western part of Wisconsin, while Lake Verret is in the southern
      part of Louisiana.


      4. **Determine relative east-west positioning**: When comparing the longitudinal

      Wissota is not east of Lake Verret.

      NV is located east of Diamond Valley Lake, CA, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Locate Grapevine Mountains, NV**: The Grapevine Mountains are located in
      Nevada, near the California-Nevada border, and are part of the Death Valley
      region. They are situated to the east of Death Valley National Park.


      2. **Locate Diamond Valley Lake, CA**: Diamond Valley Lake is a reservoir in
      Riverside County, California, located southwest of the city of Hemet. It is
      in Southern California, west of the Grapevine Mountains.


      3. **Compare their relative positions**: Grapevine Mountains, NV, are northeast
      of Diamond Valley Lake, CA. Since northeast is both north and east, the Grapevine
      Mountains are indeed east of Diamond Valley Lake.

      located east of Stoneman Lake, AZ, we need to analyze the geographic locations
      of both lakes in Arizona.


      ### Step 1: Locate Saguaro Lake

      Saguaro Lake is located in central Arizona, northeast of Phoenix. It is situated
      within the Tonto National Forest along the Salt River.


      ### Step 2: Locate Stoneman Lake

      Stoneman Lake is also located in central Arizona, but it is situated further
      north and east compared to Saguaro Lake. It is near the town of Flagstaff and
      lies closer to the Mogollon Rim.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Locations

      When comparing the two, Saguaro Lake is southwest of Stoneman Lake. Therefore,
      Saguaro Lake is **not** east of Stoneman Lake.
