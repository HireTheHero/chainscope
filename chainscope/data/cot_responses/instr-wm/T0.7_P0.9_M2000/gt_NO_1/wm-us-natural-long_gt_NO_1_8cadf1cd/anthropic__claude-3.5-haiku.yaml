      - Rainbow Lake is also located in the Show Low area of Arizona


      3. I''ll compare their relative positions:

      - Both lakes are in the same general area of Show Low, Arizona

      - Looking at detailed maps of the area, Show Low Lake is located west of Rainbow
      Lake


      4. The specific question asks: Is Show Low Lake east of Rainbow Lake?

      - Since Show Low Lake is west of Rainbow Lake, the answer is NO.


      Answer: NO'

      2. Next, locate Lake Lahontan (reservoir):

      - Lake Lahontan is an artificial reservoir in western Nevada

      - It''s located near Fallon, Nevada


      3. Compare their relative positions:

      - Minaret Lake is in eastern California

      - Lake Lahontan is in western Nevada

      - Eastern California is west of western Nevada


      4. Conclusion:

      - Since Minaret Lake is west of Lake Lahontan, it is NOT east of Lake Lahontan

      1. First, note that the question is asking about the location of "Oregon Coast
      Range" relative to "Northern Oregon Coast Range".


      2. Both locations are in Oregon and refer to mountain ranges.


      3. Typically, when a specific region (like "Northern Oregon Coast Range") is

      4. If the Northern Oregon Coast Range is a part of the Oregon Coast Range, it
      would be located within the broader Oregon Coast Range.


      5. By definition, a part cannot be located east of the whole.

      2. The question is asking if one part of the Oregon Coast Range is located east
      of another part of the same range.
