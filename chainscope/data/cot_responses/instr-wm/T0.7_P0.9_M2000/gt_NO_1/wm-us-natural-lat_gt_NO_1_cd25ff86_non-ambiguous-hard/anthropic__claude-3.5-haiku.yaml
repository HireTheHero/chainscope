      2. Haro Strait is a body of water located between Vancouver Island (Canada)
      and the San Juan Islands (Washington state, USA).


      3. Arizona is in the southwestern United States, located entirely inland.


      4. Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest, bordering the Pacific Ocean.


      5. Arizona and Washington are thousands of miles apart, with Arizona being much
      further south.


      6. Therefore, Luna Lake in Arizona is definitely located south of Haro Strait
      in Washington.
