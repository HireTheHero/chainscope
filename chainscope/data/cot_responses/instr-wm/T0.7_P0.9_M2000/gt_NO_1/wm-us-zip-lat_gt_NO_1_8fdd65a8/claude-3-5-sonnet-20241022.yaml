      1) Let me identify the locations:

      - 22554 is in Stafford, Virginia (VA)

      - 40031 is in La Grange, Kentucky (KY)


      2) Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Virginia is on the east coast

      - Kentucky is more inland and south of Virginia

      - Virginia is clearly north of Kentucky


      3) Specifically for these locations:

      - Stafford, VA is in northern Virginia

      - La Grange, KY is in northern Kentucky

      - Even though both are in the northern parts of their states, the entire state
      of Virginia is still notably north of Kentucky


      4) Therefore, since 22554 (Stafford, VA) is located in a state that is entirely
      north of the state where 40031 (La Grange, KY) is located, the first zip code
      must be north of the second one.

      3) In the Florida Keys:

      - Key West is the southernmost city

      - Cudjoe Key is located northeast of Key West


      4) Therefore, 33040 (Key West) is located SOUTH of 33042 (Cudjoe Key)

      2. Now, let me compare their locations:

      - Climax, NC is in central North Carolina

      - Crossville, TN is in eastern Tennessee


      3. In terms of states:

      - Tennessee is directly north of North Carolina

      - Any location in Tennessee will be north of a location in North Carolina


      4. Therefore, since 27233 (Climax, NC) is in North Carolina and 38555 (Crossville,
      TN) is in Tennessee, 27233 must be SOUTH of 38555.


      NO (27233, NC is not located north of 38555, TN)'

      - Easley is in the northwest part of SC, near Greenville

      - Rock Hill is in the northern part of SC, near Charlotte, NC


      3. Comparing their positions:

      - Rock Hill is in the north-central region

      - While both are in northern SC, Easley is slightly more western than Rock Hill

      - In terms of pure north-south positioning, Rock Hill is actually slightly more
      northern than Easley

      1) Let me identify these zip codes:

      - 78211 is in San Antonio, TX

      - 77510 is in Baytown/Santa Fe area (near Houston), TX


      2) Let me visualize their relative positions:

      - San Antonio (78211) is in south-central Texas

      - Baytown/Santa Fe (77510) is in southeast Texas, near the Gulf Coast


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - San Antonio is indeed south of Houston/Baytown area

      - Therefore 78211 is south of 77510


      NO'

      1) First, let me identify these locations:

      - 78211 is in San Antonio, Texas

      - 77510 is in Baytown, Texas (near Houston)


      2) Looking at their relative positions on a Texas map:

      - San Antonio (78211) is in south-central Texas

      - Baytown (77510) is on the Gulf Coast, near Houston in southeast Texas


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - San Antonio is west of Baytown

      - San Antonio is slightly north of Baytown, but not by much


      4) Making the final determination:

      Since San Antonio (78211) is indeed positioned slightly north of Baytown (77510)
