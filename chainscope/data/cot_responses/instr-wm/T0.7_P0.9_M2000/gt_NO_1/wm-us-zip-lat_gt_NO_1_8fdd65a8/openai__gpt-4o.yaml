      to higher-numbered ones. But this is not a strict rule and can vary within cities.


      3. **Check the specific areas**: Zip code 40514 is in the southwestern part
      of Lexington, while zip code 40517 is located more to the southeast.


      Based on their specific locations within Lexington:


      - 40514 is southwest of 40517.

      It includes neighborhoods such as Wynnefield, Overbrook, and parts of West Parkside.


      2. **Locate ZIP Code 19134**: This ZIP code is in the northeastern part of Philadelphia.
      It includes neighborhoods such as Port Richmond, Kensington, and Harrowgate.


      3. **Compare the General Locations**: 19134 is situated to the northeast of
      the city center, while 19131 is to the northwest. Therefore, in terms of latitude,
      19131 is generally located to the west and slightly to the north of 19134.
