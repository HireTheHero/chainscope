      2. **General US Geography:** Illinois is generally west of Connecticut. Latitude
      matters more for determining north/south location.

      3. **Zip Code approximation:** Zip codes generally increase from east to west.
      While not a perfect system, lower zip codes tend to be on the east coast.  Since
      60478 is much greater than 06415, this reinforces the idea that 60478 (IL) is
      west of 06415 (CT).

      4. **West vs. North:**  Being west doesn''t necessarily mean north or south.


      Therefore, simply knowing that 60478, IL is west of 06415, CT is insufficient
      to determine if it''s north.  More specific location information is needed.

      67101 (KS) is further east than 62918 (IL).  This reinforces the general geographic

      in western New Mexico.

      4. 19131 is numerically lower than 19134.

      5. Since lower numbers trend south, 19131 is likely south of 19134.

      2. **General US Geography:** Ohio is west of New Jersey.  Latitude (north/south)
      is the primary factor in this question.

      3. **Zip Code Approximation:** While zip codes don''t perfectly align with latitude,
      they give a general idea. Lower numbers tend to be further south.

      4. **Comparing Zip Codes:** 44281 is a substantially higher number than 07446.
      This suggests 44281 is likely further north.

      5. **West vs North:** While Ohio is west of New Jersey, the significant difference
      in zip codes suggests the latitudinal difference outweighs the longitudinal
      one.
