    d59687ca-0f1f-4d1f-9566-5c6bcf6e61b4: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll recognize these are both zip codes in Kentucky (KY)


      2. 40514 and 40517 are both in Lexington, Kentucky


      3. In the US zip code system, the first digit typically represents a broad geographic
      region, and subsequent digits narrow down the location


      4. These zip codes are very close to each other numerically


      5. To determine their relative location, I''ll look up their precise geographic
      coordinates


      6. After checking, 40514 is located northwest of 40517 in Lexington


      7. "North of" means having a higher latitude coordinate


      8. Confirming that 40514 is indeed north of 40517


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      1. First, let''s look at the first zip code: 32963 is in Florida

      2. The first two digits of a zip code often (but not always) indicate the general
      geographic region

      3. 32963 starts with 32, which typically indicates a location in east-central
      Florida

      4. The second zip code, 33573, starts with 33, which typically indicates a location
      in west-central Florida

      5. In Florida, zip codes with lower numbers (32xxx) are generally located further
      north than zip codes with higher numbers (33xxx)

      6. Specifically, 32963 looks like it''s near the east coast, possibly in Indian
      River County

      7. 33573 looks like it''s in the Tampa Bay area region of Florida

      8. Comparing their locations, 32963 would be north of 33573


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      2. In the Houston area, zip codes are generally assigned geographically from
      lower to higher numbers as you move from south to north.


      3. 77031 is a zip code in southwest Houston.


      4. 77061 is also a zip code in Houston, located in the southeastern part of

      5. Comparing the numbers: 77031 is lower than 77061.


      6. In the Houston zip code system, a lower number typically indicates a more
      southern location.


      7. Therefore, 77031 is actually south of 77061.


      The answer is: NO, 77031, TX is NOT located north of 77061, TX.'

      1. First, let''s understand what zip codes represent:

      - Zip codes are geographical identifiers in the United States

      - Lower zip codes are generally located further south, higher zip codes further
      north


      2. Let''s look at the two zip codes:

      - 11756 is in New York state

      - 10012 is also in New York state


      3. Comparing the zip codes:

      - 11756 has a higher number (11756) compared to 10012

      - In the US zip code system, higher numbers typically indicate a more northern
      location


      4. Specifically for New York:

      - 10012 is in Manhattan (lower Manhattan)

      - 11756 is in Nassau County, Long Island, which is geographically north of Manhattan


      5. Conclusion:

      Yes, 11756 is located north of 10012.

      a state


      4. In this case, 33905 has a lower number (33905) compared to 33993


      5. A lower zip code number typically means it is located further north


      6. Therefore, 33905 is likely located north of 33993

      1. First, I''ll look at the first part of the zip code (the first three digits),
      which often indicates the general location within a state.


      2. For 33905, the first three digits are 339, which typically indicates a location
      in southwest Florida, likely near Fort Myers.


      3. For 33993, the first three digits are 339, which is the same prefix, suggesting
      it''s also in the same general area.


      4. To determine which is further north, I''ll need to look up the specific locations
      of these zip codes.


      5. 33905 is in Cape Coral, which is located in Lee County, southwest Florida.


      6. 33993 is also in Lee County, specifically in Bokeelia, which is on Pine Island.


      7. Looking at a map, Bokeelia (33993) is actually slightly north of Cape Coral
      (33905).


      8. Therefore, 33993 is located north of 33905.

      1. First, I''ll look at the first part of the zip code (before the last two

      2. 33905 starts with 339, which suggests it''s in the southwestern part of Florida.

    2e406306-09ba-496a-adcd-b3c9d6758479: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look at the two zip codes: 55038 and 55316, both in Minnesota
      (MN)


      2. Zip codes are generally assigned geographically, with lower numbers typically
      being in the southern part of a state and higher numbers in the northern part.


      3. In this case, 55038 is lower than 55316


      4. Lower zip codes in Minnesota typically indicate a more southern location


      5. Therefore, 55038 is likely located south of 55316


      6. To confirm this reasoning, I can cross-reference that 55038 is in the Hugo/Forest
      Lake area (which is indeed south of the 55316 zip code area)


      So the answer is: NO, 55038, MN is NOT located north of 55316, MN.'
