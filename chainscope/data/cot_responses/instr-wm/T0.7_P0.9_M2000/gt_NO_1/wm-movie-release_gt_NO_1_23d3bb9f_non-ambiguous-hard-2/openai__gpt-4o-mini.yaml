      The Solid Gold Cadillac\" was released later than Richard Lester's \"The Knack\
      \ \u2026and How to Get It,\" we need to look at the release dates of both films.\n\
      \n1. \"The Solid Gold Cadillac\" was released in 1956.\n2. \"The Knack \u2026\
      and How to Get It\" was released in 1965.\n\nNow, we compare the two dates:\n\
