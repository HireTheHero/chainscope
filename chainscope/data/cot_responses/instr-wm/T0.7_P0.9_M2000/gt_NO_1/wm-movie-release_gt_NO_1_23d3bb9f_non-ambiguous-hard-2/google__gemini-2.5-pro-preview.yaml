      1.  **Identify the first movie:** *Nayak*, directed by Munin Barua. This is
      an Assamese film.

      2.  **Find the release date of Munin Barua''s *Nayak*:** It was released in
      **2001**.

      3.  **Identify the second movie reference:** "Vishal Pandya''s Hate Story".
      Vishal Pandya directed *Hate Story 2* (2014), *Hate Story 3* (2015), and *Hate
      Story IV* (2018). He did *not* direct the original *Hate Story* (2012), which
      was directed by Vivek Agnihotri. We should consider the earliest film directed
      by Vishal Pandya in the series.

      4.  **Find the release date of the first *Hate Story* film directed by Vishal
      Pandya:** This was *Hate Story 2*, released in **2014**.

      5.  **Compare the release dates:** Munin Barua''s *Nayak* was released in 2001.
      Vishal Pandya''s first *Hate Story* film (*Hate Story 2*) was released in 2014.

      6.  **Answer the question:** Was 2001 (Nayak''s release) later than 2014 (Hate
      Story 2''s release)? No, 2001 is earlier than 2014.


      **NO**'

      1.  **Identify the first movie and its release date:** The movie is *Nayak*,

      2.  **Identify the second movie reference and its release dates:** The reference

      (2001) was released *later* than Vishal Pandya''s *Hate Story* films (2014/2015/2018).
      Since 2001 is earlier, the answer is no.
