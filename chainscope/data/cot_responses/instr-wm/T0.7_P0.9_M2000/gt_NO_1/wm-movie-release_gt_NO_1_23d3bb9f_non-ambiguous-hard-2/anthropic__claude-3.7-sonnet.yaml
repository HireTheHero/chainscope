      1962 (Pirates of Blood River) vs 1978 (Follie di notte)

      1962 comes before 1978, so "Follie di notte" was released later than "The Pirates
      of Blood River."


      Step 4: Answer the question "Was John Gilling''s The Pirates of Blood River
      released later than Joe D''Amato''s Follie di notte?"

      Since "The Pirates of Blood River" (1962) was released before "Follie di notte"
      (1978), it was not released later.

      both films to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify when "It Shouldn''t Happen to a Vet" directed by Eric Till
      was released.

      "It Shouldn''t Happen to a Vet" was released in 1976. It''s a British comedy
      film based on James Herriot''s books.


      Step 2: Identify when "The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You" directed by
      Gerald Potterton was released.

      This is more challenging to determine. After searching my knowledge, I don''t
      have specific information about a film called "The Real Story of Happy Birthday
      to You" directed by Gerald Potterton. Gerald Potterton is known for directing
      animated films like "Heavy Metal" (1981) and various National Film Board of
      Canada shorts, but I don''t have definitive information about this particular
      title or its release date.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      Since I don''t have reliable information about the release date of "The Real
      Story of Happy Birthday to You," I cannot make a definitive comparison between
      the two films'' release dates.


      Without complete information about both films'' release dates, I cannot provide
      a YES or NO answer to this question with certainty.'

      Step 1: I need to determine when Eric Till''s "It Shouldn''t Happen to a Vet"
      was released.

      - "It Shouldn''t Happen to a Vet" was released in 1976.


      Step 2: I need to determine when Gerald Potterton''s "The Real Story of Happy
      Birthday to You" was released.

      - "The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You" was released in 1992.


      Step 3: Compare the two release dates.

      - "It Shouldn''t Happen to a Vet" was released in 1976

      - "The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You" was released in 1992

      - 1976 is earlier than 1992


      Step 4: Answer the question "Was Eric Till''s film released later than Gerald
      Potterton''s film?"

      - Since 1976 is earlier than 1992, Eric Till''s film was NOT released later
      than Gerald Potterton''s film.

      two films: "Ragazzi del Juke-Box" directed by Lucio Fulci and "Beach Red" directed
      by Cornel Wilde.


      Step 1: Find the release year of "Ragazzi del Juke-Box" by Lucio Fulci.

      "Ragazzi del Juke-Box" was released in 1959. It''s one of Fulci''s earlier works.


      Step 2: Find the release year of "Beach Red" by Cornel Wilde.

      "Beach Red" was released in 1967. It''s a war film directed by and starring
      Cornel Wilde.


      Step 3: Compare the two years to determine which was released later.

      1959 (Ragazzi del Juke-Box) vs. 1967 (Beach Red)

      1967 is later than 1959.


      Since the question asks if Fulci''s film was released later than Wilde''s film,
      and we''ve determined that Fulci''s film (1959) was actually released EARLIER
      than Wilde''s film (1967), the answer is:


      NO'

      There appears to be a slight error in the title. Laurie Anderson has a film

      Looking at Laurie Anderson''s filmography, I don''t find a film with the exact
      title "What You Mean We?" There is a film called "Home of the Brave" (1986)
      and a documentary "Heart of a Dog" (2015), but not the specific title mentioned

      less known film, but without verifiable information about its release date,
      I cannot determine if it was released later than "Gross Misconduct" (1993).
