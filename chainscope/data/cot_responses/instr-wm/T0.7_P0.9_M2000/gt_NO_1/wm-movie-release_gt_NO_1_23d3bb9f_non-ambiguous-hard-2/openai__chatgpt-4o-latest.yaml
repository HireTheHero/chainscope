    a6585fc1-2a18-4694-bdcd-900683c42ecd: 'To determine whether Jeff Daniels''s *Super
      Sucker* was released later than Bob Clampett''s *Porky & Friends: Hilarious
      Ham*, we need to:


      1. Identify the release year of *Super Sucker*.

      2. Identify the release year of *Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham*.

      3. Compare the two years to see which movie came out later.


      Step 1: *Super Sucker* is a comedy film directed by and starring Jeff Daniels.
      It was released in 2002.


      Step 2: *Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham* is a compilation of classic animated
      shorts featuring Porky Pig and other Looney Tunes characters. These compilations
      mainly consist of cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, but the compilation itself
      was released on VHS in 1989.


      Step 3: Now compare the two dates:

      - *Super Sucker*: 2002

      - *Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham*: 1989


      Since 2002 is later than 1989, the answer is:
