      - Android was released in 1982

      - 1971 comes before 1982

      - Since Parwana (1971) came before Android (1982), this is false


      NO'

      2. Let me find when "Gross Misconduct" by George T. Miller was released

      - This film was released in 1993


      3. Since I cannot verify the release date of "What You Mean We?" (or even confirm
      its existence), I cannot make a valid comparison between the release dates of
      these two films.


      4. Without being able to compare the dates, I cannot determine if one was released
      later than the other.


      Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this question due
      to insufficient verifiable information about one of the films.'

      - L''Oro di Napoli (The Gold of Naples) by De Sica was released in 1954

      - Heidi by Luigi Comencini was released in 1952


      2. To determine if Comencini''s Heidi was released later, I need to compare:

      - 1952 (Heidi) vs 1954 (L''Oro di Napoli)

      - 1952 comes before 1954


      3. Since Heidi (1952) was released before L''Oro di Napoli (1954), it was not
      released later.


      NO'
