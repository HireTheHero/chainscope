      central part of California.

      - Brookville Lake Dam is located in southeastern Indiana.

      - Central California (where O''Neill Forebay is located) is approximately between
      35-38 degrees north latitude.

      38-40 degrees north latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Indiana is generally further north than central California.

      - Specifically, Brookville Lake Dam in southeastern Indiana would be at a higher

      north of East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA, I need to identify the locations
      of both places and compare their latitudes.


      Step 1: Locate Murphy Theatre in Ohio.

      Murphy Theatre is located in Wilmington, Ohio, which is in the southwestern
      part of Ohio.


      Step 2: Locate East Branch Clarion River Lake in Pennsylvania.

      East Branch Clarion River Lake (also called East Branch Clarion River Reservoir
      or East Branch Dam) is located in Elk County, Pennsylvania, in the north-central
      part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Ohio is generally west of Pennsylvania. However, for the north-south relationship:

      - Southwestern Ohio (where Murphy Theatre is) is at a more southern latitude
      than north-central Pennsylvania (where East Branch Clarion River Lake is).

      - North-central Pennsylvania is in the northern part of the state, while Wilmington,
      Ohio is not in the northern part of Ohio.


      Step 4: Determine the answer.

      Since Murphy Theatre in southwestern Ohio is at a more southern latitude than
      East Branch Clarion River Lake in north-central Pennsylvania, Murphy Theatre
      is NOT north of East Branch Clarion River Lake.


      NO'

      Step 1: Let me identify the location of Murphy Theatre, OH.

      Murphy Theatre is located in Wilmington, Ohio. Wilmington is in the southwestern
      part of Ohio.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA.

      East Branch Clarion River Lake is in northwestern Pennsylvania, in Elk County.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, and Wilmington is in southwestern Ohio.

      East Branch Clarion River Lake is in northwestern Pennsylvania.


      When comparing north-south positioning, southwestern Ohio would be south of
      northwestern Pennsylvania. Northwestern Pennsylvania is more northerly than
      southwestern Ohio.


      Therefore, Murphy Theatre in Wilmington, Ohio would be south of East Branch
      Clarion River Lake in Pennsylvania, not north of it.

      part of Ohio.


      Step 2: Locate East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA.

      East Branch Clarion River Lake is in northwestern Pennsylvania, in Elk County.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Ohio is generally south of Pennsylvania, and Wilmington, OH (where Murphy Theatre
      is) is in the southwestern part of Ohio, making it even more southern.

      Northwestern Pennsylvania (where East Branch Clarion River Lake is) is in the
      northern part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Pennsylvania is north of Ohio, and the lake is in the northern part of
      Pennsylvania while the theatre is in the southern part of Ohio, the theatre
      must be south of the lake.

      - Pennsylvania is generally northeast of Ohio.

      - Northwestern Pennsylvania would be north and east of southwestern Ohio.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Locations in northwestern Pennsylvania are typically at a higher latitude
      (more northerly) than locations in southwestern Ohio.

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake would be north of Murphy Theatre.

      in northwestern Missouri.

      - Missouri is roughly in the middle of the country, with its northern border
      touching Iowa.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Rondout Reservoir, NY.

      - Rondout Reservoir is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United
      States.

      - More specifically, Rondout Reservoir is located in the Catskill Mountains
      region of southeastern New York state.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Missouri is generally south of New York state.

      - Northwestern Missouri (where Smithville Lake is) is still south of southeastern
      New York (where Rondout Reservoir is).

      - In terms of latitude, New York state (even its southern portions) is north
      of Missouri.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Smithville Lake is in Missouri (a more southern state) and Rondout Reservoir
      is in New York (a more northern state), Smithville Lake must be south of Rondout
      Reservoir.


      NO, Smithville Lake, MO is not located north of Rondout Reservoir, NY. It is
      located south of it.'

      determine the relative positions of these two bodies of water.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both water bodies.

      - Smithville Lake is in Missouri (MO), which is in the Midwest region of the
      United States.

      - Rondout Reservoir is in New York (NY), which is in the Northeast region of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of Missouri and New York

      - Missouri is generally located in the central part of the US.

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the US.

      - In terms of latitude, New York is generally north of Missouri.


      Step 3: More specifically, Smithville Lake is in northwestern Missouri, near
      Kansas City.

      - Smithville Lake would be in the northern part of Missouri, but Missouri itself
      is south of New York.


      Step 4: Rondout Reservoir is in southeastern New York, in the Catskill region.

      - Even though it''s in the southern part of New York, New York''s southern regions
      are still generally north of Missouri''s northern regions.


      Based on this reasoning, Smithville Lake in Missouri would be south of Rondout
      Reservoir in New York, not north of it.

      - Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - Patoka Lake is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central United States

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Indiana is generally north of Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma is situated south of Indiana on a map of the United States


      Step 4: While specific lakes might have different positions within their states,
      the overall north-south relationship between Oklahoma and Indiana is significant
      enough that a lake in Oklahoma would almost certainly be south of a lake in
      Indiana.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - Wisconsin is in the upper Midwest


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Pennsylvania is generally located south of Wisconsin

      - Wisconsin borders Canada/Lake Superior to the north, while Pennsylvania is
      further south


      Step 4: Be more specific about these attractions.

      south than Spring Green, WI.


      NO, Sparks Shot Tower in PA is not located north of House on the Rock in WI.

      determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Sunrise Musical Theater, FL is located.

      Sunrise Musical Theater would be in Sunrise, Florida, which is in South Florida,
      near Fort Lauderdale in Broward County.


      Step 2: Let me identify where the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is located.

      The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is located near Carlsbad in southeastern New
      Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes of these locations.

      Florida is in the southeastern United States, with South Florida being at the
      very southern end of the continental US.

      New Mexico is in the southwestern United States, but is significantly further
      north than South Florida.

      Florida extends much further south than New Mexico. Sunrise, FL (in South Florida)
      would be at a lower latitude (more southern) than Carlsbad, NM where WIPP is
      located.


      Since "north of" means at a higher latitude, and Sunrise Musical Theater is

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central region of the United States

      - New York is in the northeastern region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - Oklahoma is generally located south of New York

      - Therefore, Robert S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma would be south of the Church
      of St. Joseph in Bronxville, New York


      Since Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is south of the Church of St. Joseph, it cannot
      be north of it.
