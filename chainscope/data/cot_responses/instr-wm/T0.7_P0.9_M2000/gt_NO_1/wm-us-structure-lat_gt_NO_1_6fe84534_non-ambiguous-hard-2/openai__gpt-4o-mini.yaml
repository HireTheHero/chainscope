      1. **Locate St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church:** This church is located in the
      Bronx, NY, which is situated in the northeastern part of the United States.


      2. **Locate FirstBank Southwest Tower:** The FirstBank Southwest Tower is located
      in Texas, which is in the southern part of the United States.


      3. **Geographic Orientation:** Texas is generally south of New York. Therefore,
      any location in Texas, including FirstBank Southwest Tower, would be south of

      Now, putting this information together:


      - Since FirstBank Southwest Tower is located in Texas and St. Nicholas of Tolentine
      Church is in the Bronx, NY, and knowing that Texas is south of New York, FirstBank
      Southwest Tower cannot be located north of the church.

      relatively far south in their respective states, but San Antonio is further
      east compared to San Diego.


      4. **Determine North-South Positioning**: Since San Antonio (Majestic Theatre)
      is east of San Diego (Holiday Bowl), we can conclude that San Antonio is not
      north of San Diego.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:

      located north of San Clemente Dam, CA, we need to consider the geographical
      locations of both sites.


      1. **Locate DeGray Lake, AR**: DeGray Lake is situated in the state of Arkansas,
      which is located in the central southern part of the United States.


      2. **Locate San Clemente Dam, CA**: San Clemente Dam is located in California,
      which is on the western coast of the United States.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Arkansas is east of California. Since
      DeGray Lake is in Arkansas and San Clemente Dam is in California, it is necessary
      to check the latitudinal positions.


      4. **Latitude Comparison**: Generally, California is further west than Arkansas,
      and if we look at the specific latitudes, Arkansas is generally at a higher
      latitude (more north) compared to California, especially since San Clemente
      Dam is located in southern California.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Arkansas is further north than southern California,
      DeGray Lake is indeed north of San Clemente Dam.

    aeeb2f37-5a4c-473c-969e-632e08ef5b8e: 'To determine if Bayles Lake (Illinois)
      is located north of Gavins Point Dam (Nebraska), we need to consider the geographic
      locations of both places.


      1. **Location of Bayles Lake**: Bayles Lake is located in the state of Illinois.
      Specifically, it is situated in the eastern part of the state, near the town
      of Monticello.


      2. **Location of Gavins Point Dam**: Gavins Point Dam is located on the Missouri
      River, near the border of South Dakota and Nebraska, specifically in the town
      of Yankton, South Dakota.


      3. **Geographic Orientation**: Illinois is to the east of the Missouri River.
      Gavins Point Dam is located further west, near the border of South Dakota and
      Nebraska.


      4. **Determining Relative Position**: Since Bayles Lake is in Illinois and Gavins
      Point Dam is in South Dakota/Nebraska, we can analyze their latitudinal positions.
      Illinois is generally positioned east of the Missouri River, and Gavins Point
      Dam is west of it.


      5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, Bayles Lake is situated east of Gavins Point Dam,
      which means it is not north of it.


      Given this reasoning, the answer is:


      NO'
    cfb8cb05-e605-4fdf-969e-946dd0805ed3: 'To determine if Bayles Lake in Illinois
      is located north of Gavins Point Dam in Nebraska, we can break it down into
      a few steps:


      1. **Locate Bayles Lake**: Bayles Lake is situated in the state of Illinois.
      Specifically, it is located in the eastern part of the state.


      2. **Locate Gavins Point Dam**: Gavins Point Dam is located in Nebraska, near
      the border with South Dakota. It is situated in the southeastern part of Nebraska.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we need to consider the relative positions
      of Illinois and Nebraska. Illinois is generally to the east of Nebraska. However,
      Gavins Point Dam is situated in the southeast corner of Nebraska.


      4. **Determine Relative Position**: Since Bayles Lake is in eastern Illinois
      and Gavins Point Dam is in southeastern Nebraska, we need to determine if Bayles
      Lake is north of Gavins Point Dam. The eastern Illinois location is further
      east than Gavins Point Dam, but we also need to check the latitudinal position.


      5. **Latitude Comparison**: Illinois is to the east of Nebraska, and since Gavins
      Point Dam is in the southeastern part of Nebraska, Bayles Lake would be located
      further east but can also be at a higher latitude.


      Considering these steps, we find that Bayles Lake is actually located further
      north than Gavins Point Dam.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:


      **YES**.'

      part of Kentucky. It is situated in Perry County, near the town of Buckhorn.


      2. **Locate Binoculars Building, California**: The Binoculars Building is a

      the country. Specifically, Kentucky is east of California.


      4. **Assess the north-south relationship**: Since Kentucky is east of California,

      possible for Binoculars Building, CA, to be north of Buckhorn Lake, KY. In fact,

      generally be further west and thus south of Buckhorn Lake.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Binoculars Building is in California, which is west
      (and south) of Buckhorn Lake, it cannot be north of Buckhorn Lake.

      1. **Locate Bunch-of-Grapes, MA**: Bunch-of-Grapes is a fictional location often
      used as a placeholder or example. However, if we assume it represents a general
      area in Massachusetts, we can consider Massachusetts to be in the northeastern
