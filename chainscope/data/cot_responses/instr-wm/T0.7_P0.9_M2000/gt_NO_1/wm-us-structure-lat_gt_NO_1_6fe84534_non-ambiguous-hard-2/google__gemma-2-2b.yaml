      try to answer it as I understand the question.


      The first thing you have to do is to find the exact location of Nimrod Lake,
      AR. You can do that by looking at a map or by using a search engine.


      Once you have the location of Nimrod Lake, AR, you can compare it to the location
      of Lake Del Valle, CA. If the two locations are close to each other, then the
      answer is yes. If the two locations are far from each other, then the answer
      is no.


      The next thing you have to do is to compare the two lakes. You can do that by
      looking at the size of the lake, the depth of the lake, the type of water that
      the lake contains, and the activities that can be done on the lake.


      If you find that the two lakes are similar in terms of size, depth, type of
      water, and activities, then the answer is yes. If you find that the two lakes
      are different in terms of any of these factors, then the answer is no.


      So, based on my understanding of the question, the answer is yes. Nimrod Lake,

      River Lake is located in Garrett County, MD.


      The problem is that the two lakes are separated by a few miles of flat, open
      country. The answer is "yes," but it''s not a "yes" in the same way that you
      would say "yes" to a question about whether or not the Earth is round.
