      \ County, Florida, in the southeastern part of the state.\n- Miller Outdoor\
      \ Theatre is in Houston, Texas, in the southeastern part of Texas.\n\nStep 2:\

      - Berea College is located in Berea, Kentucky (KY)

      - Tun Tavern is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is in the south-central United States

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of Kentucky on a map


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Philadelphia is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Berea is in central Kentucky

      - Even though Philadelphia is in the southern portion of PA, the entire state
      of Pennsylvania lies north of Kentucky


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Pennsylvania is entirely north of Kentucky, Tun Tavern in Philadelphia
      must be north of Berea College in Kentucky

      1. The question asks if Berea College in Kentucky is located north of Tun Tavern
      in Pennsylvania.


      2. I need to determine the geographic locations of these two places.


      3. Berea College is located in Berea, Kentucky. Kentucky is a state in the southeastern
      United States.


      4. Tun Tavern is (or was) in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is in the northeastern
      United States.


      5. In general, Pennsylvania is north of Kentucky. On a map of the United States,
      Pennsylvania is above Kentucky.


      6. Since Berea College is in Kentucky, and Tun Tavern is in Pennsylvania, generally
      speaking, Berea College would be south of Tun Tavern.


      7. However, I need to be careful here - specific locations within states could
      potentially reverse this relationship if they''re near the borders. Let me consider
      the specific locations more carefully.


      8. Berea, Kentucky is in the central part of Kentucky, not particularly close
      to the Pennsylvania border.


      9. Tun Tavern is historically located in Philadelphia, which is in the southeastern
      part of Pennsylvania.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Berea College is located in Berea, Kentucky

      - Tun Tavern is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania


      ## Step 2: Compare the geographic positions

      - Kentucky is located in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of Kentucky

      - Philadelphia is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Berea is in the central part of Kentucky


      ## Step 3: Draw a conclusion

      Since Pennsylvania is north of Kentucky, and the specific locations within these
      states (Philadelphia and Berea) don''t change this north-south relationship,
      Berea College is located south of Tun Tavern, not north of it.

      I need to determine which one is located further north.


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Maryland is a state in the mid-Atlantic region, roughly in the middle of the
      East Coast

      - North Carolina is a state on the East Coast south of Maryland

      - High Rock Lake is located in central North Carolina

      - St. Anne''s Church is in Annapolis, which is the capital of Maryland, located

      would be north of the Performing Arts Center.


      Therefore, the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is NOT located

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States

      - Generally, New York is north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Even though Brooklyn is in the southern part of New York City, all of

      2. Cathedral Basilica of St. James in Brooklyn, New York (NY)


      To answer whether one is north of the other, I need to compare their geographic
      coordinates, particularly their latitudes. The location with the higher latitude
      is further north.


      Let me think about the general geographic positions:

      - North Carolina is a state in the southeastern US

      - New York is a state in the northeastern US

      - Generally, New York is north of North Carolina


      More specifically:

      - Brooklyn is a borough of New York City, which is in the southeastern part
      of New York state

      - The Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is likely in Charlotte (a major city
      in NC) or another urban area in North Carolina


      Based on general US geography, New York (even its southern portions like NYC/Brooklyn)
      is typically north of North Carolina. So the Cathedral Basilica of St. James

      North Carolina is a state in the southeastern United States, while New York
      is in the northeastern United States. Generally speaking, New York is north
      of North Carolina.


      Brooklyn is a borough of New York City, which is in the southeastern part of

      Since North Carolina is south of New York state, and the Blumenthal Performing
      Arts Center is in North Carolina, while the Cathedral Basilica of St. James
      is in Brooklyn, New York, the Performing Arts Center would be south of the Cathedral.


      Therefore, North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is NOT north of

      step by comparing the geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both buildings.

      - North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Cathedral Basilica of St. James is in Brooklyn, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Compare the general geographic positions of these states.

      - New York state is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - New York is north of North Carolina on the map

      - Brooklyn is in New York City, in the southern portion of New York state

      - Even accounting for Brooklyn''s southern position within New York, it remains
      significantly north of any point in North Carolina


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since North Carolina is entirely south of New York state, the Blumenthal Performing
      Arts Center cannot be north of the Cathedral Basilica of St. James.

      is located north of Atwood Lake, OH, I need to determine the relative geographical
      positions of these two lakes in the United States.


      First, let me think about the states:

      - NC = North Carolina, which is on the East Coast of the US, in the southeastern
      part of the country

      - OH = Ohio, which is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - North Carolina is generally south of Ohio

      - Ohio is farther north than North Carolina


      Since Fontana Lake is in North Carolina and Atwood Lake is in Ohio, and North
      Carolina is south of Ohio, it''s very likely that Fontana Lake is south of Atwood
      Lake, not north of it.


      To be more precise:

      - Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Fontana Lake is located in North Carolina (NC)

      2) Atwood Lake is located in Ohio (OH)

      3) In terms of latitude (north-south positioning), Ohio is located farther north

      5) Since Ohio is geographically north of North Carolina, lakes in Ohio would
      generally be north of lakes in North Carolina

      To answer this, I need to think about the relative positions of these two states
      and lakes within the United States.


      First, let''s consider the north-south positioning of the states:

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - North Carolina (NC) is in the Southeast region of the United States


      Generally speaking, Ohio is north of North Carolina. On a map of the US, Ohio
      is positioned more northerly than North Carolina.


      Since Fontana Lake is in North Carolina, and Atwood Lake is in Ohio, the general
      positioning would suggest that Fontana Lake is south of Atwood Lake (not north).


      So my answer would be NO, Fontana Lake, NC is not located north of Atwood Lake,
      OH. Instead, it would be located south of it.</think># Is Fontana Lake, NC located

      I need to think about the geographic positions of these two lakes by considering

      - Ohio (OH) is a Midwestern state

      - North Carolina (NC) is a Southeastern state

      - Ohio is positioned significantly further north than North Carolina


      Step 2: Apply this knowledge to the lakes.

      - Fontana Lake is in North Carolina

      - Atwood Lake is in Ohio

      - Since Ohio is north of North Carolina, a lake in Ohio would generally be north
      of a lake in North Carolina


      Step 3: Make a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since Atwood Lake is in Ohio (a northern state) and Fontana Lake is in North
      Carolina (a southern state), Fontana Lake must be south of Atwood Lake, not
      north of it.

      to determine the geographic locations of Murphy Theatre in Ohio and East Branch
      Clarion River Lake in Pennsylvania, then compare their latitudes to see which
      is further north.


      Step 1: Find the location of Murphy Theatre, OH

      Murphy Theatre is in Wilmington, Ohio. Wilmington is in the southwestern part
      of Ohio.


      Step 2: Find the location of East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA

      East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Elk County, Pennsylvania, in the northwestern
      part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      Ohio is generally south of Pennsylvania, as Pennsylvania borders Lake Erie on
      the north while Ohio is below it. Specifically:

      - Wilmington, Ohio is in the southwestern part of Ohio

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in the northwestern part of Pennsylvania


      Pennsylvania is generally north of Ohio. Northwestern Pennsylvania would be
      north of southwestern Ohio. This means East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA is
      likely north of Murphy Theatre, OH.


      So Murphy Theatre, OH is NOT north of East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA. In
      fact, it would be south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two locations to answer the question.


      Step 1: Locate Murphy Theatre, OH

      Murphy Theatre is located in Wilmington, Ohio, which is in the southwestern
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Locate East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA

      East Branch Clarion River Lake is in northwestern Pennsylvania, specifically
      in Elk County.


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      Pennsylvania is generally north of Ohio. More specifically, northwestern Pennsylvania
      (where the lake is) is positioned north of southwestern Ohio (where the theatre
      is).


      Step 4: Determine the answer

      Since Murphy Theatre is in southwestern Ohio and East Branch Clarion River Lake
      is in northwestern Pennsylvania, the theatre is positioned SOUTH of the lake,
      not north of it.

      \ of Texas and California in the United States:\n- Texas is in the southern\
      \ part of the US, bordering Mexico.\n- California is on the west coast of the\
      \ US.\n\nIn terms of north-south positioning:\n- Texas is generally east and\
      \ slightly south of California.\n- However, Texas is a large state, and California\
      \ is a long state that extends north-south.\n\nI need to be more specific about\
      \ these two locations:\n\nRed Bluff Reservoir, TX would be in Texas. Let me\
      \ think about where in Texas it might be. Given the name \"Red Bluff,\" it's\
      \ likely in western Texas, possibly near the New Mexico border, but I'm not\
      \ 100% sure.\n\nOur Lady of Sorrows Church in Santa Barbara, California - Santa\
      \ Barbara is on the California coast, roughly midway between Los Angeles and\
      \ San Francisco, but closer to Los Angeles.\n\nIn terms of latitude (north-south\
      \ positioning):\n- Santa Barbara, CA is approximately at latitude 34.4\xB0 N\n\
      - For Red Bluff Reservoir in Texas, I'm not completely certain, but most of\
      \ Texas lies south of the 36\xB0 N latitude, with northern parts of Texas around\
      \ 36\xB0 N and southern parts around 26\xB0 N.\n\nIf Red Bluff Reservoir is\
      \ in northern Texas, it might be north of Santa Barbara. If it's in central\
      \ or southern Texas, it would likely be south of Santa Barbara.\n\nWithout knowing\
      \ the exact location of Red Bluff Reservoir, I cannot give a definitive answer.\
      \ However, based on general geography, it's more likely that Santa Barbara,\
      \ CA is north of most places in Texas.</think># Determining North-South Positioning\n\
      \nTo answer whether Red Bluff Reservoir, TX is located north of Our Lady of\
      \ Sorrows Church in Santa Barbara, California, I need to compare their latitudes\
      \ (north-south positions).\n\n## Step 1: Locate both places\n- Red Bluff Reservoir\
      \ is located in northwestern Texas, near the New Mexico border\n- Our Lady of\
      \ Sorrows Church is in Santa Barbara, California, on the central California\
      \ coast\n\n## Step 2: Compare latitudes\n- Red Bluff Reservoir is located at\
      \ approximately 32\xB0N latitude\n- Santa Barbara, California is located at\
      \ approximately 34.4\xB0N latitude\n\n## Step 3: Determine relative position\n\
      Since lower latitude numbers indicate more southern locations and higher numbers\
      \ indicate more northern locations, Santa Barbara (34.4\xB0N) is north of Red\
      \ Bluff Reservoir (32\xB0N).\n\nNO, Red Bluff Reservoir, TX is NOT located north\
      \ of Our Lady of Sorrows Church in Santa Barbara, California. It is actually\
      \ south of it."

      \ southern United States, generally southeast of California.\n- California is\
      \ on the west coast of the United States.\n\nStep 2: Now I need to be more specific\
      \ about these locations.\n- Red Bluff Reservoir is in Texas. Texas spans roughly\

      \ Texas, near the Texas-New Mexico border\n- Our Lady of Sorrows Church is in\

      \ latitudes (north-south position)\n- Santa Barbara, California is located at\
      \ approximately 34.4\xB0 N latitude\n- Red Bluff Reservoir in Texas is located\
      \ at approximately 31.9\xB0 N latitude\n\n## Step 3: Make the comparison\nSince\
      \ latitude measures north-south position (with higher numbers indicating more\
      \ northern locations), and Santa Barbara (34.4\xB0 N) has a higher latitude\
      \ than Red Bluff Reservoir (31.9\xB0 N), Santa Barbara is farther north.\n\n\
      NO, Red Bluff Reservoir is NOT located north of Our Lady of Sorrows Church in\
      \ Santa Barbara."

      2. Indiana is in the Midwest/northern part of the United States

      2. **Kewaunee Power Station** is in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, on Lake Michigan''s

      - Chicago is in the northeastern corner of Illinois

      - Kewaunee is on the eastern side of Wisconsin, along Lake Michigan

      2. Kewaunee Power Station in Wisconsin (WI)


      Let me think about the geographic layout of Illinois and Wisconsin:

      - Wisconsin is directly north of Illinois

      - Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, on Lake Michigan

      - Kewaunee is likely in Wisconsin, and from the name, it''s probably also near
      Lake Michigan


      Since Chicago is in the southern state (Illinois) and Kewaunee is in the northern
      state (Wisconsin), it seems very likely that Kewaunee Power Station would be
      north of the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station.


      Therefore, the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station would NOT be north of Kewaunee
      Power Station, but rather south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative
      geographic positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      Illinois (IL) is south of Wisconsin (WI). This is an important first clue, as
      locations in Wisconsin tend to be north of locations in Illinois.


      Step 2: Identify the specific locations.

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in Chicago, Illinois, located in the northeastern
      part of Illinois along Lake Michigan.

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, located on the western shore
      of Lake Michigan in eastern Wisconsin.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Wisconsin is north of Illinois. Kewaunee is in eastern Wisconsin, while Chicago
      is in northeastern Illinois. Following the general geography of these states,
      Kewaunee Power Station would be north of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station.


      NO, Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is not located north of Kewaunee Power Station,
      but rather south of it.'

      1. Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is located in Chicago, Illinois (IL)

      2. Kewaunee Power Station is located in Kewaunee, Wisconsin (WI)


      Now I need to determine their relative north-south positions. Looking at a map

      - Wisconsin (WI) is a state that is north of Illinois (IL)

      - Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, on the shore of Lake Michigan

      - Kewaunee is in eastern Wisconsin, also on the shore of Lake Michigan


      Generally speaking, Wisconsin is north of Illinois. So a location in Wisconsin
      would typically be north of a location in Illinois. This means that Kewaunee
      Power Station (in WI) would be north of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station (in IL).


      Therefore, Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is NOT north of Kewaunee Power Station,
      but rather south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in Chicago, Illinois (IL)

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in Kewaunee, Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Illinois and Wisconsin.

      Wisconsin is located north of Illinois. Both states border Lake Michigan, with
      Wisconsin being above (north of) Illinois.


      Step 3: Determine their specific positions.

      Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, along Lake Michigan.

      Kewaunee is in the eastern part of Wisconsin, also along Lake Michigan.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      Since Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and both locations are on the eastern

      1. I need to determine the locations of both R. D. Bailey Lake, WV and Foster

      2. R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia (WV). West Virginia is generally south
      of Pennsylvania (PA).


      3. Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA).


      4. Since West Virginia is generally south of Pennsylvania, it''s likely that
      R. D. Bailey Lake (in WV) is south of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir (in PA).


      5. However, I need to be careful because specific locations within states can
      vary. Just because WV is generally south of PA doesn''t guarantee that every
      point in WV is south of every point in PA.


      But since the question is asking about specific bodies of water, and WV is definitely
      south of PA in terms of states, it''s most likely that R. D. Bailey Lake is
      south of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, not north of it.


      So, is R. D. Bailey Lake, WV located north of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir,
      PA? The answer appears to be NO.</think>I need to determine the relative locations
      of these two bodies of water.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia (WV)

      - Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located north of West Virginia on the US map. Pennsylvania shares
      its southern border with West Virginia (among other states).


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Since R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia, and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir
      is in Pennsylvania, it''s highly likely that the lake in WV is south of the
      reservoir in PA, not north of it.

      2. Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Specifically, I need to determine if R. D. Bailey Lake is north of Foster Joseph
      Sayers Reservoir.


      First, let me think about the general geography. Pennsylvania (PA) is generally
      north of West Virginia (WV). Pennsylvania borders West Virginia on WV''s northern
      side. This gives me an initial suggestion that a lake in WV might be south of
      a reservoir in PA, but I need to be careful because specific locations within
      states can vary.


      R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia, likely in the southern or central part
      of the state.


      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania, but could be anywhere in
      that state.


      Without specific coordinates, I need to rely on general state geography. Pennsylvania
      is definitely north of West Virginia. While there could be exceptions for specific
      locations near the border, the fact that one water body is specified as being
      in WV and the other in PA suggests they aren''t right on the border.


      Given that Pennsylvania is north of West Virginia, and these water bodies are

      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two bodies of
      water.


      Step 1: Consider the states where each is located.

      - R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia (WV)

      - Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located north of West Virginia

      - West Virginia borders Pennsylvania along WV''s northern boundary


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific locations.

      - Since R. D. Bailey Lake is in WV and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in
      PA, the lake in West Virginia would generally be south of the reservoir in Pennsylvania.

      - While there could be exceptions for locations very close to the border, these
      water bodies are established features that follow the general geographic relationship
      of their states.


      Therefore, R. D. Bailey Lake, WV is NOT located north of Foster Joseph Sayers

      First, let me think about the general geography. Arizona is generally east of
      California. But that doesn''t tell us about north-south positioning.


      Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ). It''s likely in southern Arizona since

      1. Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      2. Twitchell Reservoir is in California (CA)


      Generally speaking, Arizona is to the east of California, but that doesn''t
      tell us about the north-south relationship. I need to be more specific about
      the locations.


      Parker Canyon Lake is in southern Arizona, near the Mexican border. It''s located
      in Cochise County, in the southeastern part of Arizona.


      Twitchell Reservoir is in California. Without knowing exactly where it is in
      California, I can''t make a definitive determination. California is a large
      state that extends quite far north, but also has southern regions.


      Twitchell Reservoir is in central California, in San Luis Obispo County, which
      is along the central coast of California.


      Given these locations:

      - Southern Arizona is generally at a lower latitude (more southern) than central
      California

      - Parker Canyon Lake being near the Mexican border puts it very far south

      - Central California coastal areas are farther north


      So Parker Canyon Lake in southern Arizona would be south of Twitchell Reservoir
      in central California. Therefore, Parker Canyon Lake is NOT north of Twitchell
      Reservoir.</think># Is Parker Canyon Lake, AZ located north of Twitchell Reservoir,
      CA?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two bodies of
      water by looking at their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Parker Canyon Lake, AZ.

      Parker Canyon Lake is located in southern Arizona, very close to the Mexican
      border in Cochise County. This puts it in the far southern portion of Arizona.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Twitchell Reservoir, CA.

      Twitchell Reservoir is located in central California, in San Luis Obispo County
      along the central coast region of California.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Southern Arizona, especially near the Mexican border, is at a significantly
      lower latitude (more southerly position) than central coastal California.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Parker Canyon Lake is in the far southern part of Arizona near Mexico,
      while Twitchell Reservoir is in the central region of California, Parker Canyon
      Lake is south of Twitchell Reservoir, not north.

      1. Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ), which is generally east of California.

      2. Twitchell Reservoir is in California (CA).


      But the question specifically asks about the north-south relationship, not east-west.


      Parker Canyon Lake is likely in southern Arizona, as many recreational lakes
      in Arizona are in the central or southern part of the state. In particular,
      if it has "Canyon" in the name, it''s likely in the more mountainous southern
      part of Arizona.


      Twitchell Reservoir in California could be anywhere in the state, but I''ll
      try to recall its location.


      Based on my knowledge, Parker Canyon Lake is located in southern Arizona, very
      close to the Mexican border. It''s in the Coronado National Forest in the far
      southern part of Arizona.


      Twitchell Reservoir is located in central/southern California, in San Luis Obispo
      County. It''s not in the far north of California.


      Now I need to compare their latitudes:

      - Parker Canyon Lake, AZ is very far south in Arizona, near the Mexican border.

      - Twitchell Reservoir, CA is in central/southern California.


      Given that Arizona and California are at roughly similar latitudes, and Parker
      Canyon Lake is at the far southern end of Arizona near Mexico, while Twitchell
      Reservoir is more in central/southern California (but not at the Mexican border),
      it''s very likely that Parker Canyon Lake is SOUTH of Twitchell Reservoir.</think>#

      Step 1: Locate Parker Canyon Lake, AZ.

      Parker Canyon Lake is located in southern Arizona in the Coronado National Forest,
      very close to the Mexican border. This puts it at a very southern latitude within
      the United States.


      Step 2: Locate Twitchell Reservoir, CA.

      Twitchell Reservoir is located in central/southern California, specifically
      in San Luis Obispo County. While it''s in southern California, it''s not at
      the extreme southern end of the state.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Parker Canyon Lake is near the Mexican border in the southernmost part
      of Arizona, while Twitchell Reservoir is in a more central-southern position
      in California, Parker Canyon Lake would be further south.


      NO, Parker Canyon Lake, AZ is not located north of Twitchell Reservoir, CA.
      It is located south of it.'

      To answer this, I need to know the approximate latitudes of these locations:


      Atlanta is a city in Georgia, which is in the southeastern United States. Georgia

      - Colorado is roughly around 37-41 degrees North latitude


      Since Colorado is generally north of Georgia, and Atlanta is in Georgia while

      First, let me identify the approximate locations:


      1. Smithville Lake, MO - This is in Missouri (MO), which is in the central United
      States. Missouri is generally in the middle of the country.


      2. Rondout Reservoir, NY - This is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern

      - Missouri is generally south of New York state.

      - New York is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada.

      - Missouri is more mid-latitude in the US, not bordering Canada.


      Based on the general geography of US states, New York is significantly north

      - Smithville Lake is in Missouri (MO)

      - Rondout Reservoir is in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Compare general state locations

      - Missouri is located in the central United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      - New York is significantly further north than Missouri

      - New York borders Canada and the Great Lakes region

      - Missouri is more centrally positioned in the continental US


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since New York is geographically north of Missouri, Rondout Reservoir (NY) would

      Church in the Bronx, New York.


      To determine this, I need to figure out the relative locations of these two
      structures.


      Firstly:

      - FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas (TX)

      - St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church is in the Bronx, New York (NY)


      The key geographic knowledge I need to apply:

      - Texas is a southern state located significantly south of New York state

      - The Bronx is a borough in New York City, which is in the southern part of
      New York state


      In the United States, locations in Texas will generally be south of locations
      in New York. This is because Texas''s northern border is at a lower latitude
      than New York''s southern border.


      Therefore, FirstBank Southwest Tower in Texas would be south of St. Nicholas
      of Tolentine Church in the Bronx, New York.


      If something is south of another place, it cannot be north of it.</think>I need
      to determine the relative positions of these two structures based on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas (TX)

      Step 2: Compare the geographical positions of Texas and New York.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - All of Texas is south of New York state on a north-south axis


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on these locations.

      Since FirstBank Southwest Tower is in Texas, which is entirely south of New
      York state, it must be south of any location in New York, including St. Nicholas
      of Tolentine Church in the Bronx.

      In the United States:

      - Idaho (ID) is in the northwestern part of the country

      generally north of Idaho, it''s likely that a location in Minnesota (Star Lite

      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is located in the northern part of the US, bordering Canada

      - Idaho is located in the northwestern US, but is generally south of Minnesota

      Lake Wappapello is in Missouri (MO). Missouri is generally in the central part
      of the United States.


      Nichols Hall is in Kansas (KS). Kansas is also in the central part of the United
      States.


      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to know their relative positions.
      In the United States, Missouri is generally east of Kansas, but they''re roughly
      at similar latitudes. However, Missouri extends further south than Kansas.


      More specifically:

      - Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri

      - Kansas is west of Missouri

      - Nichols Hall is likely at Kansas State University or the University of Kansas,
      both of which are in the northeastern or eastern part of Kansas


      Given that Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri, and Nichols Hall is
      likely in eastern Kansas, Lake Wappapello would be south and east of Nichols
      Hall. Therefore, Lake Wappapello is NOT north of Nichols Hall - it''s south
      of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographical
      locations of both places and compare their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lake Wappapello is in Missouri (MO)

      - Nichols Hall is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Missouri and Kansas.

      - Kansas is directly west of Missouri

      - Missouri''s northern border roughly aligns with Kansas''s northern border


      Step 3: Pinpoint the specific locations within each state.

      - Lake Wappapello is located in southeastern Missouri

      - Nichols Hall (likely at Kansas State University or University of Kansas) would
      be in the northeastern or eastern portion of Kansas


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Missouri is located east of Kansas

      - Missouri is generally at the same latitude as Kansas (both are in the middle
      of the country)


      Now, for more specific locations:

      - Lake Wappapello would be in Missouri, likely in the southeastern part of the

      - Nichols Hall is in Kansas, and is probably on a university campus (maybe Kansas
      State University in Manhattan, KS or University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS)


      Missouri is directly east of Kansas, so if we''re comparing north/south positions:

      - If Lake Wappapello is in northern Missouri, it might be north of Nichols Hall

      - If Lake Wappapello is in southern Missouri, it would likely be south of Nichols
      Hall


      Let me be more specific. Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri, which
      is definitely south of the Kansas-Missouri border. And Nichols Hall in Kansas
      would be somewhere in eastern Kansas.

      - Kansas is located directly west of Missouri

      - Both states share approximately the same latitudinal range


      ## Step 2: Identify specific locations

      - Lake Wappapello is located in southeastern Missouri

      - Nichols Hall is likely on a Kansas university campus (probably Kansas State
      University in Manhattan, KS)


      ## Step 3: Compare north-south positions

      - Southeastern Missouri is in the southern portion of the state

      - Manhattan, Kansas (and other major Kansas universities) are located in the
      northern or central parts of Kansas

      Southampton, NY is located on the South Fork of Long Island, in the southeastern
      part of New York state. Long Island extends eastward from New York City along
      the Atlantic coast.


      Vermont is a state in the northeastern United States, north of New York state.
      Vermont borders New York to the west, Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire
      to the east, and Canada to the north.


      Generally speaking, Vermont is north of Long Island, NY. Since Southampton is
      on Long Island and Lake Rescue is in Vermont, it''s very likely that Lake Rescue
      is north of the Basilica.


      However, I should be more precise. Southampton, NY is near the eastern end of
      Long Island, which is quite far east. Vermont, while generally north of New
      York state, is also somewhat west of Long Island. But Vermont''s southern border
      is still north of Long Island''s position.


      Lake Rescue specifically is in southern Vermont, but even southern Vermont is

      Let me analyze the geographic locations:


      1) Southampton is located on the South Fork of Long Island in southeastern New
      York state. Long Island extends eastward from New York City along the Atlantic
      coast.


      2) Lake Rescue is located in Vermont, which is a state that sits entirely north
      of New York state (except Long Island, which extends eastward).


      3) While Southampton is relatively far east, Vermont''s position is still significantly
      farther north than any point on Long Island.


      4) Even the southernmost parts of Vermont are farther north than the northernmost

      Therefore, the Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Southampton,
      NY is NOT located north of Lake Rescue in Vermont. Lake Rescue is north of the

      Southampton, New York is on Long Island, which is in the southeastern part of
      New York state.


      Vermont is a state that borders New York to the east, but it''s generally north
      of Long Island.


      Lake Rescue is in Vermont. Vermont is entirely north of Long Island where Southampton
      is located.


      However, I need to be more precise. Even though Vermont is generally north of
      Long Island, I need to determine if specifically Lake Rescue in Vermont is north
      of Southampton, NY.


      Vermont is definitely north of Long Island. Long Island extends eastward from
      New York City, and Southampton is near the eastern end of Long Island. Vermont
      shares a border with the main part of New York State, but that border is significantly
      north of Long Island.


      So Southampton, NY is definitely south of Vermont as a whole. And since Lake
      Rescue is in Vermont, Southampton is south of Lake Rescue, which means Lake
      Rescue is north of Southampton.

      (at the eastern end), and Lake Rescue is in Vermont, the geographic relationship
      becomes clear:

      - Southampton, NY is in the southern part of New York state

      - Vermont is north of Long Island

      - Therefore, Lake Rescue (being in Vermont) is north of Southampton


      ## Conclusion

      NO, the Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Southampton, NY is
      NOT located north of Lake Rescue in Vermont. Rather, Lake Rescue is north of
      the Basilica.'
    a8f45251-76c9-4ce1-a26c-10c2194895bc: '<think>This question asks about the relative
      locations of two places:

      1. Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Southampton, New York

      2. Lake Rescue in Vermont


      To answer whether the Basilica is north of Lake Rescue, I need to determine
      their relative positions.


      First, let''s think about the general geographical positions:

      - Southampton, NY is on Long Island, which is in the southeastern part of New
      York state

      - Vermont is a state north of New York state

      - Lake Rescue is in Vermont


      In the United States, places in Vermont are generally north of places in New
      York, especially those in Long Island (which is quite far south in NY state).


      Southampton is located near the eastern end of Long Island, which puts it very
      far south within New York State.


      Since Vermont borders Canada and is entirely north of most of New York state,
      and Lake Rescue is in Vermont, it''s almost certain that Lake Rescue is north
      of the Basilica in Southampton.


      Therefore, the Basilica in Southampton, NY is NOT north of Lake Rescue, VT.
      Rather, the Basilica is south of Lake Rescue.</think># Is Basilica of the Sacred
      Hearts of Jesus and Mary (Southampton, NY) located north of Lake Rescue (Vermont)?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify where Southampton, NY is located.

      Southampton is on Long Island, which is in the southeastern part of New York
      state.


      Step 2: Identify where Lake Rescue in Vermont is located.

      Vermont is a state that lies north of New York state. Lake Rescue is in southern
      Vermont.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Vermont is entirely north of Long Island. Even the southernmost parts of Vermont
      are farther north than Southampton, NY, which is located on the south shore
      of Long Island.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Vermont is north of Long Island, Lake Rescue (in Vermont) must be north
      of the Basilica (in Southampton, NY).


      Therefore, the Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary is NOT north
      of Lake Rescue. It is south of it.

      to determine the geographical positions of two places and compare them:

      1. Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Southampton, New York

      2. Lake Rescue in Vermont


      Then I need to determine which one is further north.


      Southampton, NY is located on the southern shore of Long Island, which is in
      the southeastern part of New York state. Long Island extends eastward from New
      York City.


      Vermont is a state that borders New York to the east, but it''s positioned north
      of Long Island. Vermont is generally north of most of New York state except
      for the northernmost parts of NY that border Canada.


      Lake Rescue is in Vermont. Vermont is entirely north of Long Island where Southampton
      is located.


      So geographically speaking:

      - Southampton, NY is on Long Island in southeastern New York

      - Lake Rescue is in Vermont, which is north of Long Island


      Therefore, the Basilica in Southampton, NY would be south of Lake Rescue, VT.</think>I
      need to determine which location is further north by comparing their geographical
      positions.


      First, let''s locate both places:

      - Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary is in Southampton, New York

      - Southampton is located on the eastern end of Long Island, in the southeastern
      part of New York state

      - Lake Rescue is in Vermont

      - Vermont is a state that lies north of Long Island and east of upstate New
      York


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Long Island (where Southampton is located) is quite far south in New York
      state

      - Vermont is positioned entirely north of Long Island

      - All of Vermont, including its lakes, is at a higher latitude than Southampton


      Since the Basilica in Southampton is on Long Island in southern New York, and
      Lake Rescue is in Vermont which is significantly further north, the Basilica
      is south of Lake Rescue.

      of Lake Arrowhead Reservoir in California and Barker Meadow Reservoir in Colorado,
      and then compare their latitudes to determine which one is farther north.


      First, let''s identify the rough locations:

      - Lake Arrowhead Reservoir is in California (CA), which is on the west coast
      of the United States

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado (CO), which is in the mountain region
      of the western United States


      Generally speaking, Colorado is north of California. However, California extends
      quite far north, so I need to be more specific about these particular reservoirs.


      Lake Arrowhead is in Southern California, in the San Bernardino Mountains east
      of Los Angeles. Southern California is definitely south of Colorado.


      Barker Meadow Reservoir is near Nederland, Colorado, which is west of Boulder
      in the northern part of Colorado.


      Given these locations, Lake Arrowhead in Southern California would be south
      of Barker Meadow Reservoir in northern Colorado.</think># Is Lake Arrowhead
      Reservoir, CA located north of Barker Meadow Reservoir, CO?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) Lake Arrowhead Reservoir is located in California (CA)

      2) Barker Meadow Reservoir is located in Colorado (CO)

      3) Lake Arrowhead is specifically in the San Bernardino Mountains in Southern
      California

      4) Barker Meadow Reservoir is located near Nederland in north-central Colorado

      5) Southern California is at a lower latitude (more southerly) than north-central
      Colorado

      6) When comparing north/south positions, we''re comparing latitudes - higher
      latitude means more northerly


      California does extend quite far north, but Lake Arrowhead specifically is in
      the southern portion of California, while Colorado as a whole is north of Southern
      California.

      \ is in Maryland (MD), which is on the East Coast\n   - Cathedral of St. Raymond\
      \ Nonnatus is in Joliet, Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest\n\n2) Looking\

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central United States

      borders Texas to its south and Kansas to its north, while Indiana is much further
      northeast, bordering Michigan to the north and Kentucky to the south.

      states, Lake Lawtonka would be south of (not north of) Patoka Lake.

      1. Lake Martin in Alabama (AL)

      2. Truman Reservoir in Missouri (MO)


      I need to determine if Lake Martin is located north of Truman Reservoir.


      First, let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Alabama (AL) is in the southeastern United States

      - Missouri (MO) is in the midwestern United States, somewhat north of Alabama


      In terms of latitude:

      - Alabama is typically south of Missouri

      - Missouri is north of Alabama


      Since Lake Martin is in Alabama and Truman Reservoir is in Missouri, it''s very
      likely that Lake Martin is south of Truman Reservoir, not north of it.


      To be more specific:

      - Lake Martin would be in central or eastern Alabama

      - Truman Reservoir would be somewhere in Missouri


      Given the latitudes of these states, Lake Martin (AL) would be further south
      than Truman Reservoir (MO).</think>To determine if Lake Martin, AL is located
      north of Truman Reservoir, MO, I need to consider the geographic locations of

      - Missouri (MO) is located in the midwestern United States


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Alabama is situated significantly south of Missouri

      - Missouri is at a higher latitude (further north) than Alabama


      Step 3: Since Lake Martin is in Alabama and Truman Reservoir is in Missouri,
      their relative positions would generally follow the positions of their respective
      states.


      Therefore, Lake Martin in Alabama would be south of Truman Reservoir in Missouri,
      not north of it.

      In general, Ohio is located north of Tennessee. This means that locations in
      Ohio are generally north of locations in Tennessee.


      So Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio would be north of Walking Horse Hotel in
      Tennessee.


      But wait, the question asks if Walking Horse Hotel is north of Rosary Cathedral,
      not the other way around. So if Rosary Cathedral is north of Walking Horse Hotel,
      then Walking Horse Hotel is NOT north of Rosary Cathedral.</think>To determine
      whether Walking Horse Hotel in Tennessee is located north of Rosary Cathedral
      in Toledo, Ohio, I need to compare their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' locations.

      Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States.

      Ohio is located in the midwestern United States.


      Step 2: Compare the states'' latitudes.

      Ohio is positioned significantly north of Tennessee on the map of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      Toledo is in northern Ohio (near the Michigan border).

      Walking Horse Hotel would be somewhere in Tennessee, which entirely lies south
      of Ohio.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Tennessee is entirely south of Ohio, and Toledo is in northern Ohio, Walking
      Horse Hotel must be south of Rosary Cathedral, not north of it.


      NO'

      1. Walking Horse Hotel in Tennessee

      2. Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio


      Then I need to compare their latitudes to determine which one is further north.


      Let me recall some geography details:

      - Tennessee is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Ohio is a state in the midwestern United States

      - Generally speaking, Ohio is north of Tennessee


      Since Tennessee is entirely south of Ohio, any location in Tennessee would be
      south of any location in Ohio. Toledo is in northern Ohio, near the Michigan
      border and Lake Erie, which makes it one of the northernmost cities in Ohio.


      So without knowing the exact coordinates, I can confidently say that the Walking
      Horse Hotel in Tennessee would be south of Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio.</think>To
      determine whether Walking Horse Hotel in Tennessee is located north of Rosary
      Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio, I need to compare their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Tennessee is a southeastern state that borders Kentucky to its north.

      Ohio is a midwestern state that is entirely north of Tennessee.


      Step 2: Specifically locate Toledo within Ohio.

      Toledo is in the northwestern part of Ohio, near the Michigan border and Lake
      Erie, making it one of the northernmost cities in Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Since all of Tennessee is south of all of Ohio geographically, any location
      in Tennessee (including Walking Horse Hotel) must be south of any location in
      Ohio (including Rosary Cathedral in Toledo).


      NO, Walking Horse Hotel in Tennessee is not located north of Rosary Cathedral
      in Toledo, Ohio.'

      to determine the locations of Allegheny Reservoir, PA and Boldt Castle, NY and
      compare their relative positions on a north-south axis.


      Let me think about where these landmarks are:


      Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua Dam) is located in northwestern Pennsylvania,
      near the New York border. It''s in Warren County, PA.


      Boldt Castle is located on Heart Island in the Saint Lawrence River, in the
      Thousand Islands region of northern New York state, near the US-Canada border.


      Geographically speaking:

      - Northern New York (especially near the Canadian border) is generally farther
      north than northwestern Pennsylvania

      - The Thousand Islands region is in the northernmost part of New York state

      - The Allegheny Reservoir is not at the northern edge of Pennsylvania


      Given these facts, Boldt Castle is almost certainly farther north than Allegheny
      Reservoir. This would mean that Allegheny Reservoir is NOT north of Boldt Castle
      - rather, it would be south of Boldt Castle.</think># Is Allegheny Reservoir,
      PA located north of Boldt Castle, NY?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations:


      1) **Allegheny Reservoir**: Located in northwestern Pennsylvania near the NY
      border, created by the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River. It sits in Warren
      County, PA.


      2) **Boldt Castle**: Located on Heart Island in the Thousand Islands region
      of the Saint Lawrence River in northern New York, very close to the Canadian
      border.


      3) **Geographical comparison**: The Thousand Islands region where Boldt Castle
      is located is in the northernmost part of New York state, while the Allegheny
      Reservoir is in the northwestern part of Pennsylvania.


      4) **North-south positioning**: Northern New York (especially along the Canadian
      border) is significantly farther north than northwestern Pennsylvania. The Saint
      Lawrence River forms part of the US-Canada border, putting it much farther north
      than the PA-NY border region where the Allegheny Reservoir is located.


      NO - Allegheny Reservoir is not north of Boldt Castle. Boldt Castle is farther
      north.'

      To answer this, I need to consider the general geography of these two states:

      - Maryland is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States

      - New York is a state in the Northeastern United States


      Generally speaking, New York is north of Maryland. The entirety of Maryland

      - Cranberry Lake is in New York


      Since New York is north of Maryland, it''s very likely that any lake in Maryland

      I need to determine if Lake Centennial (Maryland) is located north of Cranberry

      Since we''re talking about the US, I can solve this by comparing the relative
      latitudes of two places. If Lake Centennial is at a higher latitude than Cranberry
      Lake, then it''s further north.


      Let''s think about the states first:

      - Maryland (MD) is a state in the mid-Atlantic region

      - New York (NY) is a state in the northeastern United States


      Generally, New York is located north of Maryland. On a map of the US, New York
      is above Maryland.


      So based on state locations alone, it''s likely that Lake Centennial in Maryland
      is south of Cranberry Lake in New York. However, I should be careful because
      specific locations within states can sometimes defy the general north-south
      relationship of the states themselves.


      But in this case, since Maryland is significantly south of New York, it''s very
      likely that any lake in Maryland would be south of lakes in New York.

      Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, while New
      York is in the northeastern region.


      Step 2: Compare the general north-south relationship between these states.

      New York is positioned north of Maryland. On a standard map of the United States,
      New York is above Maryland.


      Step 3: Consider if there might be any unusual geographic arrangements.

      Even though specific locations within states can sometimes have surprising relative
      positions, Maryland is substantially south of New York state. The northernmost
      parts of Maryland are still south of the southernmost parts of New York.


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the lakes.

      First, let me think about the general geography of the eastern US states. Maryland

      in NY, regardless of their specific locations within their respective states.


      So my reasoning is:

      1. New York state is north of Maryland state

      is located in Dutchess County).


      Therefore, Beacon Reservoir is likely south of Stillwater Reservoir, not north
      of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two New York
      reservoirs.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Beacon Reservoir.

      Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County, which is in the Hudson Valley
      region in southeastern New York state.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Stillwater Reservoir.

      Stillwater Reservoir is located in Herkimer County in the Adirondack region,
      which is in the north-central part of New York state.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      The Adirondack region (where Stillwater Reservoir is located) is significantly
      north of the Hudson Valley region (where Beacon Reservoir is located).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Beacon Reservoir is in the southeastern part of New York and Stillwater
      Reservoir is in the north-central part, Beacon Reservoir is south of Stillwater
      Reservoir, not north of it.

      Reservoir (in Dutchess County, New York) is located north of Stillwater Reservoir,
      NY.


      To answer, I need to determine the locations of both reservoirs and compare
      their positions.


      1. Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, NY. Dutchess County is in the southeastern
      part of New York state, in the Hudson Valley region, on the eastern side of
      the Hudson River.


      2. Stillwater Reservoir is in the Adirondack Mountains region of New York State,
      in Herkimer County. The Adirondacks are in northern New York state.


      Geographically, the Adirondack Mountains (where Stillwater Reservoir is) are
      in the northern part of New York state, while Dutchess County (where Beacon
      Reservoir is) is in the southeastern part of the state.


      Therefore, Beacon Reservoir would be south of Stillwater Reservoir, not north
      of it.</think>To determine if Beacon Reservoir is located north of Stillwater
      Reservoir, I need to identify where both are located in New York state.


      Step 1: Locate Beacon Reservoir

      Beacon Reservoir is located in Dutchess County, which is in the southeastern
      part of New York state in the Hudson Valley region, along the eastern side of
      the Hudson River.


      Step 2: Locate Stillwater Reservoir

      Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack Mountains region of northern
      New York state, specifically in Herkimer County.


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      The Adirondack Mountains region (containing Stillwater Reservoir) is positioned
      in the northern part of New York state, while Dutchess County (containing Beacon
      Reservoir) is in the southeastern part of the state.


      Step 4: Make the north-south determination

      Since the Adirondacks are further north in New York than the Hudson Valley/Dutchess
      County area, Stillwater Reservoir is north of Beacon Reservoir, not the other
      way around.

      Dutchess County is located in the Hudson Valley region of New York State, in
      the southeastern part of the state, not far from New York City. It''s in the
      general Mid-Hudson region.


      Stillwater Reservoir, if I recall correctly, is located in the Adirondack Mountains

      north than Dutchess County.


      The Adirondacks region is in the northern part of New York state, while Dutchess
      County is in the southeastern part of the state. This would mean that Stillwater
      Reservoir is north of Beacon Reservoir.


      So my reasoning suggests that Beacon Reservoir (in Dutchess County) is NOT north

      Step 2: Identify the location of Stillwater Reservoir.

      Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack Mountains in the northern
      part of New York state, specifically in Herkimer County.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      The Adirondack region (where Stillwater Reservoir is located) is significantly
      further north in New York state than Dutchess County (where Beacon Reservoir
      is located).


      NO. Beacon Reservoir is not located north of Stillwater Reservoir. In fact,
      Stillwater Reservoir is located north of Beacon Reservoir.'

      2. Stillwater Reservoir, NY


      Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, which is in the Hudson Valley region
      in southeastern New York, not far from New York City. Dutchess County borders
      the Hudson River on the west.


      Stillwater Reservoir is in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York state,

      Looking at the geography of New York state, the Adirondack region where Stillwater
      Reservoir is located is significantly farther north than the Hudson Valley/Dutchess
      County region where Beacon Reservoir is located.


      Therefore, Beacon Reservoir is NOT north of Stillwater Reservoir, but rather
      south of it.

      1. Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, New York.

      2. I need to find where Stillwater Reservoir is located in New York.


      Dutchess County is in southeastern New York, in the Hudson Valley region east

      - Dutchess County is in the southeastern part of New York state, in the Hudson
      Valley


      Based on this general knowledge, Beacon Reservoir in Dutchess County would be

      3) Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack region of New York state,

      4) When comparing the geographic positions, Dutchess County (where Beacon Reservoir
      is) lies significantly south of the Adirondack region (where Stillwater Reservoir
      is).


      5) Therefore, Beacon Reservoir is positioned south of Stillwater Reservoir,

      First, let''s think about the general geography:

      - Arizona (AZ) is a southwestern state in the US

      - Oregon (OR) is a northwestern state in the US


      In general, Oregon is located north of Arizona in the United States. Oregon
      borders Washington to the north and California to the south, while Arizona borders
      Utah and Colorado to the north and Mexico to the south.


      Since Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona, and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon,
      it''s very likely that Lost Creek Lake is north of Navajo Generating Station,
      not the other way around.


      To verify:

      - Navajo Generating Station was located near Page, Arizona in the northern part
      of the state

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, likely in the southern part of the state


      Even if Navajo Generating Station is in the northernmost part of Arizona and
      Lost Creek Lake is in the southernmost part of Oregon, Oregon is still significantly
      north of Arizona.


      So my answer would be NO, Navajo Generating Station is not north of Lost Creek
      Lake.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general positions.

      - Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      - Oregon is located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States

      - Arizona is located in the Southwest of the United States


      Step 2: Compare the general latitudes of these states.

      - Oregon is significantly north of Arizona in the United States

      - Even the southernmost parts of Oregon are generally north of the northernmost
      parts of Arizona


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Even though Navajo Generating Station is in northern Arizona (near Page, AZ),
      it''s still south of Oregon''s southern border

      - Lost Creek Lake in Oregon, regardless of its specific location within the
      state, would be north of any location in Arizona


      Therefore, NO, Navajo Generating Station is not located north of Lost Creek

      of these two places:


      1. Navajo Generating Station is (or was, since it was decommissioned in 2019)
      a coal-fired power plant located on the Navajo Nation in Arizona (AZ). Arizona
      is in the southwestern United States.


      2. Lost Creek Lake is a reservoir in Oregon (OR). Oregon is in the northwestern
      United States, bordering Washington state to the north and California to the
      south.


      Geographically, Oregon is north of Arizona. The US states from north to south
      along the west coast are: Washington, Oregon, California. And Arizona is east
      of California but also south of it.


      So if Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon, and Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona,
      then Lost Creek Lake should be north of Navajo Generating Station.


      Therefore, Navajo Generating Station is NOT north of Lost Creek Lake. It''s
      the opposite - Lost Creek Lake is north of Navajo Generating Station.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both places
      and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both sites.

      - Navajo Generating Station was a coal-fired power plant located in Page, Arizona
      (AZ) in the southwestern United States.

      - Lost Creek Lake is a reservoir located in Jackson County, Oregon (OR) in the
      northwestern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Oregon is significantly north of Arizona in the United States.

      - States arranged north to south along the western US include Washington, Oregon,
      California, with Arizona being southeast of California.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Oregon is north of Arizona, Lost Creek Lake (in Oregon) must be north
      of Navajo Generating Station (in Arizona).

      - This means Navajo Generating Station is south of Lost Creek Lake, not north
      of it.


      NO, Navajo Generating Station is not located north of Lost Creek Lake.'

      \ tell us about their north-south positioning.\n\nIn terms of latitude (which\
      \ determines north-south position):\n- Connecticut is in the northeastern United\
      \ States, roughly between 41\xB0 and 42\xB0 North latitude\n- California spans\
      \ a larger range of latitudes, roughly from about 32\xB0 to 42\xB0 North\n\n\
      So I need to be more specific about these particular locations.\n\nDon Pedro\
      \ Reservoir is in central California. While I don't know its exact latitude,\
      \ central California would typically be in the middle of California's north-south\
      \ span, so perhaps around 36-38\xB0 North.\n\nBattell Chapel is at Yale University\
      \ in New Haven, Connecticut. New Haven is in southern Connecticut, which would\
      \ put it at approximately 41\xB0 North latitude.\n\nBased on this reasoning,\
      \ Don Pedro Reservoir in CA is likely south of Battell Chapel in CT, since locations\
      \ in central California are generally south of locations in Connecticut.\n\n\
      So my answer would be NO, Don Pedro Reservoir is not north of Battell Chapel,\

      - 37.8\xB0 North (Don Pedro Reservoir) is south of 41.3\xB0 North (Battell Chapel)\n\
      - A location with a lower latitude number is south of a location with a higher\

      Council Grove Lake is in Kansas (KS). Kansas is a state in the central United
      States.

      Saylorville Lake is in Iowa (IA). Iowa is a state that''s also in the central
      United States.


      Generally speaking, Iowa is north of Kansas in the United States. Iowa borders
      Minnesota to its north and Missouri to its south. Kansas borders Nebraska to
      its north and Oklahoma to its south.


      Since Iowa is generally north of Kansas, and Saylorville Lake is in Iowa while
      Council Grove Lake is in Kansas, it''s likely that Saylorville Lake is north
      of Council Grove Lake.

      First, let me think about the general geographic positions of the states:

      - Kansas is located to the south of Iowa in the United States

      - Iowa is north of Kansas


      Since Council Grove Lake is in Kansas, and Saylorville Lake is in Iowa, and

      - Saylorville Lake is likely north of Council Grove Lake

      - New York is a state in the northeastern US

      - Generally, New York is north of North Carolina


      More specifically:

      - Manhattan is a borough in New York City, NY

      - Ovens Auditorium would be somewhere in North Carolina


      Since Manhattan, NY is in New York State, which is generally north of North
      Carolina, it''s very likely that St. Teresa Church in Manhattan is north of
      Ovens Auditorium in North Carolina.


      So the answer would be NO - Ovens Auditorium in NC is NOT located north of St.
      Teresa Church in Manhattan, NY. It would be south of it.</think>I need to determine
      the relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - Ovens Auditorium is in North Carolina (NC)

      - St. Teresa Church is in Manhattan, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New York state is significantly north of North Carolina

      - Manhattan, being part of New York City in the southern part of New York state,
      is still north of any location in North Carolina

      - Ovens Auditorium in NC must therefore be south of St. Teresa Church in Manhattan


      NO, Ovens Auditorium in North Carolina is not located north of St. Teresa Church
      in Manhattan, New York. It is located south of it.'

      1. Ovens Auditorium is in North Carolina (NC)

      2. St. Teresa Church (Manhattan) is in New York (NY)


      Now I need to determine whether Ovens Auditorium in NC is north of St. Teresa
      Church in Manhattan, NY.


      In the United States:

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the country

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern part of the country

      - Generally, New York is north of North Carolina


      Manhattan is in New York City, in the southern part of New York state, but still
      north of North Carolina.


      So, St. Teresa Church in Manhattan, NY would be north of Ovens Auditorium in
      NC.


      Therefore, Ovens Auditorium, NC is NOT located north of St. Teresa Church in
      Manhattan, NY. It''s the other way around.</think>I need to determine the relative
      geographical positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      Ovens Auditorium is located in North Carolina (NC).

      St. Teresa Church is located in Manhattan, New York (NY).


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      New York is in the northeastern United States.

      North Carolina is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Consider their north-south relationship.

      On a map of the United States, New York is positioned north of North Carolina.
      Manhattan, being part of New York City, is in the southern portion of New York
      state, but it is still significantly north of any location in North Carolina.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on these geographical facts.

      Since New York (including Manhattan) is north of North Carolina, St. Teresa
      Church in Manhattan is north of Ovens Auditorium in North Carolina.


      NO, Ovens Auditorium, NC is not located north of St. Teresa Church (Manhattan),
      NY. It is located south of it.'

      2. St. Teresa Church in Manhattan, New York


      To answer this, I need to compare their latitudes. Locations with higher latitude
      values are further north.


      Let me think about where these places are:

      - Manhattan, NY is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state, below New York


      Generally speaking, New York is north of North Carolina. Manhattan is in New
      York City, in the southern part of New York state, but still well north of North
      Carolina.


      While I don''t know the exact coordinates of these specific buildings, I can

      North Carolina. This is because the entire state of North Carolina lies south
      of New York.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions of
      these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations.

      - Ovens Auditorium is in North Carolina (NC)

      - St. Teresa Church is in Manhattan, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States, significantly south of
      New York


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Manhattan is located in the southern portion of New York state

      - However, even the southernmost part of New York state is still north of North
      Carolina

      - North Carolina''s northern border doesn''t extend far enough north to be above
      any part of New York


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific locations.

      - Even without exact coordinates, any location in Manhattan (including St. Teresa
      Church) must be north of any location in North Carolina (including Ovens Auditorium)


      NO - Ovens Auditorium in NC is NOT located north of St. Teresa Church in Manhattan,

      First, I need to identify the approximate locations:

      2. Crystal Creek Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Generally speaking, Colorado is north of Arizona in the US. Arizona borders
      the southern part of Colorado, with Arizona being southwest of Colorado.


      The US states are arranged with Colorado being directly north of New Mexico,
      and Arizona being west of New Mexico. So in general, locations in Colorado tend
      to be north of locations in Arizona.

      it''s very likely that the Colorado location is north of the Arizona location.</think>#
      Is Black Canyon Lake (Arizona) located north of Crystal Creek Reservoir, Colorado?


      Let me think through this geographically:


      1) First, I need to consider the states: Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ),
      while Crystal Creek Reservoir is in Colorado (CO).


      2) Looking at the relative positions of these states on a map, Colorado is located
      north of Arizona. Arizona shares its northern border with Utah, and Colorado
      is northeast of Arizona.


      3) Since Black Canyon Lake is within Arizona (which is entirely south of Colorado),
      and Crystal Creek Reservoir is within Colorado (which is entirely north of Arizona),
      we can determine that Black Canyon Lake must be south of Crystal Creek Reservoir.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO


      Black Canyon Lake in Arizona is not located north of Crystal Creek Reservoir

      Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ). Arizona is a southwestern state in the

      Crystal Creek Reservoir is in Colorado (CO). Colorado is located north of Arizona.


      Generally speaking, locations in Colorado tend to be north of locations in Arizona,

      - Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Crystal Creek Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Examine the geographic relationship between Arizona and Colorado.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Colorado is located directly north of New Mexico, which borders Arizona to
      the northeast

      - Colorado is entirely north of Arizona on a map of the United States


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since Colorado is positioned north of Arizona in the United States, and these
      water bodies are within their respective states, Black Canyon Lake in Arizona
      must be south of Crystal Creek Reservoir in Colorado.

      To solve this, I need to determine the relative north-south positioning of these
      two locations. In the United States, this means comparing their latitudes -
      a location with a higher latitude is further north.


      Let me think about where these places are:


      1. South Bend, Indiana (where St. Matthew Cathedral is located) is in northern
      Indiana, near the Michigan border.

      2. Lac qui Parle is in Minnesota, which is generally north of Indiana.


      Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada, while Indiana is more in
      the midwest/central part of the US. Generally speaking, Minnesota locations
      are almost always north of Indiana locations.


      South Bend is in the northern part of Indiana, but Minnesota is entirely north
      of Indiana. Lac qui Parle (which is a county and a lake in Minnesota) would
      be in southern or western Minnesota, but even southern Minnesota is still north
      of northern Indiana.


      So the answer should be NO - St. Matthew Cathedral in South Bend, Indiana is
      NOT located north of Lac qui Parle, Minnesota. Instead, it would be south of
      it.</think>I need to determine if St. Matthew Cathedral in South Bend, Indiana
      is located north of Lac qui Parle, Minnesota by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the US

      - Minnesota is also in the Midwest, but positioned north of Indiana


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - South Bend is in northern Indiana, near the Michigan border

      - Lac qui Parle is in western Minnesota


      Step 3: Compare general latitudes.

      - Even the northernmost parts of Indiana are typically south of the southernmost
      parts of Minnesota

      - Minnesota borders Canada to the north, while Indiana is several states away
      from Canada


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Despite South Bend being in northern Indiana, it still lies south of locations
      in Minnesota, including Lac qui Parle

      First, let me think about the general geographical relationship between Idaho
      and Washington state. Washington is north of Idaho. Washington is in the Pacific
      Northwest corner of the US, while Idaho is directly to the east of Washington.


      Now, I need to be more specific about the locations:


      1. Minidoka Dam is in Idaho, which is generally south of Washington state.

      2. Seattle is in the western part of Washington state, in the Puget Sound region.


      Since Minidoka Dam is in Idaho (south of Washington), and St. Mark''s Episcopal
      Cathedral is in Seattle (northern Washington), I can conclude that Minidoka
      Dam is located south of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral.


      Therefore, Minidoka Dam, ID is NOT located north of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral
      in Seattle, WA. It''s located south of it.</think>To determine if Minidoka Dam
      in Idaho is north of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, Washington,
      I need to compare their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Washington state is located north of Idaho on the US map. Washington borders
      Canada to the north, while Idaho is positioned directly south of Washington''s
      eastern portion.


      Step 2: Locate the specific places.

      - St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle, which is in the western part
      of Washington state

      - Minidoka Dam is in Idaho, which is entirely south of Washington state


      Step 3: Compare north-south positions.

      Since Minidoka Dam is in Idaho, and all of Idaho is south of Washington state
      (including Seattle), the dam must be south of St. Mark''s Cathedral.


      NO, Minidoka Dam is not located north of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral. It

      United States.

      2. Bergen Performing Arts Center is in New Jersey (NJ), which is a state in
      the Northeastern United States.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Missouri is generally south of New Jersey

      - New Jersey is one of the northeastern states, while Missouri is a midwestern
      state


      To be more precise:

      - Stockton Lake is likely in central or southern Missouri

      - Bergen Performing Arts Center is likely in Bergen County, which is in northern
      New Jersey


      Based on the general geography of the United States, places in New Jersey are
      typically further north than places in Missouri. This is because New Jersey
      is located in the northeast of the country, while Missouri is more central and
      southern.


      So the answer is likely NO - Stockton Lake, MO is not north of Bergen Performing

      - NY refers to New York, also a state on the east coast of the US

      - Manhattan is a borough of New York City, which is in the state of New York


      In terms of north-south positioning on a map of the United States:

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - Generally speaking, New York is north of North Carolina


      Manhattan is part of New York City, which is in the southern part of New York

      - The Church of the Guardian Angel is in Manhattan, New York (NY), which is

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      Let me think about the geography of Texas:

      - Corpus Christi is a city located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern
      part of the state.

      - Lake Alan Henry is a reservoir that I need to locate.


      Lake Alan Henry is located in the Texas Panhandle region, near Lubbock in West
      Texas. The Texas Panhandle is in the northern part of Texas.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Corpus Christi is in southern Texas

      - Lake Alan Henry is in northern Texas (the Panhandle region)

      Lake Palmdale, CA:

      - It''s in California (CA)

      - Palmdale is a city in southern California, in the Antelope Valley area of
      Los Angeles County

      Then I need to compare their latitudes to determine if one is north of the other.


      Let me reason through this:


      Oklahoma is generally south of New York in the United States. Oklahoma is in
      the south-central part of the US, while New York is in the northeastern part.


      Bronxville is in Westchester County, which is part of the New York City metropolitan

      Since New York is north of Oklahoma on a US map, and Bronxville is in New York,

      Robert S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma is south of the Church of St. Joseph in

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central region of the United States

      - New York is in the northeastern region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New York state is substantially north of Oklahoma on the map

      - Bronxville, NY would therefore be north of any location in Oklahoma

      First, let's identify their approximate locations:\n\nRobert S. Kerr Reservoir\
      \ is in Oklahoma, which is in the central United States. Oklahoma is generally\
      \ south of many northern states.\n\nThe Church of St. Joseph is in Bronxville,\

      \ eastern Oklahoma\n- Church of St. Joseph is in Bronxville, New York (in Westchester\
      \ County, just north of New York City)\n\n## Step 2: Compare their latitudes\n\
      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States, with latitudes generally\
      \ between 33\xB0N and 37\xB0N\n- New York, especially the NYC area including\
      \ Bronxville, is in the northeastern United States with latitudes around 40\xB0\
      N to 41\xB0N\n\n## Step 3: Make the comparison\nSince New York is at a higher\
      \ latitude than Oklahoma, the Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville, NY is located\
      \ farther north than Robert S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma.\n\nNO, Robert S.\
      \ Kerr Reservoir is NOT located north of the Church of St. Joseph."
