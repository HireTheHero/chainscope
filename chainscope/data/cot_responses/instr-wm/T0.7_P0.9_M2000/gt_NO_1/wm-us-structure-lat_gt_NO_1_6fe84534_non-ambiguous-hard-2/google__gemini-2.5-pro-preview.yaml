      3.  **Determine the relative geographic position of the states:** Iowa is located
      significantly north of Tennessee in the United States.

      4.  **Compare the locations:** Since Iowa is north of Tennessee, any location
      in Iowa (like Lake Icaria) will be north of any location in Tennessee (like
      Nashville Municipal Auditorium).

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Nashville Municipal
      Auditorium (TN) is *north* of Lake Icaria (IA). Based on the relative positions
      of the states, Nashville is *south* of Lake Icaria.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'
