      located north of Brookville Lake Dam, IN, we need to consider their respective
      geographic locations.


      1. **Identify the location of O''Neill Forebay, CA**: O''Neill Forebay is located
      in central California, near the city of Los Banos.


      2. **Identify the location of Brookville Lake Dam, IN**: Brookville Lake Dam
      is located in southeastern Indiana, near the town of Brookville.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, California is located to the west of
      Indiana. However, the question asks about the north-south positioning. O''Neill
      Forebay is in central California, which is at a latitude of approximately 37.1
      degrees North. Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana, at a latitude of approximately
      39.4 degrees North.


      Since 37.1 is less than 39.4, O''Neill Forebay is located south of Brookville
      Lake Dam.

      1. Identify the location of Hawke Castle, CA: Without additional context or

      is a fictional or lesser-known location, we would need more information to determine
      its specific coordinates or position in California.


      2. Identify the location of the Basilica of St. John, IA: The Basilica of St.
      John is located in Des Moines, Iowa. Des Moines is situated at approximately
      41.6 degrees North latitude.

      degrees North (at the northern border).

      Performing Arts Center in New Jersey.


      1. **Locate Stockton Lake, MO:** Stockton Lake is a reservoir located in southwestern
      Missouri. It is situated near the town of Stockton in Cedar County.


      2. **Locate Bergen Performing Arts Center, NJ:** The Bergen Performing Arts
      Center is located in Englewood, New Jersey, which is in the northeastern part
      of the state.


      3. **Determine the relative latitude:** We need to compare the latitude of Stockton
      Lake with that of the Bergen Performing Arts Center. Generally, Missouri is
      located further south compared to New Jersey. Specifically, southwestern Missouri
      (where Stockton Lake is located) is at a lower latitude than northeastern New
      Jersey.
