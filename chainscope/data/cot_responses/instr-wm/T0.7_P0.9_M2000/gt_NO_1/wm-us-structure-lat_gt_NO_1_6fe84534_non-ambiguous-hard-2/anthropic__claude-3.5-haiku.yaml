      1. First, I''ll locate R. D. Bailey Lake in West Virginia

      - This lake is located in Boone County, West Virginia

      - It is in the southern part of the state


      2. Next, I''ll locate Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir in Pennsylvania

      - Atlanta is in the southeastern part of the United States


      2. Next, locate Auraria Campus:

      - This is located in Denver, Colorado (CO)

      - Denver is in the western part of the United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Atlanta is southeast of Denver

      2. Next, I''ll locate Saylorville Lake, Iowa on a map

      - Saylorville Lake is near Des Moines, in central Iowa


      3. Compare their latitudes

      - Kansas is south of Iowa

      1. First, I''ll locate Edison Theatre in NY

      - I know Edison Theatre is in New York state


      2. Next, I''ll locate Lake Merwin in WA

      - Lake Merwin is located in Washington state

      - New York is on the east coast of the US

      - Washington is on the west coast of the US

      - New York is east of Washington


      4. Since New York is east of Washington, and "north" would mean a higher latitude,
      I''ll check their latitudes

      - New York state is at approximately 40-45 degrees north latitude

      - Washington state is at approximately 45-49 degrees north latitude


      5. This means Washington is actually further north than New York


      6. Therefore, Edison Theatre, NY is NOT located north of Lake Merwin, WA

      3. Comparing their geographic locations

      - Manhattan is in New York (east coast)

      - Oxbow Dam is in Washington state (west coast)

      - Manhattan is definitively east of Oxbow Dam


      4. The question asks: Is the church north of Oxbow Dam?

      - Since Manhattan is east of Oxbow Dam, its latitude is not relevant to being
      "north"


      5. Final reasoning

      - The church''s location in Manhattan is east of Oxbow Dam, not north


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
