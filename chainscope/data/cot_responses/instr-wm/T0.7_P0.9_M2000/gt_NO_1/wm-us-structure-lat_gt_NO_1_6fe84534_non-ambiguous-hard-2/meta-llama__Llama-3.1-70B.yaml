      Complex (AEDC) in Tennessee (TN) is located north of AFI Silver in Maryland
      (MD), we need to consider their geographical locations and compare them. Here
      are the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in
      Tennessee, and AFI Silver is in Maryland.


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Generally, states in the

      in the northeastern part of the United States, while Idaho is in the northwestern
      part.


      3. **Consider the latitudinal positions**: Generally, northeastern states are
      east and north of northwestern states. This means that New Jersey, being in
      the northeastern region, would typically be east and north of Idaho, which is
      in the northwestern region.


      4. **Specific comparison**: Without needing exact latitudes, we know that New
      Jersey is typically east and north of Idaho due to the overall geography of
      the United States.


      Given these steps, since New Jersey is generally east and north of Idaho, the
      Park Performing Arts Center, NJ, would be east and north of Eighth & Main, ID,
      not just north.


      The answer is: NO

      further south than Washington, structures in Utah would generally be located
      south of those in Washington.


      Given these steps, it''s likely that Causey Reservoir, UT, is located south
      of Little Goose Dam, WA, not north.


      The answer is: NO

    c337c48e-31e1-4e30-9fe5-079ddb7bcad8: 'To determine if Sparks Shot Tower, PA is
      located north of House on the Rock, WI, let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Sparks Shot Tower is located in Pennsylvania
      (PA), and House on the Rock is located in Wisconsin (WI).


      2. **Understand the general geography of the United States**: Pennsylvania is
      in the northeastern part of the country, while Wisconsin is in the north-central
      region.


      3. **Consider the latitudinal positions**: Generally, the northeastern states
      are east of the north-central states.


      4. **Specific comparison**: Without needing the exact latitudes, we know that
      Pennsylvania is typically east of Wisconsin due to the overall geography of
      the United States.


      Given these steps, since Pennsylvania is generally east of Wisconsin, Sparks
      Shot Tower, PA would be east of House on the Rock, WI, not north.


      The answer is: NO

    dd9c24ee-479d-4bb3-8ba4-85e5388fe181: 'To determine if Sparks Shot Tower, PA,
      is located north of House on the Rock, WI, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Sparks Shot Tower is located in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania, and House on the Rock is located in Spring Green, Wisconsin.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Pennsylvania is on the East Coast of the United
      States, while Wisconsin is in the Midwest.


      3. **Consider the relative positions**: The Midwest is generally west of the
      East Coast. However, the question asks specifically about north-south positioning.


      4. **Compare the latitudes**: To determine north-south positioning, we need
      to consider the latitudes of the locations. Without specific coordinates, we
      can make an approximation based on general knowledge of US geography.


      5. **Conclusion**: Sparks Shot Tower, PA, is in the northeastern United States,
      while House on the Rock, WI, is in the north-central part of the country. Given
      this, Sparks Shot Tower is likely not located north of House on the Rock.

      \ is a state in the southeastern United States.\n\n2. **Youghiogheny River Lake\
      \ Location**: Youghiogheny River Lake is located on the border of Pennsylvania\
      \ and Maryland, specifically in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is\
      \ a state in the northeastern United States.\n\n3. **Comparing Locations**:\n\
      \   - **Latitude**: To determine if one location is north of another, we compare\
      \ their latitudes. The higher the latitude, the more north a location is.\n\
      \   - **Lewis Smith Lake Latitude**: Lewis Smith Lake, being in Alabama, would\
      \ have a latitude somewhere around 34\xB0N.\n   - **Youghiogheny River Lake\
      \ Latitude**: Youghiogheny River Lake, being in Pennsylvania, would have a latitude\
      \ somewhere around 40\xB0N.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since Pennsylvania (where\
      \ Youghiogheny River Lake is located) has a higher latitude than Alabama (where\
      \ Lewis Smith Lake is located), this means that Youghiogheny River Lake, PA\
      \ is actually located north of Lewis Smith Lake, AL.\n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ to the question \"Is Lewis Smith Lake, AL located north of Youghiogheny River\

      Worth, Texas (TX) is located north of Blewett Falls Lake in North Carolina (NC),
      we need to compare their geographical positions. Let''s break it down step by
      step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Blackstone Hotel is located in Fort Worth, Texas,
      which is in the southern part of the United States. Blewett Falls Lake is located
      in North Carolina, which is in the southeastern part of the country.


      2. **Consider the general geography of the United States**: Texas is in the
      southern-central part of the country, while North Carolina is in the southeastern
      part. Generally, the southern-central states are south of the southeastern states.


      3. **Specific comparison**: Without needing the exact coordinates, we know that
      Texas (where Fort Worth is) is generally south of North Carolina (where Blewett
      Falls Lake is) due to the overall layout of the United States.


      Given these steps, since Texas is generally south of North Carolina, Blackstone
      Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas, would be south of Blewett Falls Lake in North Carolina,
      not north.


      The answer is: NO

      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Bowen is in South Carolina (SC), and Herbst
      Theatre is in California (CA).


      2. **Understand the general geography of the United States**: South Carolina
      is in the southeastern part of the country, while California is in the southwestern
      part.


      3. **Consider the latitudinal positions**: Generally, the southeastern states
      are south of the southwestern states.


      4. **Specific comparison**: Without needing the exact latitudes, we know South
      Carolina is typically south of California due to the overall geography of the
      United States.


      Given these steps, since South Carolina is generally south of California, Lake
      Bowen, SC would be south of Herbst Theatre, CA, not north.
