      - Since Council Grove Lake is in Kansas, and Kansas is south of Iowa

      - And Saylorville Lake is in Iowa

      - Council Grove Lake must be south of Saylorville Lake


      4) The question asks if Council Grove Lake is NORTH of Saylorville Lake

      - Since we established it''s south, not north
