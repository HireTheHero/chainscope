    36476581-d5de-4f3c-8fc5-5c560247fc8d: 'To determine whether Tiris Zemmour Region
      is more populous than Dadu District, we need to compare the populations of both
      places. Here''s a step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Tiris Zemmour Region**: This is a region in Mauritania. It is known for
      having a relatively low population density because it is largely desert.


      2. **Dadu District**: This is a district in the Sindh province of Pakistan.
      Pakistan, particularly the Sindh province, tends to have higher population densities
      compared to regions in Mauritania.


      3. **Population Comparison**: Generally, regions in Pakistan, especially districts
      like Dadu, are more populous than many regions in Mauritania due to different
      geographical, economic, and demographic factors.


      Based on this reasoning, it is likely that Dadu District is more populous than
      Tiris Zemmour Region.


      **Answer: NO**'
    44fa0867-8ea9-43d0-a876-d3ae61be4c12: 'To determine whether Tiris Zemmour Region
      is more populous than Dadu District, we need to consider the population of each
      area:


      1. **Tiris Zemmour Region**: This is a region in northern Mauritania. It is
      known for being sparsely populated, with much of its land being desert.


      2. **Dadu District**: This district is located in the Sindh province of Pakistan.
      Sindh is one of the more densely populated regions of Pakistan, and Dadu District
      itself has a significant population.


      Given that Tiris Zemmour is in a sparsely populated desert region and Dadu District
      is in a populous region of Pakistan, it is reasonable to infer that Dadu District
      is more populous than Tiris Zemmour Region.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Tiris Zemmour Region is not more populous than
      Dadu District.'

      Region is more populous than Dadu District, we need to consider the populations
      of both areas.


      1. **Tiris Zemmour Region**: This is a region in Mauritania. It is known for
      its vast desert landscapes and sparse population. As of recent estimates, the
      population of Tiris Zemmour is relatively low, likely in the tens of thousands.


      2. **Dadu District**: This is a district in the Sindh province of Pakistan.
      Pakistan is a country with a high population density, and districts in Sindh
