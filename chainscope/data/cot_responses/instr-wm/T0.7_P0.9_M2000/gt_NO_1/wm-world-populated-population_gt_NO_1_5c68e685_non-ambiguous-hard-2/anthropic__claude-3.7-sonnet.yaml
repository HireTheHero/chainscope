      Step 1: Let me consider Clayton, Illinois.

      There is no major city or town called Clayton in Illinois that I''m aware of.
      There might be a small unincorporated community by that name, but it would likely
      have a very small population, perhaps in the hundreds or low thousands at most.


      Step 2: Let me consider Bay, Somalia.

      I don''t have specific information about a place called "Bay" in Somalia. However,
      there is a Bay region (Bay or Bai) in Somalia, which is an administrative region
      rather than a single city. Administrative regions in Somalia typically contain

      if Ritchie, Edmonton is more populous than Bunia.


      Step 1: Identify what Ritchie, Edmonton is.

      Ritchie appears to be a neighborhood or community within Edmonton, which is
      a city in Alberta, Canada.


      Step 2: Estimate the population of Ritchie, Edmonton.

      As a neighborhood within Edmonton, Ritchie would have a population that''s a
      small fraction of Edmonton''s total population. Edmonton has approximately 1
      million residents, and a typical urban neighborhood might have several thousand
      residents, likely under 10,000.


      Step 3: Identify what Bunia is.

      Bunia is a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It''s the capital of
      Ituri Province.


      Step 4: Estimate the population of Bunia.

      Bunia is a significant urban center in DRC with a population of approximately
      300,000-400,000 people.


      Step 5: Compare the populations.

      Step 1: Identify Perth, Tasmania.

      Perth is a town in Tasmania, Australia. However, I need to note that the more
      well-known Perth is the capital city of Western Australia. The Perth in Tasmania
      is a small town.


      Step 2: Find the population of Perth, Tasmania.

      Perth, Tasmania is a small town with a population of approximately 2,000-3,000
      people.


      Step 3: Identify Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa is a district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India.


      Step 4: Find the population of Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa district has a population of over 500,000 people based on census
      data.


      Step 5: Compare the populations.

      Perth, Tasmania has approximately 2,000-3,000 people.

      Agar Malwa district has over 500,000 people.


      Since 2,000-3,000 is much less than 500,000, Perth, Tasmania is not more populous
      than Agar Malwa district.


      NO'

      which place is more populous.


      Step 1: Identify Perth, Tasmania.

      Perth is a town in Tasmania, Australia. However, there''s a potential confusion
      here - the major city of Perth is in Western Australia, not Tasmania. Perth,
      Tasmania is a small town in the northern part of Tasmania.


      Step 2: Find the population of Perth, Tasmania.

      Perth, Tasmania is a small town with a population of approximately 2,000-3,000
      people.


      Step 3: Identify Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa is a district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India.


      Step 4: Find the population of Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa district has a population of over 500,000 people based on census
      data.


      Step 5: Compare the populations.

      Perth, Tasmania (approximately 2,000-3,000 people) is significantly less populous

      population: Perth, Tasmania or Agar Malwa district.


      Step 1: Identify Perth, Tasmania.

      There''s a problem here - Perth is actually a city in Western Australia, not
      in Tasmania. There is no major city called Perth in Tasmania. The largest cities
      in Tasmania are Hobart and Launceston. This appears to be a trick question with
      a non-existent place.


      Step 2: Identify Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa is a district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. It was carved
      out of Shajapur district in 2013.


      Step 3: Compare populations.

      Since "Perth, Tasmania" doesn''t exist as a real place, it has a population
      of zero.

      Agar Malwa district has a population of several hundred thousand people (approximately
      500,000 based on available data).


      NO - Perth, Tasmania is not more populous than Agar Malwa district, because
      Perth, Tasmania doesn''t exist, while Agar Malwa is a real district with a substantial

      Step 1: Identify Perth, Tasmania.

      There''s actually a geographical issue here - Perth is a city in Western Australia,
      not in Tasmania. There is no major city or settlement called Perth in Tasmania.
      Tasmania is an island state of Australia with major cities like Hobart and Launceston.


      Step 2: Identify Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa is a district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India.


      Step 3: Compare populations.

      Since Perth, Tasmania doesn''t exist as a significant settlement, I need to
      clarify this comparison. If we''re referring to a very small locality in Tasmania
      called Perth (which is a small historical village), its population would be
      extremely small - likely just a few hundred people at most.


      Agar Malwa district in India has a population of several hundred thousand people
      (approximately 500,000-600,000 based on recent data).


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Any small settlement called Perth in Tasmania would be vastly less populous
      than an entire Indian district like Agar Malwa.


      NO, Perth, Tasmania is not more populous than Agar Malwa district.'

      Step 1: Identify Perth, Tasmania.

      There''s actually a geographical issue here - Perth is a city in Western Australia,
      not Tasmania. There is no major city or settlement called Perth in Tasmania.
      Perth is Australia''s fourth-largest city.


      Step 2: Consider if there might be a small town called Perth in Tasmania.

      Even if there is a small settlement called Perth in Tasmania (which would be
      very small), it would have a tiny population compared to Perth, Western Australia.


      Step 3: Identify Agar Malwa district.

      Agar Malwa is a district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India.


      Step 4: Find population data.

      Agar Malwa district has a population of approximately 500,000 people according
      to recent census data.


      Step 5: Compare populations.

      Since there is no significant "Perth, Tasmania" (as Perth is in Western Australia,
      not Tasmania), we''re essentially comparing a non-existent or extremely small
      place to a district with about 500,000 people.


      NO - Perth, Tasmania is not more populous than Agar Malwa district, because
      Perth is not located in Tasmania, and even if there is a small settlement by
      that name in Tasmania, it would be far smaller than the Agar Malwa district''s
      population of approximately 500,000.'

      and the Department of Ayacucho.


      Step 1: Identify what Mulapadu is.

      Mulapadu is a village in Krishna district in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.
      As a village, it likely has a relatively small population, probably in the thousands
      or tens of thousands.


      Step 2: Identify what the Department of Ayacucho is.

      The Department of Ayacucho is an administrative region (similar to a state or
      province) in Peru. It''s one of the 24 departments that make up Peru.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      - Mulapadu, being a village in India, would have a population likely in the
      thousands.

      - The Department of Ayacucho, as an entire administrative region of Peru, would
      have a population in the hundreds of thousands or millions. According to available
      data, Ayacucho has a population of over 600,000 people.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the comparison.

      Since Mulapadu is a small village and Ayacucho is an entire department (administrative
      region) of Peru with hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, Mulapadu is significantly
      less populous.

      Mulapadu and the Department of Ayacucho to compare them.


      Step 1: Identify what Mulapadu is and find its population.

      Mulapadu appears to be a village in India. Small villages in India typically
      have populations ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand people. Without
      specific data, I can estimate Mulapadu likely has fewer than 10,000 residents.


      Step 2: Identify what the Department of Ayacucho is and find its population.

      The Department of Ayacucho is an administrative region (similar to a state or
      province) in Peru. As a department, it would contain multiple cities, towns,
      and villages. Peruvian departments typically have populations in the hundreds
      of thousands or millions. Ayacucho Department has a population of approximately
      600,000-700,000 people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Birchleigh is a suburb of Kempton Park in Gauteng province, South Africa. While
      I don''t have its exact population, suburbs in South African cities typically
      have populations in the tens of thousands.


      Step 2: Identify Savanes Region, Togo.

      Savanes Region is the northernmost region of Togo, a country in West Africa.
      It''s one of Togo''s administrative regions.


      Step 3: Find population data.

      Savanes Region in Togo has a population of approximately 800,000-900,000 people
      (based on recent estimates).

      Birchleigh, as a suburb, likely has a population of less than 100,000.


      Step 4: Compare the populations.

      Savanes Region in Togo has a significantly larger population (hundreds of thousands)
      than Birchleigh (tens of thousands).


      NO, Birchleigh is not more populous than Savanes Region, Togo.'

      Birchleigh and Savanes Region, Togo, and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify Birchleigh.

      Birchleigh is a suburb located in Kempton Park, Gauteng province, South Africa.
      It''s a residential area, but I don''t have its exact population figure. As
      a suburb, it likely has a population in the tens of thousands.


      Step 2: Identify Savanes Region, Togo.

      Savanes Region is one of the five administrative regions of Togo, a country
      in West Africa. It''s the northernmost region of Togo.


      Step 3: Find population data.

      The Savanes Region of Togo has a population of approximately 800,000-900,000
      people (based on recent estimates). It''s one of Togo''s major administrative
      divisions.


      Birchleigh, being a suburb of a city in South Africa, would almost certainly
      have a significantly smaller population than an entire administrative region
      of a country. Suburbs typically have populations in the thousands or tens of
      thousands, while regional divisions of countries typically have populations
      in the hundreds of thousands or millions.


      Step 4: Compare the populations.

      Given that Savanes Region has a population of around 800,000-900,000 people,
      and Birchleigh is just a suburb with likely tens of thousands of residents at
      most, Savanes Region is clearly more populous.


      NO, Birchleigh is not more populous than Savanes Region, Togo.'
