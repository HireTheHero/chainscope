      Step 1: Identify Mulakuzha

      - Mulakuzha is a village in the Alappuzha district of Kerala, India.

      - As a village, its population is relatively small. According to census data,
      its population is typically in the range of tens of thousands (likely around
      30,000 or fewer).

      - Buleleng Regency is a regency (administrative division) in the northern part
      of Bali, Indonesia.

      - It is a much larger administrative region compared to a village.

      - Buleleng Regency has a population in the range of several hundred thousand.

      than the Department of Ayacucho, we need to examine the population sizes of
      both places.


      Step 1: Understand what Mulapadu is.

      Mulapadu is a village located in the NTR district in the state of Andhra Pradesh,
      India. As a village, it is a small settlement with a relatively low population.
      Typical Indian villages may have populations ranging from a few hundred to a
      few thousand people. Mulapadu is known for its natural beauty and for being
      close to forested areas and tourist spots, but it is not a large urban center.


      Step 2: Understand what the Department of Ayacucho is.

      The Department of Ayacucho is one of the 25 regions (or departments) of Peru.
      It is a large administrative division, with a number of cities, towns, and rural
      areas under its jurisdiction. Ayacucho city is the capital of the department.
      According to data from recent years, the Department of Ayacucho has a population
      of over 600,000 people.


      Step 3: Compare the two.

      Even without the exact population of Mulapadu, it is clear from its classification
      as a village that it has a much smaller population than a department in Peru
      that contains multiple municipalities and a regional capital.


      Conclusion:

      Mulapadu, being a village, is significantly less populous than the Department
      of Ayacucho, which is a large administrative region in Peru with hundreds of
      thousands of residents.
