      than Zhuozhou (~600,000).

      6.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Montegiardino is *more* populous
      than Zhuozhou. Since 970 is much less than 600,000, the statement is false.

      in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

      4.  **Find the population of Place 2:** Estimating the population of Bunia is
      more challenging due to less frequent official censuses and potential displacement.
      However, estimates consistently place it in the hundreds of thousands. For example,
      a 2012 estimate was around 366,000. More recent estimates (considering urban
      growth and refugee influx) often range much higher, sometimes cited as over

      2.  **Find the population of Yunta:** Census data and local information indicate
      Yunta has a tiny population, typically numbering in the low double digits (e.g.,
      the 2021 Australian census recorded a population of 20 for the Yunta locality).

      (a geographical and statistical division) within the state of Minas Gerais,
      Brazil. It is not a single town or city but an area comprising many municipalities.

      4.  **Find the population of Zona da Mata:** Being a large region containing
      significant cities like Juiz de Fora (itself with over half a million inhabitants),
      the total population of the Zona da Mata region numbers in the millions (estimated
      at over 2.5 million people).

      5.  **Compare the populations:** Yunta''s population (~20 people) is vastly
      smaller than the population of the Zona da Mata region (>2,500,000 people).

      6.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Yunta is *more* populous
      than Zona da Mata. Since ~20 is much, much less than >2,500,000, Yunta is not
      more populous.
