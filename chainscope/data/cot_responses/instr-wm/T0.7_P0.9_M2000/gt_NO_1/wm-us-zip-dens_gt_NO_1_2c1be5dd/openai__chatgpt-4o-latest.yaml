      \  - Population density is typically measured as the number of people per square\

      to consider population density, which is calculated as:


      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Land Area}}

      \]


      ### Step 1: Identify Locations

      - ZIP code **88310** corresponds to **Alamogordo, NM**, located in southern
      New Mexico.

      - ZIP code **40336** corresponds to an area in **Estill County, KY**, which
      is a rural part of Kentucky.


      ### Step 2: General Population and Area Trends

      - **88310 (Alamogordo, NM)**: Alamogordo is a small city with a significant
      population. It''s not highly urbanized but has a moderate population density.

      - **40336 (Kentucky)**: This ZIP code covers a rural area in Estill County,
      which is known for its lower population density.


      ### Step 3: Comparing Population and Land Area

      - **88310, NM**: Population ~30,000; Land Area ~3,300 square miles.

      - **40336, KY**: Population ~4,000; Land Area ~150 square miles.

      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Land Area}}

      \]


      ### Step 1: Gather Population Data

      - **45176 (Williamsburg, OH)**: Estimated population ~9,000.
