      population densities than smaller towns or rural areas. Both Houston and New
      Orleans are major cities.

      3. **Compare the specific areas within the cities:**  Zip codes within a city
      can have varying population densities.  77099 corresponds to a part of Houston
      called the Energy Corridor, known for its office buildings and some residential
      areas. 70119 represents Uptown New Orleans, a largely residential area including
      the Garden District, known for its historic mansions and generally affluent
      population.  While both are within major cities, Uptown New Orleans is likely
      to have a more typical urban residential density. The Energy Corridor, with
      its mix of office space, might have lower residential density even though it
      is part of a very large city.

      4. **Formulate a hypothesis:** Given the mix of land use in 77099, it''s likely
      *less* densely populated than the primarily residential 70119.

      parts of the Uptown/Garden District and areas closer to the university area,
      also a mix of residential and commercial.

      4. **Consider factors that might influence density:**  Factors such as the prevalence
      of single-family homes versus apartments, presence of parks or other open spaces,
      and the mix of commercial and residential development all impact density.  Without

      for both zip codes to calculate population density.  This would provide a definitive
      answer.  Without this data, we rely on general knowledge and inferences.


      Since I don''t have access to specific population density data for these zip
      codes, I can''t give a definitive YES or NO.  However, given that both are in
      major cities and appear to have mixed development, it''s likely the densities
      are relatively similar.  I would lean towards NO, simply because Houston is
      so sprawling, that even relatively dense areas might be less dense than comparable
      areas in a smaller, more concentrated city like New Orleans.  However, this
      is a guess without proper data.

      code in Massachusetts, even in a less dense area, is likely to be smaller and
      have a higher population density.

      4. **Consider exceptions:** While Texas is generally less dense, specific locations
      within Texas, especially near large cities, could be more densely populated
      than some areas of Massachusetts. However, 01520 is in Worcester County, MA
      which is relatively densely populated compared to rural areas of the state.  77365
      is in Waller County, TX, a more rural area outside of Houston.


      Therefore, it''s highly probable that 77365, TX is *less* densely populated
      than 01520, MA.

      of people per unit of area (e.g., people per square mile).  We need to compare
      the population density of these two zip codes.

      for each zip code (population / area). Then, we compare the two densities to
      determine which is greater.

      corresponds to a location in Texas, likely a suburban or rural area. 01520,
      MA corresponds to a location in Massachusetts, possibly also suburban or rural.


      2. **Consider general population density differences between states:**  Massachusetts
      tends to have higher population density overall compared to Texas.


      3. **Zip codes and density:** Zip codes don''t have uniform size or population.
      A very large, sparsely populated zip code in Texas could have the same population
      as a smaller, densely populated zip code in Massachusetts. Therefore, comparing
      zip codes directly based on population density can be misleading.  We need to
      find population and area data for each zip code.

      TX) has a population density of approximately 1,004 people per square mile.

      to Hampton, Virginia, and 97217 refers to Portland, Oregon.

      2. **Consider population density:** Population density is a measure of population
      per unit area.  We need to find or estimate this for both zip codes.  Direct
      density figures for zip codes aren''t always readily available.

      3. **Reasoning:** Hampton, VA is part of a larger metropolitan area in the relatively
      densely populated eastern US. Portland, OR, while a major city, has areas that
      are less dense, especially as you move further from the city center.  Zip codes
      can encompass varied areas, and 97217 appears to be more suburban/residential
      based on a quick search.

      4. **Inference:**  It''s highly probable that a zip code within Hampton, VA,
      part of a larger, denser metropolitan area on the East Coast, would have a higher
      population density than a likely more suburban/residential zip code in Portland,
      OR.

      to Hampton, Virginia, and 97217 corresponds to Portland, Oregon.

      2. **Consider population density:**  Generally, cities are more densely populated
      than surrounding suburban or rural areas.  Hampton is a city, part of the Virginia
      Beach-Norfolk-Newport News metro area.  Portland is a major city. Zip code 97217
      is within the city limits.

      3. **Compare city sizes:** While both are cities, Portland is significantly
      larger than Hampton.  Larger cities tend to have greater population densities,
      especially when comparing a major city like Portland to a smaller city like
      Hampton.

      4. **Consider specific zip codes:** Zip codes within a city can vary in density.
      However, given the significant size difference between the two cities, it''s
      highly likely that even a less dense area of Portland is denser than a more
      dense area of Hampton.

      4. **Seek a reasonable proxy for comparison:**  A reasonable proxy might be
      to compare the overall population density of the larger areas containing these
      zip codes.  Dearborn Heights is part of the Detroit metro area, while Hyattsville
      is part of the Washington D.C. metro area.  Both are substantial urban areas.


      5. **Compare the population densities of the metro areas:** The Washington D.C.
      metro area is generally considered to be more densely populated than the Detroit
      metro area.  Hyattsville, being quite close to D.C. itself, is likely to be

      both very high and very low population density. New York, particularly Long
      Island where Hicksville is located, tends to have higher, more consistent population
      density.

      Central Valley, its overall population density is likely lower than a suburb
      of New York City.

      densely populated than Rhode Island.  San Antonio is a large city but covers

      is a large state with areas of both high and low population density. San Antonio

      urban area.  Dallas is also a densely populated urban area.  This doesn''t give
      us enough information.

      3. **Look for more specific data:** We need population and area data for both
      zip codes to calculate population density (population/area).  A quick search
      online can provide this information through various sources like the U.S. Census
      Bureau or other demographic data providers.

      densities for both zip codes, we can compare them directly.

      to a zip code in Denver, Colorado. 85705 corresponds to a zip code in Tucson,
      Arizona.


      2. **Consider population density:** Population density is a measure of population
      per unit area.  Generally, urban areas have higher population densities than
      suburban or rural areas.


      3. **Compare the nature of the locations:** Denver (80234) is a major city and
      part of a large metropolitan area. Tucson (85705) is also a city, but generally
      considered less densely populated than Denver.


      4. **Formulate a hypothesis:**  Given Denver''s larger metropolitan area and
      urban nature, it''s likely that 80234, CO has a higher population density than
      85705, AZ.


      5. **Seek confirmation (optional, but recommended for accuracy):** Comparing
      census data or using online population density tools would confirm this.  However,
      based on general knowledge of these cities, a reasonable assumption can be made.

      2. **Consider population density factors:** Generally, large cities tend to
      have higher population densities than smaller cities. Denver is a larger city
      than Tucson.  Therefore, it''s *likely* that a zip code within Denver would
      be more densely populated than one in Tucson.


      3. **Recognize the need for specific data:** While the general city sizes suggest
      a likely answer, zip codes within cities can vary greatly in density.  We need
      actual population density data for these specific zip codes to be certain.  Without
      that data, we can only make an educated guess.



      Since the question requires a definitive YES or NO and we don''t have specific
      data for the zip codes, I cannot definitively answer.  I could make an educated

      Jose area (Silicon Valley), is known for being densely populated.  While parts
      of Illinois can be dense, especially around Chicago, Addison is a suburb and
      likely less dense than San Jose.

      for both zip codes. This information can be found online through sources like
      the U.S. Census Bureau.  A quick search reveals that Framingham (01701) is a
      city, while The Woodlands (77389) is a more sprawling suburban area. Cities
      generally have higher population densities than suburban areas.


      4. **General comparison (without precise data):**  Given the urban nature of
      Framingham vs. the suburban nature of The Woodlands, it''s highly likely Framingham
      is more densely populated.

      to Framingham, MA, a suburb of Boston. 77389 corresponds to The Woodlands, TX,
      a suburb of Houston.

      2. **Consider general population density:** Suburban areas near large cities
      tend to be more densely populated than suburban areas further out or near smaller
      cities.  Framingham is part of the greater Boston metro area, a very densely
      populated region. The Woodlands, while part of the Houston metro area, is further
      out and might be less dense.

      3. **Look up population density data if readily available:**  A quick search
      can confirm population densities.  (This is the step where actual numbers would
      be used in a real-world scenario).


      Based on general knowledge and the likelihood that a suburb of Boston is denser
      than a further-out suburb of Houston, I would guess YES.
