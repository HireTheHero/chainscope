      to find the locations of Lake Albert and Lake George in New South Wales, Australia.


      2. **Determine relative position:** Once located, we need to determine if Lake
      Albert is further north than Lake George.


      3. **Consult a map:** Using a map of New South Wales, we can see that Lake George
      is located near Canberra, while Lake Albert is further south, closer to the
      Victorian border.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

      is situated in southern New South Wales, near Canberra.

      2. **Locate Lake Albert (NSW):** Lake Albert is located in the Riverina region
      of New South Wales, near Wagga Wagga. The Riverina is generally considered in
      the south/south western part of the state.

      3. **Compare their latitudes:**  To be north, Lake Albert would need to have
      a lower latitude number (further from the South Pole) than Lake George.  While
      both are in southern NSW, the Riverina is further south than the Canberra region.


      NO.

      3. **Compare Latitudes:** China is generally north of the United States.  Therefore,
      Mount Cangyan is likely north of Cathedral Lakes.


      4. **Confirm with a more precise check (optional but recommended):** A quick
