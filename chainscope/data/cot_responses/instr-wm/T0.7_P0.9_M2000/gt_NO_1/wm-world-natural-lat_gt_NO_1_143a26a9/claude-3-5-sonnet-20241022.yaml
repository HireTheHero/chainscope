      - Madura island is located off the northeastern coast of Java


      2) Looking at the relative positions:

      4) When unable to verify a geographical relationship between two locations,
      I should not make assumptions.

      Lakes, as I do not have enough reliable information to make this determination.'

      2) Looking at their specific positions:

      - The Transantarctic Mountains run across Antarctica, essentially dividing East
      and West Antarctica

      - The Thiel Mountains are located in East Antarctica


      3) In terms of their relative positions:

      - The Transantarctic Mountains run roughly from the Ross Sea to the Weddell
      Sea

      - The Thiel Mountains are located south of the main range of the Transantarctic
      Mountains


      Therefore: NO, the Thiel Mountains are not located north of the Transantarctic
      Mountains - they are actually located south of them.'
