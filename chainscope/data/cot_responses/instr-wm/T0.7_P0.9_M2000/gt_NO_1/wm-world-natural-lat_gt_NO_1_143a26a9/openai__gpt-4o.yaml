      located north of Prince Christian Sound in Greenland.

      slightly into southwestern France.


      2. **Identify the location of Gazivoda Lake**: Gazivoda Lake, also known as
      Lake Ujman, is located in the region of Kosovo, which is in the Balkans, southeastern
      Europe.


      3. **Compare the geographical latitudes**: The Basque Country is situated in
      northern Spain and southwestern France, which is generally further to the north

      - **Latitude of Seto Inland Sea**: The Seto Inland Sea is in Japan, which is

      - **Latitude of Show Low Lake**: Show Low Lake in Arizona is located at approximately
      34 degrees north latitude.


      Since both locations are at similar latitudes, but Show Low Lake is slightly

      both Mount Makaturing and Latukan:


      1. **Identify the location of Mount Makaturing**: Mount Makaturing is a stratovolcano
      situated in the Philippines, specifically on the island of Mindanao. It is part
      of the Central Mindanao Arc and is located in Lanao del Sur province.


      2. **Identify the location of Latukan**: It seems there might be a misunderstanding
      or error in the question, as there is no well-known place called Latukan. However,
      there is a place called Lantawan, which is also in Mindanao but not directly
      related to Mount Makaturing. Assuming there might be a confusion with a nearby
      location, we can consider nearby towns or regions.


      3. **Determine relative positions**: If we consider the possible confusion with
      a nearby location, such as Lantawan or another nearby town in Mindanao, we still
      need specific latitudinal data to make a precise determination. Without the
      exact coordinates or a clear identification of "Latukan," we cannot definitively
      say if Mount Makaturing is north or south of it.


      Given the lack of a clear reference to what "Latukan" is supposed to be and
      the necessary geographical data, it is not possible to provide a definitive
      answer. Therefore, based on the information available:


      NO, we cannot affirmatively say Mount Makaturing is north of "Latukan" without
      further clarification on the location referred to as "Latukan."'

      1. Identify the location of Mount Makaturing: Mount Makaturing is a stratovolcano
      located in the Philippines, specifically on Mindanao Island in the Lanao del
      Sur province.


      2. Identify the location of Latukan: It seems there might be a confusion with
      the name "Latukan." If you meant "Lutayan," it is a municipality in the province
      of Sultan Kudarat, Mindanao, Philippines. However, if "Latukan" is intended
      to refer to a specific place, further clarification would be needed. For the
      sake of this question, let''s assume you meant a place nearby Mount Makaturing.


      3. Compare their latitudinal positions: Lanao del Sur, where Mount Makaturing
      is located, is positioned in central Mindanao. If the correct location of "Latukan"
      is nearby or within the same region, we need to compare their specific latitudes.


      Since there is some ambiguity in identifying "Latukan," we assume it refers
      to a location south of Mount Makaturing for this exercise.


      Based on the assumption that "Latukan" is a place south of Mount Makaturing:


      - The answer is NO, Mount Makaturing is not located north of Latukan if Latukan
      is assumed to be south of it.


      If "Latukan" refers to a different location or if further clarification is provided,
      the answer might differ.'

      1. **Lake Malawi**: This is a large lake in Africa, located in the Great Rift
      Valley. It is bordered by Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania. Geographically,
      it is situated in the southeastern part of the African continent.


      2. **Van Diemen Gulf**: This is a body of water in the Northern Territory of
      Australia. It is located north of Darwin, which is in the northern part of Australia.


      Now, to compare their relative positions:


      - Lake Malawi is in the southern hemisphere, specifically in southeastern Africa.

      - Van Diemen Gulf is also in the southern hemisphere but located in northern
      Australia.


      Given their locations, Van Diemen Gulf is considerably closer to the equator

      1. **Farallones de Cali**: This is a mountain range in the western Andes of
      Colombia, located near the city of Cali in the Valle del Cauca department.


      2. **Chini Lake**: This is a bit ambiguous without further context, but assuming
      you are referring to a known lake named Chini Lake, we would need to identify
      its specific location. For the purpose of this question, I will assume Chini
      Lake refers to a location possibly in Colombia or nearby.


      Given the mountain range''s known position, if Chini Lake is a well-documented
      location, we can compare its latitude with that of Farallones de Cali:


      - If Chini Lake''s latitude is greater than that of Farallones de Cali, then
      it is north.

      - If Chini Lake''s latitude is less, then it is south.


      Without a specific reference to a recognized Chini Lake within Colombia or a

      location, it is challenging to definitively answer the question. However, based
      on typical geographic naming and given the absence of a widely recognized Chini

      - The Belianske Tatras are situated in Europe, specifically in Slovakia.

      - Kakagi Lake is situated in North America, specifically in Canada.


      Based on their respective continental positions, the Belianske Tatras (in Slovakia)

      - Carinthia is generally situated to the east of Switzerland.

      - Switzerland is located to the west of Austria.

      - Lake Brienz is in the central part of Switzerland.


      Given these points, we can look at the general latitudinal positions:


      - Austria, particularly the region of Carinthia, tends to be at a higher latitude
      compared to central Switzerland.

      - Therefore, Weissensee in Carinthia is generally north of Lake Brienz.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      **YES**'

    175e4042-412e-44c2-b939-23f1d2750189: 'To determine whether the Gagra Range is
      located north of Lizard Pond in New York, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the location of Gagra Range:** The Gagra Range is a mountain range
      located in the Caucasus region of Georgia. It is not in the United States or
      near New York.


      2. **Identify the location of Lizard Pond:** Lizard Pond is located in the Adirondack
      Mountains in New York, USA.


      3. **Compare the geographical locations:** Since the Gagra Range is in Georgia
      (the country in the Caucasus region) and Lizard Pond is in New York (USA), they
      are on completely different continents.


      Based on this information, the answer to whether the Gagra Range is located
