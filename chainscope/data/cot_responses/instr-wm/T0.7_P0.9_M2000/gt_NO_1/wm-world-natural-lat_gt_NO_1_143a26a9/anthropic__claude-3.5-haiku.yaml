      1. First, I''ll locate Loch of the Lowes:

      - Loch of the Lowes is located in Perthshire, Scotland

      - It is near the town of Dunkeld in central Scotland


      2. Next, I''ll locate Blackwater Reservoir:

      - Blackwater Reservoir is located in the Scottish Highlands

      1. First, I''ll need to locate Gagra Range and Lizard Pond (New York)


      2. Gagra Range is actually a mountain range located in the Caucasus region of

      3. Lizard Pond is a location in New York, United States


      4. These two places are on different continents, thousands of miles apart


      5. Given their geographic locations, I can definitively say that the Gagra Range
