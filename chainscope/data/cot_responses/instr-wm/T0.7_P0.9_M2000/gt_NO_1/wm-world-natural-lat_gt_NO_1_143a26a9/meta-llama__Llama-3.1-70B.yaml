      Lake Albert (New South Wales) and Lake George (New South Wales), let''s break
      down the question into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      lakes. Lake Albert and Lake George are both located in New South Wales, Australia.
      Lake Albert is situated near the city of Wagga Wagga, while Lake George is located
      in the eastern part of the state.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      positions of these lakes relative to each other. Lake Albert is situated more
      to the west, closer to the center of New South Wales, while Lake George is located
      in the eastern part of the state, closer to the coast.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Comparing the positions, since Lake Albert is to the
      west and Lake George is to the east, and considering the general orientation
      of New South Wales, we can infer their relative north-south positioning.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Parry
      Sound and Retezat Mountains. Parry Sound is a town located in Ontario, Canada,
      on the eastern shore of Georgian Bay. Retezat Mountains, on the other hand,
      are a mountain range in the Southern Carpathians of Romania.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      positions of both locations. Parry Sound is in Ontario, Canada, which is in
      North America. Retezat Mountains are in Romania, which is in Europe.

      a series of steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Bali Sea and Madura Strait. The Bali Sea is a body of water located in the Indonesian
      archipelago, specifically between the islands of Bali and Java. The Madura Strait,
      on the other hand, is a strait that separates the island of Java from the island
      of Madura.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine their geographic positions
      relative to each other. The Bali Sea is generally situated to the east of the
      Java island, while the Madura Strait is situated north of the eastern part of
      Java.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Comparing the positions, since the Bali Sea is east
      of Java and the Madura Strait is north of the eastern part of Java, we can infer
      their relative north-south positioning.

      Serra de Monchique is a mountain range in the Algarve region of Portugal.


      2. **Determine the Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to understand if
      Crazy Lake is located north of Serra de Monchique. Since Crazy Lake is likely
      a local name, it''s not a widely known location on a global scale. Serra de
      Monchique, on the other hand, is a specific mountain range in Portugal.


      3. **Consider the General Geography**: Given that Crazy Lake is a local name,
      it''s likely not in the same region as Serra de Monchique. Portugal is a relatively
      small country, and the Algarve region, where Serra de Monchique is located,
      is in the southern part of the country.

      north of Ghoubbet-el-Kharab, let''s follow a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Identify Locations**: The Visayan Sea is a body of water located in the
      Philippines, specifically between the islands of Panay, Negros, Cebu, and Masbate.
      Ghoubbet-el-Kharab is a body of water in Djibouti, Africa, located in the Gulf
      of Tadjoura.


      2. **Geographical Positions**: The Philippines, where the Visayan Sea is located,
      is in Southeast Asia. Djibouti, where Ghoubbet-el-Kharab is located, is in the
      Horn of Africa. The Philippines is generally east of Africa, and Djibouti is
      located on the eastern coast of Africa.


      3. **North-South Orientation**: Considering the north-south orientation, the
      Philippines is generally north of Djibouti. The Visayan Sea is part of the Philippines,
      and Ghoubbet-el-Kharab is part of Djibouti.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions and the north-south orientation,
      the Visayan Sea is indeed located north of Ghoubbet-el-Kharab.

    f41e9bbb-b7bd-4baf-a648-4dfe967eba1e: 'To answer this question, we''ll need to
      follow a series of steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: The first step is to identify the locations in
      question. The Visayan Sea is a body of water located in the central Philippines,
      while Ghoubbet-el-Kharab is a body of water located in Djibouti, East Africa.


      2. **Determine the Geographic Context**: We need to understand the broader geographic
      context. The Visayan Sea is situated in the central part of the Philippines,
      an archipelago in Southeast Asia. Djibouti, where Ghoubbet-el-Kharab is located,
      is a country in East Africa, on the Horn of Africa.


      3. **Consider Relative Positions**: To determine if one is north of the other,
      we need to consider their relative positions. The Philippines is located in
      Southeast Asia, which is generally east of Africa. Djibouti is in East Africa,
      which is to the west of the Philippines.


      4. **Analyze North-South Orientation**: Given the general east-west orientation
      of the Philippines and Djibouti, it''s unlikely for the Visayan Sea to be directly
      north of Ghoubbet-el-Kharab.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic locations and their relative positions,
      it''s improbable for the Visayan Sea to be directly north of Ghoubbet-el-Kharab,

      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations in question.
      Lac Phillipe could refer to several places, so we need to ensure we''re referring
      to the correct one. Sand Lake (Kearney, Ontario) is more specific, but we still
      need to confirm the exact location.

      3. **Consider the Relative Positions**: Middle Harbour and Bantry Bay are both
      located in New South Wales, which is in the southern hemisphere. In the southern
      hemisphere, the further south you go, the closer you are to the South Pole,
      while the further north you go, the closer you are to the equator. Based on
      this, Middle Harbour would not be located north of Bantry Bay, as both bays
      are located in the same general region.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the above steps, we can conclude that Middle Harbour
      is not located north of Bantry Bay in New South Wales, Australia. Both bays
      are located in the same general region in the southern hemisphere, and thus,
      Middle Harbour is not north of Bantry Bay.

      a step-by-step process:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations mentioned
      in the question. Middle Harbour is a waterway in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
      Bantry Bay is also located in New South Wales, Australia, and it''s a bay situated
      in the northern suburbs of Sydney.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: To determine if Middle Harbour is located
      north of Bantry Bay, we need to understand their relative positions within New
      South Wales, Australia. Sydney is the largest city in New South Wales, and it''s
      situated on the eastern coast of the state.


      3. **Geographical Considerations**: Middle Harbour is a waterway within Sydney,
      which means it''s located within the city''s boundaries. Bantry Bay, on the
      other hand, is situated in the northern suburbs of Sydney. This suggests that
      Bantry Bay is further north than Middle Harbour, which is within the city.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Bantry Bay is in the northern suburbs of Sydney
      and Middle Harbour is within the city, it''s safe to conclude that Middle Harbour
      is not located north of Bantry Bay. Instead, Bantry Bay is likely located north
      of Middle Harbour.

      Sydney, Australia. Middle Harbour is a significant waterway, and Bantry Bay
      is a bay within Middle Harbour.


      2. **Geographic Context**: Sydney is situated on the east coast of Australia,
      with the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Blue Mountains to the west. The city''s
      geography is characterized by its harbor and surrounding waterways, including
      Middle Harbour.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if Middle Harbour is located north of
      Bantry Bay, we need to consider their relative positions within Sydney. Bantry
      Bay is located on the western side of Middle Harbour, while the main part of
      Middle Harbour extends to the east and south.


      4. **North-South Orientation**: In terms of north-south orientation, Bantry
      Bay is generally more to the west, while the main part of Middle Harbour extends
      to the east and south.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on their relative positions and the orientation of
      Middle Harbour, it''s unlikely that Middle Harbour is located north of Bantry

      3. **Compare Positions**: Considering the general north-south orientation of
      the Philippines, since Mount Isarog is in the Bicol Region, which is to the
      southeast of Capiz, Mount Isarog is not located north of Mount Panay but rather
      south of it.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the above steps, Mount Isarog is not located north
      of Mount Panay. Instead, it is south of Mount Panay when considering their geographical
      positions in the Philippines.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

    77213265-8e70-44ee-93b7-0b611560e6ff: 'To answer whether the Thiel Mountains are
      located north of the Transantarctic Mountains, we''ll need to break down the
      geographical information step by step:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: The Thiel Mountains and the Transantarctic Mountains
      are both mountain ranges located in Antarctica. The Thiel Mountains are situated
      in the Pensacola Mountains, which are part of the Transantarctic Mountains.
      The Transantarctic Mountains span the continent of Antarctica, dividing it into
      East Antarctica and West Antarctica.


      2. **Determine the Relative Positions**: The Thiel Mountains are located within
      the Pensacola Mountains, which are part of the Transantarctic Mountains. This
      means that the Thiel Mountains are not separate from the Transantarctic Mountains
      but are part of them.


      3. **Consider the Geography of Antarctica**: Antarctica is a vast continent
      with its own unique geography. The Transantarctic Mountains stretch across the
      continent, dividing it into two main regions: East Antarctica and West Antarctica.
      The Thiel Mountains, as part of the Pensacola Mountains, are located within
      the Transantarctic Mountains.


      4. **Analyze the Specific Relationship**: Given that the Thiel Mountains are
      part of the Pensacola Mountains, which are part of the Transantarctic Mountains,
      they cannot be located north of the Transantarctic Mountains. They are situated
      within the same mountain range.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical information, since the Thiel Mountains
      are part of the Transantarctic Mountains, they cannot be located north of the
      Transantarctic Mountains. They are part of the same mountain range and are not
      separate from it.

      California, where Tolay Lake is located, is in the United States, which is in
      North America.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Comparing the positions, since Greece is in Europe
      and the United States is in North America, there is a significant geographic
      distance between them. Greece is generally considered to be in the eastern hemisphere,
      while the United States is in the western hemisphere.


      4. **Consider Latitude**: When considering latitude, Greece is generally at
      a higher latitude than California. However, the concept of "north" and "south"
      is relative to the equator. If we consider the equator as the reference point,
      Greece is actually south of the equator, and California is north of the equator.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the above steps, Panachaiko, being in Greece, is not
      located north of Tolay Lake in California, considering the geographic distance
      and the relative positions of the two locations.

      1. **Identify the Locations**: The Stormberg Mountains are located in South
      Africa, specifically in the Eastern Cape province. The Moonbi Range is located
      in New South Wales, Australia.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Since these locations are in different
      countries, we need to consider their global positions. South Africa is located
      in the southern hemisphere, while Australia is in the southern hemisphere as
      well but further east.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Given that both locations are in the southern hemisphere,
      we can compare their positions relative to the equator. The Moonbi Range in
      Australia is generally north of the Stormberg Mountains in South Africa.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Saganaga Lake. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is
      a waterway located between the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state, USA, and
      Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. Saganaga Lake, on the other hand,
      is located in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota, USA.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we determine their geographic positions
      relative to each other. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is in the Pacific Northwest
      region of North America, while Saganaga Lake is in the northern part of Minnesota.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Comparing the positions, since the Strait of Juan
      de Fuca is located in the Pacific Northwest and Saganaga Lake is in northern
      Minnesota, they are in different regions of North America.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the above steps, the Strait of Juan de Fuca is not

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Lake Boyukshor and the Stansbury Mountains. Lake Boyukshor is a lake located
      in Azerbaijan. The Stansbury Mountains are a mountain range in Utah, United
      States.


      2. **Determine the Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the
      geographic relationship between these two locations. Azerbaijan, where Lake
      Boyukshor is located, is in the Caucasus region, which is in the south of the
      European continent. Utah, where the Stansbury Mountains are located, is in the
      western part of the United States, which is in North America.


      3. **Consider the Relative Positions**: Since Lake Boyukshor is in Azerbaijan,
      which is in the south of Europe, and the Stansbury Mountains are in Utah, which
      is in the western United States, it''s unlikely that Lake Boyukshor is located
      north of the Stansbury Mountains. Instead, it''s more likely that Lake Boyukshor
      is located to the east or southeast of the Stansbury Mountains.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general locations of Lake Boyukshor and the
      Stansbury Mountains, it''s highly unlikely that Lake Boyukshor is located north
      of the Stansbury Mountains. It''s more likely that Lake Boyukshor is located
      to the east or southeast of the Stansbury Mountains.

      in southern Austria. Lake Brienz is a lake situated in the Bernese Oberland
      region of Switzerland.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
      positions of these lakes relative to each other. Austria and Switzerland are
      neighboring countries in Central Europe. The state of Carinthia, where Weissensee
      is located, is in southern Austria, while Lake Brienz is situated in the central
