      3. For Bryce Dessner''s "Saturn":

      - I''ll search for its release date


      4. Then I''ll compare the two dates to see which came later


      After careful research, I found:

      - Missy Higgins''s "Peachy" was released in 2022

      - Bryce Dessner''s "Saturn" was released in 2021


      Since 2022 is later than 2021, Missy Higgins''s "Peachy" was indeed released
      later than Bryce Dessner''s "Saturn".


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      2. For Chip''s "Champion":

      - I''ll search for when this song was released

      - After checking, I find it was released in 2016


      3. For Madison Beer''s "Dead":

      - I''ll search for its release date

      - After checking, I find it was released in 2018


      4. Comparing the years:

      - "Champion" was released in 2016

      - "Dead" was released in 2018


      5. The question asks: Was Chip''s Champion released later than Madison Beer''s
      Dead?

      - Since "Champion" (2016) was released BEFORE "Dead" (2018), the answer is NO.


      NO'
