      military personnel and their families. The population can fluctuate based on

      does have a population due to the residents and military personnel stationed
      there, it is primarily a military installation rather than a traditional city
      or town. The population can fluctuate based on the assignment of military personnel
      and their families.


      2. **Merrill, WI**: Merrill is a city in Wisconsin. As a city, it has a civilian
      population that is counted in census data and is generally more stable in terms

      1. **Fort Stewart, GA**: Fort Stewart is a U.S. Army post located in Georgia.
      Generally, military bases have fluctuating populations depending on the deployment
      and assignment of military personnel. However, military bases are typically

      does not have a civilian population in the same way a city or town does. The

      2. **Merrill, WI**: Merrill is a city in Lincoln County, Wisconsin. As a civilian
      city, its population is counted as part of the census and consists of permanent
      residents.


      For a direct comparison, we need to consider what is being compared. If the
      population of Fort Stewart includes all military personnel stationed there at
      any point, it might exceed the population of a small city like Merrill, WI.

      to be significantly larger due to the transient military population.

      military personnel, Fort Stewart would be more populous. If comparing only the
      permanent civilian population, Merrill would have a defined civilian population,

      County, North Carolina. As an unincorporated area, it does not have a formal
      population count like incorporated towns or cities. However, it is part of the

      1. **University of California-Santa Barbara, CA**: This refers to a university
      campus, not an entire city. The population of a university campus is typically
      much smaller than that of a city or town. The student enrollment at the University
      of California-Santa Barbara is around 25,000-26,000 students.


      2. **La Homa, TX**: This is a census-designated place (CDP) in Texas. According
      to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of La Homa,
      TX is approximately 10,000 people.

      La Homa, TX, but it is still a campus and not a city with a permanent residential
      population.

      Given this, the question of whether a university campus is "more populous" than

      of the city of Santa Barbara, as of the latest data, is significantly larger

      It is a small community with a population that is generally in the range of
      several thousand people.


      Since we are comparing a university campus population to a CDP, and assuming

      of UCSB (students, faculty, and staff) is generally smaller than the population
