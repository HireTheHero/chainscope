      1. First, I''ll look up the population of Bellflower, CA

      - According to the 2020 US Census, Bellflower''s population is approximately
      76,616


      2. Next, I''ll look up the population of Folsom, CA

      - According to the 2020 US Census, Folsom''s population is approximately 82,203


      3. Comparing the two populations:

      - Bellflower: 76,616

      - Folsom: 82,203


      4. Since 82,203 is greater than 76,616, Folsom is more populous than Bellflower

    ae11c90e-c21f-4190-b243-d7640666bdf7: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll verify if Lake Norman of Catawba is an actual populated place:

      - Lake Norman is a large lake near Charlotte, North Carolina

      - Lake Norman of Catawba appears to be a community near this lake


      2. Next, I''ll check Cascades, VA:

      - Cascades is a census-designated place in Loudoun County, Virginia


      3. I''ll look up population data:

      - Lake Norman of Catawba population: Approximately 1,600-2,000

      - Cascades, VA population: Approximately 12,000-13,000


      4. Comparing the populations:

      - Cascades, VA has significantly more people than Lake Norman of Catawba


      5. Answering the specific question:

      - Is Lake Norman of Catawba more populous than Cascades, VA?

      - No, Cascades has a much larger population


      Answer: NO'

      1. First, I''ll find the population of Bealeton, VA

      - Bealeton is a small unincorporated community in Fauquier County, Virginia

      - It does not have an official population count in census data

      - It is very small and rural


      2. Next, I''ll find the population of Pinetop-Lakeside, AZ

    88f226b8-5b77-4353-9dc5-7a78b8fb2786: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll check if Bangor Base, WA is a real place:

      - Bangor Base is a naval submarine base located in Washington state

      - It''s a military installation, not a typical city or town

      - Military bases typically have a small, transient population


      2. Next, I''ll look at Willis, TX:

      - Willis is a small town in Montgomery County, Texas

      - It has a population of around 6,000-7,000 people


      3. For military bases like Bangor Base:

      - The population is usually limited to military personnel and their families

      - Typically, this would be much smaller than a civilian town


      4. Comparing the populations:

      - Willis, TX has several thousand residents

      - Bangor Base is likely to have a much smaller population


      5. Conclusion:

      - Willis, TX is almost certainly more populous than Bangor Base, WA
