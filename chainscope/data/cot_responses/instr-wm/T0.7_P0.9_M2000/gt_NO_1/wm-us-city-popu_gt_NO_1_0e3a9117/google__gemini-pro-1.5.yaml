      likely that a regular town or CDP would have a larger population than a military
      base, unless the base is exceptionally large or the town is very small.

      3. **Look up populations:**  While the prompt requests reasoning first, it''s
      important to verify. A quick search shows Paramount-Long Meadow, MD has a population
      of around 2,600. Aberdeen Proving Ground has a resident population much smaller
      than that.

      and part of the Greensboro, NC metropolitan area.  It doesn''t have its own

      McLeansville to compare, which isn''t what the question asks.

      own reported population.  A quick search finds a population figure (around 1,000,
      though the exact number isn''t crucial for this comparison).


      3. **Compare:** Since McLeansville doesn''t have its own population figures
      and is part of a larger metropolitan area, it''s highly likely that the larger
      area including McLeansville has a greater population than the small borough
      of Califon. However, the question specifically asks about McLeansville itself.  We
      can''t directly compare the population of McLeansville to Califon.

      of Ridgefield (which includes Ridgebury) is greater than the population of Experiment.  Therefore,

      of Ridgefield that constitutes Ridgebury has more people than Experiment.

    0b3d0200-e88f-41d2-ae9d-093e6702d5ca: '1. **Lake Norman, NC:** Lake Norman is
      not a city itself, but a large lake surrounded by several towns in different
      counties.  The question likely refers to the area broadly considered "Lake Norman,"
      which would include towns like Cornelius, Davidson, and Huntersville.  There
      isn''t a single population figure for "Lake Norman."


      2. **Cascades, VA:** Cascades is a census-designated place (CDP) in Loudoun
      County, Virginia.  CDPs are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical
      purposes and are generally unincorporated communities.


      3. **Population Comparison:** Since "Lake Norman" isn''t a defined entity with
      a single population, we can''t directly compare it to Cascades, VA.  However,
      even the individual towns around Lake Norman (Cornelius, Davidson, Huntersville)
      are significantly larger than Cascades, VA.


      4. **Conclusion:**  While a direct comparison is impossible, the area generally
      referred to as "Lake Norman" is undoubtedly more populous than the CDP of Cascades,
      VA.


      **YES**

    0df18dbc-a081-4d31-900d-88a95d1d98ca: '1. **Lake Norman of Catawba, NC:** This
      refers to a community surrounding Lake Norman, primarily located in Catawba
      County.  It isn''t an incorporated place with its own official population.  Therefore,
      it doesn''t have a single, definitive population number.


      2. **Cascades, VA:** This is a census-designated place (CDP) in Virginia, meaning
      it has a defined boundary and a population count recorded by the U.S. Census
      Bureau.


      3. **Comparison:** Since Lake Norman of Catawba doesn''t have an official population,
      we can''t directly compare it to Cascades, VA.  Any population estimate for
      the Lake Norman area would likely include portions of multiple towns and counties.


      Therefore, the question cannot be definitively answered as stated.  However,
      if the intent is to ask if the general area around Lake Norman in Catawba County
      has more residents than the CDP of Cascades, VA, then the practical answer is
      likely YES, given the large area and multiple towns associated with Lake Norman.  But
      since the question as written is about specific population numbers, and one
      doesn''t exist for Lake Norman of Catawba, the most accurate answer based on
      the phrasing is:


      NO

      3. **Comparison:** Compare the populations found in steps 1 and 2.


      According to the 2020 US Census, Lake Norman of Catawba, NC had a population

      3. **Comparison:** Since Lake Norman of Catawba doesn''t have a single population

      Therefore, the question, as phrased, cannot be definitively answered with a
      YES or NO.  However, if the intent was to compare the population *around* Lake
      Norman to Cascades, the answer would likely be YES, as the area around Lake
      Norman encompasses numerous towns and communities.  But given the specific wording

    0449c74c-7413-4ca9-bb9e-198d0eecd831: '1. **Identify the nature of "Whidbey Island
      Station, WA":**  A quick search reveals Whidbey Island Station is a naval air
      station, not an incorporated city or town.  Its population is primarily military
      personnel and their families living on base.  It''s part of Island County, WA,
      but doesn''t have its own independent population figures separate from the county.


      2. **Consider La Villa, TX:** La Villa is an incorporated place in Texas and
      *does* have its own official population count.


      3. **Compare populations:**  Since Whidbey Island Station doesn''t have its
      own population separate from Island County, we can''t directly compare it to
      La Villa''s population. We can only compare Island County''s population to La
      Villa''s, which is not what the question asks.

    0e756ec4-6244-47fa-bfc5-9b74ac31c380: '1. **Identify the nature of "Whidbey Island
      Station, WA":** Whidbey Island Station is a Naval Air Station, a military installation.  It''s
      not a city or town incorporated for civilian population tracking.

      2. **Consider how population is counted:** Population counts for cities and
      towns usually refer to civilian residents. Military personnel stationed at a
      base are not typically included in the town/city population where the base is
      located.

      3. **Infer the population of Whidbey Island Station:** While military personnel
      and their families live on or near the base, they would likely be counted as
      part of Oak Harbor, WA (the nearest city) if they are counted as residents at
      all. The "population" of Whidbey Island Station itself would essentially be
      zero in the context of comparing it to civilian towns.

      4. **Understand the question''s intent:** The question is comparing populations
      of settlements. Since Whidbey Island Station doesn''t have a civilian population
      in the conventional sense, it cannot be more populous than any actual town or
      city.

      is greater than the number of people living *in* La Villa, it''s not a comparable
      population statistic.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

    3f83d912-ef41-4b2d-bb7f-0b5b29d83ce7: '1. **Identify the nature of "Whidbey Island
      Station, WA":** Whidbey Island Station is a Naval Air Station.  It''s a base,
      not a town or incorporated area with its own population separate from the island
      it''s on.


      2. **Consider the population of a base vs. a town:** Military bases have personnel
      stationed there, but they aren''t counted as independent population centers
      in the same way a town like La Villa, TX would be.  The population of the base
      would be included in the overall island''s population.


      3. **Conclusion:** Since Whidbey Island Station isn''t a town with its own independent
      population count, it cannot be more populous than La Villa, TX, which *is* a
      town.

      Station, not a city or town incorporated with its own population figures.  It''s
      located on Whidbey Island, which has several towns and cities.


      2. **Identify La Villa, TX:** La Villa, TX is a recognized town/city in Texas
      and will have official population data.


      3. **Compare populations:** Since Whidbey Island Station isn''t a town with
      a population separate from the island it''s on, it can''t be *more* populous
      than any incorporated town.  The personnel stationed at the base are counted
      within the population of the island''s towns/cities where they reside.

      2. **Consider the population of Whidbey Island as a whole:**  While Whidbey
      Island has a population, the question specifically asks about "Whidbey Island
      *Station*."  We cannot use the island''s overall population.


      3. **Recognize the implication:** The question asks about the population of
      the *station* itself, implying the personnel stationed there (and possibly their
      families living on base).


      4. **Consider La Villa, TX:** La Villa, TX is a recognized town with its own
      reported population.


      5. **Compare:** Even a large naval station is unlikely to have a population
      exceeding that of a small town.

      quick search reveals that Whidbey Island Station has a population of around
      1,500-2,000, while La Villa has a population of around 2,000-2,300.  (Exact
      numbers vary slightly depending on the source and year.)

      3. **Compare populations:** We''re comparing the population *of the base* to

      it''s unlikely to surpass the entire population of a city, even a small one.
