      3. Reasoning:

      - Since Alleghenyville is an unincorporated community, it likely has a very
      small population

      - Union Bridge is an incorporated town with known population data

      - This suggests Union Bridge is larger

      2. Next, identify Willis, TX

      - Willis is a city in Montgomery County, Texas

      - As of the 2020 census, Willis had a population of approximately 6,800 people


      3. Compare populations

      - Bangor Base has military personnel and their families living on base

      - While exact numbers are not publicly available for security reasons, the entire
      Naval Base Kitsap (including Bangor) has around 13,000-14,000 active duty personnel

      - However, Bangor Base itself would only be a portion of that number


      4. Make final comparison
