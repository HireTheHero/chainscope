      1. First, I''ll locate Harris Theater in Pittsburgh, PA

      2. Then, I''ll locate O''Reilly Theater in Pittsburgh, PA

      3. Then, I''ll compare their geographical positions (north/south)


      Step 1: Harris Theater location

      - Harris Theater is located in the Cultural District of downtown Pittsburgh

      - Its specific address is 809 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222


      Step 2: O''Reilly Theater location

      - O''Reilly Theater is also located in Pittsburgh''s Cultural District

      - Its address is 621 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222


      Step 3: Comparing positions

      - Looking at a map, I can see that Harris Theater (809 Liberty Avenue) is slightly
      north of O''Reilly Theater (621 Penn Avenue)

      - Liberty Avenue is one block north of Penn Avenue in this part of downtown
      Pittsburgh


      Therefore:


      YES, Harris Theater is located north of O''Reilly Theater.'

      - Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota

      - This means it''s in the upper Midwestern United States


      Step 2: Lake Steilacoom location

      - Lake Steilacoom is in Washington state

      - Specifically, it''s near Tacoma, in the western part of Washington


      Step 3: Geographic comparison

      - Minnesota is geographically located east and north of Washington state

      - So a location in Minnesota would indeed be north of a location in western
      Washington


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Kenner Army Health Clinic, VA:

      - This is likely a military medical facility

      - The "VA" suggests it is in Virginia


      2. Next, I''ll locate Green River Lake, KY:
