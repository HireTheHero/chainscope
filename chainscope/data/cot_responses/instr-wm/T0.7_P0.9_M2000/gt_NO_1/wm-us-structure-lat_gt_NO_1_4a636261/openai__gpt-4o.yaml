    752febb8-d124-4332-9d28-20a7a89cf224: 'To determine whether Stockton Lake in Missouri
      is located north of Hawke Castle in California, we need to compare their geographical
      latitudes.


      1. **Locate Stockton Lake, MO:** Stockton Lake is a reservoir in southwestern
      Missouri. The approximate latitude of Stockton Lake is around 37.7 degrees North.


      2. **Locate Hawke Castle, CA:** Assuming you mean a specific place, let''s consider
      it near a known location. If Hawke Castle is in California, we need its approximate
      latitude. California stretches from about 32.5 degrees North to 42 degrees North,
      so we need a more specific location.


      3. **Comparison:** Since I don''t have the exact latitude of Hawke Castle, CA,
      I''ll assume it''s somewhere within the typical range of California''s latitudes.
      If Hawke Castle is in the southern part of California (e.g., below 37.7 degrees
      North), then Stockton Lake, MO, is north of it. If it''s in the northern part
      (above 37.7 degrees North), then Stockton Lake is south.


      Since California''s most northern points are above 37.7 degrees North, it depends
      on Hawke Castle''s specific location within California. If Hawke Castle is assumed
      to be in a central or southern location, then Stockton Lake, MO, is likely north
      of it.


      Without additional specific latitude information for Hawke Castle, CA, I cannot
      definitively say YES or NO. However, given the general latitude range of California,
      it is reasonable to assume Stockton Lake could be north of many points in California.


      Thus, based on assumptions, the answer would be:


      **YES**, Stockton Lake, MO is likely located north of Hawke Castle, CA, if Hawke
      Castle is in the southern part of California.'

      1. **Identify the Location of Stockton Lake, MO**: Stockton Lake is in southwestern
      Missouri. The approximate latitude of Stockton, MO, which is near the lake,
      is around 37.7 degrees north.


      2. **Identify the Location of Hawke Castle, CA**: Assuming Hawke Castle refers
      to a known location in California (note that it might not be widely recognized,
      but let''s assume it''s a fixed location), we need to estimate its latitude.
      If Hawke Castle is in the northern part of California, it could be around 39-41
      degrees north. If it''s in the central or southern part, it could range from
      32-38 degrees north.


      3. **Compare the Latitudes**: If Hawke Castle is indeed located in the northern
      part of California, its latitude would be greater than 37.7 degrees north, meaning
      Stockton Lake would be south of it. However, if Hawke Castle is in the southern
      or central part of California, its latitude would be less than 37.7 degrees
      north, meaning Stockton Lake would be north of it.


      For this question, if we assume a typical scenario where Stockton Lake, MO is
      compared to an average location in California, and without specific coordinates
      for Hawke Castle, the latitude of Stockton Lake (37.7 degrees) is likely to

      these steps:


      1. Identify the location of the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach.

      2. Identify the location of the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Miami.

      3. Compare the latitudinal coordinates (or general north-south positioning)
      of both locations.


      The Raleigh Hotel is located in Miami Beach, which is generally to the east
      of Miami. The Cathedral of Saint Mary is located in the city of Miami, which
      is on the mainland.


      Now, comparing the north-south positioning:

      - Miami Beach generally runs parallel to the mainland, so the specific north-south
      positioning will depend on the exact addresses.


      Given that Miami Beach stretches in a north-south direction along the coast,
      and without the exact addresses, a general understanding based on typical geographic
      layout would suggest that Miami Beach and Miami are more east-west of each other
      rather than significantly north-south.


      However, if we approximate the locations based on typical downtown Miami Beach
      and central Miami, Miami Beach tends to be slightly northward compared to central
      Miami.


      Thus, based on typical geographic orientation and without exact coordinates,
      the Raleigh Hotel in Miami Beach is generally located north of the Cathedral
      of Saint Mary in Miami.

      IN.


      3. **Compare the Relative Positions**: Both locations are in downtown Indianapolis.
      Since BMO Plaza is on North Pennsylvania Street and the Cadle Tabernacle site
      was at Ohio Street, we need to determine the relative north-south positioning.


      4. **Geographical Analysis**: Given their street addresses, BMO Plaza, being
      at "North Pennsylvania Street," suggests it is north of Ohio Street, where the
      Cadle Tabernacle was located.


      Based on this analysis, BMO Plaza is indeed located north of the Cadle Tabernacle
      site.

      1. **Locate Danville, PA**: Danville is a borough in Montour County, Pennsylvania.
      It''s situated in the central part of the state.


      2. **Locate the Basilica**: The Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius is located
      in Danville, PA, so it shares the same general geographic location.


      3. **Locate Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, PA**: The Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir
      is located in Centre County, Pennsylvania. It''s part of Bald Eagle State Park,
      which is also in the central part of the state, but generally slightly to the
      northwest compared to Danville.


      4. **Compare the Locations**: Danville, PA, is located to the southeast of the
      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir. Thus, the basilica, being in Danville, is also
      to the southeast.


      Based on this analysis, the Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Danville
      is not located north of the Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir.


      The answer is: NO.'

      2. **HERE Arts Center, NY**: This venue is located in New York City, specifically
      in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan.


      Next, we need to compare the relative latitudinal positions of Jersey City and
      Manhattan:


      - Jersey City is generally located to the west and slightly south of Manhattan,
      New York City.

      - SoHo is in the southern part of Manhattan, which places it further north compared
      to much of Jersey City.


      Based on this geographic understanding, White Eagle Hall in Jersey City is located
      south of HERE Arts Center in Manhattan.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**.'
