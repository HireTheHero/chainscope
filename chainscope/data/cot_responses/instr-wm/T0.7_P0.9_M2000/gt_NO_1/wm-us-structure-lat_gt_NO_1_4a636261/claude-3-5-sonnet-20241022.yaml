      - Wilshire Blvd runs east-west

      - The Mark Taper Forum is in the downtown area

      - Immanuel Presbyterian Church is in the Koreatown/Westlake area


      4) Comparing their positions:

      - Immanuel Presbyterian Church is west of downtown and further south than the
      Mark Taper Forum

      - The Mark Taper Forum sits in a more northerly position in the city

      - Charles E. Nelson House is in Salem, Oregon


      2) Now let me determine their relative positions:

      - Portland is located in northern Oregon

      - Salem is located in central Oregon, south of Portland


      3) Since Portland is north of Salem, and:

      - Mission Theater and Pub is in Portland

      - Charles E. Nelson House is in Salem


      Therefore, Mission Theater and Pub is north of Charles E. Nelson House.

      2) Now, let me check their relative positions:

      - Portland is located in northern Oregon

      - Salem is located in central Oregon, south of Portland


      3) Since Portland is north of Salem, and Mission Theater is in Portland while
      Charles E. Nelson House is in Salem, Mission Theater must be north of Charles
      E. Nelson House.

      1) Let me find the locations:

      - Mission Theater and Pub is in Portland, Oregon

      - Charles E. Nelson House is in Salem, Oregon


      2) Looking at Oregon''s geography:

      - Portland is located in northern Oregon

      - Salem is located in the Willamette Valley, south of Portland


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - Portland is approximately 47 miles north of Salem


      4) Therefore, since Mission Theater and Pub is in Portland, and Portland is
      north of Salem where the Charles E. Nelson House is located, the Mission Theater
      and Pub is indeed north of the Charles E. Nelson House.

      - St. Augustine Catholic Church is located at 1419 V Street NW

      - All Souls Church, Unitarian is located at 1500 Harvard Street NW


      2) Looking at a DC street map:

      - Harvard Street also runs east-west

      - Harvard Street is north of V Street


      3) Since All Souls Church is on Harvard Street which is north of V Street where

      1. Let me find Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael, NY

      - It''s located in Manhattan at 502 W 41st St, New York, NY


      2. Let me find Imperial Theatre, NY

      - It''s located at 249 W 45th St, New York, NY


      3. Let me compare their street numbers

      - Church is on 41st Street

      - Theatre is on 45th Street

      - In Manhattan, street numbers increase as you go north

      - Therefore, 45th Street is north of 41st Street


      4. Since the Imperial Theatre is on a higher numbered street than the church,
      the theatre is north of the church, not the other way around.


      NO'

      2) Looking at their relative positions:

      - The North End is located north of Boston Harbor

      - Kendall Square/Cambridge is located north of the Charles River but south of
      the North End


      3) Therefore, Improv Asylum (in the North End) is located north of Kendall Cogeneration
      Station.
