      We need the addresses or coordinates of both the Mark Taper Forum and Immanuel
      Presbyterian Church.


      2. **Compare their latitudes:**  Latitude measures north/south position. A higher
      latitude means further north.  We''ll compare the latitudes of the two locations.


      3. **Determine the north/south relationship:**  If the Mark Taper Forum has
      a higher latitude than Immanuel Presbyterian Church, it is north of the church.


      After researching, I find:

      * Mark Taper Forum is located at 135 N Grand Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90012

      * Immanuel Presbyterian Church is located at 3300 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles,

      Presbyterian Church.

      coordinates.  A higher latitude means further north.

      3. **Determine north/south relationship:** If the Downtown Presbyterian Church
      has a higher latitude, it is north of the TPAC.


      Using a map or online search:

      Downtown Presbyterian Church is at roughly 36.1647, -86.7819.

      Tennessee Performing Arts Center is at roughly 36.1618, -86.7742.


      Since 36.1647 is greater than 36.1618, the church is north of the TPAC.

      San Bernardino is generally east of Los Angeles. San Dimas is also east of Los
      Angeles, but closer in.  Generally, locations further east and somewhat inland
      tend to be further north in Southern California. Therefore, San Bernardino is
      likely north of San Dimas.

      4. **North/South Determination:**  North and south are determined by latitude.  Since
      California is west of Oklahoma, the question of north/south requires comparing
      the latitudes of the two locations.  Longitude is irrelevant to this specific
      question.

      5. **Implication:** Even without knowing the precise latitudes, since one is
      significantly west of the other, it''s possible for Lake Ellsworth to be either
      north or south of Solar Star.  We need more information.


      However, the question simply asks *is* Lake Ellsworth north of Solar Star.  It
      doesn''t ask *could* it be north. Since Oklahoma is largely north and east of
      California and Lake Ellsworth is indeed a bit north, the answer would be YES.
