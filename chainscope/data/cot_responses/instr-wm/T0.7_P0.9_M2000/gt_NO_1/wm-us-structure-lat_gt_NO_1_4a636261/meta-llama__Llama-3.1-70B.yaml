      \n3. **Compare the Locations**:\n   - To determine if the Mark Taper Forum is\
      \ north of the Immanuel Presbyterian Church, we need to understand the layout\
      \ of Los Angeles.\n\n4. **Los Angeles Layout**:\n   - Los Angeles is a large\
      \ city with a sprawling layout.\n   - It's essential to understand that \"north\
      \ of\" doesn't always mean a strict north-south alignment in a city as vast\
      \ and spread out as Los Angeles.\n\n5. **Specific Addresses**:\n   - Mark Taper\

      \ streets that run east-west (Wilshire Blvd and Grand Ave).\n\n7. **Determine\
      \ the Relationship**:\n   - Given the addresses, the Mark Taper Forum is not\
      \ directly north of the Immanuel Presbyterian Church. However, the concept of\
      \ \"north of\" can be subjective in a city as large and diverse as Los Angeles,\

      \   - Both locations are in Los Angeles, which is a large city in southern California.\
      \ The city is known for its sprawling urban landscape.\n\n3. **Compare Locations\
      \ in Terms of North-South Positioning**:\n   - Los Angeles is a large city with\

      \ of another within the same city, we need to understand the specific locations\
      \ and their relative positions within the city's layout.\n\n4. **Specific Locations**:\n\
      \   - Mark Taper Forum is located at 135 N Grand Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90012,\

      \ Los Angeles, CA 90010, USA.\n\n5. **Determine the Relationship**:\n   - Given\
      \ the addresses, we can see that Mark Taper Forum is located on Grand Avenue,\
      \ which is a major north-south street in Los Angeles. Immanuel Presbyterian\
      \ Church is on Wilshire Boulevard, another significant north-south street.\n\
      \n6. **Consider the Grid System**:\n   - Los Angeles follows a grid system for\
      \ its streets, with north-south streets typically being numbered and east-west\
      \ streets often being named.\n\n7. **Latitude Comparison**:\n   - Without exact\

      \   - To determine if Health Education Campus in Cleveland, Ohio, is north of\

      \ and longitude:\n     - Health Education Campus in Cleveland, OH, is approximately\

      7. **Final Consideration**:\n   - Since both locations are in the Midwest and\
      \ at roughly the same latitude, without knowing the exact locations within their\
      \ respective cities, it might seem challenging to definitively say one is north\
      \ of the other. However, considering typical city layouts and assuming the Health\
      \ Education Campus in Cleveland and the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Davenport\
      \ are relatively central, their north-south positioning can be estimated based\
      \ on the grid.\n\nGiven the addresses and knowing the layout of the Midwest,\
      \ we can make an educated guess. The locations are roughly at the same latitude,\
      \ and the difference is in the east-west positioning. However, considering the\
      \ grid and assuming the numbering system reflects distance from a central point\
      \ or river, we can estimate their positions.\n\nGiven the information and typical\
      \ layouts, the Health Education Campus, being in Cleveland, and the Sacred Heart\
      \ Cathedral, being in Davenport, and considering the general flow of the Midwest's\
      \ cities, it appears the Health Education Campus could be slightly north or\
      \ very close in latitude to the Sacred Heart Cathedral due to the parallel nature\

      \n2. **Understand Geographic Terms**:\n   - \"North of\" means that Marion Reservoir\
      \ is situated to the north, relative to Gibson Generating Station.\n\n3. **General\
      \ US Geography Knowledge**:\n   - Kansas is generally considered to be in the\
      \ central part of the United States, often thought of as part of the Midwest.\n\
      \   - Illinois is also in the Midwest, but it's more towards the eastern side.\n\
      \n4. **Compare Locations**:\n   - Kansas (where Marion Reservoir is) is west\
      \ of Illinois (where Gibson Generating Station is).\n\n5. **Determine North-South\
      \ Relationship**:\n   - Kansas is not significantly north of Illinois in a way\
      \ that would universally apply (since parts of Illinois are at a similar latitude\
      \ to parts of Kansas, and some areas of Illinois are even north of Kansas).\

      \ Illinois can be at a similar latitude to the southern parts of Kansas, but\
      \ overall, significant portions of Illinois are south of Kansas due to Illinois's\
      \ long north-south geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Latitude**:\n   -\
      \ Since Marion Reservoir, Kansas, is more towards the central United States\
      \ and Gibson Generating Station, Illinois, is more towards the eastern side,\
      \ to determine if Marion Reservoir is north of Gibson Generating Station, we\
      \ need to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use general\
      \ knowledge:\n     - Kansas' latitude ranges approximately from 37\xB0N to 40\xB0\
      N.\n     - Illinois' latitude ranges from about 36.5\xB0N to 42.5\xB0N.\n\n\
      Given the ranges, it's possible for parts of Illinois (especially the northern\
      \ parts) to be at a higher latitude (more north) than Kansas. However, without\
      \ specific latitudes for Marion Reservoir and Gibson Generating Station, the\

      \ in Kansas, has a latitude that would generally place it south of the northern\
      \ parts of Illinois but could be north of the southern parts of Illinois.\n\n\
      7. **Final Consideration**:\n   - Since Gibson Generating Station is in Illinois,\
      \ which spans a significant north-south distance, and without knowing its exact\
      \ location within Illinois, we must consider if Marion Reservoir could be north\
      \ of any part of Illinois where Gibson Generating Station might be. Given that\

      of California, while Humboldt County is also in the northern part but further
      west and closer to the coast.


      7. **Determine North-South Relationship**: Given the general north-south orientation
      of California and the relative positions of Trinity County and Humboldt County,
      it''s clear that Trinity Dam, being in Trinity County, is located north of Carson
      Mansion, which is in Humboldt County.


      8. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout of California and the positions
      of Trinity County and Humboldt County, the Trinity Dam is indeed located north
      of the Carson Mansion.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      \ in Rochester, Minnesota.\n   - The Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul is in\
      \ Lewiston, Maine.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic Positions**:\n   - Rochester,\

      \   - Generally, the Midwest is west of the Northeast in the United States layout.\n\
      \n4. **Consider North-South Relationship**:\n   - While the Midwest is generally\
      \ west of the Northeast, it's important to note that they can overlap in terms\
      \ of latitude. Some parts of the Midwest can be at the same latitude as parts\
      \ of the Northeast.\n\n5. **Determine North-South Orientation**:\n   - Without\
      \ specific coordinates, we rely on general knowledge of the areas. IBM Rochester\
      \ is in the Midwestern state of Minnesota, which is generally west of the northeastern\
      \ state of Maine, where Lewiston is located. However, the key is the north-south\
      \ orientation.\n\n6. **Latitude Comparison**:\n   - The latitude of Rochester,\
      \ Minnesota, is approximately 44.0\xB0 N.\n   - The latitude of Lewiston, Maine,\
      \ is approximately 44.1\xB0 N.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that both locations\
      \ are at roughly the same latitude (44.0\xB0 N and 44.1\xB0 N), the difference\
      \ in their north-south positioning is minimal or negligible based on this rough\
      \ estimate. However, considering the exact latitude and longitude:\n     - IBM\
      \ Rochester in Rochester, MN, is approximately at 44.0194\xB0 N, 92.4705\xB0\

      \ distance, and without knowing its exact location within Connecticut, we must\
      \ consider if Rondout Reservoir could be north of any part of Connecticut where\
      \ House VI might be. Given that some parts of Connecticut are north of New York's\
      \ latitude, the key is the specific location of House VI within Connecticut.\n\
      \n**Given the lack of specific information about House VI's location within\
      \ Connecticut and considering general geographic principles:**\n\nIf House VI\
      \ is in the southern part of Connecticut, then Rondout Reservoir could indeed\

      \ parts of Maryland, but overall, significant portions of Indiana are south\
      \ of Maryland due to Indiana's long north-south geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion\
      \ Based on Latitude**: \n   - Since AFI Silver, Maryland, is more towards the\
      \ eastern United States and Lake Monroe, Indiana, is in the Midwest, to determine\
      \ if AFI Silver is north of Lake Monroe, we need to consider their latitudes.\
      \ Without exact coordinates, we can use general knowledge:\n     - Maryland's\

      \ latitude ranges from about 37.8\xB0N to 41.8\xB0N.\n\nGiven the ranges, it's\
      \ possible for parts of Indiana (especially the northern parts) to be at a higher\
      \ latitude (more north) than Maryland. However, without specific latitudes for\

      \ it south of the northern parts of Indiana but could be north of the southern\
      \ parts of Indiana.\n\n7. **Final Consideration**: \n   - Since Lake Monroe\
      \ is in Indiana, which spans a significant north-south distance, and without\
      \ knowing its exact location within Indiana, we must consider if AFI Silver\
      \ could be north of any part of Indiana where Lake Monroe might be. Given that\

      \ Daphne, Alabama (AL).\n\n2. **Understand Geographic Terms**:\n   - \"North\
      \ of\" means that the location in question (Lake Pflugerville) is situated to\
      \ the north, relative to the other location (Malbis Memorial Church).\n\n3.\
      \ **General US Geography Knowledge**:\n   - Texas (TX) is generally considered\
      \ to be in the South-Central part of the United States.\n   - Alabama (AL) is\
      \ in the Southeastern United States.\n\n4. **Compare Locations**:\n   - Texas\
      \ (where Lake Pflugerville is) is west and somewhat central in the U.S.\n  \
      \ - Alabama (where Malbis Memorial Church is) is in the southeastern part of\
      \ the U.S.\n\n5. **Determine North-South Relationship**:\n   - Texas is not\
      \ significantly north of Alabama in a way that would universally apply (since\
      \ parts of Texas are at a similar latitude to parts of Alabama, and some areas\
      \ of Texas are even south of Alabama). However, considering the general positioning:\n\
      \     - The northern parts of Texas can be at a similar latitude to the southern\
      \ parts of Alabama, but overall, significant portions of Texas are south of\
      \ Alabama due to Texas's long north-south geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based\
      \ on Latitude**:\n   - Since Lake Pflugerville, Texas, is more towards the central\
      \ United States and Malbis Memorial Church, Alabama, is in the Southeast, to\
      \ determine if Lake Pflugerville is north of Malbis Memorial Church, we need\
      \ to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use general\
      \ knowledge:\n     - Texas's latitude ranges approximately from 25\xB0N to 37\xB0\
      N.\n     - Alabama's latitude ranges from about 30\xB0N to 35\xB0N.\n\nGiven\
      \ the ranges, it's possible for parts of Texas (especially the northern parts)\
      \ to be at a higher latitude (more north) than Alabama. However, without specific\
      \ latitudes for Lake Pflugerville and Malbis Memorial Church, the question becomes\
      \ about their general positions.\n\n- Lake Pflugerville, being in Texas, has\
      \ a latitude that would generally place it south of the northern parts of Alabama\
      \ but could be north of the southern parts of Alabama.\n\n7. **Final Consideration**:\n\
      \   - Since Malbis Memorial Church is in Alabama, which spans a significant\
      \ north-south distance, and without knowing its exact location within Alabama,\
      \ we must consider if Lake Pflugerville could be north of any part of Alabama\
      \ where Malbis Memorial Church might be. Given that some parts of Texas are\
      \ north of Alabama's latitude, the key is the specific location of Malbis Memorial\
      \ Church within Alabama.\n\n**Given the lack of specific information about Malbis\
      \ Memorial Church's location within Alabama and considering general geographic\
      \ principles:**\n\nIf Malbis Memorial Church is in the southern part of Alabama,\
      \ then Lake Pflugerville could indeed be north of it. However, if Malbis Memorial\
      \ Church is in the northern part of Alabama, Lake Pflugerville would likely\

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: Both Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral and Cathedral
      Basilica of St. James are located in Brooklyn, New York.


      2. **Understand Geographic Terms**: "North of" implies that one location is
      situated to the north of the other, meaning it is at a higher latitude or further
      away from the equator.


      3. **Consider Street Layout**: In many cities, including Brooklyn, streets are
      often laid out in a grid pattern. Understanding this grid can help determine
      relative north-south positions.


      4. **Street Grid in Brooklyn**: In Brooklyn, the street grid is generally aligned
      with the north-south axis. This means that streets running east-west are parallel
      to the equator, and streets running north-south are perpendicular to the equator.


      5. **Specific Addresses**: Without exact addresses, we can use general knowledge
      of the area. Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral is located on Remsen Street,
      and Cathedral Basilica of St. James is on Jay Street.


      6. **Compare Street Positions**: In the street grid of Brooklyn, Remsen Street
      and Jay Street are both north-south streets. However, Remsen Street is slightly
      further east than Jay Street.


      7. **Determine North-South Relationship**: Given the street grid and the specific
      street names, we can infer that Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral on Remsen
      Street is slightly further east but at a similar latitude to Cathedral Basilica
      of St. James on Jay Street.


      8. **Conclusion**: Given the street grid and the specific street names, Our
      Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral on Remsen Street is not significantly north
      of Cathedral Basilica of St. James on Jay Street. While they are at a similar
      latitude, the difference in their east-west positions does not make one significantly

    e5b3848b-e244-4ed1-81af-b6777ede8e87: 'To determine if Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite
      Cathedral is located north of Cathedral Basilica of St. James, both in Brooklyn,
      New York, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the cathedrals in Brooklyn, New York.


      2. **Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral**: This cathedral is located at
      113 Remsen Street in Brooklyn.


      3. **Cathedral Basilica of St. James**: This cathedral is located at 250 Willoughby
      Street in Brooklyn.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral
      is north of Cathedral Basilica of St. James, we need to understand the layout
      of Brooklyn. Brooklyn is part of New York City, and its streets are laid out
      in a grid pattern. Typically, the higher the street number, the more north you
      are in the city.


      5. **Street Grid**: In Brooklyn''s grid system, as you move north, the street
      numbers increase. 113 Remsen Street (Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral)
      and 250 Willoughby Street (Cathedral Basilica of St. James) are both located
      in the downtown area of Brooklyn.


      6. **Specific Addresses**: With these specific addresses, we can determine their
      relative positions. Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral is at 113 Remsen
      Street, and Cathedral Basilica of St. James is at 250 Willoughby Street.


      7. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given the grid system and specific
      locations, we can determine their relative positions. Both cathedrals are in
      the downtown area, relatively close to each other, and the difference in their
      locations would be based on the specific intersection and block they are on.


      8. **Conclusion**: Given that both cathedrals are in downtown Brooklyn and close
      to each other, without precise GPS coordinates or a detailed map, it might seem
      challenging to definitively say one is north of the other. However, considering
      typical street layouts and assuming the cathedrals are relatively central, their
      north-south positioning can be estimated based on the downtown grid.


      Given the addresses (113 Remsen Street for Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral
      and 250 Willoughby Street for Cathedral Basilica of St. James), and knowing
      the layout of downtown Brooklyn, we can make an educated guess. Remsen Street
      and Willoughby Street run parallel to each other, and the numbers suggest their
      relative east-west positioning rather than north-south. However, considering
      the grid and assuming the numbering system reflects distance from a central
      point or river, we can estimate their positions.


      Given the information and typical layouts, Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral,
      being on Remsen Street, and Cathedral Basilica of St. James, being on Willoughby
      Street, and considering the general flow of Brooklyn''s streets, it appears
      that Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral could be slightly north or very
      close in latitude to Cathedral Basilica of St. James due to the parallel nature
      of their streets and the close proximity of their addresses within the downtown
      area.

      1. **Identify Locations**: Both St. Augustine Catholic Church and All Souls
      Church, Unitarian, are located in Washington, D.C.


      2. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether St. Augustine Catholic
      Church is located north of All Souls Church, Unitarian.


      3. **Consider Cardinal Directions**: In a city like Washington, D.C., the streets
      are often laid out in a grid pattern, with avenues running north-south and streets
      running east-west.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Without specific addresses, we can rely on general
      knowledge of the city layout. Both churches are in Washington, D.C., so their
      north-south positioning is relative to the city''s grid.


      5. **Consider the Grid**: Given the grid system, the north-south positioning
      of the churches would depend on their specific intersection and block.


      6. **Conclusion**: Since both churches are in Washington, D.C., and without
      precise GPS coordinates or a detailed map, it might be challenging to definitively
      say one is north of the other. However, considering typical street layouts and
      assuming the churches are relatively central, their north-south positioning
      can be estimated based on the city''s grid.


      Given the addresses (St. Augustine Catholic Church at 1419 V Street NW, and
      All Souls Church, Unitarian, at 1500 Harvard Street NW) and knowing the layout
      of Washington, D.C., we can make an educated guess. Harvard Street NW runs parallel
      to V Street NW, and the numbers suggest their relative east-west positioning
      rather than north-south. However, considering the grid and assuming the numbering
      system reflects distance from a central point or landmark, we can estimate their
      positions.


      Given the information and typical layouts, the St. Augustine Catholic Church,
      being on V Street NW, and the All Souls Church, Unitarian, being on Harvard
      Street NW, and considering the general flow of Washington, D.C.''s streets,
      it appears the St. Augustine Catholic Church could be slightly north or very
      close in latitude to the All Souls Church, Unitarian due to the parallel nature
      of their streets and the close proximity of their addresses within the city.

      \ St Paul, MN 55101\n\n8. **Conclusion Based on Addresses**:\n   - In the Heart\
      \ of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre is located at 1500 E Lake St, which is\
      \ a north-south street.\n   - Fitzgerald Theater is located at 10 E Exchange\
      \ St, which is an east-west street.\n   - Since both addresses are on different\

      \ Theater is on an east-west street (E Exchange St). This means their north-south\
      \ positioning cannot be determined without additional information.\n\n**Final\
      \ Consideration**:\n\nAssuming we don't have more precise information about\
      \ their locations within Minneapolis, we cannot definitively say whether In\

      \ of Claytor Dam, but the difference is minimal.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   -\
      \ Given the similar latitudes, we can conclude that Claytor Dam, VA, is not\
      \ significantly north of O'Neill Forebay, CA. However, for the sake of a YES/NO\
      \ question and acknowledging the slight difference in latitude where O'Neill\
      \ Forebay is actually at a slightly higher latitude, the answer leans towards\
      \ NO because Claytor Dam is not definitively north of the forebay; they are\
      \ roughly at the same latitude.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NO}$\n\n"

      \ north, relative to the other location (O'Neill Forebay).\n\n3. **General US\
      \ Geography Knowledge**:\n   - Virginia (VA) is generally considered to be in\
      \ the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.\n   - California (CA) is on\
      \ the West Coast, spanning a significant portion of the western United States.\n\
      \n4. **Compare Locations**:\n   - Virginia (where Claytor Dam is) is east of\
      \ California (where O'Neill Forebay is).\n\n5. **Determine North-South Relationship**:\n\
      \   - Generally, Virginia is not significantly north of California, but it depends\
      \ on the specific locations within each state. Some parts of California can\
      \ be at a similar latitude to parts of Virginia, and some areas of California\
      \ are even north of Virginia. However, considering the general positioning:\n\
      \     - The northern parts of California can be at a similar latitude to the\
      \ southern parts of Virginia, but overall, significant portions of California\
      \ are south of Virginia due to California's long north-south geography.\n\n\
      6. **Conclusion Based on Latitude**:\n   - Since Claytor Dam, Virginia, is more\
      \ towards the eastern part of the United States and O'Neill Forebay, California,\
      \ is on the West Coast, to determine if Claytor Dam is north of O'Neill Forebay,\
      \ we need to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use\
      \ general knowledge:\n     - Virginia's latitude ranges approximately from 36\xB0\
      N to 39\xB0N.\n     - California's latitude ranges from about 32\xB0N to 42\xB0\
      N.\n\nGiven the ranges, it's possible for parts of California (especially the\
      \ northern parts) to be at a higher latitude (more north) than Virginia. However,\
      \ without specific latitudes for Claytor Dam and O'Neill Forebay, the question\
      \ becomes about their general positions.\n\n- Claytor Dam, being in Virginia,\
      \ has a latitude that would generally place it south of the northern parts of\
      \ California but could be north of the southern parts of California.\n\n7. **Final\
      \ Consideration**:\n   - Since O'Neill Forebay is in California, which spans\
      \ a significant north-south distance, and without knowing its exact location\
      \ within California, we must consider if Claytor Dam could be north of any part\
      \ of California where O'Neill Forebay might be. Given that some parts of California\
      \ are north of Virginia's latitude, the key is the specific location of O'Neill\
      \ Forebay within California.\n\n**Given the lack of specific information about\
      \ O'Neill Forebay's location within California and considering general geographic\
      \ principles:**\n\nIf O'Neill Forebay is in the southern part of California,\
      \ then Claytor Dam could indeed be north of it. However, if O'Neill Forebay\
      \ is in the northern part of California, Claytor Dam would likely be south of\
      \ it.\n\n**Assuming a general scenario without precise coordinates:**\n\nThe\

      \ Indianapolis, specifically at 135 N. Pennsylvania St.\n   - Cadle Tabernacle\
      \ is also located in downtown Indianapolis, at 421 W. Ohio St.\n\n4. **Consider\
      \ Cardinal Directions**: To determine if one location is north of another, we\
      \ look at their relative positions on a map. Generally, if one location is directly\
      \ north of another, it means that it's on the same line of latitude but at a\
      \ higher latitude (closer to the North Pole).\n\n5. **Specific Addresses**:\
      \ Looking at the specific addresses, we can see that both locations are in downtown\
      \ Indianapolis. However, BMO Plaza is on Pennsylvania St., which runs north-south,\
      \ while Cadle Tabernacle is on Ohio St., which also runs north-south.\n\n6.\
      \ **Compare Street Orientations**: Since both streets run north-south, we need\
      \ to determine if one is north of the other:\n\n   - BMO Plaza (135 N. Pennsylvania\
      \ St.) is on the northern side of Pennsylvania St.\n   - Cadle Tabernacle (421\
      \ W. Ohio St.) is on the western side of Ohio St.\n\n7. **Determine North-South\
      \ Relationship**: Given that both structures are on streets that run north-south\
      \ and they are both in downtown Indianapolis, we need to consider the relative\
      \ positions of the streets:\n\n   - Pennsylvania St. and Ohio St. intersect,\
      \ forming a crossroads in downtown Indianapolis.\n   - BMO Plaza is located\
      \ on the northern side of this intersection.\n   - Cadle Tabernacle is located\
      \ on the western side of this intersection.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Based on the\
      \ relative positions of the streets and the locations of the structures, we\
      \ can conclude that BMO Plaza (135 N. Pennsylvania St.) is located north of\
      \ Cadle Tabernacle (421 W. Ohio St.) in downtown Indianapolis.\n\nThe final\

      \ \n   - The question asks if Twitchell Reservoir in California is north of\

      \ 35\xB0N to 36.5\xB0N.\n\n6. **Compare the latitudes**: \n   - Since the latitude\

      \ the exact location of Twitchell Reservoir in California, it's difficult to\
      \ say definitively whether it is north of Nickajack Lake in Tennessee. However,\
      \ if we assume that Twitchell Reservoir is located in the northern part of California,\
      \ it is likely north of Nickajack Lake in Tennessee.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: \n\
      \   - Given the general geographic information and the assumption that Twitchell\
      \ Reservoir is in the northern part of California, it is likely that Twitchell\
      \ Reservoir is indeed north of Nickajack Lake in Tennessee.\n\nThe final answer\

      \n5. **Determine North-South Relationship**:\n   - Nevada is not significantly\
      \ north of North Carolina in a way that would universally apply (since parts\
      \ of North Carolina are at a similar latitude to parts of Nevada, and some areas\
      \ of North Carolina are even north of Nevada). However, considering the general\
      \ positioning:\n     - The northern parts of North Carolina can be at a similar\
      \ latitude to the southern parts of Nevada, but overall, significant portions\
      \ of North Carolina are south of Nevada due to North Carolina's long north-south\
      \ geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Latitude**:\n   - Since Boulder City\
      \ Hospital, Nevada, is more towards the central United States and Durham Performing\
      \ Arts Center, North Carolina, is on the East Coast, to determine if Boulder\
      \ City Hospital is north of Durham Performing Arts Center, we need to consider\
      \ their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use general knowledge:\n\
      \     - Nevada's latitude ranges approximately from 35\xB0N to 42\xB0N.\n  \
      \   - North Carolina's latitude ranges from about 34\xB0N to 36.5\xB0N.\n\n\
      Given the ranges, it's possible for parts of North Carolina (especially the\
      \ northern parts) to be at a higher latitude (more north) than Nevada. However,\
      \ without specific latitudes for Boulder City Hospital and Durham Performing\
      \ Arts Center, the question becomes about their general positions.\n\n- Boulder\
      \ City Hospital, being in Nevada, has a latitude that would generally place\
      \ it south of the northern parts of North Carolina but could be north of the\
      \ southern parts of North Carolina.\n\n7. **Final Consideration**:\n   - Since\
      \ Durham Performing Arts Center is in North Carolina, which spans a significant\
      \ north-south distance, and without knowing its exact location within North\
      \ Carolina, we must consider if Boulder City Hospital could be north of any\
      \ part of North Carolina where Durham Performing Arts Center might be. Given\
      \ that some parts of North Carolina are north of Nevada's latitude, the key\
      \ is the specific location of Durham Performing Arts Center within North Carolina.\n\
      \n**Given the lack of specific information about Durham Performing Arts Center's\
      \ location within North Carolina and considering general geographic principles:**\n\
      \nIf Durham Performing Arts Center is in the southern part of North Carolina,\
      \ then Boulder City Hospital could indeed be north of it. However, if Durham\
      \ Performing Arts Center is in the northern part of North Carolina, Boulder\
      \ City Hospital would likely be south of it.\n\n**Assuming a general scenario\
      \ without precise coordinates:**\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{YES}$\n\n"

      \ Peter Cathedral is in Los Angeles, California.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic\
      \ Terms**:\n   - \"North of\" means that the location in question (All Saints'\

      \ (Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral).\n\n3. **Consider the Geographic\
      \ Context**:\n   - Beverly Hills and Los Angeles are neighboring cities in Southern\

      \   - Since Beverly Hills is west of Los Angeles, it is not significantly north\

      \ the general positioning:\n     - The northern parts of Los Angeles can be\
      \ at a similar latitude to the southern parts of Beverly Hills, but overall,\
      \ significant portions of Los Angeles are south of Beverly Hills due to Los\
      \ Angeles' long north-south geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Latitude**:\n\
      \   - Since All Saints' Episcopal Church, Beverly Hills, is more towards the\
      \ west of Los Angeles and Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral, Los Angeles,\
      \ is in the central part of the city, to determine if the church is north of\

      \ about 33.9333\xB0N to 34.2833\xB0N.\n\nGiven the ranges, it's possible for\
      \ parts of Los Angeles (especially the northern parts) to be at a higher latitude\
      \ (more north) than Beverly Hills. However, without specific latitudes for All\
      \ Saints' Episcopal Church and Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral,\
      \ the question becomes about their general positions.\n\n- All Saints' Episcopal\
      \ Church, being in Beverly Hills, has a latitude that would generally place\
      \ it south of the northern parts of Los Angeles but could be north of the southern\
      \ parts of Los Angeles.\n\n7. **Final Consideration**:\n   - Since Our Lady\
      \ of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral is in Los Angeles, which spans a significant\
      \ north-south distance, and without knowing its exact location within Los Angeles,\
      \ we must consider if All Saints' Episcopal Church could be north of any part\
      \ of Los Angeles where the cathedral might be. Given that some parts of Los\
      \ Angeles are north of Beverly Hills' latitude, the key is the specific location\
      \ of the cathedral within Los Angeles.\n\n**Given the lack of specific information\
      \ about Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral's location within Los Angeles\
      \ and considering general geographic principles:**\n\nIf the cathedral is in\
      \ the southern part of Los Angeles, then All Saints' Episcopal Church could\
      \ indeed be north of it. However, if the cathedral is in the northern part of\
      \ Los Angeles, All Saints' Episcopal Church would likely be south of it.\n\n\

      \ border.\n     - Riffe Lake is in the southwestern part of Washington, not\
      \ too far from the Oregon border.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Latitude**:\n\
      \   - Since Dworshak Dam is in the northwestern part of Idaho and Riffe Lake\
      \ is in the southwestern part of Washington, to determine if Dworshak Dam is\
      \ north of Riffe Lake, we need to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates,\

      \ from 42\xB0N to 49\xB0N.\n     - Washington's latitude ranges from about 46\xB0\
      N to 49\xB0N.\n\nGiven the ranges, it's possible for parts of Washington (especially\
      \ the northern parts) to be at a higher latitude (more north) than Idaho. However,\
      \ without specific latitudes for Dworshak Dam and Riffe Lake, the question becomes\
      \ about their general positions.\n\n- Dworshak Dam, being in the northwestern\
      \ part of Idaho, has a latitude that would generally place it south of the northern\
      \ parts of Washington but could be north of the southern parts of Washington.\n\
      \n7. **Final Consideration**:\n   - Since Riffe Lake is in Washington, which\
      \ spans a significant north-south distance, and without knowing its exact location\
      \ within Washington, we must consider if Dworshak Dam could be north of any\
      \ part of Washington where Riffe Lake might be. Given that some parts of Washington\
      \ are north of Idaho's latitude, the key is the specific location of Riffe Lake\
      \ within Washington.\n\n**Given the lack of specific information about Riffe\
      \ Lake's location within Washington and considering general geographic principles:**\n\
      \nIf Riffe Lake is in the southern part of Washington, then Dworshak Dam could\
      \ indeed be north of it. However, if Riffe Lake is in the northern part of Washington,\
      \ Dworshak Dam would likely be south of it.\n\n**Assuming a general scenario\

    b74e4367-4ea5-4a04-8102-41e3c8551662: 'To determine if Five Wounds Portuguese
      National Church in California (CA) is located north of Mammoth Pool Reservoir,
      also in California, we need to break down the process step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations of
      both the Five Wounds Portuguese National Church and Mammoth Pool Reservoir.
      While we know they are both in California, we need to pinpoint their specific
      locations within the state.


      2. **Understand Geographic Context**: California is a large state with varying
      landscapes and geographic features. To understand the relationship between these
      two locations, we need to consider the general geography of California.


      3. **Consider North-South Positioning**: To determine if one location is north
      of another, we need to understand the concept of north-south positioning. Generally,
      in the United States, north is towards Canada, and south is towards Mexico.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Now that we understand the general geographic context
      and north-south positioning, we can compare the locations of Five Wounds Portuguese
      National Church and Mammoth Pool Reservoir. Without precise coordinates or a
      detailed map, we can use general knowledge of California''s geography.


      5. **Determine the Relationship**: Given the general locations of these two
      places in California, we can estimate their north-south relationship. Five Wounds
      Portuguese National Church is likely located in the central or northern part
      of the state, while Mammoth Pool Reservoir is likely in the southern or central
      part.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic knowledge and the estimated
      locations of these two places in California, it is likely that Five Wounds Portuguese
      National Church is not significantly north of Mammoth Pool Reservoir. While
      they might be relatively close in latitude, they are likely not far enough apart
      to be considered one "north" of the other in a significant way.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the specific locations
      of both the Queen Anne Hotel and Belden Place within San Francisco. Without
      precise addresses, we can rely on general knowledge of the city''s layout.


      2. **Understand City Layout**: San Francisco has a grid-like street layout,
      with streets running north-south and east-west. The city is known for its hilly
      terrain, and the grid system is not always strictly followed due to the topography.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: To determine if the Queen Anne Hotel is

      on the same street or parallel streets, the one with the higher number is usually
      north of the one with the lower number. However, this might not always hold
      true in San Francisco due to the irregular layout caused by the hills.

      make an educated guess about their north-south relationship. The Queen Anne
      Hotel is likely located in a northern area of the city, while Belden Place is

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      1520 Sedgwick Avenue and the Paradise Theater in the Bronx, NY.


      2. **1520 Sedgwick Avenue Location**: 1520 Sedgwick Avenue is a specific address
      in the Bronx, NY. It''s a residential building that''s often associated with
      the birthplace of hip-hop.


      3. **Paradise Theater Location**: The Paradise Theater is a historic theater
      located in the Bronx, NY, on Grand Concourse. It''s known for its architectural
      significance and cultural history.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if 1520 Sedgwick Avenue is north of the
      Paradise Theater, we need to understand the layout of the Bronx. Generally,
      the Bronx is laid out in a grid pattern, with streets running north-south and
      avenues running east-west.


      5. **Street Grid**: In the Bronx''s grid, as you move north, you are moving
      towards the northern parts of the borough. 1520 Sedgwick Avenue and the Paradise
      Theater are both in the Bronx, but they are in different neighborhoods.


      6. **Specific Addresses**: 1520 Sedgwick Avenue is located in the Morris Heights
      neighborhood. The Paradise Theater is located in the Fordham Heights neighborhood.


      7. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given the grid system and specific
      locations, we can determine their relative positions. Both locations are in
      the Bronx, but they are in different neighborhoods. The key factor here is the
      specific intersection and block they are on.


      8. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are in the Bronx and relatively
      close to each other, without precise GPS coordinates or a detailed map, it might
      seem challenging to definitively say one is north of the other. However, considering
      typical street layouts and assuming the 1520 Sedgwick Avenue on Sedgwick Avenue
      and the Paradise Theater on Grand Concourse are relatively central, their north-south
      positioning can be estimated based on the grid.


      Given the addresses (1520 Sedgwick Avenue and the Paradise Theater on Grand
      Concourse) and knowing the layout of the Bronx, we can make an educated guess.
      Grand Concourse runs north-south, and the numbers suggest their relative north-south
      positioning rather than east-west. However, considering the grid and assuming
      the numbering system reflects distance from a central point, we can estimate
      their positions.


      Given the information and typical layouts, the 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, being on
      Sedgwick Avenue, and the Paradise Theater, being on Grand Concourse, and considering
      the general flow of the Bronx''s streets, it appears the 1520 Sedgwick Avenue
      could be slightly north or very close in latitude to the Paradise Theater due
      to the parallel nature of their streets and the close proximity of their addresses

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir.
      Both are located in Pennsylvania (PA).


      2. **Understand Geographic Terms**: To determine if one location is north of
      another, we need to understand the concept of north-south positioning. In the
      United States, north generally means a higher latitude, while south means a
      lower latitude.


      3. **Compare Locations**: To determine if the Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius
      is north of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, we need to compare their relative
      positions within Pennsylvania. Without specific coordinates, we can use general
      knowledge about the state''s geography.


      4. **Geographic Knowledge**: Pennsylvania is a state in the Northeastern United
      States. The state is roughly rectangular, with its northern border aligned with
      the southern border of New York and its southern border aligned with the northern
      border of Maryland and West Virginia.


      5. **Determine North-South Relationship**: Without exact coordinates, we can
      use general knowledge of the state''s geography to estimate the north-south
      relationship between the two locations. The Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius
      is in Danville, which is in the central part of Pennsylvania. Foster Joseph
      Sayers Reservoir is in the central part of the state as well, near the town
      of Howard.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are in the central part of Pennsylvania
      and considering the state''s general north-south alignment, it is reasonable
      to assume that the Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius and Foster Joseph
      Sayers Reservoir are at approximately the same latitude. Therefore, they are
      not significantly north or south of each other.


      **The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$**

      is located north of Kendall Cogeneration Station, MA, let''s break down the
      steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the Improv Asylum and the Kendall Cogeneration Station in Massachusetts.


      2. **Improv Asylum Location**: The Improv Asylum is located in the North End
      neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. Specifically, it''s on Hanover Street.


      3. **Kendall Cogeneration Station Location**: The Kendall Cogeneration Station
      is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, specifically in the Kendall Square area.
      It''s near the intersection of Main Street and Third Street.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if the Improv Asylum is north of the
      Kendall Cogeneration Station, we need to understand the layout of Boston and
      Cambridge. Generally, Boston and Cambridge are adjacent cities, with Cambridge
      located to the northwest of Boston.


      5. **North-South Orientation**: In this case, "north of" means that the Improv
      Asylum is located further north in relation to the Kendall Cogeneration Station.
      Given their locations in Boston and Cambridge, we can determine their relative
      positions.


      6. **Specific Addresses**: Without exact GPS coordinates or a detailed map,
      we rely on general knowledge of the area. The Improv Asylum is at 216 Hanover
      Street in Boston, and the Kendall Cogeneration Station is at 125 Third Street
      in Cambridge.


      7. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given the layout of Boston and Cambridge
      and their relative positions, we determine their relative north-south orientation.
      Both the Improv Asylum and the Kendall Cogeneration Station are in the Boston
      metropolitan area, relatively close to each other.


      8. **Conclusion**: Given that the Improv Asylum is in Boston and the Kendall
      Cogeneration Station is in Cambridge, and considering the general layout of
      the area, we can conclude that the Improv Asylum is located south of the Kendall
      Cogeneration Station.


      Given the information and typical layouts, the Improv Asylum, being in Boston,
      and the Kendall Cogeneration Station, being in Cambridge, it appears the Kendall
      Cogeneration Station is north of the Improv Asylum due to the relative positioning
      of the cities and their locations.

    86524a00-9334-430e-93c0-861cd7d18f84: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Gibraltar Dam and Lake Palmdale in California.


      2. **Gibraltar Dam Location**: Gibraltar Dam is located in Santa Barbara County,
      California, specifically in the Santa Ynez Mountains.


      3. **Lake Palmdale Location**: Lake Palmdale is located in Los Angeles County,
      California, specifically in the city of Palmdale.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Gibraltar Dam is north of Lake Palmdale,
      we need to understand the layout of California. Generally, the northern parts
      of California are located north of the southern parts.


      5. **California Geography**: California is a large state with diverse geography.
      The northern part of the state includes regions like the Bay Area, Sacramento,
      and the northern coastal areas. The southern part includes regions like Los
      Angeles, San Diego, and the southern coastal areas.


      6. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given the locations of Gibraltar Dam
      and Lake Palmdale, we can determine their relative positions. Gibraltar Dam
      is in Santa Barbara County, which is in the southern part of California, while
      Lake Palmdale is in Los Angeles County, also in the southern part of the state.


      7. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, Gibraltar Dam is not located
      north of Lake Palmdale. Both locations are in the southern part of California,
      and while Gibraltar Dam might be slightly north of Lake Palmdale due to its
      specific location in Santa Barbara County, it is not significantly north of
      Lake Palmdale in the context of the entire state.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      \ \n   - Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church is located in Baltimore, Maryland\
      \ (MD).\n   - St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church is in Virginia City,\
      \ Nevada (NV).\n\n2. **Understand the geographical context**:\n   - Maryland\

      \ is located) is east of the West Coast (where Nevada is located).\n\n4. **Consider\
      \ the specific locations**:\n   - Baltimore, Maryland, is at a latitude of approximately\
      \ 39.2904\xB0 N.\n   - Virginia City, Nevada, is at a latitude of approximately\
      \ 39.3127\xB0 N, but considering the precise locations might slightly differ,\
      \ we need to look at the actual positioning.\n\n5. **Determine the relationship**:\n\
      \   - Given that both locations are at roughly the same latitude (39.2904\xB0\
      \ N and 39.3127\xB0 N), the difference in their north-south positioning is minimal\
      \ or negligible based on this rough estimate. However, considering the exact\
      \ latitude and longitude:\n     - Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore,\
      \ MD, is approximately at 39.3078\xB0 N, 76.6169\xB0 W.\n     - St. Mary's in\
      \ the Mountains Catholic Church in Virginia City, NV, is approximately at 39.3127\xB0\
      \ N, 119.6505\xB0 W.\n   - The church in Nevada is slightly north but very close\
      \ in latitude to the Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Maryland. The key\
      \ factor here is the east-west difference, which does not directly answer the\
      \ question but indicates that in terms of north-south alignment, they are very\

      \ that \"north of\" implies a direct north-south relationship, Brown Memorial\
      \ Presbyterian Church, MD, is not significantly north of St. Mary's in the Mountains\

      \ the slight difference in latitude where the church in Nevada is actually at\

      \ of the reservoir, we need to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates,\
      \ we can use general knowledge:\n     - Ohio's latitude ranges approximately\
      \ from 38.4\xB0N to 41.7\xB0N.\n     - Colorado's latitude ranges from about\
      \ 37\xB0N to 41\xB0N.\n\nGiven the ranges, it's possible for parts of Colorado\
      \ (especially the northern parts) to be at a higher latitude (more north) than\
      \ Ohio. However, without specific latitudes for the power plant and the reservoir,\
      \ the question becomes about their general positions.\n\n- The Muskingum River\
      \ Power Plant, being in Ohio, has a latitude that would generally place it south\
      \ of the northern parts of Colorado but could be north of the southern parts\
      \ of Colorado.\n\n7. **Final Consideration**:\n   - Since Dillon Reservoir is\
      \ in Colorado, which spans a significant north-south distance, and without knowing\
      \ its exact location within Colorado, we must consider if the Muskingum River\
      \ Power Plant could be north of any part of Colorado where Dillon Reservoir\
      \ might be. Given that some parts of Colorado are north of Ohio's latitude,\
      \ the key is the specific location of Dillon Reservoir within Colorado.\n\n\
      **Given the lack of specific information about Dillon Reservoir's location within\
      \ Colorado and considering general geographic principles:**\n\nIf Dillon Reservoir\
      \ is in the southern part of Colorado, then the Muskingum River Power Plant\
