      1. First, I''ll locate Rockwell City, Iowa on a map

      2. Then, I''ll locate Candlewood Lake, Ohio on a map

      3. Then I''ll compare their geographical positions


      Rockwell City is in north-central Iowa, specifically in Calhoun County.

      Candlewood Lake is located in northeastern Ohio.


      Comparing their positions:

      - Iowa is west of Ohio

      - Rockwell City is further west than Candlewood Lake

      - This means Rockwell City is west of Candlewood Lake, not east
