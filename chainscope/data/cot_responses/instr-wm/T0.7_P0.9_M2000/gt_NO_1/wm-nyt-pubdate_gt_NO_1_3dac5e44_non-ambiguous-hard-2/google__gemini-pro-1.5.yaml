      *A web search shows "Thai Protester Killed at Blockade" was published on November

      *A web search shows "50-Year Sentence Upheld for Ex-President of Liberia" refers
      to Charles Taylor, whose sentence was upheld in 2013.  Several articles discuss
      this, making finding an exact match difficult, but his sentence was upheld on

      an article surrounding comments made by a Kashmiri official in 2019.  Several
      news outlets reported on this, but finding a specific NYT article with this

      article (2010) and the first seems to be from 2019 (even if not the exact headline

      "Cardinals Signal Careful Pace Toward Vote on Pope" appears to have been published
      around March 2013 (related to the papal conclave following Pope Benedict XVI''s
      resignation).


      "Musharraf Is Arrested on Range of Charges in Pakistan" seems to have been published
      in 2013 as well, but likely earlier in the year (various reports place this
      around April 2013).
