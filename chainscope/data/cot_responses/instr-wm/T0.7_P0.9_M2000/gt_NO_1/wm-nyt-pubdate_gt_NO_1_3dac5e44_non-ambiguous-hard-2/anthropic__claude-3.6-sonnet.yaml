      - The US-China climate convergence article likely relates to climate diplomacy
      discussions


      3. The US-China climate convergence was a major story around late 2014, particularly
      during the Obama administration when the two countries made significant joint
      climate announcements.


      4. The killing of a senior Pakistani general by insurgents was reported in September
      2013, when Maj. Gen. Sanaullah Khan Niazi was killed in a roadside bombing.


      5. Therefore, the Pakistani General article (2013) came BEFORE the US-China
      climate article (2014).

      - "Victory Proves Gloomy for Venezuela''s New Leader" was published on April
      15, 2013

      - "Militants Attack U.N. Compound in Somalia''s Capital" was published on June
      19, 2013


      2. Comparing the dates:

      - April comes before June in the calendar

      - Both articles are from 2013

      - Therefore, June 19, 2013 is later than April 15, 2013

      article

      - The Venezuela article (April) came BEFORE the Somalia article (June)
