      \ in California is more populous than 37208 in Tennessee, we need to consider\
      \ the population data for each area. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach:\n\n\
      1. **Identify the Locations:**\n   - **91101** is a zip code for Pasadena, California.\n\
      \   - **37208** is a zip code for Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n2. **Population Data:**\n\

      \ **Research and Comparison:**\n   - As of the latest data, 91101 (Pasadena,\
      \ CA) is a central area within the city and has a significant population, but\
      \ it's also a relatively compact urban area.\n   - 37208 (Nashville, TN) is\
      \ also a central urban area, part of Nashville, which has been experiencing\
      \ significant growth.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without the exact numbers\

      \ code is more populous just based on qualitative analysis.\n   - Generally,\
      \ both areas are urban and could have similar population densities. However,\

      in Iowa is more populous than 20778 in Maryland, we need to look at population
      data for these specific zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the areas covered by each zip code.

      - Zip code 50012 is associated with Ames, Iowa, specifically the Iowa State
      University area.

      - Zip code 20778 is associated with West River, Maryland, a small community.


      Step 2: Consider the typical population characteristics of each area.

      - Ames, Iowa, especially the area around Iowa State University (zip code 50012),
      is likely to have a significant population due to the presence of a large university,
      which includes not only students but also faculty and staff.

      - West River, Maryland (zip code 20778), is a small, primarily residential community
      without large institutions that would drive a high population density.


      Step 3: Estimate the relative populations based on these characteristics.

      - The presence of a large university suggests that 50012 likely has a higher
      population than the small community of West River, Maryland.

      \   - Based on historical data and trends, suburban areas near large cities,\
      \ like Bloomingdale, tend to have higher populations compared to more rural\
      \ or less densely populated areas.\n\nUsing general knowledge and trends, it\
      \ is likely that 60108, IL (Bloomingdale) is more populous than 99224, WA, given\

      \ code covers parts of Wheaton, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.\n\n2. **Research\
      \ population data for each ZIP code:**\n   - **20008, D.C.**: Washington, D.C.\
      \ is a densely populated urban area, and ZIP code 20008 includes several residential\
      \ neighborhoods. However, it is also known for having a significant number of\
      \ diplomatic residences and some commercial areas, which might reduce its residential\
      \ population density compared to other parts of D.C.\n   - **60187, IL**: Wheaton\
      \ is a suburb with a mixture of residential, commercial, and public spaces.\
      \ Suburban areas can have varying population densities, but they often house\
      \ more residents in larger family homes.\n\n3. **Compare typical population\
      \ sizes for urban vs. suburban ZIP codes:**\n   - ZIP codes in urban areas like\
      \ Washington, D.C., can have high population densities, but specific neighborhoods\
      \ that include non-residential spaces might have lower overall populations.\n\
      \   - Suburban ZIP codes like 60187 can have more residents due to larger household\
      \ sizes and more housing units, even if the area is less densely populated.\n\
      \n4. **Conclusion:** Based on general trends, suburban ZIP codes can often have\
      \ higher populations than specific urban ZIP codes with mixed-use areas. However,\
      \ without exact population numbers, this is an estimation.\n\nFor a definitive\
      \ answer, we would need the latest population statistics for both ZIP codes.\
      \ Given the nature of urban versus suburban areas and typical population distributions,\
      \ the answer is:\n\n**NO, 20008, DC is not more populous than 60187, IL.**"

      Generally, the population of a ZIP code can be influenced by the size of the
      area it covers, the density of the population, and the characteristics of the
      area (urban, suburban, or rural). Both ZIP codes are located in suburban areas
      of major metropolitan regions (Chicago for 60194 and Detroit for 48081), which
      suggests they may have significant populations.


      1. **60194, IL** - This ZIP code is located in Schaumburg, Illinois, a suburban
      area northwest of Chicago. Schaumburg is known for its residential communities
      and commercial centers, including the Woodfield Mall, one of the largest malls
      in the United States. The area is densely populated as part of the Chicago metropolitan
      area.


      2. **48081, MI** - This ZIP code is in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, a suburban
      city located along Lake St. Clair and part of the Detroit metropolitan area.
      This area is also residential and can be densely populated, but typically not
      as densely as some parts of the Chicago suburbs.


      Without specific and up-to-date population numbers for each ZIP code, it is
      challenging to definitively state which is more populous. However, Schaumburg
      (60194) is part of a larger metropolitan area and could be expected to have
      a higher population than St. Clair Shores (48081).

      \   - New York City, including Queens, generally has a higher population density\
