      1. First, I''ll look up the zip codes 39730 (Mississippi) and 08226 (New Jersey)


      2. 39730 is located in Pontotoc County, Mississippi, which is a rural area


      3. 08226 is located in Cape May County, New Jersey, which is a coastal area


      4. To determine population, I''ll check population data for these specific zip

      1. First, I''ll look up the zip code 60459, which is located in Illinois (IL)

      - This zip code corresponds to Oak Lawn, a suburb southwest of Chicago

      - Oak Lawn is a relatively dense suburban area near Chicago

      - Population of Oak Lawn is around 56,000 people


      2. Next, I''ll look up the zip code 85629, which is located in Arizona (AZ)

      - This zip code is in the Tucson area

      - It appears to be a less densely populated area outside of Tucson

      - The population in this zip code area is likely much smaller than Oak Lawn


      3. Comparing the two:

    643a1d5d-d208-4878-8f50-71c33fa753d1: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look up the population of the zip code 65355 in Missouri

      - 65355 corresponds to Camdenton, Missouri

      - Camdenton has a population of around 2,000-3,000 people


      2. Next, I''ll look up the population of the zip code 85941 in Arizona

      - 85941 corresponds to McNary, Arizona

      - McNary is a very small rural community

      - Its population is likely less than 1,000 people


      3. Comparing the two populations

      - Camdenton (65355, MO) has approximately 2,000-3,000 residents

      - McNary (85941, AZ) has less than 1,000 residents


      4. Conclusion: Camdenton is more populous than McNary


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      1. First, I''ll look up the location of 90015, CA:

      - This is a zip code in Los Angeles, California

      - Los Angeles is a very large, densely populated city


      2. Next, I''ll look up the location of 88007, NM:

      - This is a zip code in New Mexico

      5. The key factors are:

      - 90015 is in a major urban center (Los Angeles)

      - 88007 is in a sparsely populated state (New Mexico)
