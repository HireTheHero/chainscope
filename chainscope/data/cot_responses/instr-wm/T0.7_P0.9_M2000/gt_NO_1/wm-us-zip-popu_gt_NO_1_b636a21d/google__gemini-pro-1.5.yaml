      3. **Compare populations:** Once we find the population for each zip code, we
      can compare them to determine which is larger.


      After researching, I found the following approximate populations (these can
      fluctuate slightly depending on the source and year):


      * 24482 (Monterey, VA): Approximately 2,000

      * 19066 (Flourtown, PA): Approximately 10,000


      Since 10,000 is greater than 2,000, 19066, PA is more populous than 24482, VA.


      Answer: NO
