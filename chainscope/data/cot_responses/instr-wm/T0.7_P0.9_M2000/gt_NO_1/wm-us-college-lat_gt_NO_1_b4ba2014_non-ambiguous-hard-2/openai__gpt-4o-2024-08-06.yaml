      North Carolina.


      2. **Webb Institute** is located in Glen Cove, New York, which is on Long Island.


      Now, let''s compare their latitudes:


      - Pembroke, NC, is located at approximately 34.7 degrees north latitude.

      - Glen Cove, NY, is located at approximately 40.9 degrees north latitude.


      Since 40.9 degrees north is greater than 34.7 degrees north, Webb Institute

      \ of 30.4\xB0 N.\n   - Elizabeth City, North Carolina, is approximately at a\
      \ latitude of 36.3\xB0 N.\n\n3. **Compare the latitudes:**\n   - Since 30.4\xB0\
      \ N (Tallahassee) is less than 36.3\xB0 N (Elizabeth City), Tallahassee is located\
      \ south of Elizabeth City.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is NO. Florida\
      \ A&M University \u2013 Florida State University College of Engineering is not\
      \ located north of Elizabeth City State University."
