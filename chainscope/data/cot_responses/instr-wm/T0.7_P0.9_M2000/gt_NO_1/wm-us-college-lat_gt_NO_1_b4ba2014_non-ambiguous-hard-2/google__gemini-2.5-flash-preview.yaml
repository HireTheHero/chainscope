      \ the primary geographical direction requested:** The question asks if UHD is\
      \ *north* of GWU.\n\n3.  **Determine the general location of each university\
      \ within its respective state:**\n    *   UHD is located in Houston, Texas.\
      \ Houston is in southeastern Texas.\n    *   GWU is located in Boiling Springs,\
      \ North Carolina. Boiling Springs is in western North Carolina.\n\n4.  **Consider\
      \ the relative positions of the states:** Texas is a large state in the southern\
      \ US. North Carolina is a state on the eastern coast of the US, generally considered\
      \ part of the Southeast.\n\n5.  **Visualize or approximate the locations on\
      \ a map:** Imagine the US map. Texas is significantly to the southwest of North\
      \ Carolina.\n\n6.  **Compare the latitudes:** To be *north* of another location,\
      \ the northern location must have a higher latitude (be closer to the North\
      \ Pole).\n    *   Houston, TX is approximately at 29.76\xB0 N latitude.\n  \
      \  *   Boiling Springs, NC is approximately at 35.23\xB0 N latitude.\n\n7. \
      \ **Analyze the latitude comparison:** 35.23\xB0 N is a higher latitude than\
      \ 29.76\xB0 N. This means Boiling Springs, NC (and therefore Gardner\u2013Webb\
      \ University) is located *north* of Houston, TX (and therefore University of\
      \ Houston\u2013Downtown).\n\n8.  **Formulate the answer based on the analysis:**\
      \ Since Gardner\u2013Webb University is north of University of Houston\u2013\
      Downtown, it is *not* true that University of Houston\u2013Downtown is north\
      \ of Gardner\u2013Webb University.\n\n9.  **Translate to a YES/NO answer:**\
      \ The statement \"Is University of Houston\u2013Downtown, TX located north of\
      \ Gardner\u2013Webb University, NC?\" is false. Therefore, the answer is NO.\n\
      \nFinal Answer Derivation: The latitude of UHD (approx 29.76\xB0 N) is lower\
      \ than the latitude of GWU (approx 35.23\xB0 N). A lower latitude means the\
      \ location is further south. Therefore, UHD is south of GWU, not north.\n\n\

      \ generally west and south of North Carolina.\n\n**Final Answer:** NO"

      \ 42.85\xB0 N\n    *   Wausau, Wisconsin latitude: Approximately 44.96\xB0 N\n\
      \n6.  **Compare the latitudes:**\n    *   Latitude of Rindge, NH (Franklin Pierce)\
      \ is ~42.85\xB0 N.\n    *   Latitude of Wausau, WI (UW-Marathon County) is ~44.96\xB0\

      \ 42.85\xB0 N.\n\n8.  **Formulate the conclusion based on the comparison:**\
      \ Since Wausau, WI (UW-Marathon County) has a higher latitude than Rindge, NH\
      \ (Franklin Pierce), UW-Marathon County is located *north* of Franklin Pierce\
      \ University.\n\n9.  **Address the user's specific question:** The question\
      \ asks if Franklin Pierce University, NH is north of UW-Marathon County, WI.\
      \ My analysis shows that UW-Marathon County is north of Franklin Pierce University.\
      \ Therefore, Franklin Pierce University is *south* of UW-Marathon County.\n\n\
      10. **Provide the final YES/NO answer:** Based on the conclusion, the answer\
      \ is NO.\n\n*Self-Correction/Refinement:* Double-check the university locations\
      \ and city names. Franklin Pierce is indeed in Rindge. UW-Marathon County is\
      \ indeed in Wausau. Latitudes seem correct for those approximate locations.\
      \ The logical comparison holds.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n* Latitude of Franklin\
      \ Pierce (Rindge, NH) \u2248 42.85\xB0 N\n* Latitude of UW-Marathon Co (Wausau,\
      \ WI) \u2248 44.96\xB0 N\n* 42.85\xB0 N is *less than* 44.96\xB0 N.\n* Therefore,\
      \ Franklin Pierce University is located *south* of UW-Marathon County.\n* The\
      \ question asks: Is Franklin Pierce University, NH located north of University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon County, WI?\n* The answer is NO.\n\nStep 1: Identify\
      \ the location of Franklin Pierce University, NH. It is located in Rindge, New\
      \ Hampshire.\nStep 2: Identify the location of University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Marathon County, WI. It is located in Wausau, Wisconsin.\nStep 3: Determine\
      \ the latitude of Rindge, NH. The approximate latitude is 42.85\xB0 N.\nStep\
      \ 4: Determine the latitude of Wausau, WI. The approximate latitude is 44.96\xB0\
      \ N.\nStep 5: Compare the latitudes. 42.85\xB0 N is less than 44.96\xB0 N.\n\
      Step 6: A location with a lower latitude is south of a location with a higher\
      \ latitude (in the Northern Hemisphere). Therefore, Rindge, NH (Franklin Pierce\
      \ University) is south of Wausau, WI (University of Wisconsin\u2013Marathon\
      \ County).\nStep 7: The question asks if Franklin Pierce University is *north*\

      4.  **Determine the general location of North Carolina:** North Carolina is
      on the east coast of the United States.

      5.  **Consider latitude:** While California is generally west of North Carolina,
      the question asks about *north* of. We need to compare their latitudes.

      6.  **Estimate/Recall latitude:** California is a long state, but San Marcos
      is in Southern California. Southern California''s latitude is generally lower
      (further south) than states like North Carolina. Winston-Salem, NC is in the
      central part of North Carolina.

      7.  **Compare latitudes:** San Marcos, CA is roughly at 33.1 degrees North latitude.
      Winston-Salem, NC is roughly at 36.1 degrees North latitude.

      8.  **Conclusion based on latitude:** Since 33.1 is less than 36.1, San Marcos,

      4.  **Consider the continental scale:** California is on the West Coast, and
      North Carolina is on the East Coast. To determine if one is north of the other,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Southern California''s latitude is generally
      lower (closer to the equator) than the latitude of North Carolina. For example,
      San Marcos is around 33.1 degrees North latitude, while Winston-Salem is around
      36.1 degrees North latitude.
