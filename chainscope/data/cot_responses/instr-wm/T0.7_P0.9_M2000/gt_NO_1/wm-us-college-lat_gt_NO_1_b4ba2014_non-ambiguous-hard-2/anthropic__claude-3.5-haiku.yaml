    a938d93c-81cd-499e-95db-4d0aedfa607a: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. William Jessup University is located in Rocklin, California, which is in
      Northern California.


      2. The University of Northern Iowa is located in Cedar Falls, Iowa, which is
      in the Midwestern United States.


      3. California is west of Iowa, and specifically, Northern California is even
      further west.


      4. When comparing locations on a map, something located in California would
      be west of something in Iowa, not north.


      5. Therefore, William Jessup University is NOT located north of the University
      of Northern Iowa.
