      East Central University is located in Ada, Oklahoma.

      Morehead State University is located in Morehead, Kentucky.


      Oklahoma is generally west of Kentucky, but I need to determine their north-south

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Oklahoma is in the south-central part of the US

      - Kentucky is in the east-central part of the US


      Oklahoma''s northern border touches Kansas, and its southern border touches
      Texas.

      Kentucky''s northern border touches Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois (along the Ohio
      River), and its southern border touches Tennessee.


      Based on US geography, Oklahoma is generally situated at a similar latitude
      as the southern parts of states like Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia. Kentucky
      is north of Tennessee and south of Ohio.

      Looking at their positions on the map:

      - Oklahoma is roughly at the same latitude as Arkansas and Tennessee

    999857ab-3280-4c39-a105-e6bbdb897c62: '<think>This question requires me to compare
      the geographic locations of two universities:

      1. Urbana University in Ohio (OH)

      2. Calvin University in Michigan (MI)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Urbana University is located north of Calvin
      University.


      Let me think about where these universities are located:


      Urbana University is in Urbana, Ohio. Ohio is generally south of Michigan, since
      Michigan is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering Canada,
      while Ohio is below it.


      Calvin University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan.


      Given that Michigan is generally north of Ohio, it''s likely that Calvin University
      is north of Urbana University. However, I should be careful about the specific
      locations since border areas could be exceptions.


      Urbana, Ohio is in the west-central part of Ohio.

      Grand Rapids, Michigan is in the southwestern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.


      Even though Grand Rapids is in the southern part of Michigan, Michigan as a
      whole is north of Ohio. So Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan is almost
      certainly north of Urbana University in Urbana, Ohio.


      Therefore, Urbana University is NOT north of Calvin University. Rather, Urbana
      University is south of Calvin University.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Urbana University is located in Urbana, Ohio

      - Calvin University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Ohio and Michigan.

      - Michigan is generally north of Ohio

      - Ohio borders Michigan''s southern boundary


      Step 3: Look at the specific cities within their states.

      - Urbana is in west-central Ohio

      - Grand Rapids is in the southwestern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Even though Grand Rapids is in southern Michigan, it''s still north of most
      of Ohio, including Urbana. Looking at their latitudes, Grand Rapids, MI is farther
      north than Urbana, OH.

      Step 1: Let''s identify the locations.

      - Concordia Seminary is in Missouri (MO)

      - University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Think about the general geographic relationship between these states.

      Wisconsin is a northern state that borders Canada, while Missouri is further
      south in the central United States. Generally speaking, Wisconsin is north of
      Missouri.


      Step 3: Since Wisconsin is north of Missouri, and the institutions are in their
      respective states, University of Wisconsin-Waukesha would be north of Concordia
      Seminary.


      Therefore, Concordia Seminary, MO is NOT north of University of Wisconsin-Waukesha,
      WI. It would be south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two institutions by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Concordia Seminary is in Missouri (MO)

      - University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Wisconsin is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Lake Superior
      and Michigan.

      Missouri is located south of Wisconsin, in the central United States.


      Step 3: Determine relative position based on state locations.

      Since Wisconsin is geographically north of Missouri, and these institutions
      are in their respective states, University of Wisconsin-Waukesha would be north
      of Concordia Seminary.

      Now I need to determine which is further north. Let me think about the geography
      of these states.


      Wisconsin is north of Iowa. Specifically, Wisconsin borders Minnesota, Michigan''s
      Upper Peninsula, and Lake Superior to the north, and Illinois to the south.
      Iowa is south of Minnesota and Wisconsin, and north of Missouri.


      Marinette, WI is in the northeastern part of Wisconsin, on the border with Michigan''s
      Upper Peninsula, along the shore of Green Bay (part of Lake Michigan). This
      puts it quite far north in Wisconsin.


      Des Moines, IA (where Grand View University is located) is roughly in the center
      of Iowa.


      Given that Wisconsin is already north of Iowa, and Marinette is in the northern
      part of Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin-Marinette would be considerably

      relative location of two universities in the United States:

      1. Mount Mercy University in Iowa (IA)

      2. University of Mary in North Dakota (ND)


      I need to determine whether Mount Mercy University is north of University of
      Mary.


      First, let me think about the general geographic relationship between Iowa and
      North Dakota. North Dakota is a northern border state that touches Canada. Iowa
      is located south of Minnesota, which borders North Dakota to the south. So generally
      speaking, North Dakota is north of Iowa.


      But I need to be more specific about these particular universities.


      Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA). It''s located in Cedar Rapids, which
      is in eastern Iowa.


      University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND). It''s located in Bismarck, which
      is in south-central North Dakota.


      Since North Dakota is north of Iowa, and these universities don''t appear to
      be in unusual locations within their states that would reverse this relationship,
      Mount Mercy University (in Iowa) would be south of University of Mary (in North
      Dakota).


      Therefore, Mount Mercy University is NOT north of University of Mary.</think>#
      Is Mount Mercy University, IA located north of University of Mary, ND?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Mount Mercy University is in Iowa (IA)

      - University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is a northern border state that touches Canada

      - Iowa is located south of Minnesota, which itself is south of North Dakota


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Mount Mercy University is in Cedar Rapids, located in eastern Iowa

      - University of Mary is in Bismarck, located in south-central North Dakota


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Even though University of Mary is in the southern part of North Dakota, North
      Dakota as a whole is significantly north of Iowa

      - The northernmost parts of Iowa are still south of the southernmost parts of
      North Dakota


      Therefore, Mount Mercy University in Iowa is south of the University of Mary
      in North Dakota, not north of it.

      north of Iowa.


      Step 3: Since Mount Mercy University is in Iowa, and University of Mary is in
      North Dakota, and North Dakota is north of Iowa, it follows that University
      of Mary is likely north of Mount Mercy University.


      Therefore, Mount Mercy University is NOT north of University of Mary. Instead,
      University of Mary is north of Mount Mercy University.</think>To answer this

      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of these states.

      North Dakota is positioned significantly farther north in the United States
      compared to Iowa. North Dakota borders Canada to the north, while Iowa is several
      states south of the Canadian border.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      Since North Dakota is north of Iowa, and these universities are in their respective
      states, University of Mary (ND) must be north of Mount Mercy University (IA).


      NO, Mount Mercy University is NOT located north of University of Mary. It''s

      north of Missouri.


      Geographically, North Dakota is definitely north of Iowa on the map of the United

      - University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND)


      Since North Dakota is north of Iowa, and these universities are in their respective
      states, it''s almost certain that University of Mary in North Dakota is north
      of Mount Mercy University in Iowa.


      To be thorough, I should check if there are any unusual geographic anomalies,
      like if the University of Mary was in the extreme southern part of North Dakota

      - University of Mary is in North Dakota (ND)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      North Dakota is one of the northernmost states in the continental US, bordering
      Canada. Iowa is in the Midwest, positioned south of Minnesota and north of Missouri.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      North Dakota is entirely north of Iowa on the map. Even the southernmost point

      Even if Mount Mercy University were at the extreme northern edge of Iowa and

      1. The question is asking about the relative locations of two universities:
      Alcorn State University, MS and Harding University, AR.

      2. Specifically, I need to determine if Alcorn State (in Mississippi) is located
      north of Harding University (in Arkansas).

      3. To answer this, I need to think about the geographical locations of these
      states and universities.


      Mississippi (MS) is generally east of Arkansas (AR). But the question is about
      north/south positioning.


      Arkansas is located immediately north of Louisiana, while Mississippi is east
      of Louisiana and south of Tennessee.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Arkansas is generally in the south-central US but is north of Mississippi

      - Mississippi is in the deep south, bordering the Gulf of Mexico at its southern
      end


      So broadly speaking, Mississippi is south of Arkansas. But I need to consider
      the specific locations of these universities within their states.


      Alcorn State University is in southwest Mississippi.

      Harding University is in central Arkansas (Searcy, AR).


      Given that Arkansas is already north of Mississippi, and Harding is in central
      Arkansas while Alcorn State is in Mississippi, it''s very likely that Alcorn
      State is south of Harding University.</think>To determine if Alcorn State University
      in Mississippi is located north of Harding University in Arkansas, I need to
      consider the geographic locations of both universities.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Mississippi is generally located east and south of Arkansas. Arkansas is positioned
      north of Mississippi on a map of the United States.


      Step 2: Locate the specific universities within their states.

      Alcorn State University is located in southwest Mississippi (near Lorman).

      Harding University is located in Searcy, which is in central Arkansas.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Since Arkansas as a state is positioned north of Mississippi, and Harding University
      is in central Arkansas while Alcorn State is in southern Mississippi, Alcorn
      State would be south of Harding University.


      NO, Alcorn State University is not located north of Harding University.'

      geographical positions of two universities:

      1. Alcorn State University in Mississippi (MS)

      2. Harding University in Arkansas (AR)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Alcorn State University is located north
      of Harding University.


      Let me think about the general locations of these states first:

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Arkansas (AR) is also in the southeastern US, but generally located a bit
      more to the northwest of Mississippi


      To determine which university is further north, I need to compare their latitudes:


      Alcorn State University is located in Lorman, Mississippi. Mississippi is generally
      south of Arkansas on a map of the United States.


      Harding University is located in Searcy, Arkansas, which is in the central part
      of Arkansas.


      Given the general geography of the US, Arkansas is typically north of Mississippi.
      This suggests that Harding University would be north of Alcorn State University,
      not the other way around.


      However, I should be careful about making this judgment just based on state
      locations, as universities near state borders could have different relative
      positions.


      Based on my knowledge, Alcorn State is in southwestern Mississippi, while Harding
      University is in central Arkansas. This would place Alcorn State south of Harding
      University.</think># Determining if Alcorn State University (MS) is north of
      Harding University (AR)


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two universities by considering
      their states and specific locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' general positions

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Arkansas (AR) is also in the southeastern US, but positioned northwest of
      Mississippi


      ## Step 2: Consider specific university locations

      - Alcorn State University is located in Lorman, Mississippi, in the southwestern
      part of the state

      - Harding University is located in Searcy, Arkansas, in the central part of
      that state


      ## Step 3: Compare the latitudes

      Looking at the map of the United States, Arkansas is generally north of Mississippi.
      Even considering their specific locations, Searcy, AR is located further north
      than Lorman, MS.

      Wisconsin borders Canada/the Great Lakes in the northern part of the US, while
      West Virginia is in the Appalachian region, which is more southern/mid-Atlantic.


      Wisconsin is in the Upper Midwest, while West Virginia is in the Appalachian
      region of the eastern US.


      Given the general geography of the US, Wisconsin is north of West Virginia.
      Therefore, Viterbo University in Wisconsin would be north of Mountain State
      University in West Virginia.


      So Mountain State University is NOT north of Viterbo University. It''s the opposite
      - Viterbo University is north of Mountain State University.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of both
      universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states these universities are in.

      - Mountain State University is in West Virginia (WV)

      - Viterbo University is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Wisconsin is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States, bordering
      Lake Superior and Michigan to the north and northeast.

      West Virginia is located in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States,
      much further south.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Wisconsin is significantly further north than West Virginia on the map of the
      United States.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion about the universities.

      Since Viterbo University is in Wisconsin (a northern state) and Mountain State
      University is in West Virginia (a more southern state), Viterbo University must
      be located north of Mountain State University, not the other way around.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Bloomsburg University, PA.

      Bloomsburg University is located in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, which is in the
      northeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Granite State College, NH.

      Granite State College is in New Hampshire, which is a state in the northeastern
      United States. NH is north of PA generally.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Generally speaking, New Hampshire is north of Pennsylvania. Without specific
      coordinates, I can use general geographic knowledge:

      - Pennsylvania is south of New Hampshire

      - Bloomsburg is in northeastern PA

      - Granite State College has multiple locations in NH, but all would be in New
      Hampshire


      Based on the general geography of the northeastern United States, New Hampshire
      is north of Pennsylvania. Even though Bloomsburg is in the northeastern part
      of Pennsylvania, it would still be south of locations in New Hampshire.

      - Pennsylvania is south of New Hampshire in the United States

      - New Hampshire borders Canada to the north and Massachusetts to the south

      - Pennsylvania is significantly further south, below New York state


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Even though Bloomsburg is in northeastern Pennsylvania, the entire state of
      Pennsylvania lies south of New Hampshire. Any location in New Hampshire (including
      Granite State College) would be north of any location in Pennsylvania (including

      I need to determine if Bloomsburg University is located north of Granite State
      College.


      To solve this, I''ll need to know the approximate latitude of each school:


      1. Bloomsburg University is in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania

      2. Granite State College is in New Hampshire


      Pennsylvania is generally south of New Hampshire in the United States. New Hampshire
      is one of the northernmost states in the eastern US, being part of New England.
      Pennsylvania is more mid-Atlantic.


      New Hampshire borders Canada to the north, Maine to the east, Massachusetts
      to the south, and Vermont to the west.


      Pennsylvania is south of New York State, which itself is south of the New England
      states including New Hampshire.

      Pennsylvania would be south of any college in New Hampshire, including Granite
      State College.</think>To determine if Bloomsburg University, PA is located north
      of Granite State College, NH, I need to consider the geographic locations of
      Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.


      Step 1: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

      New Hampshire is located in the New England region, which is in the northeastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare the relative positions.

      New Hampshire is significantly further north than Pennsylvania. On a map of
      the US, New Hampshire sits above Massachusetts, while Pennsylvania is below
      New York State.


      Step 3: Even without knowing the exact cities, the northernmost parts of Pennsylvania
      are generally still south of most of New Hampshire.


      Step 4: Bloomsburg, PA is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, but even
      this northern location in PA would be south of most locations in New Hampshire,
      including where Granite State College is located.


      NO, Bloomsburg University is not located north of Granite State College. It
      is located south of it.'

      Looking at their relative positions on a mental map of the US:

      - New Hampshire is one of the northernmost states in the eastern US, part of
      New England

      - Pennsylvania is south of New York state and New England


      Since Granite State College is in New Hampshire, and New Hampshire is generally

    7bf7200e-fee2-4fcc-bcf4-c091ad828f8d: '<think>Alright, I need to determine if
      Widener University in Delaware is located north of Mildred Elley in New York.


      First, let me identify the locations of both institutions:


      1. Widener University, DE - I need to check if Widener University is in Delaware.
      Actually, I think Widener University''s main campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania,
      not Delaware. There might be a satellite campus in Delaware.


      2. Mildred Elley, NY - This is a college in New York state.


      To determine which is further north, I need to compare their latitudes. Generally:

      - Pennsylvania is south of New York State

      - Delaware is south of both Pennsylvania and New York State


      So if Widener University is in Delaware, it would be south of Mildred Elley
      in New York.

      If Widener University is in Pennsylvania, it would still likely be south of
      New York.


      Given the geographic arrangement of these states from north to south:

      New York

      Pennsylvania

      Delaware


      Based on this geographical knowledge, Widener University (whether in PA or DE)
      would be south of Mildred Elley in NY.


      Therefore, Widener University is NOT north of Mildred Elley.</think># Is Widener
      University, DE located north of Mildred Elley, NY?


      I need to determine the geographic locations of these two institutions and compare
      their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Widener University, DE appears to be in Delaware

      - Mildred Elley, NY is in New York state


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      New York state is located north of Delaware. Looking at a map of the US, New
      York is significantly further north than Delaware.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific institutions.

      Since Mildred Elley is in New York (a northern state) and Widener University
      is in Delaware (a more southern state), Widener University would be south of
      Mildred Elley, not north of it.

      - Washburn University is in Topeka, Kansas, which is in the northeastern part
      of Kansas


      ## Step 2: Compare the states geographically

      - Kansas is entirely north of Texas on the US map

      - Kansas borders Oklahoma on its south, and Oklahoma borders Texas on its south


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state

      - Even though Grayson College is in northern Texas, the entire state of Texas

      To answer this question, I need to:

      1. Find the locations (specifically latitudes) of both institutions

      2. Compare their latitudes - higher latitude means further north


      Let me reason through this:


      First, I know Kansas is generally north of Texas in the United States. Kansas
      borders the northern part of Oklahoma, which borders the northern part of Texas.


      Grayson College is in Texas, likely in the northern part of Texas given the

      Given the general geography of the United States, with Kansas being entirely
      north of Texas, it''s very likely that Washburn University is north of Grayson
      College.


      More specifically:

      - Washburn University is in Topeka, Kansas, which is in the northeastern part
      of Kansas

      - Grayson College is likely in Grayson County, Texas, which is in north Texas
      near the Oklahoma border


      Even though Grayson College is in northern Texas, Kansas is still further north

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two colleges by examining

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Grayson College is located in Denison, Texas (in Grayson County)

      - Washburn University is located in Topeka, Kansas


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      - Texas is located south of Kansas in the United States

      - Kansas is entirely north of Texas (they don''t even share a border - Oklahoma
      is between them)


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - Even though Grayson College is in northern Texas, it''s still in Texas

      - Any location in Kansas (including Topeka where Washburn is located) would
      be north of any location in Texas


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Kansas is entirely north of Texas geographically, Washburn University

      College in Texas is located north of Washburn University in Kansas.


      To answer this, I need to:

      1. Determine the location (latitude) of Grayson College in Texas

      2. Determine the location (latitude) of Washburn University in Kansas

      3. Compare these latitudes to see which is further north


      Let me think about the geography:


      Kansas is a state that''s generally north of Texas. Kansas is in the central
      United States, while Texas is in the south-central United States, bordering
      Mexico. So in general, locations in Kansas tend to be north of locations in
      Texas.


      Grayson College is in Texas (TX).

      Washburn University is in Kansas (KS).


      Based on general geography knowledge, Kansas is north of Texas, which would
      suggest that Washburn University is likely north of Grayson College.


      Therefore, Grayson College in TX is likely NOT north of Washburn University
      in KS.</think># Is Grayson College, TX located north of Washburn University,
      KS?


      I''ll solve this step by step by comparing the geographic locations of these
      two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Grayson College is in Texas (TX)

      - Washburn University is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Kansas.

      - Kansas is directly north of Texas on the US map

      - Texas is in the south-central US

      - Kansas is in the central US, positioned above Texas


      Step 3: Determine the answer based on state positions.

      Since Kansas is geographically north of Texas, and these institutions are in
      their respective states, Grayson College (in Texas) cannot be north of Washburn
      University (in Kansas).


      NO'

      1. Find the locations of both colleges

      2. Determine which one is further north


      Let me identify where these colleges are located:


      Grayson College is in Denison, Texas (TX).

      Washburn University is in Topeka, Kansas (KS).


      Now I need to compare their latitudes. North-south position is determined by
      latitude, with higher latitude numbers indicating more northern locations.


      Generally speaking, Kansas is north of Texas in the United States. Kansas borders
      Oklahoma on its southern border, and Oklahoma borders Texas. So geographically,
      Kansas is entirely north of Texas.


      Since Grayson College is in Texas and Washburn University is in Kansas, it''s
      very likely that Washburn is north of Grayson. However, to be precise, I should
      check the specific latitudes of these cities.


      Without the exact coordinates, I can rely on the fact that all of Kansas is
      north of all of Texas. Therefore, any location in Kansas (including Washburn
      University in Topeka) would be north of any location in Texas (including Grayson
      College in Denison).


      So Grayson College in TX is south of Washburn University in KS, not north of
      it.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - Grayson College is located in Denison, Texas.

      - Washburn University is located in Topeka, Kansas.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Kansas is entirely north of Texas in the United States.

      - Kansas shares its southern border with Oklahoma, which borders Texas to the
      north.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Since all of Kansas is north of all of Texas, Washburn University (in Kansas)
      must be north of Grayson College (in Texas).

      - This means Grayson College is south of Washburn University, not north of it.

      Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is located in Owensboro, Kentucky.

      The University of Scranton is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania.


      Let me think about their approximate geographic positions:


      Kentucky is generally south of Pennsylvania in the United States. Pennsylvania
      is in the northeastern part of the US, while Kentucky is more in the south-central
      region.


      Specifically:

      - Scranton, PA is in northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Owensboro, KY is in western Kentucky


      Without specific coordinates, I know that Pennsylvania (around 40-42 degrees
      North latitude) is generally north of Kentucky (around 36-39 degrees North latitude).


      Therefore, Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY would be south of the University
      of Scranton, PA, not north of it.</think># Determining the North-South Relationship
      Between Two Universities


      I need to determine if Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY is located
      north of University of Scranton, PA.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states and their general positions

      - Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is in Kentucky (KY)

      - University of Scranton is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Compare the general latitudes of these states

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located in the south-central United States

      - Pennsylvania (approximately 40-42 degrees North latitude) is generally north
      of Kentucky (approximately 36-39 degrees North latitude)


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific cities

      - Scranton is in northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Owensboro is in western Kentucky

      - This specific positioning maintains the same north-south relationship as the
      states overall


      Based on this geographic analysis, Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY
      is located SOUTH of University of Scranton, PA, not north.

      step by step. I need to determine if Tarleton State University in Texas is located
      north of Oklahoma City University in Oklahoma.


      First, let me recall the locations:

      1. Tarleton State University is in Texas (TX)

      2. Oklahoma City University is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (OK)


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is north of Texas, since Texas borders Oklahoma
      to the south. But I need to be more precise about the specific locations of
      these universities.


      Tarleton State University is located in Stephenville, Texas, which is in north-central
      Texas.

      Oklahoma City University is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which is in
      the central part of Oklahoma.


      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and these universities are not in unusual
      border areas that might create exceptions, it''s very likely that Oklahoma City
      University is north of Tarleton State University.


      So Tarleton State University is NOT north of Oklahoma City University. Rather,
      it''s the opposite - Oklahoma City University would be north of Tarleton State
      University.</think>To determine if Tarleton State University in Texas is located
      north of Oklahoma City University in Oklahoma, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of both institutions.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Texas is generally south of Oklahoma on a map of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the specific locations of both universities.

      - Tarleton State University is located in Stephenville, Texas, which is in north-central
      Texas.

      - Oklahoma City University is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which is in the central
      part of Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Even though Tarleton is in northern Texas, the state of Oklahoma sits entirely
      north of Texas (sharing a border). Oklahoma City is well within Oklahoma state,
      not near the southern border.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and Oklahoma City is centrally located in
      Oklahoma, Oklahoma City University must be north of Tarleton State University,
      not the other way around.


      NO, Tarleton State University is not located north of Oklahoma City University.'

      Shenandoah University is located in Winchester, Virginia, which is in the northern
      part of Virginia.


      Mercyhurst University is located in Erie, Pennsylvania, which is in the northwestern
      corner of Pennsylvania.


      Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia. Erie, PA is particularly far north
      in Pennsylvania, near the shore of Lake Erie on the border with New York and
      Ohio.


      So even though Shenandoah is in northern Virginia, Mercyhurst in Erie, PA would
      be significantly further north in latitude.


      Therefore, Shenandoah University in VA is NOT north of Mercyhurst University
      in PA. Mercyhurst is north of Shenandoah.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two universities by locating them geographically.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Shenandoah University is located in Winchester, Virginia, in the northern
      Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia.

      - Mercyhurst University is located in Erie, Pennsylvania, in the far northwestern
      corner of Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Virginia and Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is a state that lies north of Virginia.

      - Erie, PA (where Mercyhurst is) is particularly far north, sitting on the shore
      of Lake Erie.


      Step 3: Compare the specific latitudes.

      - Winchester, VA is in northern Virginia, but Virginia as a whole is south of
      Pennsylvania.

      - Erie, PA is at one of the northernmost points in Pennsylvania, near the Great
      Lakes.


      NO. Shenandoah University in Virginia is not located north of Mercyhurst University

      To answer this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of both universities

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south positions)


      Shenandoah University is located in Winchester, Virginia, in the northern part
      of Virginia.


      Mercyhurst University is located in Erie, Pennsylvania. Erie is in the northwestern
      corner of Pennsylvania, right on Lake Erie.

      New York to the north, while Virginia is further south).


      Erie, PA is specifically in the far northern part of Pennsylvania, near the
      Great Lakes. Winchester, VA is in the northern part of Virginia, but Virginia
      as a whole is south of Pennsylvania.


      So even though Shenandoah is in northern Virginia, Mercyhurst in Erie, PA would

      part of Virginia.

      - Mercyhurst University is located in Erie, Pennsylvania, in the northwestern
      corner of Pennsylvania along Lake Erie.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally located north of Virginia on a map.

      - Erie, PA is positioned in the far northern region of Pennsylvania, directly
      bordering Lake Erie.

      - Winchester, VA, while in northern Virginia, is still in a state that lies
      south of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Even though Shenandoah University is in northern Virginia, its location is
      still south of Erie, PA where Mercyhurst is located.

      I need to determine if Columbus Technical College is located north of St. Andrews
      University.


      Let me think about the geography of Georgia and North Carolina:

      - Georgia is generally south of North Carolina in the southeastern United States

      - North Carolina is directly north of South Carolina, and Georgia is southwest
      of South Carolina


      Now, let''s try to be more specific about these locations:

      - Columbus, Georgia is located in the western part of Georgia, near the Alabama
      border

      - I need to determine where St. Andrews University is located in North Carolina


      St. Andrews University should be in North Carolina. Based on my knowledge, it''s
      located in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southern part of North Carolina.


      Even though St. Andrews is in southern North Carolina and Columbus is in western
      Georgia, North Carolina as a whole is still north of Georgia. So Columbus, GA
      would be south of Laurinburg, NC.


      Therefore, Columbus Technical College in GA would NOT be north of St. Andrews
      University in NC.</think># Is Columbus Technical College, GA located north of
      St. Andrews University, NC?


      I need to compare the geographic locations of these two institutions:


      1. First, let''s identify the states: Columbus Technical College is in Georgia
      (GA), while St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC).


      2. Looking at a US map, North Carolina is generally located north of Georgia
      in the southeastern United States.


      3. More specifically, Columbus, Georgia is in the western part of Georgia near
      the Alabama border.


      4. St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina, which is
      in the southern part of North Carolina.


      5. Even though St. Andrews is in southern North Carolina and Columbus is in
      western Georgia, the entirety of Georgia lies south of North Carolina.


      NO - Columbus Technical College is not located north of St. Andrews University.
      It is located south of it.'

      First, let me identify the locations:

      1. Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia (GA)

      2. St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)


      Now I need to determine which one is further north. In the United States:

      - Georgia is a southeastern state

      - North Carolina is also a southeastern state, but it''s positioned north of
      Georgia


      Looking at a mental map of the US, North Carolina is above (north of) Georgia
      in terms of latitude. Columbus is in west-central Georgia, while St. Andrews
      University is likely in North Carolina.


      A quick geography check: Columbus, GA is near the Alabama border in the west-central
      part of Georgia. St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the
      southern part of North Carolina.


      Since North Carolina is north of Georgia, and these cities don''t have unusual
      positions within their states that would reverse this relationship, Columbus
      Technical College would be south of St. Andrews University.


      So, Columbus Technical College is NOT north of St. Andrews University.</think>#
      Is Columbus Technical College, GA located north of St. Andrews University, NC?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two institutions.

      - Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia (GA)

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Compare the states geographically

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - North Carolina is also in the southeast, but is positioned north of Georgia


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific cities

      - Columbus is in the west-central part of Georgia

      - Laurinburg is in the southern part of North Carolina

      - Even though Laurinburg is in southern NC, the entire state of North Carolina
      is still north of Georgia


      ## Step 4: Make the north-south comparison

      Since North Carolina is entirely north of Georgia on the map, and the specific
      locations of these cities within their states don''t change this relationship,
      Columbus Technical College must be south of St. Andrews University.

      if Lynn University in Florida is located north of McMurry University in Texas.


      To answer this, I need to determine the approximate latitudes of both universities:


      Lynn University is in Boca Raton, Florida, which is in South Florida.

      McMurry University is in Abilene, Texas, which is in central/north-central Texas.


      Florida extends further south than Texas does, with South Florida being one
      of the southernmost parts of the continental United States. Boca Raton is in
      Palm Beach County, which is in South Florida.


      Abilene, Texas is located in the north-central part of Texas, which would put
      it at a more northern latitude than South Florida locations.


      I need to think about the general geography of the US. Florida extends southward
      along the Atlantic coast, with South Florida being very far south. Texas is
      to the west of Florida, but Central/North Texas is going to be at a higher latitude
      than South Florida.


      If I mentally visualize a map of the US, Boca Raton (where Lynn University is)
      would be further south than Abilene (where McMurry University is).</think>#
      Is Lynn University, FL located north of McMurry University, TX?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) Lynn University is located in Boca Raton, Florida, which is in southern Florida

      2) McMurry University is located in Abilene, Texas, which is in north-central
      Texas

      3) Florida extends much further south than Texas, with South Florida being among
      the southernmost parts of the continental United States

      4) Boca Raton is in South Florida (Palm Beach County), placing it at a southern
      latitude

      5) Abilene, Texas is positioned more northerly in the United States compared
      to Boca Raton


      Looking at the relative positions on a US map, Boca Raton, FL is further south
      than Abilene, TX. Therefore, Lynn University is NOT north of McMurry University.

      the geographic locations (latitudes) of both universities.


      Franciscan University of Steubenville is in Steubenville, Ohio (OH).

      Husson University is in Maine (ME).


      Let me think about the general geographic locations:


      Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States, roughly in the
      middle of the country from north to south.


      Maine is in the northeastern corner of the United States, at the very top of
      the East Coast.


      In terms of north-south positioning (latitude), Maine is generally north of
      Ohio. Maine borders Canada to the north, while Ohio is further south.


      Since Franciscan University is in Ohio and Husson University is in Maine, it''s
      very likely that Husson University (in Maine) is north of Franciscan University
      (in Ohio).


      Therefore, Franciscan University of Steubenville, OH is NOT located north of
      Husson University, ME. Rather, it''s the opposite - Husson University is north
      of Franciscan University.</think># Is Franciscan University of Steubenville,
      OH located north of Husson University, ME?


      I need to determine the relative latitude of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      - Franciscan University is in Steubenville, Ohio (OH)

      - Husson University is in Maine (ME)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Maine is in the far northeastern corner of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Maine is one of the northernmost states in the continental US, bordering Canada

      - Ohio is more centrally located in the US, significantly south of Maine


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Maine is substantially north of Ohio, Husson University (in Maine) must
      be north of Franciscan University (in Ohio).

      So most likely, Our Lady of the Lake University (in San Antonio, TX) is south
      of the University of Arkansas at Monticello (in Monticello, AR).


      Therefore, the answer would be NO - Our Lady of the Lake University is NOT located
      north of University of Arkansas at Monticello.</think># Is Our Lady of the Lake
      University, TX located north of University of Arkansas at Monticello, AR?


      I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Our Lady of the Lake University is in San Antonio, Texas

      - University of Arkansas at Monticello is in Monticello, Arkansas


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of Texas and Arkansas

      - Arkansas is located directly north of Texas

      - San Antonio is in the southern half of Texas

      - Monticello is in the southeastern part of Arkansas


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Even though Monticello is in the southeastern part of Arkansas, the entire state
      of Arkansas sits north of Texas. San Antonio is quite far south within Texas,
      making it even further south of any point in Arkansas.


      Therefore, Our Lady of the Lake University is south of the University of Arkansas
      at Monticello, not north of it.

      geographic positions of two universities:

      1. Our Lady of the Lake University in Texas

      2. University of Arkansas at Monticello in Arkansas


      First, I''ll identify where these universities are located:


      Our Lady of the Lake University is in San Antonio, Texas, which is in southern
      Texas.


      University of Arkansas at Monticello is in Monticello, Arkansas. Arkansas is
      located north of Texas, bordering Texas''s northeastern side.


      Since Arkansas is north of Texas, and Monticello is in southern Arkansas while
      San Antonio is in southern Texas, the University of Arkansas at Monticello would
      be north of Our Lady of the Lake University.


      Let me verify: Monticello, AR is located in the southeastern part of Arkansas,
      but even southeastern Arkansas is still north of San Antonio, TX which is in
      south-central Texas.</think># Determining the North-South Relationship Between
      Universities


      I need to find the relative positions of these two universities:


      1. Our Lady of the Lake University in Texas

      2. University of Arkansas at Monticello in Arkansas


      ## Step 1: Locate the universities

      - Our Lady of the Lake University is in San Antonio, Texas (southern Texas)

      - University of Arkansas at Monticello is in Monticello, Arkansas (southeastern
      Arkansas)


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' positions

      - Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana, which borders eastern Texas

      - Texas extends further south than Arkansas


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - San Antonio is in south-central Texas

      - Monticello is in southeastern Arkansas

      - Even the southernmost parts of Arkansas are still north of San Antonio, Texas


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Our Lady of the Lake University in Texas is NOT located north of University
      of Arkansas at Monticello. Instead, the Arkansas university is north of the
      Texas university.'

      To do this, I need to consider the geographical locations of both universities:


      1. Our Lady of the Lake University is in Texas (TX)

      2. University of Arkansas at Monticello is in Arkansas (AR)


      Now I need to think about the relative locations of these two places:


      - Texas is generally south of Arkansas. Texas borders Arkansas on Arkansas''s
      southwestern border.

      - Our Lady of the Lake University is specifically in San Antonio, Texas, which
      is in the southern part of Texas.

      - The University of Arkansas at Monticello is in Monticello, Arkansas, which
      is in the southeastern part of Arkansas.


      Since Texas is south of Arkansas, and San Antonio is in the southern part of
      Texas, while Monticello is in the southeastern part of Arkansas, Our Lady of
      the Lake University would be south of the University of Arkansas at Monticello.


      Therefore, the answer is NO - Our Lady of the Lake University is NOT north of

      - University of Arkansas at Monticello is located in Monticello, Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Arkansas.

      - Arkansas is positioned north of Texas on the map

      - Texas borders Arkansas along Arkansas''s southwestern border


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      - San Antonio is in the southern part of Texas

      - Monticello is in the southeastern part of Arkansas


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes.

      - San Antonio, TX is further south than Monticello, AR

      1. Thomas More University, KY - Located in Kentucky (KY)

      2. Benedictine University, IL - Located in Illinois (IL)


      I need to figure out which one is further north.


      Thomas More University is in Kentucky, which is generally south of Illinois
      in the US. Kentucky borders Illinois to the south.


      However, I should be more specific about the exact locations within those states,
      since state borders aren''t straight lines and parts of one state could be north
      of parts of another.


      Let me think about the specific locations:

      - Thomas More University is in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, which is in the northern
      part of Kentucky near Cincinnati, Ohio

      - Benedictine University is in Lisle, Illinois, which is a suburb of Chicago
      in the northeastern part of Illinois


      Illinois is generally north of Kentucky. Even the southern tip of Illinois is
      typically north of most of Kentucky. The Chicago area (where Benedictine is)
      is in the far northern part of Illinois, while Crestview Hills (where Thomas
      More is) is in the northern part of Kentucky.


      Therefore, Benedictine University in Illinois should be further north than Thomas
      More University in Kentucky.</think># Determining if Thomas More University,
      KY is north of Benedictine University, IL


      I need to identify the locations of both universities and compare their north-south
      positions.


      ## Step 1: Locate both universities

      - Thomas More University is in Crestview Hills, Kentucky (KY), in the northern
      part of the state near Cincinnati

      - Benedictine University is in Lisle, Illinois (IL), which is in the Chicago
      metropolitan area


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographical positions

      - Illinois is generally north of Kentucky on the US map

      - More specifically, the Chicago area (where Lisle is located) is in the northern
      part of Illinois

      - Even though Thomas More is in northern Kentucky, the Chicago area is significantly
      further north


      ## Step 3: Make the comparison

      - Benedictine University (Chicago area, IL) is further north than Thomas More
      University (northern KY)
