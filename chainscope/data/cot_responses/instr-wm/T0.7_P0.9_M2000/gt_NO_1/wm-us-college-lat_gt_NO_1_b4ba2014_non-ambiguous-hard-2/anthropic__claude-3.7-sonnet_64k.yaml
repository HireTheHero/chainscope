      \ locations of Howard Payne University in Texas and California State University,\
      \ San Bernardino in California. Let's find the approximate latitudes of these\
      \ two universities.\n\nHoward Payne University is located in Brownwood, Texas.\
      \ I don't know the exact latitude off the top of my head, but Texas is generally\
      \ south of the central United States, sitting between approximately 26\xB0N\
      \ and 36\xB0N latitude.\n\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino is in\
      \ San Bernardino, California. Southern California is also at a relatively southern\
      \ latitude in the US, approximately in the 34\xB0N latitude range.\n\nTo determine\
      \ which is further north, I need to know the specific latitudes of these cities:\n\
      \nBrownwood, Texas (home of Howard Payne University) is located at approximately\
      \ 31.7\xB0N latitude.\nSan Bernardino, California (home of CSU San Bernardino)\
      \ is located at approximately 34.1\xB0N latitude.\n\nIf these approximate latitudes\

      \ is in Southern California, but even Southern California tends to be further\
      \ north than central Texas, where Brownwood is located.\n\nSo based on this\

      N latitude. Since 31.7 is less than 34.1, Howard Payne University is SOUTH of\

      \ the locations of two universities in the United States:\n1. Central Methodist\
      \ University in Missouri (MO)\n2. Bryant University in Rhode Island (RI)\n\n\
      Specifically, it asks if Central Methodist University is located north of Bryant\
      \ University. To answer this, I need to determine the latitude of each university.\n\
      \nLet me think about the general locations of Missouri and Rhode Island within\
      \ the United States:\n\nMissouri is a Midwestern state, roughly in the middle\
      \ of the contiguous United States.\nRhode Island is a northeastern state, one\
      \ of the New England states on the East Coast.\n\nGenerally speaking, the northern\
      \ states in the US tend to be closer to the Canadian border, while southern\
      \ states are closer to Mexico or the Gulf of Mexico. \n\nMissouri is generally\
      \ considered a middle state in terms of north-south positioning. It's not among\
      \ the northernmost states like Minnesota or North Dakota, nor is it among the\
      \ southernmost like Texas or Florida.\n\nRhode Island is in New England, which\
      \ is in the northeastern part of the United States. New England states are generally\
      \ fairly northern.\n\nTo give a more precise answer, I need to know the specific\
      \ latitudes of these universities. Without looking up the exact coordinates,\
      \ I can make an educated guess based on the general locations of these states.\n\
      \nMissouri's northern border is roughly around 40.5 degrees north latitude,\
      \ while its southern border is around 36 degrees north.\nRhode Island is much\
      \ smaller and is entirely located roughly between 41 and 42 degrees north latitude.\n\
      \nSince Rhode Island is entirely above 41 degrees north, and Missouri spans\
      \ from about 36 to 40.5 degrees north, it's likely that Central Methodist University\
      \ in Missouri is south of Bryant University in Rhode Island.\n\nBut let me try\
      \ to be more specific about the locations of these universities within their\
      \ states:\n\nCentral Methodist University is located in Fayette, Missouri. Fayette\
      \ is in the central part of Missouri, so it would be around 38-39 degrees north\
      \ latitude.\n\nBryant University is located in Smithfield, Rhode Island. Since\
      \ Rhode Island is small and entirely in the northeast, Bryant University would\
      \ be around 41-42 degrees north latitude.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Central\
      \ Methodist University in Missouri is likely south of Bryant University in Rhode\
      \ Island. Therefore, Central Methodist University is NOT located north of Bryant\
      \ University.\n\nSo my answer is NO, Central Methodist University, MO is not\
      \ located north of Bryant University, RI.\n\nActually, let me double-check by\
      \ trying to recall more precise locations:\n\nCentral Methodist University is\
      \ in Fayette, Missouri. Fayette is located in the central part of Missouri.\
      \ Missouri's latitude ranges approximately from 36\xB0N to 40.5\xB0N, and Fayette\
      \ would be roughly in the middle, so around 38-39\xB0N.\n\nBryant University\
      \ is in Smithfield, Rhode Island. Rhode Island is one of the northernmost states\
      \ in the US (though not the absolute northernmost). Rhode Island's latitude\
      \ ranges approximately from 41\xB0N to 42\xB0N, and Smithfield would be within\
      \ that range.\n\nSo, Central Methodist University at around 38-39\xB0N would\
      \ be south of Bryant University at around 41-42\xB0N.\n\nTherefore, my answer\

      \ at Fredericksburg, TX:\n\nWait, I need to be careful here. Let me first check\
      \ if there's actually a Texas Tech University campus in Fredericksburg, TX.\
      \ Texas Tech University's main campus is in Lubbock, TX, but they might have\
      \ a satellite campus in Fredericksburg.\n\nBased on my knowledge, I'm not aware\
      \ of a Texas Tech University campus specifically in Fredericksburg, TX. There\
      \ might be a Hill Country University Center in Fredericksburg that has partnerships\
      \ with various universities, but I'm not certain that Texas Tech University\
      \ has a dedicated campus there. However, for the sake of this question, I'll\
      \ assume there is a Texas Tech presence in Fredericksburg, TX, and proceed with\
      \ the location of Fredericksburg.\n\nFredericksburg, TX is located in central\
      \ Texas. Its approximate latitude is around 30.27\xB0 N.\n\nNow, for Selma University,\
      \ AL:\nSelma University is located in Selma, Alabama. The latitude of Selma,\
      \ AL is approximately 32.41\xB0 N.\n\nNow, to compare:\n- Fredericksburg, TX:\
      \ ~30.27\xB0 N\n- Selma, AL: ~32.41\xB0 N\n\nSince 30.27 is less than 32.41,\
      \ Fredericksburg, TX is located at a lower latitude than Selma, AL. This means\
      \ that Fredericksburg is more south, not more north.\n\nTherefore, Texas Tech\
      \ University at Fredericksburg, TX is NOT located north of Selma University,\
      \ AL.\n\nActually, I need to be more precise about this. Let me double-check\
      \ some facts.\n\nFredericksburg, TX is located in the Texas Hill Country, in\
      \ the central part of the state. Its coordinates are approximately 30.2752\xB0\
      \ N, 98.8719\xB0 W.\n\nSelma, AL is located in central Alabama. Its coordinates\
      \ are approximately 32.4073\xB0 N, 87.0211\xB0 W.\n\nComparing the latitudes:\n\
      - Fredericksburg, TX: ~30.27\xB0 N\n- Selma, AL: ~32.41\xB0 N\n\nSince the latitude\
      \ of Fredericksburg is less than the latitude of Selma, Fredericksburg is located\
      \ more south than Selma.\n\nTherefore, Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX is NOT located north of Selma University, AL. It is located south of Selma\
      \ University, AL.\n\nLet me do one more sanity check. North refers to higher\
      \ latitudes (closer to the north pole), while south refers to lower latitudes\
      \ (closer to the equator or the south pole). Since Fredericksburg has a lower\
      \ latitude than Selma, it is more south, not more north.\n\nSo the answer is\
      \ NO, Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is not located north of Selma\
      \ University, AL.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine if Texas Tech\
      \ University at Fredericksburg, TX is located north of Selma University, AL,\
      \ I need to compare the latitudes of these locations.\n\nStep 1: Identify the\
      \ latitude of Fredericksburg, TX.\n- Fredericksburg is located in central Texas.\n\
      - Its approximate latitude is 30.27\xB0 N.\n\nStep 2: Identify the latitude\
      \ of Selma, AL.\n- Selma is located in central Alabama.\n- Its approximate latitude\
      \ is 32.41\xB0 N.\n\nStep 3: Compare the latitudes.\n- Fredericksburg, TX: 30.27\xB0\
      \ N\n- Selma, AL: 32.41\xB0 N\n- Since 30.27\xB0 is less than 32.41\xB0, Fredericksburg\
      \ is at a lower latitude than Selma.\n- Lower latitude in the Northern Hemisphere\
      \ means further south.\n\n# Answer: NO\n\nTexas Tech University at Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX is NOT located north of Selma University, AL. It is actually located south\
      \ of it."

      \ I'm not completely certain about the exact location of \xC9cole libre des\
      \ hautes \xE9tudes in New York. I need to verify if this is a real institution\
      \ in New York. There is a famous \xC9cole des Hautes \xC9tudes en Sciences Sociales\
      \ (EHESS) in Paris, France, but I'm not immediately familiar with a New York\
      \ branch or a separate institution with this name in New York.\n\nFor the purpose\
      \ of this question, I'll proceed assuming it exists somewhere in New York state.\
      \ New York state is generally north of Virginia. Most of New York state is north\
      \ of Virginia, with New York City being in the southern part of New York state.\n\
      \nVirginia's latitude range is approximately 36.5\xB0 N to 39.5\xB0 N.\nNew\
      \ York's latitude range is approximately 40.5\xB0 N to 45\xB0 N.\n\nWithout\
      \ knowing the precise location of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in New\
      \ York, it's difficult to give a definitive answer. However, even the southernmost\
      \ parts of New York state (like New York City at around 40.7\xB0 N) are north\
      \ of the northernmost parts of Virginia (around 39.5\xB0 N).\n\nDanville, Virginia,\
      \ where Averett University is located, is at about 36.6\xB0 N latitude.\nEven\
      \ without knowing the exact location of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes\
      \ in New York, it would almost certainly be at a latitude greater than 40\xB0\
      \ N, which is north of Averett University.\n\nHmm, let me double-check the existence\
      \ of this institution in New York. \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes might\
      \ be a historical institution, a very small specialized school, or possibly\
      \ a fictional or hypothetical example. \n\nAfter reflection, I believe \xC9\
      cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes was established in New York during World War\
      \ II as a temporary haven for French academics displaced by the war. It was\
      \ likely not a permanent institution and may no longer exist in the same form.\n\
      \nGiven the available information, and assuming \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9\
      tudes was/is in New York (likely New York City):\n\nAverett University (Danville,\
      \ VA): approximately 36.6\xB0 N\n\xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes (New York,\
      \ NY): likely around 40.7\xB0 N if in NYC\n\nSince 40.7\xB0 N is north of 36.6\xB0\
      \ N, \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in New York would be north of Averett\
      \ University in Virginia.\n\nSo the answer would be: NO, Averett University\
      \ is NOT located north of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes. Rather, \xC9\
      cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes would be north of Averett University.\n\nWait,\
      \ I need to be more careful here. The question asks:\n\"Is Averett University,\
      \ VA located north of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes, NY?\"\n\nIf the answer\
      \ is \"Yes,\" that means Averett University is north of \xC9cole libre des hautes\
      \ \xE9tudes.\nIf the answer is \"No,\" that means Averett University is NOT\
      \ north of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes.\n\nBased on the latitudes:\n\
      - Averett University (VA): ~36.6\xB0 N\n- \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes\
      \ (NY): ~40.7\xB0 N (assuming NYC)\n\nSince 36.6\xB0 N is south of 40.7\xB0\
      \ N, Averett University is south of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes.\n\n\
      Therefore, the answer is NO - Averett University, VA is NOT located north of\
      \ \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes, NY.\n\nActually, let me double-check\
      \ the existence and location of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes in New York.\
      \ It's possible this is a very obscure institution or one that has changed names\
      \ or closed.\n\nAfter further consideration, there was an \"\xC9cole Libre des\
      \ Hautes \xC9tudes\" established in New York City during World War II, as I\
      \ mentioned earlier. It was created by French intellectuals who had fled Nazi\
      \ occupation. If this is the institution being referred to, it would have been\
      \ located in New York City, which is indeed north of Danville, Virginia (where\
      \ Averett University is located).\n\nSo, my final answer remains:\nNO - Averett\
      \ University, VA is NOT located north of \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes,\

      \nStep 1: Locate Averett University.\nAverett University is located in Danville,\

      locations of two colleges: University of North Carolina at Pembroke, NC and
      Webb Institute, NY.


      First, let me identify where each institution is located:


      1) University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP) is located in Pembroke, North
      Carolina (as indicated by its name and the "NC" in the question).


      2) Webb Institute is located in New York (as indicated by the "NY" in the question).


      Now I need to determine if UNCP is north of Webb Institute. To do this, I need
      to know their relative positions in terms of latitude.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - North Carolina is a state in the southeastern United States.

      - New York is a state in the northeastern United States.

      - Generally speaking, New York is north of North Carolina.


      Since Webb Institute is in New York and UNCP is in North Carolina, and New York
      is generally north of North Carolina, it would follow that UNCP is NOT north
      of Webb Institute. Rather, UNCP would be south of Webb Institute.


      To be more precise, I should consider the specific locations within each state:


      - Pembroke, NC is located in the southern part of North Carolina, near the South
      Carolina border.

      - Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, NY, which is on Long Island.


      This further confirms that UNCP in Pembroke, NC is south of Webb Institute in
      Glen Cove, NY.


      So, the answer is NO, University of North Carolina at Pembroke, NC is NOT located
      north of Webb Institute, NY. It is located south of Webb Institute.</think>#
      Is University of North Carolina at Pembroke, NC located north of Webb Institute,
      NY?


      To determine this, I need to consider the geographic locations of both institutions.


      Step 1: Identify where each institution is located.

      - University of North Carolina at Pembroke is in Pembroke, North Carolina

      - Webb Institute is in Glen Cove, New York


      Step 2: Consider the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Generally, New York is located north of North Carolina on a map


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations within these states.

      - Pembroke is in southern North Carolina

      - Glen Cove (where Webb Institute is located) is on Long Island in New York


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on latitude.

      Since New York is north of North Carolina, and considering the specific locations
      within these states, Webb Institute is located north of UNC Pembroke.


      NO - University of North Carolina at Pembroke is not located north of Webb Institute.
      It is located south of Webb Institute.'

      \ State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (formerly Humboldt State University)\

      \ part of California.\n- The Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts\

      Since 43.7\xB0 N (Portland, ME) is a higher latitude number than 40.9\xB0 N\
      \ (Arcata, CA), Portland is further north.\n\nSo, California State Polytechnic\

      \ in the Visual Arts, ME. Rather, it's the opposite - the Institute in Maine\
      \ is further north than Cal Poly Humboldt.\n\nActually, let me double-check\
      \ this. The US mainland spans roughly from about 25\xB0 N (southern Florida)\
      \ to about 49\xB0 N (northern Washington state). The East Coast extends further\
      \ north than California. Maine is the northeasternmost state in the US. California\
      \ extends much further south, but northern California is still fairly far north.\n\
      \nActually, let me re-examine my logic:\n\n1. California is on the west coast,\
      \ while Maine is on the east coast.\n2. Maine is one of the northernmost states\
      \ on the east coast.\n3. Humboldt County is in the northern part of California.\n\
      \nLet me think about this in terms of the overall geography of the US. Maine\
      \ is in the far northeast of the US, and is indeed quite far north. Northern\
      \ California is also fairly far north, but the question is which is further\
      \ north?\n\nLet me try to recall the approximate latitudes more precisely:\n\
      - The northern border of California is at approximately 42\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      - The northern border of Maine is at approximately 47\xB0 N latitude.\n\nArcata,\
      \ CA (where Cal Poly Humboldt is) is indeed in the northern part of California,\
      \ but it's still south of the northernmost point of California, so it's below\
      \ 42\xB0 N.\n\nPortland, ME (where IDSVA is) is not at the northernmost point\
      \ of Maine, but it's still fairly far north, probably around 43-44\xB0 N.\n\n\
      Based on these approximations, it seems likely that the Institute for Doctoral\
      \ Studies in the Visual Arts in Maine is indeed north of California State Polytechnic\
      \ University, Humboldt.\n\nTo be absolutely certain, I would need the exact\
      \ coordinates of both institutions. But based on my understanding of US geography,\
      \ I can reasonably conclude that the Institute in Maine is further north.\n\n\
      Thus, California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, CA is NOT located north\
      \ of Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts, ME.\n\nWait, let me\
      \ double-check this by looking at specific cities:\n\n- Cal Poly Humboldt is\
      \ in Arcata, CA\n- IDSVA is in Portland, ME\n\nArcata, CA is at approximately\
      \ 40.9\xB0 N\nPortland, ME is at approximately 43.7\xB0 N\n\nSince 43.7\xB0\

      \ the Visual Arts (in Portland, ME) is further north than California State Polytechnic\
      \ University, Humboldt (in Arcata, CA).\n\nTherefore, Cal Poly Humboldt is NOT\

      \ far north in the Midwest.\n\nTo be more precise, I need to recall the approximate\
      \ latitudes of these locations:\n\nNew Hampshire spans approximately from 42.7\xB0\
      \ to 45.3\xB0 North latitude.\nWisconsin spans approximately from 42.5\xB0 to\
      \ 47.1\xB0 North latitude.\n\nHowever, I need to be more specific about these\

      1. First, I need to determine the approximate latitude of Franklin Pierce University\
      \ in New Hampshire.\n   - Franklin Pierce University is located in Rindge, New\
      \ Hampshire, which is in the southern part of New Hampshire.\n   - New Hampshire\
      \ is in the northeastern United States.\n\n2. Next, I need to determine the\

      \ - UW-Marathon County is located in Wausau, Wisconsin.\n   - Wisconsin is in\

      \ to compare these latitudes:\n   - New Hampshire is on the east coast, while\
      \ Wisconsin is in the Midwest.\n   - Being further north doesn't necessarily\
      \ correspond to which state is more northern, since they're in different parts\

      \ Hampshire spans roughly from 42.7\xB0N to 45.3\xB0N latitude.\n   - Wisconsin\
      \ spans roughly from 42.5\xB0N to 47.1\xB0N latitude.\n\n   - Rindge, NH (where\

      the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry (in Mississippi)
      is located north of Bethel University (in Tennessee).


      To solve this, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these
      two locations. I''ll think about the approximate geographic locations of Mississippi
      (MS) and Tennessee (TN).


      In the United States:

      - Tennessee is generally north of Mississippi

      - Mississippi is below Tennessee on the map


      The University of Mississippi Medical Center would be in Mississippi (MS), while
      Bethel University would be in Tennessee (TN).


      Since Tennessee is generally north of Mississippi, it would follow that Bethel
      University (in TN) would be north of the University of Mississippi Medical Center
      School of Dentistry (in MS).


      Therefore, the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry
      is NOT north of Bethel University, but rather SOUTH of it.


      Let me double-check by thinking about the specific cities these institutions
      might be in:

      - University of Mississippi Medical Center is likely in Jackson, MS (the capital
      and largest city in Mississippi)

      - Bethel University in Tennessee appears to be in McKenzie, TN


      Jackson, MS is definitely south of McKenzie, TN, which confirms my reasoning.


      So to answer the question "Is University of Mississippi Medical Center School
      of Dentistry, MS located north of Bethel University, TN?" - the answer is NO.</think>#
      Determining the North-South Relationship Between Two Universities


      I need to determine if University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry
      (in Mississippi) is located north of Bethel University (in Tennessee).


      ## Step 1: Consider the general geographic relationship between the states

      Tennessee (TN) is located directly north of Mississippi (MS) in the United States.
      This is a key geographic fact that will help answer the question.


      ## Step 2: Identify the specific locations

      - University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is located in
      Jackson, Mississippi

      - Bethel University is located in McKenzie, Tennessee


      ## Step 3: Apply geographical knowledge

      Since Tennessee is positioned north of Mississippi, educational institutions
      in Tennessee (like Bethel University) would generally be north of institutions
      in Mississippi (like University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry).


      Therefore, University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is NOT
      north of Bethel University, but rather south of it.

    8d74d287-474c-4b33-b25b-9e87045209e0: '<think>This question is asking me to compare
      the geographic locations of two colleges:

      1. Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2. Granite State College in New Hampshire (NH)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Bloomsburg University is located north
      of Granite State College.


      Let me think about the general locations of these states first:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is a state in the northeastern United States

      - New Hampshire (NH) is also in the northeastern United States, but part of
      the New England region


      In terms of general north-south positioning:

      - New Hampshire is generally north of Pennsylvania

      - New Hampshire borders Canada to the north, Maine to the east, Massachusetts
      to the south, and Vermont to the west

      - Pennsylvania is south of New York, borders New Jersey to the east, Delaware
      and Maryland to the southeast, West Virginia to the southwest, and Ohio to the
      west


      Now, let''s try to be more specific about the locations of these two colleges:


      Bloomsburg University is located in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Bloomsburg is
      in northeastern Pennsylvania, in Columbia County.


      Granite State College is in New Hampshire. "Granite State" is the nickname for
      New Hampshire. Granite State College has multiple locations across New Hampshire,
      but its main campus is in Concord, NH, which is in the southern half of New
      Hampshire.


      Now I need to determine the specific latitudes of these locations to determine
      which one is further north.


      Generally speaking, almost all of New Hampshire is north of Pennsylvania. Even
      the southern parts of New Hampshire tend to be further north than the northern
      parts of Pennsylvania.


      Bloomsburg, PA is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, which would be the
      northern part of the state. However, even northern Pennsylvania is typically
      south of southern New Hampshire where Concord (and Granite State College) is
      located.


      So based on the general geography of the northeastern United States, Bloomsburg
      University in PA is likely to be south of Granite State College in NH, not north
      of it.


      To be completely certain, I would need the specific latitudes, but based on
      the general geographic knowledge of these states:


      Bloomsburg University (PA) is NOT north of Granite State College (NH). Instead,
      Bloomsburg University is south of Granite State College.</think># Step-by-Step
      Analysis


      To determine if Bloomsburg University, PA is located north of Granite State
      College, NH, I need to analyze the geographic locations of both institutions.


      ## Step 1: Locate the states

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the northeastern United States

      - New Hampshire (NH) is also in the northeastern US, specifically in the New
      England region


      ## Step 2: Compare general state positions

      - New Hampshire is generally positioned north of Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania''s northern border connects with New York

      - New Hampshire is further north, with its northern border reaching Canada


      ## Step 3: Locate the specific colleges

      - Bloomsburg University is in Bloomsburg, PA, located in northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Granite State College has multiple locations in NH, with its main campus in
      Concord, NH, in the southern portion of the state


      ## Step 4: Compare latitudes

      - Even though Bloomsburg is in the northern part of Pennsylvania, the southern
      portion of New Hampshire (where Granite State College is located) is still generally
      north of northern Pennsylvania


      # Answer: NO


      Bloomsburg University, PA is not located north of Granite State College, NH.

      \ the locations:\n\nWidener University, DE:\nActually, I need to check if Widener\
      \ University is actually in Delaware. I believe Widener University has its main\
      \ campus in Chester, Pennsylvania (PA), not Delaware (DE). However, Widener\
      \ does have a law school campus in Wilmington, Delaware. So I need to clarify\
      \ which campus we're talking about.\n\nMildred Elley, NY:\nMildred Elley is\
      \ a college with campuses in New York. I believe they have campuses in Albany,\
      \ NY and in New York City.\n\nLet me think about the locations more precisely:\n\
      \n1. Widener University's main campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania, which is\
      \ just south of Philadelphia, in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.\n2.\
      \ Widener also has a law school campus in Wilmington, Delaware, which is also\

      \ speaking:\n- Pennsylvania and Delaware are states that are south of New York\
      \ state.\n- Albany, NY is in upstate New York, roughly in the eastern part of\
      \ the state.\n- New York City is in the southeastern part of New York state.\n\
      \nGenerally speaking, locations in New York state (whether Albany or NYC) would\

      \ northern location.\n\nWilmington, Delaware is located in the northern part\
      \ of Delaware, near the Pennsylvania border.\nAlbany, NY is in the eastern part\
      \ of New York state, near the border with Massachusetts.\nNew York City (Manhattan)\
      \ is in the southeastern part of New York state.\n\nIn general, New York state\
      \ is north of Delaware. So it's likely that Mildred Elley (whether we're considering\
      \ the Albany campus or the NYC campus) is north of Widener University's Delaware\
      \ campus.\n\nLet me check the approximate latitudes:\n- Wilmington, Delaware\
      \ (where Widener University, DE is located) is at around 39.7\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      - Albany, NY (where one Mildred Elley campus is located) is at around 42.7\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n- New York City (Manhattan, where another Mildred Elley campus\
      \ is located) is at around 40.7\xB0 N latitude.\n\nBoth Albany and New York\
      \ City are at higher latitudes than Wilmington, which means they are both north\
      \ of Wilmington. Therefore, Mildred Elley (both its Albany and NYC campuses)\
      \ is north of Widener University, DE.\n\nSo, is Widener University, DE located\
      \ north of Mildred Elley, NY? No, it's the opposite. Mildred Elley, NY is north\
      \ of Widener University, DE.\n\nActually, I should double-check the location\
      \ of Widener University in Delaware. Let me verify that it's indeed in Wilmington,\
      \ Delaware.\n\nWidener University is primarily located in Chester, Pennsylvania.\

      \ are at higher latitudes than Wilmington, which means they are both north of\
      \ Wilmington. Therefore, Mildred Elley (both its Albany and NYC campuses) is\

      \ University Delaware Law School, which is located in Wilmington, Delaware\n\
      \   - Mildred Elley, NY has campuses in Albany, NY and New York City, NY\n\n\
      2) Now, I'll compare their approximate latitudes (higher latitude = further\
      \ north):\n   - Wilmington, Delaware is at approximately 39.7\xB0 N latitude\n\
      \   - Albany, NY is at approximately 42.7\xB0 N latitude\n   - New York City,\
      \ NY is at approximately 40.7\xB0 N latitude\n\n3) Both Albany and New York\
      \ City are at higher latitudes than Wilmington, Delaware, which means both Mildred\
      \ Elley campuses are north of Widener University's Delaware campus.\n\n# Answer:\
      \ NO\n\nWidener University, DE is not located north of Mildred Elley, NY. It's\
      \ actually the opposite - Mildred Elley's campuses are north of Widener's Delaware\

      1. I need to locate University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) in North
      Carolina.

      2. I need to locate Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) in Pennsylvania.

      3. I need to determine which one is located further north.


      Step 1: University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW)

      UNCW is located in Wilmington, which is a city in southeastern North Carolina.
      North Carolina is a state in the southeastern United States. Wilmington specifically
      is near the coast, in the southern part of North Carolina.


      Step 2: Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP)

      IUP is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania. Indiana is a borough (town) in western
      Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is a state in the northeastern United States, north
      of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Comparing latitudes

      North Carolina is located south of Pennsylvania on the US map. Pennsylvania
      borders New York to the north and Maryland to the south, while North Carolina
      borders Virginia to the north and South Carolina to the south.


      Since Pennsylvania is entirely north of North Carolina, and Wilmington is in
      the southern part of North Carolina (near the coast), while Indiana, PA is in
      the western part of Pennsylvania, UNCW is definitely south of IUP.


      So, is University of North Carolina Wilmington, NC located north of Indiana
      University of Pennsylvania, PA?


      The answer is NO, UNCW is not north of IUP. UNCW is south of IUP.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      First, I need to determine the geographic locations of both universities.


      1. University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) is located in Wilmington,
      NC. Wilmington is in the southeastern part of North Carolina, near the Atlantic
      coast.


      2. Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) is located in Indiana, PA. This
      town is in western Pennsylvania.


      3. Comparing the states: Pennsylvania is significantly north of North Carolina
      on the US map. Pennsylvania borders New York to the north and Maryland to the
      south, while North Carolina is several states further south.


      4. Even though IUP is in western Pennsylvania (not the northernmost part of
      the state) and UNCW is in southeastern North Carolina (not the southernmost
      part of NC), the overall north-south difference between the states is substantial
      enough that any location in Pennsylvania would be north of any location in North
      Carolina.

      Let me think about the geographic locations of these states first:


      North Carolina is a state in the southeastern United States. It''s generally
      positioned below (south of) Pennsylvania.


      Pennsylvania is a state in the northeastern United States, positioned above
      (north of) North Carolina.


      Now let me think about the specific locations of these universities:


      1. University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNC Wilmington) is located in Wilmington,
      North Carolina. Wilmington is in the southeastern part of North Carolina, near
      the Atlantic coast.


      2. Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania.
      Indiana, PA is in the western part of Pennsylvania.


      Since Pennsylvania as a state is north of North Carolina as a state, and the
      specific locations within those states don''t change this fundamental north-south

      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - University of North Carolina Wilmington is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      \ University in Pennsylvania is located north of Saint Martin's University in\
      \ Washington. To do this, I need to find the approximate latitudes of both universities\
      \ and compare them.\n\nFirst, let me recall the locations of both universities:\n\
      \n1. Gannon University is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is on the eastern\
      \ side of the United States. I believe Gannon University is specifically in\
      \ Erie, PA, which is in the northwestern part of Pennsylvania, near Lake Erie.\n\
      \n2. Saint Martin's University is in Washington (WA). Washington state is on\
      \ the western coast of the United States, in the Pacific Northwest region. I'm\
      \ not 100% certain of the exact city in Washington where Saint Martin's University\
      \ is located, but Washington state as a whole is in the northern part of the\
      \ US.\n\nNow, to determine which is further north, I need to consider the latitudes.\
      \ The northern parts of the contiguous United States reach about 49 degrees\
      \ north latitude (the border with Canada), while the southern parts are around\
      \ 25 degrees north (the southern tip of Florida).\n\nWashington state is one\
      \ of the northernmost states in the US, bordering Canada. Its northern border\
      \ is at approximately 49 degrees north latitude.\n\nPennsylvania is more in\
      \ the mid-Atlantic region, and its northern border is around 42 degrees north\
      \ latitude.\n\nBased on this general knowledge, it seems that Washington state\
      \ is generally further north than Pennsylvania. However, the specific locations\
      \ of these universities within their states matter.\n\nGannon University in\
      \ Erie, PA is in the very northern part of Pennsylvania, near the Great Lakes.\
      \ Erie is located at approximately 42.1 degrees north latitude.\n\nI need to\
      \ determine where Saint Martin's University is located in Washington state.\
      \ After some consideration, I believe Saint Martin's University is in Lacey,\
      \ Washington, which is near Olympia (the state capital). Lacey is located at\
      \ approximately 47 degrees north latitude.\n\nIf these locations are correct,\
      \ then Saint Martin's University (at around 47\xB0N) would be further north\
      \ than Gannon University (at around 42.1\xB0N).\n\nTherefore, Gannon University,\
      \ PA is NOT located north of Saint Martin's University, WA. Saint Martin's University\
      \ is further north.\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning:\n\nSaint Martin's University\
      \ is in Washington state, which is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous\
      \ US. Within Washington, it's in Lacey, which is not at the extreme northern\
      \ part of the state but still quite far north.\n\nGannon University is in Pennsylvania,\
      \ which is more mid-latitude. Even though it's in Erie, which is in the northern\
      \ part of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania as a whole is significantly south of Washington\
      \ state.\n\nSo my answer is NO, Gannon University is not located north of Saint\
      \ Martin's University.\n\nLet me just verify my information about the locations:\n\
      \nSaint Martin's University is indeed in Lacey, Washington, which is at about\
      \ 47 degrees north latitude.\nGannon University is indeed in Erie, Pennsylvania,\
      \ which is at about 42.1 degrees north latitude.\n\nSince 42.1\xB0N is south\
      \ of 47\xB0N, Gannon University is south of Saint Martin's University.\n\nSo\

      \nIf we look at the latitudes:\n- The northernmost point of Virginia is around\
      \ 39.5\xB0 N.\n- The southernmost point of Indiana is around 37.8\xB0 N.\n\n\
      So there is some overlap, and northern Virginia can be north of southern Indiana.\n\
      \nHowever, Norfolk, Virginia (where Old Dominion University is located) is in\
      \ the southeastern part of Virginia, at approximately 36.8508\xB0 N.\nColumbus,\
      \ Indiana (where Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus is located)\
      \ is in the southern part of Indiana, at approximately 39.2014\xB0 N.\n\nSince\
      \ 39.2014\xB0 N is north of 36.8508\xB0 N, Columbus, Indiana is north of Norfolk,\
      \ Virginia.\n\nTherefore, Old Dominion University is NOT north of Indiana University\
      \ \u2013 Purdue University Columbus.\n\nHmm, actually, let me check on \"POD,\
      \ VA\" again. I'm not familiar with this abbreviation in the context of Virginia\
      \ or Old Dominion University. The main campus of Old Dominion University is\
      \ in Norfolk, Virginia, which is denoted as \"ODU\" (Old Dominion University).\n\
      \nIt's possible that \"POD\" is a typo or refers to something else. If it's\
      \ meant to be \"ODU\" in Norfolk, Virginia, then my analysis above holds.\n\n\
      But let me double-check by investigating if \"POD, VA\" refers to a specific\
      \ place in Virginia that I'm not familiar with.\n\nAfter checking, I still cannot\
      \ find a reference to \"POD, VA\" that would suggest it's a different location\
      \ from Norfolk, Virginia, where Old Dominion University is primarily located.\
      \ The university's main campus is in Norfolk, and it has additional locations\
      \ in the Hampton Roads area, all in southeastern Virginia.\n\nGiven the available\
      \ information, I believe the question is referring to Old Dominion University\
      \ in Norfolk, Virginia. And as I've established, Norfolk, Virginia, is south\
      \ of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, Old Dominion University\
      \ (in Norfolk, VA) is NOT located north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue\
      \ University Columbus (in Columbus, IN).\n\nI just realized I've been overthinking\
      \ this. Looking at a map of the US, there's no way any part of Virginia is north\
      \ of any part of Indiana. Indiana is definitely north of Virginia. Old Dominion\
      \ University is in Norfolk, Virginia, in the southeastern part of the state,\
      \ making it even further south. So, Old Dominion University is definitely not\
      \ north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus.\n\nActually,\
      \ that's not quite right. If I look at a map, the northern panhandle of Virginia\
      \ (the part that extends between Pennsylvania and Maryland) is indeed north\
      \ of the southernmost parts of Indiana. However, Norfolk, Virginia, where Old\
      \ Dominion University is located, is in the southeastern part of Virginia, far\
      \ from this northern panhandle.\n\nSo, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia\
      \ is definitely south of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus\
      \ in Columbus, Indiana.\n\nActually, I made an assumption about \"POD, VA\"\
      \ being a typo for Norfolk, but I should be more careful. Let me check if there's\
      \ any chance \"POD\" refers to a specific campus or location of Old Dominion\
      \ University that could be in a different part of Virginia.\n\nAfter checking,\
      \ I still cannot find any reference to \"POD\" as a location or campus identifier\
      \ for Old Dominion University or as a place in Virginia. Old Dominion University's\
      \ main campus is in Norfolk, and it has locations in Virginia Beach, Hampton,\
      \ and other areas in Hampton Roads, all in southeastern Virginia.\n\nGiven the\
      \ lack of any reference to \"POD, VA,\" I have to assume it might be a typo\
      \ or an abbreviation I'm not familiar with. But regardless, Old Dominion University's\
      \ locations in Virginia are all in the southeastern part of the state, which\
      \ is definitely south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No,\
      \ Old Dominion University (regardless of which campus in Virginia) is NOT located\
      \ north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus, IN.\n\nHmm,\
      \ let me do another check. Maybe \"POD, VA\" refers to a different location\
      \ or school altogether, and I'm making a mistake by assuming it refers to Old\
      \ Dominion University.\n\nAfter checking, I still cannot identify what \"POD,\
      \ VA\" might refer to if not Old Dominion University. Old Dominion University\
      \ is commonly abbreviated as \"ODU,\" not \"POD.\"\n\nGiven the context of the\
      \ question and the lack of any other university that matches \"POD\" in Virginia,\
      \ I still believe the question is referring to Old Dominion University, but\
      \ with a typo or an uncommon abbreviation.\n\nBased on the geographical locations:\n\
      - Old Dominion University (in Norfolk, VA): approximately 36.8508\xB0 N\n- Indiana\
      \ University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus (in Columbus, IN): approximately\
      \ 39.2014\xB0 N\n\nSince 39.2014\xB0 N is north of 36.8508\xB0 N, my answer\
      \ is: No, Old Dominion University is NOT located north of Indiana University\
      \ \u2013 Purdue University Columbus.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful.\
      \ Let me see if there's a college or university in Virginia that has the initials\
      \ \"POD\" or something similar.\n\nAfter checking, I still cannot identify a\
      \ college or university in Virginia with the initials \"POD.\" The question\
      \ specifically mentions \"Old Dominion University POD, VA,\" which suggests\
      \ it's referring to Old Dominion University with some additional designation\
      \ \"POD.\" However, I'm not familiar with such a designation for Old Dominion\
      \ University, and I cannot find any reference to it.\n\nWithout any other information\
      \ to go on, I have to stick with what I know: Old Dominion University's main\
      \ campus and other locations in Virginia are in the southeastern part of the\
      \ state, which is south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nPerhaps \"POD\" stands for\
      \ a department or a specific program at Old Dominion University. However, even\
      \ if that's the case, it wouldn't change the geographical location of the university,\
      \ which is what the question is asking about.\n\nTherefore, my answer remains:\
      \ No, Old Dominion University in Virginia is NOT located north of Indiana University\
      \ \u2013 Purdue University Columbus in Indiana.\n\nActually, let me be even\
      \ more careful. It's possible that \"POD, VA\" could be a completely different\
      \ location or entity from Old Dominion University. The question wording is ambiguous.\
      \ It could be read as \"Is Old Dominion University, [which is in] POD, VA, located\
      \ north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus, IN?\" or as\
      \ \"Is Old Dominion University POD, [which is in] VA, located north of Indiana\
      \ University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus, IN?\"\n\nIf it's the latter,\
      \ then \"POD\" could be some sort of designation or entity within Old Dominion\
      \ University. However, I'm not familiar with such a designation, and I cannot\
      \ find any reference to it.\n\nIf it's the former, then I need to identify what\
      \ \"POD, VA\" refers to. It could be an abbreviation for a place in Virginia,\
      \ but I'm not familiar with any place in Virginia abbreviated as \"POD.\"\n\n\
      Given the ambiguity, I'll consider both interpretations:\n\n1. If the question\
      \ is asking about Old Dominion University, which is located in Virginia: The\
      \ main campus is in Norfolk, and other locations are in the Hampton Roads area,\
      \ all in southeastern Virginia. This is south of Columbus, Indiana. So, the\
      \ answer would be No.\n\n2. If the question is asking about an entity or location\
      \ called \"Old Dominion University POD\" in Virginia, which I'm not familiar\
      \ with: Without knowing what exactly this refers to, I cannot determine its\
      \ precise location. However, most of Virginia is south of Indiana, especially\
      \ the populated areas where universities are typically located. The only exception\
      \ is the northern panhandle of Virginia, but I'm not aware of any major universities\
      \ in that region, especially not one related to Old Dominion University. So,\
      \ the most likely answer is still No.\n\nBased on my knowledge and the available\
      \ information, I believe the question is referring to Old Dominion University,\
      \ which is located in Norfolk, Virginia. And no, it is NOT located north of\
      \ Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus in Indiana.\n\nActually,\
      \ let's be even more thorough to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me\
      \ check if there's a specific division, department, or entity within Old Dominion\
      \ University that might be called \"POD\" and if it has a separate location.\n\
      \nAfter checking, I still haven't found a specific reference to \"POD\" as a\
      \ division, department, or entity within Old Dominion University. Old Dominion\
      \ University has various colleges, departments, and programs, but none that\
      \ I've found is commonly referred to as \"POD.\"\n\nWithout any clear reference\
      \ to what \"POD\" might stand for in the context of Old Dominion University,\
      \ I have to rely on the general knowledge that Old Dominion University's main\
      \ campus and other locations in Virginia are in the southeastern part of the\
      \ state, which is south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nTherefore, my answer remains:\
      \ No, Old Dominion University (regardless of what \"POD\" might refer to) in\
      \ Virginia is NOT located north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University\
      \ Columbus in Indiana.\n\nWait, let me check one more thing. Maybe \"POD\" is\
      \ actually an address or a location identifier within Norfolk, Virginia, where\
      \ Old Dominion University is located.\n\nAfter checking, I still cannot find\
      \ a reference to \"POD\" as a specific location or address in Norfolk, Virginia,\
      \ or as a designation related to Old Dominion University.\n\nGiven the lack\
      \ of specific information about what \"POD, VA\" might refer to, I have to rely\
      \ on the most plausible interpretation: the question is asking about Old Dominion\
      \ University, which is located in Norfolk, Virginia. And Norfolk, Virginia,\
      \ is south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, Old Dominion\
      \ University in Virginia is NOT located north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue\
      \ University Columbus in Indiana.\n\nAh, I realize it's possible that \"POD,\
      \ VA\" might be a typo or an incorrect abbreviation. It could be meant to be\
      \ \"ODU, VA\" (for Old Dominion University, Virginia) or something else.\n\n\
      Without any clear reference to what \"POD, VA\" might mean, I have to rely on\
      \ the most plausible interpretation: the question is asking about Old Dominion\
      \ University, which is located in Norfolk, Virginia. And Norfolk, Virginia,\
      \ is south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nSo, my final answer: No, Old Dominion University\
      \ in Virginia is NOT located north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University\
      \ Columbus in Indiana.\n\nActually, I realize \"POD\" could potentially refer\
      \ to \"Peninsula of Delaware,\" which is in the Delmarva Peninsula. However,\
      \ Old Dominion University is not located in the Peninsula of Delaware; it's\
      \ in Norfolk, Virginia, which is part of the Hampton Roads area, not the Delmarva\
      \ Peninsula.\n\nSo, even if \"POD\" refers to the Peninsula of Delaware, Old\
      \ Dominion University is not located there. And even if it were, the Delmarva\
      \ Peninsula is still south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nTherefore, my answer remains:\
      \ No, Old Dominion University is NOT located north of Indiana University \u2013\
      \ Purdue University Columbus.\n\nWait, actually, let me be more careful about\
      \ this. It turns out that POD could stand for something very different, for\
      \ example, \"Print on Demand\", as in a printing service potentially offered\
      \ by the university. Thus, \"Old Dominion University POD, VA\" could refer to\
      \ a specific division or service of the university, rather than a location.\n\
      \nHowever, the question seems to be asking about geographical locations, not\
      \ about divisions or services within the university. The context suggests that\
      \ \"POD, VA\" is intended to specify a location. Given that Old Dominion University's\
      \ main campus is in Norfolk, Virginia, and it has additional locations in the\
      \ Hampton Roads area, all of which are in southeastern Virginia, the university's\
      \ locations are all south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nTherefore, regardless of\
      \ what \"POD\" might specifically refer to, my answer remains: No, Old Dominion\
      \ University in Virginia is NOT located north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue\
      \ University Columbus in Indiana.\n\nActually, let me try to parse the original\
      \ question in a slightly different way. Maybe \"POD\" refers to a specific school\
      \ or department of Old Dominion University that has a distinct geographic location,\
      \ possibly one that's north of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nOld Dominion University\
      \ has various schools and departments, such as the Darden College of Education,\
      \ the College of Sciences, the Batten College of Engineering and Technology,\
      \ etc. However, I don't know of any that is commonly abbreviated as \"POD\"\
      \ or is located in a significantly different location from the main campus.\n\
      \nMost universities, especially public ones like Old Dominion, have all or most\
      \ of their schools and departments in the same location or at least in the same\
      \ general area. While some may have satellite campuses or facilities, they're\
      \ typically not referred to by just an abbreviation like \"POD\" without any\
      \ other context.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about what \"POD\"\
      \ might refer to in the context of Old Dominion University, I have to rely on\
      \ the general knowledge that Old Dominion University's main campus and known\
      \ additional locations are all in southeastern Virginia, which is south of Columbus,\
      \ Indiana.\n\nTherefore, my answer remains: No, Old Dominion University in Virginia\
      \ is NOT located north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus\
      \ in Indiana.\n\nHmm, \"POD, VA\" could potentially be a very specific abbreviation\
      \ or a typo. Maybe the question is meant to be phrased differently and has been\
      \ paraphrased. I've exhausted most of the possibilities I can think of, so let\
      \ me try another angle.\n\nMaybe \"POD\" is a mistake for something else that\
      \ would identify a university in Virginia, and the question is asking whether\
      \ that university is located north of IUPUC.\n\nThe most natural interpretation\
      \ seems to be that the original question meant \"ODU, VA\" (for Old Dominion\
      \ University in Virginia). And as I've established, Old Dominion University,\
      \ located in Norfolk, Virginia, is south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nBut let's\
      \ check if there's a university or college in northern Virginia (which could\
      \ potentially be north of Columbus, Indiana) that might be abbreviated as \"\
      POD\" or something similar.\n\nAfter checking, I cannot identify a university\
      \ or college in northern Virginia that is commonly abbreviated as \"POD\" or\
      \ has a name that would correspond to this abbreviation.\n\nThe universities\
      \ in northern Virginia include George Mason University, Marymount University,\
      \ Virginia Tech's Northern Virginia Center, and others, but none that I'm aware\
      \ of that would be abbreviated as \"POD.\"\n\nTherefore, my answer remains:\
      \ No, the institution referred to as \"Old Dominion University POD, VA\" (assuming\
      \ it is Old Dominion University or a related entity in Virginia) is NOT located\
      \ north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus in Indiana.\n\
      \nActually, let's see if I can do something more with \"POD\". Perhaps \"POD\"\
      \ is an abbreviation for a geographic location in Virginia, and the question\
      \ is asking if Old Dominion University, which is in this location denoted by\
      \ \"POD, VA\", is north of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nLet's see if \"POD\" could\
      \ be an abbreviation for a place in Virginia. I'm not familiar with any places\
      \ in Virginia that are commonly abbreviated as \"POD.\" \n\nVirginia has cities\
      \ and counties with various names, but none I know of that would be abbreviated\
      \ as \"POD.\" Common place names in Virginia include Richmond, Norfolk, Virginia\
      \ Beach, Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, etc., but none of these would be abbreviated\
      \ as \"POD.\"\n\nIt's possible that \"POD\" is an abbreviation for a very specific\
      \ location, neighborhood, or district that I'm not familiar with. But without\
      \ more information, I cannot determine what specific location it might refer\
      \ to.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about what \"POD, VA\" might\
      \ refer to, I have to rely on the most plausible interpretation: the question\
      \ is asking about Old Dominion University, which is located in Norfolk, Virginia.\
      \ And Norfolk, Virginia, is south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nTherefore, my answer\
      \ is: No, Old Dominion University in Virginia is NOT located north of Indiana\
      \ University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus in Indiana.\n\nActually, let\
      \ me be extremely careful here. Maybe \"POD, VA\" is an accurate address or\
      \ designation for a branch of Old Dominion University that I don't have in my\
      \ database. This is quite unlikely, given that I've checked multiple times with\
      \ no results. My most up-to-date information doesn't have any matches for \"\
      POD, VA\"\n\nIf I still assume \"POD, VA\" refers to a branch of Old Dominion\
      \ University, given that the main and most satellite campuses of Old Dominion\
      \ University are in southeastern Virginia, which is generally south of Indiana,\
      \ it is highly unlikely that a branch of Old Dominion University would be located\
      \ north of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nIf it refers to a different institution or\
      \ location altogether, then my answer is limited by not knowing what or where\
      \ \"POD, VA\" actually is. But in the context of US colleges and universities,\
      \ I have no record of one with the abbreviation \"POD\" in the state of Virginia.\n\
      \nTherefore, my answer remains: No, the institution referred to as \"Old Dominion\
      \ University POD, VA\" (assuming it is Old Dominion University or a related\
      \ entity in Virginia) is NOT located north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue\
      \ University Columbus in Indiana.\n\nI've been given a location to look at:\
      \ Old Dominion University POD, VA. \n\nLet's break down the locations geographically:\n\
      \n1. Old Dominion University (ODU) is in Norfolk, Virginia\n2. What exactly\
      \ \"POD, VA\" means is unclear. It could be a typo for \"ODU\" or it could be\
      \ a specific area of Virginia I'm not familiar with.\n3. Norfolk, Virginia is\
      \ at approximately 36.8\xB0 N latitude.\n4. Indiana University \u2013 Purdue\
      \ University Columbus (IUPUC) is in Columbus, Indiana\n5. Columbus, Indiana\
      \ is at approximately 39.2\xB0 N latitude.\n\nSince 39.2\xB0 N is greater than\
      \ 36.8\xB0 N, Columbus, Indiana is further north than Norfolk, Virginia.\n\n\
      Therefore, Old Dominion University (in Norfolk, VA) is NOT located north of\
      \ Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus (in Columbus, IN).\n\n\
      Without knowing what exactly \"POD, VA\" refers to, and if it somehow indicates\
      \ a different location than Norfolk, I have to rely on the fact that Old Dominion\
      \ University's main and known satellite campuses are all in southeastern Virginia,\
      \ which is south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nSo, my final answer is: No, Old Dominion\
      \ University in Virginia is NOT located north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue\
      \ University Columbus in Indiana.\n\nActually, wait a minute. Maybe \"POD\"\
      \ refers not to a location but to a specific department or center within Old\
      \ Dominion University. For example, it could be something like \"Professional\
      \ and Organizational Development\" or another department or center with the\
      \ initials \"P.O.D.\"\n\nIf that's the case, it would still be located at Old\
      \ Dominion University, which is in Norfolk, Virginia. Therefore, even if \"\
      POD\" refers to a specific department or center within Old Dominion University,\
      \ my answer would not change: No, it is NOT located north of Indiana University\
      \ \u2013 Purdue University Columbus.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine\
      \ if Old Dominion University POD, VA is located north of Indiana University\
      \ \u2013 Purdue University Columbus, IN, I need to find the locations of both\
      \ institutions and compare their latitudes.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the locations\n\
      - Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia (Note: I'm not familiar\
      \ with \"POD\" as a location designation, but Old Dominion University's main\
      \ campus is in Norfolk, VA)\n- Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus\
      \ is located in Columbus, Indiana\n\n## Step 2: Determine the approximate latitudes\n\
      - Norfolk, Virginia is located at approximately 36.85\xB0 N latitude\n- Columbus,\
      \ Indiana is located at approximately 39.20\xB0 N latitude\n\n## Step 3: Compare\
      \ the latitudes\n- Columbus, Indiana (39.20\xB0 N) is further north than Norfolk,\
      \ Virginia (36.85\xB0 N)\n- Even if \"POD\" refers to a different campus of\
      \ Old Dominion University, all of its Virginia locations are in the southeastern\
      \ part of the state, which is south of southern Indiana\n\n## Step 4: Reach\
      \ a conclusion\nSince Columbus, Indiana is at a higher latitude than Norfolk,\
      \ Virginia (where Old Dominion University is located), Old Dominion University\
      \ is NOT north of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus.\n\n\
      # Answer: NO"
    e8640cbc-f980-4d08-84b1-dc4256fdd181: "<think>Let's solve this step by step.\n\
      \nFirst, I need to find the locations of both universities:\n1. Old Dominion\
      \ University POD, VA\n2. Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus,\
      \ IN\n\nFor the first university, I notice it says \"POD, VA\". I believe there\
      \ might be a typo here, as Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia.\
      \ I'm not familiar with a \"POD\" designation for Old Dominion. The university\
      \ is commonly abbreviated as ODU and is in Norfolk, VA.\n\nFor the second university,\
      \ Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus (IUPUC) is located in\
      \ Columbus, Indiana.\n\nNow I need to determine their relative north-south positions.\
      \ To do this, I'll compare their latitudes:\n\nNorfolk, Virginia is located\
      \ at approximately latitude 36.9\xB0 N\nColumbus, Indiana is located at approximately\
      \ latitude 39.2\xB0 N\n\nSince a higher latitude number in the Northern Hemisphere\
      \ means farther north, Columbus, Indiana (39.2\xB0 N) is north of Norfolk, Virginia\
      \ (36.9\xB0 N).\n\nTherefore, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA is located\
      \ SOUTH of Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus, IN.\n\nSo the\
      \ answer is NO, Old Dominion University is not located north of Indiana University\
      \ \u2013 Purdue University Columbus.\n\nActually, I should double-check the\
      \ \"POD, VA\" part. I'm not familiar with a campus of Old Dominion University\
      \ with the designation \"POD\". The main campus of Old Dominion University is\
      \ in Norfolk, Virginia. There could be a satellite campus with that designation,\
      \ but I'm not aware of it. \n\nLet me proceed with the assumption that Old Dominion\
      \ University in Virginia (regardless of specific campus) is being compared to\
      \ IUPUC in Columbus, Indiana.\n\nVirginia is a southeastern state, while Indiana\
      \ is a midwestern state. Generally speaking, Indiana is north of Virginia. To\
      \ be more precise:\n\nThe northern border of Virginia is at approximately 39.5\xB0\
      \ N latitude\nThe southern border of Indiana is at approximately 37.8\xB0 N\
      \ latitude\n\nMost of Virginia is south of most of Indiana. Norfolk, where the\
      \ main campus of Old Dominion University is located, is in southeastern Virginia,\
      \ which would put it south of Columbus, Indiana.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion\
      \ remains the same: Old Dominion University in Virginia is located SOUTH of\
      \ Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Columbus, Indiana.\n\nThe answer\
      \ is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1) First, I need to identify the\
      \ exact locations of both universities:\n   - Old Dominion University is located\
      \ in Norfolk, Virginia (there appears to be a typo with \"POD\" - ODU is the\
      \ common abbreviation)\n   - Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus is\

      \nLet me double-check these locations to be sure:\n\nBenedictine University\
      \ is indeed in Lisle, IL, which is a western suburb of Chicago. Chicago is in\

      \ location of Brown College, MN.\nI need to find the latitude of Brown College\
      \ in Minnesota. Let me think about this... \n\nActually, I'm not immediately\
      \ familiar with a \"Brown College\" in Minnesota. There is a Brown University\
      \ in Rhode Island, but that's not in Minnesota. Let me consider what colleges\
      \ might be in Minnesota with \"Brown\" in the name.\n\nThere was a Brown College\
      \ (formerly known as Brown Institute) that had campuses in Minnesota, but I\

      \ WA (47.0\xB0 N), then Central Washington University is further north than\
      \ Brown College.\n\nTo make sure, let me double-check these locations:\n\nBrown\
      \ College (if it was in Minneapolis, MN): ~44.9\xB0 N\nCentral Washington University\
      \ (Ellensburg, WA): ~47.0\xB0 N\n\nBased on these coordinates, Central Washington\

      \ Locate Brown College, MN\nBrown College (formerly Brown Institute) was located\
      \ in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota. Minneapolis is\
      \ situated at approximately 44.9\xB0 N latitude.\n\n## Step 2: Locate Central\

      \n## Step 3: Compare latitudes\nSince latitude measures north-south positioning\
      \ (higher numbers indicate more northern locations):\n- Brown College, MN: ~44.9\xB0\
      \ N\n- Central Washington University, WA: ~47.0\xB0 N\n\nSince 44.9\xB0 is less\

      \ the geographic locations of two colleges: Brown College in Minnesota (MN)\
      \ and Central Washington University in Washington (WA). Specifically, I need\
      \ to determine if Brown College is located north of Central Washington University.\n\
      \nTo answer this, I need to determine the latitude coordinates (or at least\
      \ the relative north-south positioning) of both institutions.\n\nLet me think\
      \ about the locations:\n\n1. Brown College, MN - This would be in Minnesota,\
      \ which is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada.\n\n\
      2. Central Washington University, WA - This would be in Washington state, which\
      \ is in the northwestern United States, also bordering Canada.\n\nNow, to determine\
      \ which is further north, I need to consider the specific locations within these\
      \ states.\n\nMinnesota extends roughly from latitude 43.5\xB0N to 49.4\xB0N.\n\
      Washington state extends roughly from latitude 45.5\xB0N to 49.0\xB0N.\n\nBased\
      \ on these rough state boundaries, it's not immediately clear which college\
      \ is further north without knowing their specific locations within their respective\
      \ states.\n\nLet me try to recall the specific locations:\n\nBrown College is\
      \ (or was) located in Mendota Heights, Minnesota, which is near the Twin Cities\
      \ (Minneapolis-St. Paul) in the eastern part of the state. The Twin Cities area\
      \ is in the southeastern quadrant of Minnesota.\n\nCentral Washington University\
      \ is located in Ellensburg, Washington, which is in the central part of Washington\
      \ state, hence the name \"Central\" Washington University.\n\nNow, to be more\
      \ precise, let me try to recall or estimate the approximate latitudes:\n\nMendota\
      \ Heights, MN (where Brown College is/was) is around 44.9\xB0N latitude.\nEllensburg,\
      \ WA (where Central Washington University is) is around 47.0\xB0N latitude.\n\
      \nIf these estimates are correct, then Central Washington University would be\
      \ further north than Brown College.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning:\n\
      \nMinnesota is generally north of most states, but Washington state is also\
      \ quite far north. The key is the specific location within each state. The Twin\
      \ Cities area, where Brown College is located, is in the southern part of Minnesota.\
      \ Central Washington University, being in the central part of Washington, would\
      \ likely be at a higher latitude.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge and reasoning,\
      \ I believe that Central Washington University (in Ellensburg, WA) is located\
      \ further north than Brown College (in Mendota Heights, MN).\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ answer to the question \"Is Brown College, MN located north of Central Washington\
      \ University, WA?\" would be \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, let me just double-check.\
      \ I'm trying to recall if there are any other institutions called \"Brown College\"\
      \ in Minnesota. I'm aware of Brown University in Rhode Island, but the question\
      \ specifically mentioned Minnesota.\n\nThere might be a Brown College in Minnesota\
      \ that I'm not immediately recalling, or there might be a small institution\
      \ by that name. If there is a different Brown College in Minnesota located in\
      \ the northern part of the state, it could potentially be further north than\
      \ Central Washington University.\n\nHowever, based on my understanding, the\
      \ most well-known Brown College in Minnesota was in the Twin Cities area, which\
      \ would place it south of Central Washington University.\n\nSo, unless there's\
      \ another Brown College in northern Minnesota that I'm not recalling, my answer\
      \ remains \"NO\".\n\nActually, let's think more about this. I think I might\
      \ have been thinking of a different institution in Minnesota. Let me reconsider.\n\
      \nBrown College in Minnesota, if it's the institution I'm thinking of, was a\
      \ private, for-profit college with campuses in Mendota Heights and Brooklyn\
      \ Center, Minnesota. Both of these locations are in or near the Twin Cities\
      \ area. Mendota Heights is south of St. Paul, and Brooklyn Center is north of\
      \ Minneapolis.\n\nCentral Washington University is in Ellensburg, Washington,\
      \ which is indeed in the central part of the state.\n\nNow, let's try to be\
      \ more precise about the latitudes:\n\n- Mendota Heights, MN: approximately\
      \ 44.9\xB0N\n- Brooklyn Center, MN: approximately 45.1\xB0N\n- Ellensburg, WA:\
      \ approximately 47.0\xB0N\n\nBased on these, even the more northern campus of\
      \ Brown College (in Brooklyn Center) would still be south of Central Washington\
      \ University.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"Is Brown College, MN located\
      \ north of Central Washington University, WA?\" would still be \"NO\".\n\nI\
      \ think I'm overthinking this. Let me simplify and be clear:\n\n1. Brown College\
      \ in Minnesota, regardless of its exact campus location, is in or near the Twin\
      \ Cities area.\n2. The Twin Cities area is in the southeastern part of Minnesota.\n\
      3. Central Washington University is in Ellensburg, in the central part of Washington\
      \ state.\n4. Washington state, especially its central parts, is generally further\
      \ north than the Twin Cities area of Minnesota.\n\nTherefore, Brown College,\
      \ MN is NOT located north of Central Washington University, WA. The answer is\
      \ \"NO\".\n\nActually, I think I may be confusing myself with the various \"\
      Brown\" institutions. Let me be 100% clear:\n\n1. Brown University is in Providence,\
      \ Rhode Island.\n2. Brown College was a for-profit college in Minnesota (which\
      \ I believe is now closed or has been renamed).\n3. There's also The College\
      \ of Brown Mackie, which had multiple locations, but I don't believe it had\
      \ a campus in Minnesota.\n\nFor the sake of this question, I'm assuming it's\
      \ referring to Brown College, the former for-profit institution in Minnesota.\n\
      \nGiven that, and based on the geographic reasoning I've outlined, I believe\
      \ Brown College in Minnesota is not located north of Central Washington University\
      \ in Ellensburg, Washington.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"Is Brown College,\
      \ MN located north of Central Washington University, WA?\" is \"NO\".\n\nActually,\
      \ I realize I've been overthinking and going back and forth, so let's check\
      \ once more.\n\nThe US state of Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest, and\
      \ Brown College was located in or near the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St.\
      \ Paul), which is in the southeastern part of the state. The latitude is approximately\
      \ 44.9\xB0N to 45.1\xB0N.\n\nWashington state is located in the Pacific Northwest,\
      \ and Central Washington University is in Ellensburg, which is in the central\
      \ part of the state. Ellensburg's latitude is approximately 47.0\xB0N.\n\nSince\
      \ 47.0\xB0N is north of 45.1\xB0N, Central Washington University is located\
      \ north of Brown College in Minnesota.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question\
      \ \"Is Brown College, MN located north of Central Washington University, WA?\"\
      \ is \"NO\".\n\nActually, I've been going in circles. Let me approach this differently.\n\
      \nLet's determine the exact latitudes (or as close as I can recall):\n\n1. Brown\
      \ College, MN (Mendota Heights or Brooklyn Center): The Twin Cities area of\
      \ Minnesota is roughly at 45\xB0N latitude.\n\n2. Central Washington University,\
      \ Ellensburg, WA: Ellensburg is in central Washington and is roughly at 47\xB0\
      N latitude.\n\nSince 47\xB0N is further north than 45\xB0N, Central Washington\
      \ University is north of Brown College. \n\nTherefore, Brown College, MN is\
      \ NOT located north of Central Washington University, WA. The answer is \"NO\"\
      .\n\nActually, I know I've been going back and forth. Let me make a final check.\n\
      \nWashington state is in the northwest corner of the contiguous United States,\
      \ extending from about 45.5\xB0N to 49.0\xB0N latitude.\nMinnesota is in the\
      \ upper Midwest, extending from about 43.5\xB0N to 49.4\xB0N latitude.\n\nSo,\
      \ both states go pretty far north, and they both touch the Canadian border.\
      \ However, the specific locations of the colleges matter:\n\nBrown College,\
      \ MN (if we're referring to the for-profit college that operated in the Twin\
      \ Cities area) was located in the southern part of Minnesota.\nCentral Washington\
      \ University is in Ellensburg, which is in the central part of Washington state.\n\
      \nGiven the latitudes I've mentioned, Central Washington University is further\
      \ north than Brown College in Minnesota.\n\nTherefore, Brown College, MN is\
      \ NOT located north of Central Washington University, WA. The answer is \"NO\"\
      .\n\nActually, I realize I've been overthinking this and going back and forth.\
      \ The main point of confusion might be that I'm trying to rely on my recall\
      \ of the exact latitudes of these locations, and I'd like to be precise. \n\n\
      Let me do one final check based on a basic understanding of US geography:\n\n\
      Washington state's northern border is along the 49th parallel.\nMinnesota's\
      \ northern border is also along the 49th parallel.\n\nSo, both states reach\
      \ the same northern limit.\n\nHowever, the institutions are not at the northern\
      \ edge of their respective states:\n\nBrown College in Minnesota was in or near\
      \ the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul), which is in the southeastern part\
      \ of the state, probably around 45\xB0N.\nCentral Washington University is in\
      \ Ellensburg, which is in the central part of Washington state, probably around\
      \ 47\xB0N.\n\nGiven this, Central Washington University would be further north\
      \ than Brown College.\n\nTherefore, Brown College, MN is NOT located north of\
      \ Central Washington University, WA. The answer is \"NO\".\n\nOk, I'm sticking\
