      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both universities.

      - Central Methodist University is in Missouri (MO)

      - Bryant University is in Rhode Island (RI)


      Step 2: Let me identify the approximate geographical coordinates.

      - Central Methodist University is in Fayette, Missouri, which is in the central
      part of Missouri, roughly in the middle of the United States.

      - Bryant University is in Smithfield, Rhode Island, which is in the northeastern
      United States.


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positions (latitudes).

      - Missouri is significantly south of Rhode Island.

      - Central Methodist University would be at a more southern latitude than Bryant
      University.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Central Methodist University in Missouri is south of Bryant University
      in Rhode Island, it is NOT located north of Bryant University.

      of Claflin University in South Carolina and Capital University in Ohio.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Claflin University is in Orangeburg, South Carolina.

      - Capital University is in Columbus, Ohio.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of South Carolina and Ohio.

      - South Carolina is a southeastern state on the Atlantic coast.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, north of South Carolina.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positioning).

      - South Carolina is located further south than Ohio.

      - Therefore, Claflin University in South Carolina would be south of Capital
      University in Ohio.


      Step 4: Determine if Claflin is north of Capital.

      - Since Claflin is in a state that is south of Ohio, and there are no unusual
      geographic arrangements that would place Claflin further north than Capital,
      Claflin University is not north of Capital University.


      NO, Claflin University in South Carolina is not located north of Capital University

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Whitacre College of Engineering is part of Texas Tech University in Lubbock,
      Texas (TX).

      - Ohio Dominican University is in Columbus, Ohio (OH).


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Ohio is located in the northern/midwestern United States.

      - Ohio is north of Texas on a map.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since Ohio is north of Texas, Ohio Dominican University (in Ohio) is north
      of Whitacre College of Engineering (in Texas).

      - Therefore, Whitacre College of Engineering is NOT north of Ohio Dominican
      University, but rather south of it.


      NO, Whitacre College of Engineering, TX is not located north of Ohio Dominican

      - New York is a northern state on the east coast of the US

      - Generally, New York is north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations.

      - UNC Pembroke is located in the southern part of the US in North Carolina

      - Webb Institute is located in the northern part of the US in New York

      - There are no unusual geographic circumstances that would place the North Carolina
      institution north of the New York one

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Bloomsburg University is in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Granite State College is in New Hampshire (NH)


      Step 2: Determine their approximate latitudes.

      - Pennsylvania is generally south of New Hampshire in the United States

      - New Hampshire is in the northern New England region

      - Pennsylvania is in the Mid-Atlantic region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - New Hampshire shares a border with Canada to its north, while Pennsylvania
      does not

      - New Hampshire is positioned significantly further north than Pennsylvania
      on the US map


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      - Since New Hampshire is north of Pennsylvania, Granite State College (in NH)
      would be north of Bloomsburg University (in PA)

      - Therefore, Bloomsburg University is NOT north of Granite State College


      NO'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Grayson College is located in Denison, Texas

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these cities.

      - Topeka, Kansas is located in the northeastern part of Kansas

      - Denison, Texas is located in north Texas, near the Oklahoma border

      - Kansas is a state that lies entirely north of Texas

      - Topeka is roughly in the middle-to-northern part of Kansas

      - Denison, while in northern Texas, is still south of the Kansas state line

      \ the relative locations of these universities.\n\nStep 1: Identify the locations\
      \ of both universities.\n- Florida A&M University - Florida State University\
      \ College of Engineering is located in Tallahassee, Florida.\n- Elizabeth City\
      \ State University is located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.\n\nStep 2:\
      \ Determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.\n- Tallahassee,\
      \ FL is located in northern Florida, near the Florida-Georgia border.\n- Elizabeth\
      \ City, NC is located in northeastern North Carolina, near the Virginia border.\n\
      \nStep 3: Compare their latitudes.\n- Tallahassee, FL is at approximately 30.4\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n- Elizabeth City, NC is at approximately 36.3\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \nStep 4: Make the comparison.\n- Since Elizabeth City, NC has a higher latitude\
      \ (36.3\xB0 N) than Tallahassee, FL (30.4\xB0 N), Elizabeth City is further\
      \ north.\n- Therefore, Florida A&M University - Florida State University College\
      \ of Engineering is located SOUTH of Elizabeth City State University, not north\
      \ of it.\n\nNO"
