      the relative locations of the two institutions:


      1. **California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (Cal Poly Humboldt)**
      is located in Arcata, California. Arcata is in Northern California, near the
      Pacific Ocean.

      2. **Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts (IDSVA)** is located
      in Portland, Maine. Portland is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Now, let''s compare their locations:

      - **California** is on the west coast of the United States, while **Maine**
      is on the east coast.

      - **Arcata, CA**, is further south than **Portland, ME**, because Maine is located
      in the northernmost part of the New England region.


      **Conclusion:** Cal Poly Humboldt is located **south** of IDSVA, not north.


      Answer: **NO.**'

      Mary University) is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Milwaukee is in the southeastern
      part of Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan.


      2. **Locate Michigan Technological University, MI**: Michigan Technological
      University is located in Houghton, Michigan. Houghton is in the Upper Peninsula
      of Michigan, near Lake Superior.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Houghton, MI, is in the northern part of Michigan''s
      Upper Peninsula, while Milwaukee, WI, is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin.
      On a map, Houghton is significantly farther north than Milwaukee.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Houghton, MI (where Michigan Technological University
      is located) is north of Milwaukee, WI (where Mount Mary College is located),
      the answer is **NO**. Mount Mary College is not located north of Michigan Technological
      University.
