      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Central Methodist University is located in Missouri
      (MO), and Bryant University is located in Rhode Island (RI).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Missouri is located in the Midwestern United
      States, while Rhode Island is in the Northeastern United States.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the Northeast (where Rhode Island is
      located) is at a higher latitude than the Midwest (where Missouri is located).
      This means that Rhode Island is typically north of Missouri.


      4. **Consider specific university locations**: While the general geographic
      locations give us a good idea, the specific positions of these universities
      within their states could vary. However, given the general rule that the Northeast
      is north of the Midwest, it''s reasonable to deduce that Bryant University in
      Rhode Island would be north of Central Methodist University in Missouri without
      needing the exact latitudes.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of the United States, Rhode
      Island (and thus Bryant University) is north of Missouri (and thus Central Methodist
      University).

      \n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Northcentral University is in Arizona\

      \ University is based in San Diego, California, initially, but now operates\
      \ as an online university, the original premise might have been misleading regarding\
      \ its physical location in Arizona. The key point, though, is comparing the\
      \ general locations: parts of Arizona are north of parts of California, but\
      \ the specific locations of these universities are what matter.\n\nGiven the\
      \ context that Northcentral University has been associated with Arizona but\
      \ operates primarily online and considering the original San Diego connection,\
      \ the question seems to hinge on a geographical comparison that might not directly\

      \ to the core question without overcomplicating: If we consider Northcentral\
      \ University as being associated with Arizona and acknowledging parts of Arizona\

      \ on geographical principles rather than the specific operational nature of\
      \ the university.\n\nTherefore, based on the simplification that parts of Arizona\
      \ (where Northcentral University is associated) are north of Fresno, California,\
      \ the answer to whether Northcentral University, AZ is located north of California\

      Center for Politics, VA is located north of Ball State University, IN, let''s
      break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The University of Virginia (UVA) is in Virginia,
      and Ball State University is in Indiana.


      2. **Understand geographic locations**: Virginia is generally southeast of Indiana
      in the United States.


      3. **Consider the latitudes**: To determine north-south relationships, we need
      to consider the latitudes of these locations. Without exact coordinates, we
      can still make an educated guess based on general geographic knowledge. Virginia
      is typically at a lower latitude (further south) compared to Indiana.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Virginia is southeast and generally south of Indiana,
      it is reasonable to conclude that the University of Virginia Center for Politics,
      VA is located south of Ball State University, IN, not north.

      3. Since the question asks if Shenandoah University (in VA) is north of Mercyhurst

      that Shenandoah University would be south, not north, of Mercyhurst University.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Thomas More University is located in Kentucky
      (KY), and Benedictine University is located in Illinois (IL).


      2. **Understand geographical positions**: Generally, states in the northern
      United States are north of states in the southern United States. Illinois is
      considered to be in the northern part of the central United States, while Kentucky
      is more towards the southeastern part of the central United States but is north
      of the traditional "Southern States" like Tennessee.


      3. **Specific locations within states**: Without specific city or town names,
      we consider the general positions of the states. However, knowing that both
      universities are likely to be near or within the metropolitan areas of their
      respective states can help. Thomas More University is near Crestview Hills,
      KY (a suburb of Cincinnati, OH), and Benedictine University is near Lisle, IL
      (a suburb of Chicago, IL).


      4. **Compare latitudes**: To determine which university is north, comparing
