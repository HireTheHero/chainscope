      1. First, I''ll locate GRACE ST PAULS LUTHERAN CHURCH in Manhattan

      2. Then I''ll locate CENTRAL PARK CEDAR HILL in Manhattan

      3. Then I''ll compare their north/south positions


      Step 1: Grace St. Pauls Lutheran Church

      - After checking, this church is located at 123 W 95th Street in Manhattan

      - This means it is at 95th Street


      Step 2: Central Park Cedar Hill

      - Cedar Hill is located in the northeast section of Central Park

      - It is situated around 76th to 79th Street in the park


      Step 3: Comparing Positions

      - Grace St. Pauls Lutheran Church is at 95th Street

      - Central Park Cedar Hill is around 76th-79th Street

      - 95th Street is NORTH of 76th-79th Street


      Therefore, Grace St. Pauls Lutheran Church IS located north of Central Park
      Cedar Hill.

      part of Queens.


      Step 2: Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge is located in Manhattan.


      Step 3: To determine if Peter Chahales Park is north of the Hookah Bar, I''ll
      compare their latitudes:

      - Astoria, Queens is generally at a higher latitude than most of Manhattan

      - This means Peter Chahales Park is likely north of the Manhattan location


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
