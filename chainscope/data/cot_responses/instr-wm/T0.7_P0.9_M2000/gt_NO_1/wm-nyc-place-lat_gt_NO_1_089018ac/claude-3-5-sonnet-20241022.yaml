      1) First, I need to understand what these lights are - they are navigational
      lights in Raritan Bay near Staten Island.


      2) In navigational light numbering systems, typically the numbers increase as
      you go from the sea towards the harbor/inland.


      3) Light 58 has a higher number than Light 42, which means it is further inland.


      4) Raritan Bay is south of Staten Island.


      5) When moving from the bay towards Staten Island (going inland), you are moving
      northward.

      inland and thus further north.

      lights that are further out or further along a channel/waterway.

      - JK Early Educational Center is also in the Bronx


      2. The key thing to note is that South Bronx Community Charter High School has
      "South" in its name, indicating it''s in the southern part of the Bronx.


      3. If a school is in the South Bronx, it would be positioned lower (more south)
      than most other locations in the Bronx.


      4. Therefore, a school in the South Bronx would not be north of other Bronx
      locations (unless that other location was also in the very southern tip of the
      Bronx).


      5. Based on this reasoning, South Bronx Community Charter High School is likely
      positioned south of JK Early Educational Center.

      - Queens is one of the outer boroughs, located to the east of Manhattan

      - Manhattan runs roughly north-south


      2) PETER CHAHALES PARK is in Queens, specifically in Astoria

      - Astoria is in the northwestern part of Queens

      - Astoria is roughly parallel with the Upper East Side/Midtown of Manhattan

      Park is north or south of it.

      - 231st Street is further north than 204th Street


      4) Therefore, since The New School is on 231st Street and Gordon School Annex
      is around 204th Street, The New School is located north of Gordon School Annex.
