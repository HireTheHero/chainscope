      - Scurry County is located in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States.

      - Gogebic County is located in Michigan (MI), which is in the northern United
      States.


      Step 2: Let me be more specific about their locations.

      - Scurry County, TX is in west-central Texas.

      - Gogebic County, MI is in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, bordering
      Wisconsin and Lake Superior.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Michigan''s Upper Peninsula is very far north in the continental US, close
      to the Canadian border.

      - Texas is much further south, with even its northernmost parts being well south
      of Michigan.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Gogebic County, MI is positioned much further north than Scurry County, TX.

      - Therefore, Scurry County cannot be north of Gogebic County.

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States.

      - Montana is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Quay County is in New Mexico (NM), which is in the southwestern United States.

      - Whatcom County is in Washington (WA), which is in the northwestern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Washington state is located along the northern border of the United States,
      adjacent to Canada.

      - New Mexico is much further south, bordering Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Whatcom County, WA is one of the northernmost counties in the continental
      US, located at the Canadian border (around 48-49 degrees North latitude).

      - Quay County, NM is in eastern New Mexico (around 34-35 degrees North latitude).


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since Whatcom County is at a much higher latitude (further north) than Quay
      County, Quay County cannot be north of Whatcom County.


      NO, Quay County, NM is not located north of Whatcom County, WA. It is located

      - Lac qui Parle County is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the northern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Louisiana is significantly south of Minnesota in the United States.

      - Minnesota borders Canada to the north, while Louisiana borders the Gulf of
      Mexico to the south.


      Step 3: Apply directional reasoning.

      - For a location to be "north of" another location, it must have a higher latitude.

      - Since Minnesota is north of Louisiana, any county in Minnesota would have
      a higher latitude than any county in Louisiana.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      - St. Helena Parish (in Louisiana) must be south of Lac qui Parle County (in
      Minnesota).

      - Therefore, St. Helena Parish is NOT located north of Lac qui Parle County.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative latitudes of these
      two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Wichita County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern part of the United
      States.

      - Morrison County is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the northern part of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, bordering
      Canada.

      - Texas is in the south, bordering Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Minnesota is significantly north of Texas on the map.

      - Counties in Minnesota will generally be at higher latitudes (more northerly)
      than counties in Texas.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Calcasieu Parish is in Louisiana, which is in the southern United States.

      - Grand Isle County is in Vermont, which is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their latitudes.

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States

      - South Dakota is in the northern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico and is one of the southernmost states

      - South Dakota is much further north, bordering North Dakota


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison.

      - Any parish in Louisiana (including Vermilion) would be south of any county
      in South Dakota (including Fall River County)

      - Therefore, Vermilion Parish, LA is south of Fall River County, SD, not north
      of it
