      3.  **Determine the relative location of Ellis County within Texas:** Ellis
      County is in north-central Texas.

      4.  **Determine the relative location of Pacific County within Washington:**
      Pacific County is in southwestern Washington, on the Pacific coast.

      \n2.  **Determine the location of Rockwall County, TX:**\n    *   State: Texas\
      \ (TX)\n    *   Region within the US: Southern US, specifically North Texas.\n\
      \    *   General Latitude: Texas is a southern state, so its latitude will be\
      \ relatively low (closer to the equator).\n\n3.  **Determine the location of\
      \ Pepin County, WI:**\n    *   State: Wisconsin (WI)\n    *   Region within\
      \ the US: Upper Midwest.\n    *   General Latitude: Wisconsin is a northern\
      \ state, so its latitude will be relatively high (further from the equator).\n\
      \n4.  **Compare the general locations:** Texas is significantly south of Wisconsin.\n\
      \n5.  **Refine the comparison (optional but helpful for certainty):** To be\
      \ absolutely sure, I can look up the approximate latitudes.\n    *   Rockwall\
      \ County, TX: Located near 32.8\xB0 N latitude.\n    *   Pepin County, WI: Located\
      \ near 44.6\xB0 N latitude.\n\n6.  **Interpret the latitudes:** A lower latitude\
      \ number means the location is closer to the equator and therefore *further\
      \ south*. A higher latitude number means the location is further from the equator\
      \ and therefore *further north*.\n\n7.  **Apply the interpretation to the question:**\
      \ Rockwall County, TX (approx. 32.8\xB0 N) has a *lower* latitude than Pepin\
      \ County, WI (approx. 44.6\xB0 N). This means Rockwall County is *south* of\
      \ Pepin County.\n\n8.  **Formulate the answer:** The question asks if Rockwall\
      \ County, TX is *north* of Pepin County, WI. My analysis shows Rockwall County\
      \ is *south* of Pepin County. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n9.  **Final Check:**\

      to compare Etowah County, Alabama and Skamania County, Washington.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Alabama is in the southeastern
      US. Washington is in the northwestern US.

      3.  **Consider the latitude of each state:** States in the far north of the
      US generally have higher latitudes (farther from the equator) than states in
      the southeast. Washington is much further north than Alabama.

      4.  **Consider the location of the counties within their states:** While a county
      *could* be at the northernmost point of a southern state or the southernmost
      point of a northern state, it''s highly improbable that the southernmost point
      of Washington would be south of the northernmost point of Alabama.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** Skamania County, WA is located at latitudes around
      45-46 degrees North. Etowah County, AL is located at latitudes around 34 degrees
      North.

      6.  **Determine the relative position based on latitude:** A higher latitude
      means further north. 45-46 degrees North is significantly higher than 34 degrees
      North.

      7.  **Conclude the relative position of the counties:** Skamania County, WA
      is located north of Etowah County, AL.


      Therefore, Etowah County, AL is located *south* of Skamania County, WA.


      The question asks if Etowah County, AL is located *north* of Skamania County,
      WA.


      The answer is the opposite of our conclusion.

      to know the locations of Calcasieu Parish, LA and Grand Isle County, VT.

      2. **Determine the general location of each state:** Louisiana is in the southern
      US, bordering the Gulf of Mexico. Vermont is in the northeastern US, bordering
      Canada.

      3. **Consider the relative positions of the states:** Due to their positions
      on a map of the US, Vermont is clearly located north of Louisiana.

      4. **Relate the county/parish locations to their states:** Calcasieu Parish
      is in Louisiana, and Grand Isle County is in Vermont.

      5. **Compare the locations:** Since Vermont is north of Louisiana, any location
      within Vermont will be north of any location within Louisiana.


      Therefore, Calcasieu Parish, LA is located south of Grand Isle County, VT.


      The question asks if Calcasieu Parish, LA is *north* of Grand Isle County, VT.

      latitudes.

      3.  **Find the approximate latitude of Calcasieu Parish, LA:** Calcasieu Parish
      is in southwestern Louisiana. Louisiana is in the southern US. Its latitude
      is roughly between 30 and 31 degrees North.

      4.  **Find the approximate latitude of Grand Isle County, VT:** Grand Isle County
      is in northwestern Vermont. Vermont is in the northeastern US, bordering Canada.
      Its latitude is roughly between 44 and 45 degrees North.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** 30-31 degrees North (Calcasieu Parish) is a smaller
      number than 44-45 degrees North (Grand Isle County). On the Earth''s surface,
      a smaller North latitude means a location is *south* of a location with a larger
      North latitude.

      part of the United States. Idaho is in the northwestern part of the United States.

      3.  **Consider latitude:** Latitude measures distance north or south of the

      2.  **Determine approximate latitude for Iberville Parish, LA:** Louisiana is
      in the southern part of the US. Baton Rouge, the capital of Louisiana, is near
      Iberville Parish and is around 30.4 degrees North latitude. Iberville Parish
      is slightly south of Baton Rouge, so its latitude is roughly 30 degrees North.

      3.  **Determine approximate latitude for Owyhee County, ID:** Idaho is in the
      northwestern part of the US. Boise, the capital of Idaho, is near Owyhee County
      and is around 43.6 degrees North latitude. Owyhee County is south of Boise,
      but still in Idaho, so its latitude is roughly between 42 and 43 degrees North.

      a higher latitude (further north) than states in the Southeast. South Dakota
      is significantly north of South Carolina.

      5.  **Apply to the specific counties:** Since Hanson County is in South Dakota
      and Beaufort County is in South Carolina, and South Dakota is north of South
      Carolina, any point in Hanson County, SD will be north of any point in Beaufort
      County, SC.


      Therefore, Beaufort County, SC is NOT located north of Hanson County, SD. Hanson
      County, SD is located north of Beaufort County, SC.
