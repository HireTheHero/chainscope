    14da9c71-23fd-4fdd-8e7c-4e29a67d5010: 'To determine whether Young County, TX is
      located north of Brown County, WI, we need to look at the geographical locations
      of both counties.


      1. **Location of Young County, TX**: Young County is situated in the north-central
      part of Texas. Its county seat is Graham, and it is generally considered to
      be in the southern part of the United States.


      2. **Location of Brown County, WI**: Brown County is located in the northeastern
      part of Wisconsin, with its county seat in Green Bay. This area is significantly
      further north in the United States compared to Texas.


      3. **Comparative Analysis**: Since Wisconsin is located much further north than
      Texas, and considering that Young County is in Texas, it stands to reason that
      Young County, TX is south of Brown County, WI.


      Based on this geographical analysis, the answer to the question is NO.'

      is located north of Itasca County, MN, let''s analyze the locations of both
      counties step by step.


      1. **Location of Sharkey County, MS**: Sharkey County is situated in the state
      of Mississippi, which is located in the southern region of the United States.
      Specifically, Sharkey County is in the western part of Mississippi.


      2. **Location of Itasca County, MN**: Itasca County is located in Minnesota,
      which is in the northern part of the United States. Itasca County is situated
      in the north-central part of Minnesota and is known for its lakes and forests.


      3. **Geographical Comparison**: To determine if Sharkey County is north of Itasca
      County, we need to consider the latitudinal positions of both counties. Since
      Mississippi is a southern state and Minnesota is a northern state, it is reasonable
      to conclude that counties in Mississippi, including Sharkey County, will generally
      be situated further south than counties in Minnesota, including Itasca County.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Sharkey County is in Mississippi (south) and Itasca
      County is in Minnesota (north), it follows that Sharkey County is not located
      north of Itasca County.

      1. **Locate Vermilion Parish, LA**: Vermilion Parish is situated in the southern
      part of Louisiana, along the Gulf of Mexico.


      2. **Locate Fall River County, SD**: Fall River County is located in the southwestern
      part of South Dakota, near the border with Wyoming.


      3. **Compare the latitudinal positions**: Louisiana is generally further south
      than South Dakota. Since Vermilion Parish is in Louisiana and Fall River County
      is in South Dakota, we can conclude that Vermilion Parish is located at a lower
      latitude than Fall River County.


      Based on this reasoning, Vermilion Parish cannot be north of Fall River County,
      as it is situated further south.


      Thus, the answer is NO.'

      located north of Parke County, IN, we need to consider the geographical locations
      of both counties.


      1. **Locate Bee County, TX**: Bee County is situated in South Texas. It is located
      south of the central part of Texas, near the Gulf Coast.


      2. **Locate Parke County, IN**: Parke County is located in west-central Indiana.

      as a whole is further south than Indiana, and Bee County specifically is quite
      far south in Texas.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Bee County is located in the southern part of
