    0aa186f3-6baa-4c4a-93a2-0ce4c999d1a9: 'To determine whether Young County, TX is
      located north of Brown County, WI, we need to consider their geographical locations
      within the United States.


      1. **Identify the states**: Young County is in Texas (TX), and Brown County
      is in Wisconsin (WI).

      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Texas is located in the southern part
      of the U.S., while Wisconsin is in the northern part.
