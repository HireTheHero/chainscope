      1.  **Identify the first location:** Starr County, Texas (TX).

      2.  **Determine its general location:** Starr County is located in deep South
      Texas, right on the border with Mexico (along the Rio Grande River). This puts
      it very far south within the United States.

      3.  **Identify the second location:** Bath County, Kentucky (KY).

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to compare the locations of Bullock
      County, Alabama (AL) and Asotin County, Washington (WA).

      2.  **Locate the states:** Alabama is in the southeastern US. Washington is
      in the northwestern US.

      state in the United States. Idaho is a northern state in the United States,
      located much farther north than Louisiana.

      6.  **Determine relative position:** Since Idaho is significantly north of Louisiana,
      any location within Idaho (like Owyhee County) will be north of any location
      within Louisiana (like Iberville Parish).

      7.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Iberville Parish,
