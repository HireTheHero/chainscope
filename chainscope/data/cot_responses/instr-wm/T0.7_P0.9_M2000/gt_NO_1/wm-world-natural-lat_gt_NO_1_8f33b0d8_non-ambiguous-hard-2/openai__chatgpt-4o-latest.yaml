      Step 1: Lake Ngozi is a crater lake located in southern Tanzania, within the

      Step 2: The Vulture Mountains are also located in southern Tanzania and are

      1. Identify the location of the Caraballo Mountains.

      2. Identify the location of Lake Oscawana.

      3. Compare their relative positions (specifically, north vs south).


      **Step 1: Location of the Caraballo Mountains**

      - The Caraballo Mountains are located in the Philippines, specifically in the
      central part of Luzon island. They are situated between the Cordillera Central
      and Sierra Madre mountain ranges.


      **Step 2: Location of Lake Oscawana**

      - Lake Oscawana is located in Putnam Valley, New York, United States.


      **Step 3: Compare their relative positions**

      - The Philippines is located in Southeast Asia, near the equator (approximately
      13-17 degrees north latitude).

      - Lake Oscawana is in New York state, which is significantly farther north (approximately
      41-42 degrees north latitude).


      **Conclusion:**

      Since New York is much farther north than the Philippines, and the Caraballo

      question compares it to Gjende, a well-known lake in Norway, we can assume both
      features are in Norway.


      2. **Locate Gjende**: Gjende is a long, narrow lake in the Jotunheimen mountains
      in central southern Norway, situated in Innlandet County. It is a popular hiking
      destination, especially for routes like Besseggen.


      3. **Consider what "Lake Mountains" might mean in this context**: If it refers
      to mountains around another lake in the region, or perhaps the mountains around
      Gjende itself, we would need a specific name to compare accurately. But since
      the phrase "Lake Mountains" is ambiguous and not a recognized geographical term
      in Norway, it''s unclear.


      4. **Possibility**: There is a place called "Lake Mountain" in Utah, USA, but
      that is not relevant here given the context of Gjende in Norway.


      5. **Conclusion**: Because there is no known mountain range or location named
      "Lake Mountains" in the vicinity of Gjende (or in geographical databases related
      to Norway), and without further clarification, we cannot confirm that such a
      place exists or is north of Gjende.
