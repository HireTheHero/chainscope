    ad6d55fd-fb56-4afb-919d-66dd78fef068: '1. **Locate Fansipan:** Fansipan is the
      highest mountain in the Indochinese Peninsula, located in northwest Vietnam.


      2. **Locate Wazee Lake:** Wazee Lake doesn''t appear to exist.  There is Lake
      Wazeecha in Wisconsin, USA and a Lake Wazapamani in Manitoba, Canada.  It''s
      highly unlikely either of these is intended, given the location of Fansipan.  It''s
      possible there is a misspelling, but without further information, I have to
      assume the lake is not in Southeast Asia.


      3. **Compare Locations:** Vietnam is in Southeast Asia. North America (where
      both Wazapamani and Wazeecha are) is significantly north of Southeast Asia.


      Therefore, even with a potential misspelling of the lake''s name, Fansipan is
      almost certainly south of any lake named something similar to "Wazee."

      2. **Locate Ogilvie Mountains:** The Ogilvie Mountains are in the Yukon territory

      3. **Relative Positions:**  Newfoundland is far east of the Ogilvie Mountains.  North
      and south are relative.  While Newfoundland is at a higher latitude *generally*
      than the Ogilvie Mountains, the question asks if the "Newfoundland Mountains"
      (implying a mountain range *in* Newfoundland) are north of the Ogilvie Mountains.
      The island of Newfoundland, while at a higher latitude, stretches relatively
      east-west, placing portions of it further south than the Ogilvie mountains.


      4. **Specific Mountain Range:**  A search does not reveal any mountain range
      specifically called the "Newfoundland Mountains" within the province/island
