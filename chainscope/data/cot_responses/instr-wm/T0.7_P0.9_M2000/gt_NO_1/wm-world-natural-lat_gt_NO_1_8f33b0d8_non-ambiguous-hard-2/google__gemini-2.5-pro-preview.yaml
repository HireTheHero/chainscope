      north than Singanallur Lake in Coimbatore, India.

      5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Singanallur Lake is *north*
      of Mary Lake. Since Singanallur Lake is far to the south of Mary Lake, the answer
      is no.

      Lake) is located in the Wicklow Mountains, County Wicklow, Ireland.

      4.  **Determine Lough Tay''s approximate latitude:** County Wicklow is roughly
      at 53.1 degrees North latitude.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** 26.4 degrees North (Ana Sagar Lake) is south
      of 53.1 degrees North (Lough Tay).

      6.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Ana Sagar Lake is *north*
      of Lough Tay. Since its latitude is lower (further south), it is not north of
      Lough Tay.

    cd5eb87f-3260-41ad-8176-3bc157f06f91: "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\
      \n1.  **Locate Cordillera Real:** The Cordillera Real is a major mountain range\
      \ in the Bolivian Andes. It runs roughly northwest to southeast, situated east\
      \ of Lake Titicaca and northeast of the city of La Paz. Its approximate latitude\
      \ range is between 15\xB0 S and 17\xB0 S.\n2.  **Locate Paco (volcano):** Finding\
      \ a prominent volcano named simply \"Paco\" in Bolivia is difficult. However,\
      \ there are possibilities like Cerro Pacuni or Cerro Paco Khollu, or it might\
      \ refer generally to the volcanic region south/southwest of the Cordillera Real.\
      \ Major well-known volcanoes in Bolivia (like Sajama, Parinacota, Uturuncu,\
      \ Licancabur) are located in the Western Cordillera and Altiplano, generally\
      \ *south* or *southwest* of the Cordillera Real. For example, Sajama is around\
      \ 18\xB0 S latitude. Even lesser-known volcanic peaks potentially named \"Paco\"\
      \ in the relevant Andean region are overwhelmingly likely to be south of the\
      \ main non-volcanic Cordillera Real range.\n3.  **Compare Locations:** The Cordillera\
      \ Real lies approximately between 15\xB0 S and 17\xB0 S latitude. Any significant\
      \ volcano potentially identifiable as \"Paco\" in the relevant context of Bolivia's\
      \ geography is almost certainly south of 17\xB0 S latitude (i.e., having a larger\
      \ southern latitude number).\n4.  **Determine Direction:** Since smaller latitude\
      \ numbers in the Southern Hemisphere indicate a position further north, the\
      \ Cordillera Real (15\xB0S - 17\xB0S) is indeed located north of the region\
      \ where Paco volcano would likely be situated (south of 17\xB0S).\n\nYES"

      is far to the west-southwest of Norway, not north.

      4.  **Compare Locations (Interpretation 2: Mountains around Gjende):** Lake
      Gjende is surrounded by mountains (e.g., Besseggen ridge to the north, other
      peaks to the south). These mountains are located both north *and* south of the
      lake itself. So, the collection of mountains *around* the lake is not exclusively
      located north of it.

      5.  **Conclusion:** Whether interpreting "Lake Mountains" as the specific range
      in Utah or as the mountains surrounding Gjende, neither is located entirely
      *north* of Lake Gjende. The Utah range is geographically far away and not to
      the north. The mountains around Gjende lie on multiple sides of the lake.

      1.  **Identify Songkhla Lake''s location:** Songkhla Lake is located in southern
      Thailand.

      2.  **Identify Lake Boyukshor''s location:** Lake Boyukshor is located in Azerbaijan,

      4.  **Compare the locations:** Since Lake Kizi is in Adamawa State and the Mambilla
      Plateau is in Taraba State (which is south of Adamawa), Lake Kizi is located
      north of the Mambilla Plateau.

      5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if the Mambilla Plateau is located
      *north* of Lake Kizi. Based on the above reasoning, the Mambilla Plateau is
      *south* of Lake Kizi.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'

      1.  **Identify Satpura Range:** The Satpura Range is a mountain range located
      in central India.

      2.  **Identify Batchawana Bay:** Batchawana Bay is a large bay on the eastern
      shore of Lake Superior, located in Ontario, Canada.

      3.  **Compare Locations:** India is located in South Asia, while Canada is located
      in North America. Specifically, central India (where the Satpura Range is) is
      at a much lower latitude (closer to the equator) than Lake Superior/Ontario
      (where Batchawana Bay is).

      4.  **Determine Relative Position:** Batchawana Bay is significantly further
      north geographically than the Satpura Range. Therefore, the Satpura Range is
      located south of Batchawana Bay.

      3.  **Compare their global positions:** India is in Asia, south of Canada which
      is in North America. More specifically, the Satpura Range is roughly around
      21-22 degrees North latitude. Batchawana Bay is much further north, around 47
      degrees North latitude.

      4.  **Determine the relative position:** Since 22 degrees North is south of
      47 degrees North, the Satpura Range is located south of Batchawana Bay.
