      and "south" mean in this context.


      "North" refers to the direction opposite to the sun''s movement as seen from
      the North Pole. So, if you were standing in a place, and the sun was rising
      in the east, then "north" would be the direction towards the west.


      Similarly, "south" refers to the opposite direction of "north". If you were
      standing in a place, and the sun was setting in the west, then "south" would
      be the direction towards the east.


      Now, let''s look at the given options:


      1. Mount Baya is located north of Lake Baskunchak.

      2. Mount Baya is located south of Lake Baskunchak.

      3. Mount Baya is located in the center of Lake Baskunchak.


      To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the location of Mount Baya
      in relation to Lake Baskunchak.


      Lake Baskunchak is located in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan.


      1. If Mount Baya is located north of Lake Baskunchak, then it would be located
      in the western part of the Pamir Mountains.

      2. If Mount Baya is located south of Lake Baskunchak, then it would be located
      in the eastern part of the Pamir Mountains.

      3. If Mount Baya is located in the center of Lake Baskunchak, then it would
      be located in the middle of the lake.


      Based on this information, we can eliminate options 1 and 3, as they are not
      consistent with the given location of Mount Baya in the Pamir Mountains.
