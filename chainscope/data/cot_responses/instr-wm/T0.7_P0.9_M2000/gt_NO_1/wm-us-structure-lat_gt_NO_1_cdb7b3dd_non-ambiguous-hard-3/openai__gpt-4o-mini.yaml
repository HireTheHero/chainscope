      Wisconsin, we need to consider their geographical locations.


      1. **Locate Chicago Avenue Pumping Station**: The Chicago Avenue Pumping Station
      is located in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is situated in the northeastern part
      of the state of Illinois, near Lake Michigan.


      2. **Locate Kewaunee Power Station**: The Kewaunee Power Station is located
      in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, which is on the eastern side of Wisconsin along the

      3. **Determine relative positions**: Chicago is south of Kewaunee. Specifically,
      Kewaunee is farther north along the Lake Michigan shoreline compared to Chicago.


      Given this information, we can conclude that the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station
      is not located north of the Kewaunee Power Station.

      Salmon Falls Dam is upstream (north) on the Snake River, which flows generally
      from north to south.


      3. **Compare Elevation**: In river systems, the upstream locations are generally
      considered to be further north than downstream locations. Since Salmon Falls
      Dam is upstream of Oxbow Dam, it is likely to be north of it.


      4. **Confirm with Additional Information**: Cross-reference with geographical

      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: To compare the locations, we need to look
      at their latitudinal positions. Typically, New Mexico is south of Colorado.
      Since Navajo Lake is in New Mexico and Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado,
      we can infer that Navajo Lake is generally south of Barker Meadow Reservoir.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Navajo Lake is located in New Mexico and Barker
      Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado, and considering their geographical positions,

      1. **Locate Red Bluff Reservoir, TX**: Red Bluff Reservoir is situated in the
      southeastern part of New Mexico, near the Texas border. It specifically lies
      in Loving County, Texas.


      2. **Locate Lensic Theater, NM**: Lensic Theater is located in Santa Fe, New
      Mexico, which is north of Red Bluff Reservoir.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Lensic Theater is in Santa Fe,
      NM, which is approximately north of Red Bluff Reservoir in Texas, we can conclude
      that Red Bluff Reservoir is located south of Lensic Theater.


      Based on these steps, the answer to the question is:


      NO.'
