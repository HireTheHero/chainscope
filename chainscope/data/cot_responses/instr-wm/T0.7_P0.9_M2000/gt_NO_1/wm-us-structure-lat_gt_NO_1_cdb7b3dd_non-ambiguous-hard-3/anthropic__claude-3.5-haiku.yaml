      - Allegheny Reservoir is in the northwestern part of Pennsylvania

      - Northwestern Pennsylvania is geographically north of central/eastern North
      Carolina


      4. Therefore, Allegheny Reservoir is located north of High Rock Lake.


      5. The question asks: "Is High Rock Lake, NC located north of Allegheny Reservoir,
      PA?"

      - Since Allegheny Reservoir is north of High Rock Lake, the answer is the opposite.

      1. First, I''ll locate Navajo Generating Station in Arizona

      - This is a large coal-fired power plant located near Page, Arizona

      - It is situated in northern Arizona, near Glen Canyon Dam


      2. Next, I''ll locate Rockport Reservoir in Utah

      - This reservoir is located in northeastern Utah, near the Wasatch Mountains

      - Navajo Generating Station is in northern Arizona

      - Rockport Reservoir is in northeastern Utah


      4. Determining north/south positioning

      - Arizona is south of Utah

      - So a location in northern Arizona would be south of a location in northeastern
      Utah

    f9b244cb-89ba-4759-b52e-d9da48833e07: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Lake Centennial in Maryland and Rondout Reservoir in
      New York on a map.


      2. Maryland is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, located
      south of New York state.


      3. Since Maryland is geographically south of New York, any location in Maryland
      will generally be south of a location in New York.


      4. Therefore, Lake Centennial in Maryland would be located south of Rondout
      Reservoir in New York.


      The answer is: NO.'
