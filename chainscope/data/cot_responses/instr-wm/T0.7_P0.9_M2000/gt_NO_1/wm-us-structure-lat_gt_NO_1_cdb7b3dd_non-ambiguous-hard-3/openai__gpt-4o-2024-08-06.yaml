      1. **Fontana Lake, NC**: Fontana Lake is located in the western part of North
      Carolina, near the Great Smoky Mountains. Its approximate latitude is around
      35.4 degrees North.


      2. **Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus, OH**: This church is located in Cleveland,

      southwestern Oregon, northeast of Medford.


      Now, let''s consider the general north-south orientation of California and Oregon:


      - California is located to the south of Oregon.

      - Merced, where Lake Yosemite is located, is in central California.

      - Lost Creek Lake is in southwestern Oregon, which is further north than central
      California.


      Based on this information, Lake Yosemite in California is geographically south
      of Lost Creek Lake in Oregon.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**. Lake Yosemite, CA is not located north of
      Lost Creek Lake, OR.'

      \ (where Lake Centennial is located) is approximately at latitude 39.2\xB0 N.\n\
      \   - Rondout Reservoir, New York, is approximately at latitude 41.8\xB0 N.\n\
      \n4. **Compare the Latitudes**: The latitude of Rondout Reservoir is higher\
      \ than that of Lake Centennial, meaning it is further north.\n\nTherefore, based\
      \ on the latitudinal comparison:\n\nNO, Lake Centennial in Maryland is not located\
      \ north of Rondout Reservoir in New York."
    e8af90ff-0e4a-4f9d-a32a-5235a75bbcb2: "To determine if Lake Centennial in Maryland\
      \ is located north of Rondout Reservoir in New York, we need to compare the\
      \ latitudes of both locations.\n\n1. **Identify the location of Lake Centennial,\
      \ MD:** Lake Centennial is located in Ellicott City, Maryland.\n\n2. **Identify\
      \ the location of Rondout Reservoir, NY:** Rondout Reservoir is located in Sullivan\
      \ and Ulster counties in New York.\n\n3. **Determine the latitude of each location:**\n\
      \   - Ellicott City, MD (where Lake Centennial is located) is approximately\
      \ at a latitude of 39.2673\xB0 N.\n   - Rondout Reservoir, NY is approximately\
      \ at a latitude of 41.7500\xB0 N.\n\n4. **Compare the latitudes:** Since 39.2673\xB0\
      \ N (Lake Centennial) is less than 41.7500\xB0 N (Rondout Reservoir), Lake Centennial\
      \ is located south of Rondout Reservoir.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer\
      \ to the question is: NO."
