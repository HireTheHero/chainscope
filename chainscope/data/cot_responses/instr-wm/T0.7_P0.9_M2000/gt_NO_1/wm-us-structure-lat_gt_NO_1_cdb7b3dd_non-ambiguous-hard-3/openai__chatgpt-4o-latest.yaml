      - Santa Barbara is a coastal city in southern California, situated along the
      Pacific Ocean, northwest of Los Angeles.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Don Pedro Reservoir**

      - Don Pedro Reservoir is located in Tuolumne County, in the Sierra Nevada foothills
      of central California.

      - It lies east of Modesto and west of Yosemite National Park.


      **Step 3: Compare the relative positions**

      - Santa Barbara is located to the south of central California.

      - Don Pedro Reservoir is located in central California, in the Sierra foothills,
      which is geographically north of Santa Barbara.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Santa Barbara is south of Don Pedro Reservoir, that means Our Lady of
      Sorrows Church is also south of Don Pedro Reservoir.
