      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas

      - Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma

      - Waco is in the central part of Texas


      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and both cities are in roughly the central
      parts of their respective states, Oklahoma City (and thus the Cathedral) would
      be north of Lake Waco.


      Therefore, Lake Waco is NOT north of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual
      Help. The Cathedral is north of Lake Waco.

      - Lake Martin is a reservoir located in central Alabama.

      - The Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Alabama and Tennessee.

      - Tennessee is located directly north of Alabama.

      - Knoxville is in eastern Tennessee.


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations.

      - Lake Martin is in central Alabama.

      - Knoxville is in eastern Tennessee, which is north of Alabama.


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      - Since Tennessee is north of Alabama, and Knoxville is well within Tennessee
      (not at its southern border), while Lake Martin is well within Alabama (not
      at its northern border), Knoxville must be north of Lake Martin.

      - Therefore, Lake Martin must be south of the Cathedral in Knoxville.


      NO - Lake Martin, AL is not located north of the Cathedral of the Most Sacred
      Heart of Jesus in Knoxville, Tennessee. It is located south of it.'

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Utah is located directly north of Arizona in the United States.


      Step 3: Since Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona and UCCU Center is in Utah, and
      Utah is north of Arizona, it''s very likely that the UCCU Center is north of

      is in Arizona, and regardless of its exact location within Arizona, any point
      in Utah would be north of it based on the geographical arrangement of these

      - UCCU Center is in Utah (specifically in Orem, Utah), which means it''s somewhere
      in Utah.


      Step 4: Apply the north-south relationship.

      - Since Utah is north of Arizona, and Black Canyon Lake is in Arizona while
      UCCU Center is in Utah, Black Canyon Lake must be south of UCCU Center.

      - For Black Canyon Lake to be north of UCCU Center, it would need to be either

      Dakota. It''s formed by the Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.


      2) Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota (MN).


      To determine their relative positions, I need to consider their states:

      - Nebraska is south of South Dakota

      - Minnesota is north of Nebraska and east of South Dakota


      Since Lewis and Clark Lake is on the Nebraska-South Dakota border, and Minnesota
      is north of Nebraska, the Star Lite Motel in Minnesota would be located north
      of Lewis and Clark Lake.


      Therefore, Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is NOT located north of Star Lite Motel,
      MN. It''s the opposite - Star Lite Motel, MN is north of Lewis and Clark Lake,
      NE.

      in Nebraska


      Step 4: Check if there are any unusual geographic features.

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is on the Nebraska-South Dakota border

      - Even at Nebraska''s northernmost point (the border with South Dakota), it
      would still be south of most points in Minnesota


      NO - Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is not located north of Star Lite Motel, MN. Minnesota
      is generally north of Nebraska, so the motel in Minnesota would be north of

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Carson Mansion is in Eureka, California

      - Swift Reservoir is in Washington state


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - California is a state on the west coast of the US, south of Washington state

      - Washington is the northernmost state on the west coast of the continental
      US


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Any location in California would be south of Washington state

      - Since Carson Mansion is in California, it must be south of Swift Reservoir
      which is in Washington


      Step 4: Confirm the north-south relationship.

      - North means higher latitude

      - South means lower latitude

      - Washington has higher latitude than California

      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) Salmon Falls Dam is located in Idaho (ID).

      2) Oxbow Dam is located in Oregon (OR).

      3) To determine their relative positions, I need to consider their geographic
      coordinates.


      Salmon Falls Dam is located on the Salmon Falls Creek in southern Idaho, near
      the Nevada border. Idaho is generally north of Nevada.


      Oxbow Dam is located on the Snake River along the Oregon-Idaho border. The Snake
      River forms part of the border between these states, with Oregon to the west
      and Idaho to the east.


      Given the geography of the region:

      - Southern Idaho (where Salmon Falls Dam is located) is in the southern portion
      of the state

      - The Oregon-Idaho border (where Oxbow Dam is located) runs along the western
      side of Idaho

      - The Snake River and its dams in this region are in the western part of Idaho
      and eastern Oregon


      Based on these geographic relationships, Salmon Falls Dam in southern Idaho
      would be south of Oxbow Dam, which is further north along the Snake River at
      the Oregon-Idaho border.


      NO, Salmon Falls Dam, ID is not located north of Oxbow Dam, OR.'

      if Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, TX is located north of Lake Lawtonka, OK.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Majestic Theatre is in San Antonio, Texas

      - Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma


      Step 2: Consider their general geographic positions.

      - Texas is generally south of Oklahoma

      - San Antonio is in south-central Texas

      - Oklahoma''s lakes would be somewhere within Oklahoma state


      Step 3: Think about cardinal directions.

      - For something in Texas to be north of something in Oklahoma, it would need
      to be an unusual geographic arrangement, since Texas is primarily south of Oklahoma.


      Step 4: San Antonio''s specific location.

      - San Antonio is quite far south in Texas, nowhere near the Oklahoma border.

      - It would be very unlikely for San Antonio to be north of any point in Oklahoma.


      Step 5: Conclusion based on the standard geographic arrangement of these states.

      - Since San Antonio is in south-central Texas, and Oklahoma is entirely north
      of most of Texas, the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio must be south of Lake
      Lawtonka in Oklahoma.

      Step 2: Consider their states'' relative positions.

      - Texas is generally south of Oklahoma (Texas shares its northern border with
      Oklahoma''s southern border)


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - San Antonio is in southern Texas, far from the Oklahoma border

      - Lake Lawtonka is in southwestern Oklahoma (near Lawton)


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Since San Antonio is in southern Texas, and Texas is already south of Oklahoma,
      San Antonio must be south of any point in Oklahoma, including Lake Lawtonka.

      - Therefore, the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio cannot be north of Lake Lawtonka.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both structures.

      - Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Rockport Reservoir is in Utah (UT)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Arizona and Utah.

      - Utah is directly north of Arizona in the western United States


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - Navajo Generating Station was located near Page, Arizona, in the northern
      part of Arizona

      - Rockport Reservoir is in Summit County, Utah, in the northern part of Utah


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Even though Navajo Generating Station is in northern Arizona, it is still
      south of most of Utah

      - Rockport Reservoir being in northern Utah places it well north of the Arizona
      border


      Step 5: Make the final determination.

      - Since Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona, which is south of Utah, and
      Rockport Reservoir is in northern Utah, the generating station must be south

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Navajo Lake is in New Mexico (NM)

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      Colorado is directly north of New Mexico in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within their states.

      - Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado border

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is in north-central Colorado, near Boulder


      Step 4: Compare their specific latitudes.

      - Navajo Lake is located very close to the Colorado-New Mexico border, in the
      northern part of NM

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is in the central part of Colorado, not in the southern
      portion of the state


      Step 5: Make the comparison.

      Since Colorado is north of New Mexico, and Barker Meadow Reservoir is not in
      the extreme southern part of Colorado, while Navajo Lake is in the northern
      part of New Mexico, Barker Meadow Reservoir would be north of Navajo Lake.


      NO - Navajo Lake, NM is not located north of Barker Meadow Reservoir, CO. It''s

      which is west of Boulder in north-central Colorado.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - New Mexico is generally south of Colorado, as Colorado''s southern border
      connects to New Mexico''s northern border.

      - Navajo Lake is in the northwestern part of New Mexico, close to the Colorado
      border.

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is in north-central Colorado, relatively far from
      the New Mexico border.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Since Navajo Lake is in northern New Mexico (near the Colorado border), and
      Barker Meadow Reservoir is in north-central Colorado (well within Colorado''s
      boundaries), Barker Meadow Reservoir would be further north.

      - Therefore, Navajo Lake would be south of Barker Meadow Reservoir, not north

      in Maryland is located north of Rondout Reservoir in New York.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      New York is located north of Maryland in the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      Since New York is north of Maryland, any location in Maryland would typically
      be south of locations in New York (with potential rare exceptions for unusual
      border configurations).


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Lake Centennial is in Maryland (MD), which means it''s in a state that''s south
      of New York.

      Rondout Reservoir is in New York (NY), which means it''s in a state that''s
      north of Maryland.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Lake Centennial is in Maryland (south) and Rondout Reservoir is in New
      York (north), Lake Centennial must be south of Rondout Reservoir, not north
      of it.


      NO, Lake Centennial (Maryland) is not located north of Rondout Reservoir (New
      York).'

      Step 1: Let me identify where Lake Centennial in Maryland is located.

      Lake Centennial is in Columbia, Howard County, Maryland, which is in the central
      part of Maryland.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Rondout Reservoir is located.

      Rondout Reservoir is in the Catskill region of New York State, in Ulster and
      Sullivan counties.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      Maryland is south of New York State in the United States. Since Lake Centennial
      is in Maryland and Rondout Reservoir is in New York, Lake Centennial must be
      south of Rondout Reservoir.


      Step 4: Answer the specific question about whether Lake Centennial is north
      of Rondout Reservoir.

      Since Lake Centennial is in Maryland (south) and Rondout Reservoir is in New
      York (north), Lake Centennial cannot be north of Rondout Reservoir.
