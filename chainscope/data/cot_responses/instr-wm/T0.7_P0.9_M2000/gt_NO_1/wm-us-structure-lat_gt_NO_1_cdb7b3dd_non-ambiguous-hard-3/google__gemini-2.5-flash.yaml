      Now, we need to determine their relative positions.


      *   San Antonio, TX is in south-central Texas.

      *   Lawton, OK is in southwestern Oklahoma.


      If you draw a line directly north from San Antonio, TX, it would pass through
      central Texas and then into Oklahoma, well south of Lawton. Conversely, if you
      draw a line directly south from Lawton, OK, it would pass through Oklahoma and
      then into north-central Texas.


      Therefore, San Antonio, TX, and specifically the Majestic Theatre, is located
      significantly south of Lake Lawtonka, OK.
