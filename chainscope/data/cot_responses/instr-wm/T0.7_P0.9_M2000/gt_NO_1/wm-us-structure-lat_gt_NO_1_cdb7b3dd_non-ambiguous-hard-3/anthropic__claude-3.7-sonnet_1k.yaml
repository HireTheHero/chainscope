    007863ca-8c00-4522-b827-bed051bb9f3d: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of South Holston Lake in Tennessee and the Basilica and National Shrine
      of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio.


      First, let me think about their general locations:

      - South Holston Lake is in Tennessee (TN), which is in the southeastern United
      States

      - The Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson,
      Ohio (OH), which is in the northeastern/midwestern United States


      To determine which is further north, I need to compare their latitudes:


      Tennessee is generally south of Ohio in the United States. Ohio borders Lake
      Erie to the north and is much further north than Tennessee, which borders Alabama,
      Mississippi, and Georgia to its south.


      North Jackson, Ohio would be in the northeastern part of Ohio, making it quite
      far north.

      South Holston Lake in Tennessee would likely be in the northeastern part of
      Tennessee (given the name "South" Holston suggests it''s the southern part of
      something called Holston), but even northern Tennessee is still south of Ohio.


      Given these geographical facts, South Holston Lake in Tennessee would be south
      of the Basilica in North Jackson, Ohio. Therefore, South Holston Lake is NOT
      located north of the Basilica.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two locations by considering their states and
      regions.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations.

      - South Holston Lake is in Tennessee (TN)

      - The Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson,
      Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Ohio is significantly north of Tennessee on the map

      - North Jackson is in northeastern Ohio, further reinforcing its northern position

      - Even the northernmost parts of Tennessee are still south of most of Ohio


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Ohio is north of Tennessee, the Basilica in North Jackson, Ohio would
      be north of South Holston Lake in Tennessee.


      NO, South Holston Lake is not located north of the Basilica and National Shrine
      of Our Lady of Lebanon.'

      I need to figure out which one is further north (has a higher latitude).


      Tennessee is generally south of Ohio in the United States. Tennessee is in the
      southeastern US, while Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Since South Holston Lake is in Tennessee, and the Basilica and National Shrine
      of Our Lady of Lebanon is in Ohio, it''s very likely that the South Holston
      Lake is south of (not north of) the Basilica.


      To be more precise:

      - South Holston Lake is located in northeastern Tennessee, near the Virginia
      border

      - North Jackson, Ohio is in northeastern Ohio


      Even though South Holston Lake is in the northern part of Tennessee, Ohio is

      South Holston Lake is in northeastern Tennessee, near the Virginia border.

      North Jackson, Ohio is in northeastern Ohio.

      Even though South Holston Lake is in the northern part of Tennessee, Ohio''s

      1. South Holston Lake, Tennessee

      2. Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon in North Jackson, Ohio


      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A location with a higher latitude is further north.


      First, let me think about the general geography:

      - Tennessee is generally south of Ohio in the United States

      - Ohio is in the northern part of the US, bordering Canada (via Lake Erie)

      - Tennessee is more in the southern/mid-section of the US


      Based on this general knowledge, I would expect that a location in Tennessee
      would be south of a location in Ohio, meaning Tennessee would have a lower latitude
      than Ohio.


      So my reasoning suggests that South Holston Lake, TN would be south of the Basilica
      in North Jackson, OH, not north of it.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO - South Holston Lake is not located north
      of the Basilica.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions

      - South Holston Lake is in Tennessee (TN)

      - The Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is in North Jackson,
      Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the general north-south arrangement of these states.

      - Ohio is in the northern United States, bordering Lake Erie

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States, significantly south
      of Ohio


      Step 3: Based on this geographical relationship, we can determine that:

      - Locations in Tennessee are generally south of locations in Ohio

      - North Jackson, Ohio would have a higher latitude (more northerly position)
      than South Holston Lake, Tennessee


      Therefore, South Holston Lake, TN is NOT located north of the Basilica and National

      Corpus Christi is a city located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern
      part of the state.


      Mountain Creek Lake is located in Dallas County, which is in north Texas.


      So geographically speaking, Corpus Christi (where the cathedral is located)

      ## Step 2: Locate Mountain Creek Lake

      Mountain Creek Lake is located in Dallas County in the northern part of Texas,

      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Texas extends from north to south, with Dallas in the northern portion of the

      Let me think about where these places are located:


      Corpus Christi is a city located on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in the southern
      part of the state. It''s in South Texas.


      Mountain Creek Lake is located in Dallas County, in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex
      area, which is in North Texas.


      Since Corpus Christi is in South Texas and Mountain Creek Lake is in North Texas,
      Corpus Christi Cathedral would be located south of Mountain Creek Lake, not
      north of it.


      Texas geography generally has:

      - North Texas (including Dallas-Fort Worth area)

      - Central Texas

      - East Texas

      - West Texas

      on the Gulf Coast in the southern part of Texas.

      - Mountain Creek Lake is located in Dallas County, in the Dallas-Fort Worth
      metroplex area in North Texas.


      Step 2: Compare the relative positions of these locations within Texas.

      - Corpus Christi is significantly south in Texas, near the Gulf of Mexico.

      - The Dallas area, where Mountain Creek Lake is located, is in North Texas.


      Step 3: Determine their north-south relationship.

      - Since Corpus Christi is in South Texas and Mountain Creek Lake is in North
      Texas, Corpus Christi Cathedral must be south of Mountain Creek Lake, not north
      of it.

      (Dallas area), Corpus Christi Cathedral would be SOUTH of Mountain Creek Lake,
      not north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      geographic locations of these two places in Texas.


      Step 1: Identify where Corpus Christi Cathedral is located.

      Corpus Christi Cathedral is in Corpus Christi, Texas, which is a city located

      Step 2: Identify where Mountain Creek Lake is located.

      Mountain Creek Lake is located in Dallas County in North Texas, in the Dallas-Fort

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Texas extends from north to south, with the Dallas area (where Mountain Creek
      Lake is) being significantly further north in the state than Corpus Christi.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their positions.

      Since Corpus Christi is in South Texas and Mountain Creek Lake is in North Texas,
      Corpus Christi Cathedral is located SOUTH of Mountain Creek Lake, not north
      of it.

      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.
      Generally speaking, places with higher latitude are more northern.


      I know that Virginia is north of North Carolina geographically. Virginia borders
      North Carolina along its southern border, which means Virginia is north of North
      Carolina.


      Since the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is in North Carolina, and the Paramount
      Theater is in Charlottesville, Virginia, we can reasonably conclude that the
      Paramount Theater is north of the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center (not the
      other way around).


      So the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is NOT north of the Paramount Theater.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these two
      venues.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Paramount Theater is in Charlottesville, Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located directly north of North Carolina. The entire state of Virginia
      is positioned above North Carolina on a map.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific venues.

      Since Charlottesville, VA is in Virginia, and Charlotte (where the Blumenthal
      Performing Arts Center is located) is in North Carolina, the Paramount Theater
      must be north of the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center.


      Therefore, the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is NOT north of the Paramount
      Theater - it''s the other way around.

      First, let''s think about the states themselves:

      - North Carolina is south of Virginia

      - Virginia is north of North Carolina


      This gives us a general idea, but I should look at the specific cities to be

      - Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is in Charlotte, NC (based on my knowledge)

      - Paramount Theater is in Charlottesville, VA

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - KS (Kansas) is a state in the central United States

      - MN (Minnesota) is a state in the northern part of the central United States


      Generally speaking, Minnesota is north of Kansas. Minnesota borders Canada to

      Now, for the specific lakes:

      - Tuttle Creek Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - Lac qui Parle is in Minnesota (MN)


      Since Minnesota is generally north of Kansas, and these lakes are within their

      2) Minnesota is located in the northern central United States, bordering Canada.


      3) Kansas is located in the central United States, significantly south of Minnesota.


      4) Since Tuttle Creek Lake is in Kansas and Lac qui Parle is in Minnesota, we
      can determine their relative positions based on their states.


      5) Given that Minnesota is north of Kansas geographically, Lac qui Parle (in
      MN) would be north of Tuttle Creek Lake (in KS).

      Specifically:

      - Tuttle Creek Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - Lac qui Parle is in Minnesota (MN)


      Since Minnesota is north of Kansas, Lac qui Parle (in MN) should be north of

      1. Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is
      in the northeastern part of the US, but it''s south of New York state. Specifically,
      Shofuso is in Philadelphia, which is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      2. Boldt Castle is in New York (NY). New York state is north of Pennsylvania.

      New York state near the Canadian border.


      So geographically:

      - Philadelphia, PA is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Boldt Castle is in the northern part of New York state

      Utah is generally south of Montana, since Montana borders Canada in the north,

      The general geography is:

      - Utah is in the southwestern US


      Since Causey Reservoir is in Utah (UT) and Hebgen Lake is in Montana (MT), and

      - Montana is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - Utah is located in the southwestern United States, significantly south of
      Montana


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      Since Montana (where Hebgen Lake is) lies entirely north of Utah (where Causey
      Reservoir is), it follows that Hebgen Lake must be north of Causey Reservoir.


      NO, Causey Reservoir, UT is not located north of Hebgen Lake, MT. It is located

      - Utah (UT) is a state in the western United States

      - Montana (MT) is also a western state, but it''s located north of Utah

      - Montana shares a border with Canada to the north, while Utah is further south


      Since Montana is generally north of Utah, it would be expected that a lake in
      Montana (Hebgen Lake) would be north of a reservoir in Utah (Causey Reservoir).


      Montana is directly north of Utah (though they don''t share a border - Idaho
      is between them), so a body of water in Montana would almost certainly be north
      of one in Utah.

      - Hebgen Lake is in Montana (MT)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Utah and Montana.

      - Montana is located north of Utah

      - These states don''t directly border each other (Idaho is between them)

      - Montana extends along the Canadian border, while Utah is farther south


      Step 3: Make a logical deduction about the locations.

      Since Montana is entirely north of Utah, any body of water in Montana (including
      Hebgen Lake) would be north of any body of water in Utah (including Causey Reservoir).

      (UT)

      2) However, I need to check if their specific locations might change this relationship

      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Even though Causey Reservoir is in northern Utah and Hebgen Lake is in southern

      Anderson Ranch Dam is located in Idaho (ID).

      Little Goose Dam is located in Washington state (WA).

      Idaho is generally south of Washington state, as Washington is the northernmost
      state in the contiguous United States (bordering Canada), while Idaho is below

      Given that Washington state is north of Idaho, and Little Goose Dam is in Washington
      while Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho, Little Goose Dam should be north of Anderson

      borders Canada to the north, while Idaho is positioned below Washington.


      Step 2: Consider the specific dam locations.

      Anderson Ranch Dam is located in Idaho (ID) on the South Fork of the Boise River
      in the southern part of the state.

      Little Goose Dam is located in Washington state (WA) on the Snake River in the

      Since Washington is north of Idaho, and these dams aren''t located near the

      - Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Texas and Oklahoma.

      Oklahoma is directly north of Texas. The entire state of Oklahoma is north of
      Texas.


      Step 3: Since Lady Bird Lake is in Texas and Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma, and
      Oklahoma is north of Texas, Lady Bird Lake would be south of Oologah Lake.


      Therefore, Lady Bird Lake, TX is NOT located north of Oologah Lake, OK. It is

      Step 1: Determine the locations of both lakes.

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, Texas, in the central part of Texas.

      - Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma borders Texas to the north.

      - Texas is positioned south of Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since Lady Bird Lake is in Texas and Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma, and Oklahoma
      is positioned north of Texas, Lady Bird Lake must be south of Oologah Lake.


      NO, Lady Bird Lake, TX is not located north of Oologah Lake, OK. It is located

      if Lady Bird Lake in Texas is located north of Oologah Lake in Oklahoma.


      To answer this, I need to consider the relative positions of these two lakes.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Texas (TX)

      - Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is north of Texas since Oklahoma borders Texas
      on its northern side.


      Now, let''s be more specific about the locations:

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, which is in central Texas

      - Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma


      Given that Oklahoma is generally north of Texas, and Lady Bird Lake is in central
      Texas while Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma, it''s very likely that
      Lady Bird Lake is south of Oologah Lake, not north.


      So my reasoning indicates that Lady Bird Lake, TX is NOT located north of Oologah
      Lake, OK. Rather, it''s south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative
      north-south positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lady Bird Lake is in Austin, Texas (central Texas)

      - Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma borders Texas on Texas''s northern boundary

      - Generally, Oklahoma is north of Texas


      Step 3: Analyze the specific locations within their states.

      - Austin is in central Texas, not near the northern border

      - Oologah Lake is in northeastern Oklahoma, well within Oklahoma''s borders


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these facts.

      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and Lady Bird Lake is in central Texas (not
      even in northern Texas), Lady Bird Lake must be south of Oologah Lake.

      2. Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma. Let me try to be more specific about its location

      - Oologah Lake is located in northeastern Oklahoma, near Tulsa.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas along their shared border.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and Oologah Lake is in Oklahoma while Lady
      Bird Lake is in Texas, Oologah Lake must be north of Lady Bird Lake (not the

      2. First, let''s think about the states. Illinois (IL) is generally south of
      Wisconsin (WI) as Wisconsin borders the northern part of Illinois.


      3. Chicago is a city in northeastern Illinois, located on the southwestern shore
      of Lake Michigan.


      4. Kewaunee is a city in Wisconsin, which should be on the eastern side of Wisconsin,
      likely also near Lake Michigan.


      5. If we think about the general geography, since Wisconsin is north of Illinois,
      a location in Wisconsin (Kewaunee) would typically be north of a location in

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Illinois and Wisconsin.

      - Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois

      - Both states border Lake Michigan on their eastern sides


      Step 3: Determine more specific locations.

      - Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, on Lake Michigan''s southwestern
      shore

      - Kewaunee is on the eastern side of Wisconsin, along Lake Michigan''s western
      shore

      - Kewaunee is positioned well north of the Illinois-Wisconsin border


      Step 4: Compare the specific locations.

      First, let me consider Chicago Avenue Pumping Station:

      - It''s in Chicago, Illinois

      - Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois, on the southwestern shore of
      Lake Michigan


      Next, Kewaunee Power Station:

      - It''s in Wisconsin

      - Wisconsin is located north of Illinois

      - Kewaunee is likely on the western shore of Lake Michigan


      Generally speaking, Wisconsin is north of Illinois. However, I need to be more
      precise about these specific locations.


      Kewaunee is a city in Wisconsin that''s on the western shore of Lake Michigan,
      approximately halfway up Wisconsin''s eastern border. It''s significantly north
      of the Illinois-Wisconsin border.


      Chicago is at the very northeastern part of Illinois, right on the Illinois-Wisconsin
      border.


      Given Wisconsin''s position north of Illinois, and Kewaunee being well into
      Wisconsin (not just at the border), Kewaunee Power Station would be north of
      Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, not the other way around.</think>I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two structures:


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in Chicago, Illinois, located in the northeastern
      part of Illinois along Lake Michigan.

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, located on the western shore
      of Lake Michigan.


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois.


      Step 3: Examine the specific locations within their states.

      - Chicago is at the northeastern corner of Illinois.

      - Kewaunee is approximately halfway up Wisconsin''s eastern shoreline, well
      north of the Illinois-Wisconsin border.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Even though Chicago is in the northern part of Illinois, Kewaunee is much
      further north in Wisconsin.

      - Therefore, Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is south of Kewaunee Power Station,
      not north of it.

      (ND).


      3) Generally, North Dakota is north of South Dakota (as their names suggest

      4) Since Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota, and Garrison Dam is in North Dakota,
      it''s likely that Big Bend Dam is south of Garrison Dam.


      5) However, I should be careful about making assumptions based solely on state

      South Dakota could potentially be north of a location in southern North Dakota.


      6) But given the information that Big Bend Dam is in SD and Garrison Dam is

      the most reasonable conclusion is that Big Bend Dam is south of Garrison Dam,
      not north of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two dams.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each dam is located.

      - Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Garrison Dam is in North Dakota (ND)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - North Dakota is located directly north of South Dakota

      - The state names themselves reflect this north-south relationship


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the dams.

      - Since Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota (the southern state)

      2. Specifically, it''s asking if Big Bend Dam is located north of Garrison Dam.

      3. To answer this, I need to consider the general geography of North Dakota
      and South Dakota.

      4. North Dakota (ND) is located north of South Dakota (SD) - that''s why they
      have these names.

      5. Generally speaking, locations in North Dakota tend to be north of locations
      in South Dakota.

      6. Since Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota and Garrison Dam is in North Dakota,
      it''s likely that Big Bend Dam is south of Garrison Dam, not north of it.

      1) I need to determine the locations of two dams: Big Bend Dam in South Dakota
      (SD) and Garrison Dam in North Dakota (ND).


      2) First, let''s consider the states: South Dakota is south of North Dakota.
      The abbreviations SD and ND stand for South Dakota and North Dakota respectively.
      North Dakota is the more northern state of the two.


      3) Now, to determine if Big Bend Dam is north of Garrison Dam, I need to know
      their specific locations within their respective states.


      4) Big Bend Dam is on the Missouri River in South Dakota. Garrison Dam is also
      on the Missouri River in North Dakota.


      5) Since the Missouri River generally flows from northwest to southeast in this
      region, and North Dakota is north of South Dakota, it would be expected that
      a dam on the Missouri River in North Dakota (Garrison Dam) would be north of
      a dam on the Missouri River in South Dakota (Big Bend Dam).


      6) Therefore, Big Bend Dam in SD is likely south of Garrison Dam in ND, not
      north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic

      - Big Bend Dam is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Garrison Dam is in North Dakota (ND)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      North Dakota is located directly north of South Dakota (as their names suggest).


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations of the dams.

      Both dams are built on the Missouri River, which flows from northwest to southeast
      through these states. The river first passes through North Dakota before continuing
      into South Dakota.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geography.

      Since North Dakota is north of South Dakota, and the Missouri River flows southward
      through these states, Garrison Dam in North Dakota would be located north of
      Big Bend Dam in South Dakota.


      NO, Big Bend Dam is not located north of Garrison Dam. It is located south of

      First, let me recall the general geography:

      - North Dakota (ND) is north of South Dakota (SD)

      - So generally, locations in ND are north of locations in SD


      However, I need to be careful because the specific locations of these dams within
      their respective states could change their relative positions.


      Big Bend Dam is on the Missouri River in South Dakota.

      Garrison Dam is on the Missouri River in North Dakota.


      Since North Dakota is north of South Dakota, and both dams are on the same river
      (Missouri River) which flows from north to south through these states, it''s
      very likely that the Garrison Dam in ND is north of the Big Bend Dam in SD.

      ND. Instead, Garrison Dam, ND would be north of Big Bend Dam, SD.</think>I need
      to determine the relative locations of these two dams.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each dam is located.

      South Dakota)


      Step 3: Both dams are on the Missouri River, which flows from northwest to southeast
      through these states.

      - The Missouri River flows from North Dakota into South Dakota

      - Dams on this river generally follow this north-to-south sequence


      Step 4: Based on this geographical arrangement, Garrison Dam in North Dakota
      would be located north of Big Bend Dam in South Dakota.


      NO. Big Bend Dam, SD is not located north of Garrison Dam, ND. It''s the opposite

      1. I need to determine if Arnold Engineering Development Complex in Tennessee
      is located north of Griffy Lake in Indiana.

      2. This requires knowing the relative geographic locations of these two places.


      First, let me think about the states. Tennessee (TN) is south of Indiana (IN).
      Generally speaking, locations in Tennessee would be south of locations in Indiana.


      Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, which means it''s likely
      to be south of anything in Indiana.


      Griffy Lake is in Indiana, which means it''s likely to be north of anything
      in Tennessee.


      So based on the general geographic relationship between these two states, Arnold
      Engineering Development Complex in Tennessee would be south of Griffy Lake in
      Indiana, not north of it.


      Therefore, the answer should be NO - Arnold Engineering Development Complex,
      TN is not located north of Griffy Lake, IN.</think>To answer whether Arnold
      Engineering Development Complex, TN is located north of Griffy Lake, IN, I need
      to determine the relative geographic positions of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are found.

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Griffy Lake is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Indiana is positioned north of Tennessee on the map


      Step 3: Since the locations are in their respective states, we can determine
      their relative positions.

      - Any location in Tennessee would generally be south of locations in Indiana

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex would therefore be south of Griffy
      Lake


      NO - Arnold Engineering Development Complex, TN is not located north of Griffy
      Lake, IN.'

      Arnold Engineering Development Complex is located in Arnold Air Force Base in

      Griffy Lake is in Indiana, which is north of Tennessee. Specifically, Griffy

      Since Indiana is north of Tennessee, and Griffy Lake is in Indiana while the
      Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, it''s very likely that
      Griffy Lake is north of the Arnold Engineering Development Complex.


      Therefore, the Arnold Engineering Development Complex is NOT north of Griffy
      Lake - it''s south of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee (TN)

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of US states.

      - Indiana is a state in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is a state in the Southeastern United States

      - Indiana is positioned directly north of Tennessee in the US map


      Step 3: More specifically, Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Coffee

      Step 4: Since Indiana is entirely north of Tennessee on the map of the United
      States, any location in Indiana (including Griffy Lake) would be north of any

      if Arnold Engineering Development Complex in Tennessee is located north of Griffy
      Lake in Indiana.


      To answer this, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of both places

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south positions)


      Let me think about the states first:

      - TN = Tennessee, which is in the southeastern United States

      - IN = Indiana, which is in the midwestern United States


      Generally speaking, Indiana is north of Tennessee. Indiana borders the southern
      shore of Lake Michigan in the north, while Tennessee is further south, bordering
      states like Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.


      So if Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, and Griffy Lake
      is in Indiana, then Arnold Engineering Development Complex would likely be south
      of Griffy Lake (not north).


      Let me double-check this by thinking about the general north-south arrangement
      of these states:

      - Indiana is north of Tennessee

      - Places in Tennessee would generally be south of places in Indiana


      Therefore, Arnold Engineering Development Complex in TN would be south of Griffy
      Lake in IN, not north of it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Tennessee (TN) is located in the southeastern United States, while Indiana (IN)
      is in the midwestern United States. Looking at a map of the US, Indiana is positioned
      north of Tennessee.


      Step 2: Consider the general latitude relationship.

      Since Indiana is entirely north of Tennessee geographically, any location in
      Indiana would be north of any location in Tennessee. This is because Indiana''s
      southern border is at a higher latitude than Tennessee''s northern border.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      Arnold Engineering Development Complex is in Tennessee, while Griffy Lake is
      in Indiana. Based on the states'' positions, Griffy Lake must be north of the
      Arnold Engineering Development Complex.


      NO. Arnold Engineering Development Complex, TN is not located north of Griffy

      1. Find the location of St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis, Maryland

      2. Find the location of Big Pink in New York

      3. Determine which one is further north (has a higher latitude)


      St. Anne''s Church is in Annapolis, Maryland. Annapolis is located in the central
      part of Maryland, on the Chesapeake Bay.


      "Big Pink" is a nickname for a house in Saugerties, New York where Bob Dylan
      and The Band recorded music in the late 1960s. Saugerties is in upstate New
      York in the Hudson Valley region.


      Geographically:

      - Maryland is south of New York state

      - Annapolis is in the central part of Maryland

      - Saugerties is in the southern part of New York state, but New York state as

      - St. Anne''s Church is in Annapolis, Maryland

      - Big Pink is in Saugerties, New York (a famous house where Bob Dylan and The
      Band recorded music)


      Step 2: Consider their geographical positions.

      - Maryland is a state south of New York

      - Annapolis is in central Maryland

      - Saugerties is in upstate New York in the Hudson Valley region


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Locations in New York state are generally north of locations in Maryland

      - Even southern New York locations are typically north of central Maryland locations


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since New York is north of Maryland, Big Pink in Saugerties, NY is north of
      St. Anne''s Church in Annapolis, MD.

      step:


      1. I need to determine the geographic locations of two places: Atlanta Symphony
      Hall in Georgia (GA) and Patoka Lake in Indiana (IN).


      2. First, let''s consider Atlanta Symphony Hall. Atlanta is the capital city
      of Georgia, which is a state in the southeastern United States. Georgia is generally
      in the southern part of the US.


      3. Next, let''s consider Patoka Lake. This is in Indiana (IN), which is a state
      in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States. Indiana is generally
      north of Georgia.


      4. In terms of north-south positioning in the US, Indiana is north of Georgia.
      Cities in Indiana would typically be north of cities in Georgia.


      5. Therefore, Atlanta Symphony Hall in GA would be south of Patoka Lake in IN,
      not north of it.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions

      - Atlanta is in Georgia (GA), which is a southeastern state

      - Patoka Lake is in Indiana (IN), which is a midwestern state


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes

      - Indiana is significantly north of Georgia on the US map

      - All locations in Indiana are generally north of major cities in Georgia


      Step 3: Specifically about these locations

      - Atlanta is located in northern Georgia

      - Patoka Lake is in southern Indiana

      - Even though Atlanta is in northern Georgia, the entire state of Georgia is
      still south of Indiana


      Therefore, Atlanta Symphony Hall (GA) is located SOUTH of Patoka Lake (IN),
      not north of it.

      2. Atlanta is the capital city of Georgia, which is a state in the southeastern
      United States.


      3. Indiana is a state in the midwestern United States, north of Georgia.


      4. Since Indiana is north of Georgia, and Atlanta is in Georgia while Patoka
      Lake is in Indiana, we can determine that Atlanta Symphony Hall is south of
      Patoka Lake.


      5. The question asks if Atlanta Symphony Hall is north of Patoka Lake, which
      would be the opposite of what we just determined.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to consider the geographic locations of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Atlanta Symphony Hall is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United
      States.

      - Patoka Lake is in Indiana (IN), which is in the midwestern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Indiana is significantly north of Georgia on the U.S. map.

      - Indiana shares a border with Michigan and Lake Michigan to its north, and
      Kentucky to its south.

      - Georgia is much further south, bordering Florida at its southern end.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - Since Atlanta is in Georgia (a southern state) and Patoka Lake is in Indiana
      (a more northern state), Atlanta Symphony Hall must be south of Patoka Lake.

      - Therefore, Atlanta Symphony Hall is NOT north of Patoka Lake.

      Patoka Lake is in Indiana, which is in the Midwest region of the United States.
      Indiana is north of Georgia.

      Indiana''s southern border is at approximately 37.8 degrees north latitude,
      while Georgia''s northern border is around 35 degrees north latitude.


      Atlanta is not in the northernmost part of Georgia - it''s roughly in the northern
      third of the state but still well within Georgia. Even so, Atlanta would be
      south of virtually any point in Indiana, including Patoka Lake.


      So Patoka Lake in Indiana is north of Atlanta Symphony Hall in Georgia.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two locations by comparing

      - Patoka Lake is in Indiana (IN)

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Georgia is in the Southeast region of the United States


      Step 2: Compare their general north-south positions.

      - Indiana is significantly north of Georgia on the US map

      - All of Indiana is north of Georgia''s northern border


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Atlanta is located in northern Georgia, but still well within the state

      - Patoka Lake is in southern Indiana, but still well within Indiana

      - Even the southernmost points of Indiana are north of the northernmost points
      of Georgia


      Since Indiana is entirely north of Georgia, and Patoka Lake is in Indiana while
      Atlanta Symphony Hall is in Georgia, Patoka Lake must be north of Atlanta Symphony
      Hall.


      NO (Atlanta Symphony Hall is NOT north of Patoka Lake; rather, Patoka Lake is

      Now let''s specifically look at these two lakes:


      Lake Yosemite is in California, likely in or near Yosemite National Park in

      Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon. I don''t have the exact coordinates, but since
      it''s in Oregon, it would typically be north of most places in California.


      Given the general geography of the US west coast states, where Oregon is north

      Since Oregon is north of California, and Lake Yosemite is in California while

      To answer this question, I need to analyze the locations of these two lakes
      based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each lake is located.

      - Lake Yosemite is in California (CA)

      - Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between California and Oregon.

      - Oregon is directly north of California along the west coast of the United
      States

      - California shares its northern border with Oregon


      Step 3: Compare the locations of the lakes.

      - Since Lake Yosemite is in California, and Lost Creek Lake is in Oregon

      - And Oregon is north of California

      - Lake Yosemite must be south of Lost Creek Lake

      Trinity Dam is in California (CA). California is a state in the western United

      Lake Merwin is in Washington (WA). Washington is also a western state, but it''s
      located north of California. Washington borders Canada to the north and Oregon

      - For something in California to be north of something in Washington would be
      unusual, as generally everything in Washington is north of everything in California


      However, I need to be precise about these specific locations. Let me think about
      the general geography:

      - Washington state is the northernmost continental US state on the west coast

      - California is further south along the west coast

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - CA is California, which is on the west coast of the US, south of Washington
      state (WA).

      - WA is Washington state, which is on the west coast of the US, north of California.


      Generally speaking, locations in Washington state tend to be north of locations

      state on the west coast of the contiguous US, while California is south of Oregon,
      which is south of Washington.


      Trinity Dam is in California (CA), so it''s in the more southern state.

      While there could theoretically be exceptions if Trinity Dam were in the extreme
      northern part of California and Lake Merwin were in the extreme southern part

      - Washington state is positioned along the northern U.S. west coast

      - California is positioned along the west coast, but significantly south of
      Washington

      - Washington is north of Oregon, which is north of California


      Step 3: Apply this geographical relationship to the specific locations.

      - Since Trinity Dam is in California, and California is south of Washington

      to determine the locations of Lake Wappapello, MO and House on the Rock, WI
      and compare their latitudes.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Lake Wappapello is in Missouri (MO)

      - House on the Rock is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Now I need to think about their relative positions in the United States:


      Missouri is generally located south of Wisconsin. Wisconsin is in the northern
      part of the United States, bordering Canada (via the Great Lakes), while Missouri
      is more centrally located in the US.


      To be more specific:

      - Wisconsin is in the Upper Midwest region

      - Missouri is in the Midwest/Central United States, but definitely south of
      Wisconsin


      Since Lake Wappapello is in Missouri and House on the Rock is in Wisconsin,
      and Missouri is south of Wisconsin, Lake Wappapello would be located SOUTH of
      House on the Rock, not north of it.</think># Is Lake Wappapello, MO located
      north of House on the Rock, WI?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations by examining
      which state is further north.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Lake Wappapello is in Missouri (MO)

      - House on the Rock is in Wisconsin (WI)


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographic positions

      - Wisconsin is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Missouri is located in the central United States, south of Wisconsin

      - Wisconsin shares its northern border with the Upper Peninsula of Michigan
      and Lake Superior

      - Missouri does not border Wisconsin directly, but is positioned below Iowa,
      which is below Wisconsin


      ## Step 3: Determine relative position

      Since Wisconsin is positioned north of Missouri in the United States, House
      on the Rock (in Wisconsin) would be north of Lake Wappapello (in Missouri).

      locations of two places: Lake Wappapello, Missouri and House on the Rock, Wisconsin.


      First, let me think about the general locations of Missouri (MO) and Wisconsin
      (WI) states:

      - Missouri is located in the central United States

      - Wisconsin is located in the upper Midwest, bordering Lake Michigan


      Geographically, Wisconsin is generally north of Missouri. Wisconsin borders
      Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and Michigan, while Missouri borders Iowa, Illinois,
      Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska.


      Now, let''s consider the specific locations:

      - Lake Wappapello is in Missouri (southeastern part of the state)

      - House on the Rock is in Wisconsin (likely in the southern part of Wisconsin
      since it''s a tourist attraction)


      Even though House on the Rock might be in southern Wisconsin, and Lake Wappapello
      might be in northern Missouri, Wisconsin is still substantially north of Missouri
      in the United States.


      Therefore, Lake Wappapello in Missouri would be SOUTH of House on the Rock in
      Wisconsin, not north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative locations of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      Missouri (MO) is located in the central United States.

      Wisconsin (WI) is located in the upper Midwest, north of Missouri.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri.

      House on the Rock is in southwestern Wisconsin (near Spring Green).


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Even though Lake Wappapello is in Missouri and House on the Rock is in Wisconsin,
      I need to be precise about their north-south relationship.

      Wisconsin is entirely north of Missouri on a map of the United States.

      Even the southernmost point of Wisconsin is north of the northernmost point
      of Missouri.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Missouri geographically, and House on the
      Rock is in Wisconsin while Lake Wappapello is in Missouri, Lake Wappapello must
      be south of House on the Rock.

      First, let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Wisconsin (WI) is in the northern part of the United States, bordering the
      Great Lakes region

      - Missouri (MO) is more southern, in the Midwest


      To answer whether Lake Wappapello, MO is north of House on the Rock, WI, I need
      to compare their latitudes.


      Generally speaking, Wisconsin is north of Missouri in the United States. Wisconsin
      is along the Canadian border area, while Missouri is more centrally located
      in the US.


      Since Lake Wappapello is in Missouri, and House on the Rock is in Wisconsin,
      it''s very likely that Lake Wappapello is SOUTH of House on the Rock, not north.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO - Lake Wappapello, MO is not located north
      of House on the Rock, WI.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states involved.

      Wisconsin (WI) is located in the northern United States, bordering Minnesota,
      Michigan, Iowa, and Illinois.

      Missouri (MO) is located in the central United States, south of Iowa and Illinois.


      Step 2: Compare the general positions of these states.

      Wisconsin is entirely north of Missouri. The northernmost point of Missouri
      doesn''t reach as far north as the southernmost point of Wisconsin.


      Step 3: Specific locations within these states.

      House on the Rock is a tourist attraction in Spring Green, Wisconsin.

      Lake Wappapello is a reservoir in southeastern Missouri.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these relative positions.

      Since Missouri is south of Wisconsin, and Lake Wappapello is in Missouri while
      House on the Rock is in Wisconsin, Lake Wappapello must be south of House on
      the Rock.

      1. Lake Wappapello, MO (Missouri)

      2. House on the Rock, WI (Wisconsin)


      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.
      If Lake Wappapello has a higher latitude than House on the Rock, then it would
      be north of it. If it has a lower latitude, then it would be south of it.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of these states:

      - Wisconsin (WI) is in the northern part of the US, bordering Canada

      - Missouri (MO) is more central/southern, below Iowa and Illinois


      Generally, Wisconsin is north of Missouri. This means that locations in Wisconsin
      tend to be north of locations in Missouri.


      House on the Rock is a tourist attraction in Wisconsin. I believe it''s in the
      southwestern part of Wisconsin.


      Lake Wappapello is a reservoir in southeastern Missouri.


      Given the general geography, it''s very likely that Lake Wappapello in Missouri
      is south of House on the Rock in Wisconsin, not north of it.


      So my answer would be NO, Lake Wappapello, MO is not located north of House
      on the Rock, WI.</think># Is Lake Wappapello, MO located north of House on the
      Rock, WI?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these locations are found.

      - Lake Wappapello is in Missouri (MO)

      - House on the Rock is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states.

      - Wisconsin is located in the northern part of the United States

      - Missouri is located south of Wisconsin, in the central United States


      Step 3: While specific locations within states can sometimes create exceptions
      to general state relationships, in this case:

      - House on the Rock is in southwestern Wisconsin

      - Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri

      - Even the northernmost parts of Missouri are generally south of Wisconsin


      Step 4: Conclusion based on geographic positioning:

      Since Missouri is south of Wisconsin, and these specific locations don''t create
      an exception to this pattern, Lake Wappapello must be south of (not north of)
      House on the Rock.

      Lake Wappapello is in Missouri (MO), which is generally in the central United

      House on the Rock is in Wisconsin (WI), which is in the northern part of the
      central United States, bordering Canada''s Great Lakes.


      Specifically:

      - Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri

      - House on the Rock is in southwestern Wisconsin, near Spring Green


      Wisconsin is north of Missouri in general. So House on the Rock (in Wisconsin)
      should be north of Lake Wappapello (in Missouri).


      Therefore, Lake Wappapello is NOT north of House on the Rock. Lake Wappapello
      is south of House on the Rock.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general positions.

      - Lake Wappapello is in Missouri (MO)

      - House on the Rock is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Wisconsin is located in the northern central US, while Missouri is located in
      the central US, south of Wisconsin.


      Step 3: More specifically, Lake Wappapello is in southeastern Missouri, while
      House on the Rock is in southwestern Wisconsin.


      Step 4: Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Missouri geographically, any location
      in Wisconsin (including House on the Rock) would be north of locations in Missouri

      Missouri (MO) is in the central United States, while Wisconsin (WI) is further
      north in the upper Midwest.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Lake Wappapello is located in southeastern Missouri.

      House on the Rock is a tourist attraction in southwestern Wisconsin.

      Given the general geography of the United States:

      - Oklahoma is north of Texas

      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      1) First, let''s identify the states: Lake Waco is in Texas, and the Cathedral
      of Our Lady of Perpetual Help is in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.


      2) Looking at the geographical arrangement of US states, Oklahoma is directly
      north of Texas along the central portion of their shared border.


      3) Waco, Texas is located in central Texas, while Oklahoma City is in the central
      part of Oklahoma.


      4) Since Oklahoma borders Texas to the north, and both cities are in the central
      parts of their respective states, Oklahoma City would be north of Waco.


      5) Therefore, Lake Waco (in Waco, Texas) would be south of the Cathedral in
      Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

      Lake Waco is a reservoir located in McLennan County, Texas, near the city of
      Waco.

      The Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.


      Now let me think about their relative positions:


      1. Texas is generally south of Oklahoma in the United States.

      2. Waco, TX is in central Texas.

      3. Oklahoma City is in central Oklahoma.


      Since Oklahoma is directly north of Texas, and both locations are in the central
      parts of their respective states, it''s very likely that Lake Waco is south
      of the Cathedral in Oklahoma City.


      To be north of something, you need to have a higher latitude. Since Lake Waco
      is in Texas (which is south of Oklahoma), it should have a lower latitude than
      the Cathedral in Oklahoma City, meaning Lake Waco is south, not north of the
      Cathedral.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations
      by examining their geographical coordinates.

      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas on a map of the United States.

      - Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma.

      - Waco is in the central part of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since Oklahoma is entirely north of central Texas, and these locations are
      in the central parts of their respective states, Lake Waco would be south of
      Oklahoma City.

      - For Lake Waco to be north of the Cathedral, it would need to have a higher

      Let me break this down:


      1. Washington Avenue Immigration Station is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2. One Commerce Plaza is in New York (NY)


      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to know their specific locations.


      Pennsylvania is generally south of New York State. New York is one of the northernmost
      states in the eastern US, while Pennsylvania is directly below it.


      However, this is a generalization, and I need to consider the specific locations.
      Let me think about where these specific buildings might be located:


      - Washington Avenue Immigration Station in PA is likely in Philadelphia, which
      is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - One Commerce Plaza in NY is likely in either New York City or possibly Albany
      (the state capital)


      New York City is in the southern part of New York State, and Albany is more
      central/northern in the state. Either way, both NYC and Albany are north of
      Philadelphia.


      Based on the general geography of the US states, a location in Pennsylvania
      would typically be south of a location in New York State.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both places and compare
      them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Washington Avenue Immigration Station is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - One Commerce Plaza is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - New York State is generally located north of Pennsylvania on a map of the
      United States.


      Step 3: Consider specific locations within these states.

      - Washington Avenue Immigration Station is likely in Philadelphia (southeast
      PA)

      - One Commerce Plaza is in Albany, NY (capital region of NY state)


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes.

      - Albany, NY is located in the eastern part of upstate New York

      - Philadelphia, PA is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Locations in upstate New York are generally north of locations in Pennsylvania


      NO - Washington Avenue Immigration Station in PA is not north of One Commerce
      Plaza in NY. It is south of it, as Pennsylvania is south of New York.'

      locations, specifically their latitudes. A location with a higher latitude is
      further north.


      3. Washington Avenue Immigration Station is in Pennsylvania (PA). I''m not entirely
      sure of its exact location, but Pennsylvania is generally south of New York
      State.


      4. One Commerce Plaza is in New York (NY). This is likely in Albany, which is
      the state capital and has a prominent office building by that name.


      5. Generally speaking, New York State is north of Pennsylvania. Albany, NY is
      in the eastern part of upstate New York, which is definitely north of Pennsylvania.


      6. Without knowing the exact coordinates, I can say that most locations in New
      York would be north of most locations in Pennsylvania, especially something
      in Albany, NY compared to something in PA.


      Based on the general geographical relationship between New York and Pennsylvania,
      and assuming One Commerce Plaza is in Albany, NY, I would conclude that Washington
      Avenue Immigration Station in PA is likely south of One Commerce Plaza in NY,
      not north.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative

      Step 2: Consider their general geographic positions.

      - One Commerce Plaza is likely in Albany, NY (the state capital), where there
      is a well-known office building by this name

      - Pennsylvania is generally located south of New York State


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - New York State, particularly Albany in upstate NY, is positioned north of
      Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, a location in Pennsylvania would be south of a location in Albany,
      NY


      NO. Washington Avenue Immigration Station in PA is not located north of One

      states, it''s likely that Lake Martin is south of the Cathedral in Knoxville.


      To be more precise: Knoxville is in the eastern part of Tennessee, near the
      North Carolina border. Lake Martin is in central Alabama.


      Given the general geography of the southeastern United States, a location in
      central Alabama would be south of a location in eastern Tennessee.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of Lake Martin,
      Alabama and the Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in Knoxville, Tennessee.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' positions.

      Tennessee is located directly north of Alabama in the United States.


      Step 2: Locate the specific places.

      - Lake Martin is in central Alabama

      - The Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus is in Knoxville, which is
      in eastern Tennessee


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Tennessee is entirely north of Alabama, and Knoxville is in Tennessee
      while Lake Martin is in Alabama, Lake Martin must be south of the Cathedral
      in Knoxville.


      If Lake Martin is south of the Cathedral, then it cannot be north of it.

      Big Hill Lake is in Kansas (KS), and Smithville Lake is in Missouri (MO).


      Let me recall the general geographic relationship between Kansas and Missouri:

      - Kansas is west of Missouri

      - They share a border that runs east-west

      - Northern parts of both states are roughly at the same latitude


      However, the specific locations of these lakes might not follow the general
      state positioning. I need to be more precise.


      Big Hill Lake is located in southeastern Kansas, in Labette County.

      Smithville Lake is located in northwestern Missouri, north of Kansas City.


      Given that Kansas City is in the northern part of the border between Kansas
      and Missouri, and Smithville Lake is north of Kansas City, while Big Hill Lake
      is in southeastern Kansas (which would be more southern), it''s likely that
      Smithville Lake is north of Big Hill Lake.


      So my reasoning suggests that Big Hill Lake, KS is NOT north of Smithville Lake,
      MO, but rather south of it.</think># Is Big Hill Lake, KS located north of Smithville

      I need to determine the relative locations of these two lakes by identifying

      - Big Hill Lake is located in southeastern Kansas (Labette County)

      - Smithville Lake is located in northwestern Missouri, north of Kansas City


      Looking at their positions:

      - Southeastern Kansas is in the lower part of the state

      - Northwestern Missouri (especially north of Kansas City) is in the upper part
      of Missouri

      - The Kansas-Missouri border runs roughly east-west


      Based on these geographical positions, Big Hill Lake in southeastern Kansas
      would be south of Smithville Lake, which is in the northern part of Missouri.

      For these specific lakes:

      - Big Hill Lake is in Kansas (KS)

      - Smithville Lake is in Missouri (MO)


      Big Hill Lake is located in southeastern Kansas, near the Kansas-Oklahoma border.
      This would place it in the southern part of Kansas.


      Smithville Lake is in northwestern Missouri, near Kansas City. This would place

      - Smithville Lake is located in northwestern Missouri, north of Kansas City.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Kansas and Missouri.

      - Kansas is west of Missouri.

      - However, the north-south relationship varies along the border.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations of these lakes.

      Kansas is typically positioned to the west of Missouri, but they''re roughly

      For the specific lakes, I need to remember:

      - Big Hill Lake would be somewhere in Kansas

      - Smithville Lake would be somewhere in Missouri


      To answer precisely, I would need to know where in their respective states these
      lakes are located.


      Smithville Lake is likely in northern Missouri, near Kansas City.

      Big Hill Lake is likely in southeastern Kansas.


      Given the geography of the states, if Smithville Lake is in northern Missouri

      First, let''s establish some basic geographic knowledge:

      - North Carolina (NC) is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is a state in the northeastern United States

      - Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina


      But I need to be specific about these two lakes, since lakes within states could
      be positioned differently than the general state positions.


      Let me think about the locations:

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina, which is generally in the southern part of
      the eastern US

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania, which is generally in the
      northern part of the eastern US


      Pennsylvania is entirely north of North Carolina in terms of latitude. The southernmost
      part of Pennsylvania is still north of the northernmost part of North Carolina.


      Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina and East Branch Clarion River Lake is
      in Pennsylvania, it follows that Badin Lake must be south of East Branch Clarion
      River Lake, not north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine

      Step 1: Consider the states where these lakes are located.

      - Badin Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - East Branch Clarion River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, while North Carolina
      is in the southeastern United States. Pennsylvania is entirely north of North
      Carolina.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific lakes.

      Since Pennsylvania is entirely north of North Carolina, any lake in Pennsylvania
      (including East Branch Clarion River Lake) would be north of any lake in North
      Carolina (including Badin Lake).


      Step 4: Conclude based on geographic positions.

      Badin Lake (NC) cannot be north of East Branch Clarion River Lake (PA) because
      North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania.

      Step 2: Consider the general geography.

      Pennsylvania shares its southern border with Maryland and West Virginia, while
      North Carolina is even further south (below Virginia).


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Since Badin Lake is in North Carolina, and East Branch Clarion River Lake is
      in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania lake must be at a higher latitude (further

      Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama (AL). Alabama is generally south of Tennessee
      (TN).


      Nashville is in Tennessee. The Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville,
      Tennessee.


      So geographically, Tennessee is north of Alabama. This means that Nashville
      (in TN) is likely north of Lewis Smith Lake (in AL).


      However, I should be more precise. Let me think about where exactly in Alabama
      Lewis Smith Lake is located, and where exactly in Tennessee Nashville is located.


      Nashville is in the north-central part of Tennessee, not far from the Kentucky
      border.


      Lewis Smith Lake (also called Smith Lake) is in north-central Alabama.


      Given that Tennessee is directly north of Alabama, and Nashville is in the northern
      part of Tennessee while Lewis Smith Lake is in the northern part of Alabama,
      it''s almost certain that Nashville Municipal Auditorium is north of Lewis Smith
      Lake.


      So my answer would be that NO, Lewis Smith Lake is NOT north of Nashville Municipal
      Auditorium. Rather, Nashville Municipal Auditorium is north of Lewis Smith Lake.


      Wait, I need to be careful with the direction. The question asks if Lewis Smith
      Lake is north of Nashville Municipal Auditorium. Since Alabama is south of Tennessee,
      Lewis Smith Lake (in AL) is south of Nashville Municipal Auditorium (in TN),
      not north.</think># Determining if Lewis Smith Lake, AL is north of Nashville
      Municipal Auditorium, TN


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama (AL),
      and Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Tennessee (TN).


      2) Looking at the geographical relationship between these states: Tennessee
      is located directly north of Alabama.


      3) Nashville is in the north-central part of Tennessee, while Lewis Smith Lake
      is in north-central Alabama.


      4) Given this north-south relationship, any location in Tennessee (including
      Nashville) would generally be north of locations in Alabama (including Lewis
      Smith Lake).


      5) Therefore, Nashville Municipal Auditorium would be north of Lewis Smith Lake,
      not the other way around.


      NO, Lewis Smith Lake, AL is not located north of Nashville Municipal Auditorium,
      TN.'

      step:


      1. I need to determine the locations of Lewis Smith Lake, AL and Nashville Municipal

      2. Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama (AL). Alabama is a state in the southeastern
      United States.


      3. Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville, Tennessee (TN). Nashville
      is the capital city of Tennessee, which is also in the southeastern United States.


      4. To determine which is more north, I need to compare their geographical positions.


      5. Tennessee is located directly north of Alabama. The northern border of Alabama
      meets the southern border of Tennessee.


      6. Nashville is located in the central part of Tennessee.


      7. Lewis Smith Lake is in northern Alabama, but Alabama as a whole is south
      of Tennessee.


      8. Therefore, Lewis Smith Lake (in northern Alabama) would be south of Nashville
      (in central Tennessee).


      9. This means that Lewis Smith Lake is NOT located north of Nashville Municipal
      Auditorium.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      geographic positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama (AL)

      - Nashville Municipal Auditorium is in Nashville, Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Tennessee is located directly north of Alabama

      - Alabama''s northern border connects with Tennessee''s southern border


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      - Nashville is in the north-central part of Tennessee

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in northern Alabama


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Even though Lewis Smith Lake is in northern Alabama, it is still south of Nashville,
      Tennessee. The entire state of Alabama is south of central Tennessee where Nashville
      is located.

      If Lewis Smith Lake has a higher latitude than Nashville Municipal Auditorium,
      then it''s north of it. Otherwise, it''s not.


      Let me think about the general geography of Alabama and Tennessee:

      - Tennessee is generally north of Alabama

      - Nashville is in the northern part of Tennessee

      - Lewis Smith Lake would be somewhere in Alabama


      Based on the general geography, it''s likely that Lewis Smith Lake in Alabama
      is south of Nashville, Tennessee. This is because Alabama is south of Tennessee.
      However, let me be more precise:


      Nashville, TN is in the central-northern part of Tennessee.

      Lewis Smith Lake would be in Alabama, which is south of Tennessee.


      So based on this reasoning, Lewis Smith Lake is likely south of Nashville Municipal
      Auditorium, not north of it.


      So the answer would be NO, Lewis Smith Lake is not north of Nashville Municipal

      - Nashville is in the north-central part of Tennessee

      - Lewis Smith Lake is in north-central Alabama


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Alabama is south of Tennessee, and Nashville is well within Tennessee''s

      2. Star Lite Motel, Minnesota (MN)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Lewis and Clark Lake is located north of
      Star Lite Motel.


      Let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Nebraska (NE) is located in the central United States

      - Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern part of the central United States


      Generally speaking, Minnesota is north of Nebraska. Minnesota borders Canada
      to the north, while Nebraska is further south and doesn''t border Canada.


      So if we''re comparing locations in these two states, typically a location in
      Nebraska would be south of a location in Minnesota, not north of it.


      Therefore, Lewis and Clark Lake in Nebraska is likely south of Star Lite Motel
      in Minnesota.</think>To determine whether Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is located
      north of Star Lite Motel, MN, I need to consider the geographic relationship
      between Nebraska and Minnesota.


      Step 1: Consider the relative positions of the states.

      Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern part of the central United States,
      bordering Canada.

      Nebraska (NE) is located south of Minnesota in the central United States.


      Step 2: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific locations.

      Since Nebraska is entirely south of Minnesota, any location in Nebraska (including
      Lewis and Clark Lake) would be south of any location in Minnesota (including
      Star Lite Motel).


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the north-south relationship.

      Since Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska, and Nebraska is south of Minnesota,
      Lewis and Clark Lake must be south of (not north of) Star Lite Motel.

      First, let''s think about the states: Nebraska (NE) is south of Minnesota (MN).
      Nebraska borders South Dakota to its north, while Minnesota is north of Iowa
      and borders Canada to its north.


      If we look at the general geography of the US states:

      - Minnesota is a northern state that borders Canada

      - Nebraska is more southern, not bordering Canada


      So in general, locations in Minnesota tend to be north of locations in Nebraska.


      However, I need to be more specific about these particular locations. Lewis
      and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE), likely in the northern part of the state
      since Lewis and Clark traveled along the Missouri River which forms part of
      Nebraska''s northern border with South Dakota. But even northern Nebraska is
      generally south of most of Minnesota.

      NE is north of Star Lite Motel, MN, I need to analyze the relative positions

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      - Minnesota (MN) is a northern state that borders Canada.

      - Nebraska (NE) is located south of Minnesota, with South Dakota in between
      them.


      Step 2: Consider Lewis and Clark Lake''s specific location.

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska, specifically on the Nebraska-South Dakota
      border along the Missouri River in the northeastern part of Nebraska.

      - Even though it''s in northern Nebraska, it''s still south of Minnesota''s
      southern border.


      Step 3: Consider Star Lite Motel''s location.

      - Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota, and regardless of where in Minnesota it''s
      located, any point in Minnesota is north of Lewis and Clark Lake.


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes.

      - All of Minnesota is at a higher latitude (more northern) than northern Nebraska

      NO - Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is not located north of Star Lite Motel, MN. It

      part of Nebraska.

      I don''t have specific information about the exact location of Star Lite Motel
      in Minnesota.


      Step 3: Make a geographic assessment.

      Even though Lewis and Clark Lake is in the northern part of Nebraska, Minnesota
      as a whole is north of Nebraska. So generally speaking, locations in Minnesota
      would be north of locations in Nebraska.


      Without the specific coordinates of Star Lite Motel in Minnesota, I need to
      rely on the general geographic relationship between the states. Since Minnesota
      is north of Nebraska, it''s most likely that any location in Minnesota (including
      Star Lite Motel) would be north of Lewis and Clark Lake in Nebraska.</think>I
      need to determine if Lewis and Clark Lake in Nebraska is north of Star Lite
      Motel in Minnesota.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic positions of the states.

      Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada.

      Nebraska (NE) is located south of Minnesota in the central United States.


      Step 2: Analyze the relative positions.

      Even though I don''t know the exact location of Star Lite Motel within Minnesota,
      Minnesota as a whole state is positioned north of Nebraska.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since Minnesota is entirely north of Nebraska, any location in Minnesota (including
      Star Lite Motel) would be north of locations in Nebraska (including Lewis and
      Clark Lake).


      NO, Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is not located north of Star Lite Motel, MN. It

      by step:


      1. I need to determine the relative positions of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE (Nebraska)
      and Star Lite Motel, MN (Minnesota).


      2. First, let''s consider the states: Nebraska (NE) is south of Minnesota (MN).
      Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the continental US, bordering
      Canada, while Nebraska is more central.


      3. Since Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska, and Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota,
      and Minnesota is north of Nebraska, it follows that Lewis and Clark Lake is
      likely south of the Star Lite Motel.


      4. However, I should be careful here. Just because one state is generally north
      of another doesn''t guarantee that every point in the northern state is north
      of every point in the southern state. Border areas could have exceptions.


      5. Lewis and Clark Lake is likely in northern Nebraska (as it would be on the
      Missouri River which forms part of Nebraska''s northern border with South Dakota),
      while Star Lite Motel could be in southern Minnesota.


      6. Even with this consideration, Minnesota is still significantly north of Nebraska,
      so it''s very likely that Star Lite Motel in Minnesota is north of Lewis and
      Clark Lake in Nebraska.</think>To determine if Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is located
      north of Star Lite Motel, MN, I need to consider the geographic relationship
      between Nebraska and Minnesota.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern part of the United States, bordering
      Canada.

      Nebraska (NE) is located south of Minnesota in the central United States.


      Step 2: Consider state positioning.

      Since Minnesota is entirely north of Nebraska on the map, any location in Minnesota
      would generally be north of locations in Nebraska.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota and Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska,
      the motel would be north of the lake.


      NO, Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is not located north of Star Lite Motel, MN. The
      lake is south of the motel.'

      I specifically need to know if the first location is north of the second location.


      Let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Nebraska (NE) is a state in the central part of the US

      - Minnesota (MN) is a state in the northern part of the US, bordering Canada


      In terms of north-south positioning, Minnesota is generally north of Nebraska.
      Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, while Nebraska
      is more central.


      Since Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE) and Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota
      (MN), it''s very likely that the lake is south of the motel, not north of it.


      Therefore, Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is likely NOT north of Star Lite Motel,
      MN.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these locations are found.

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states.

      - Minnesota is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous United States,
      bordering Canada.

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States, south of Minnesota.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level knowledge to the specific locations.

      Since Minnesota is north of Nebraska, locations in Minnesota (like Star Lite
      Motel) would generally be north of locations in Nebraska (like Lewis and Clark
      Lake).


      NO (Lewis and Clark Lake, NE is not located north of Star Lite Motel, MN)'

      1) I need to determine the locations of two places: Lewis and Clark Lake in

      2) First, let''s consider the states themselves. Nebraska (NE) is a state in
      the central United States, while Minnesota (MN) is a state in the upper Midwest.
      Generally speaking, Minnesota is north of Nebraska.


      3) Since Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE) and Star Lite Motel is in
      Minnesota (MN), and Minnesota is generally north of Nebraska, it''s unlikely
      that Lewis and Clark Lake would be north of Star Lite Motel.


      4) However, I need to be careful because specific locations within states can
      vary. If Lewis and Clark Lake is in the very northern part of Nebraska and Star
      Lite Motel is in the very southern part of Minnesota, there could be an exception.


      5) But generally speaking, Minnesota''s southern border is still north of most
      of Nebraska. The northernmost part of Nebraska would still likely be south of
      most of Minnesota.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two locations based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Minnesota is located north of Nebraska in the United States. Minnesota shares
      its southern border with Iowa, which is north of Nebraska.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the specific locations.

      Since Minnesota is entirely north of Nebraska, any location in Minnesota (including
      Star Lite Motel) would be north of locations in Nebraska (including Lewis and
      Clark Lake).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Lewis and Clark Lake in Nebraska cannot be north of Star Lite Motel in Minnesota.

      2. Specifically, I need to determine if Lewis and Clark Lake is north of Star
      Lite Motel.


      To determine this, I need to know the approximate locations of both places.


      Lewis and Clark Lake is a reservoir on the Missouri River along the Nebraska-South
      Dakota border. The Missouri River forms part of Nebraska''s northern border
      with South Dakota in that region.


      Minnesota is located entirely north of Nebraska. Minnesota shares its southern
      border with Iowa, which in turn borders Nebraska to the northeast.


      Given these geographical facts:

      - Nebraska is south of Minnesota

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is in northern Nebraska (on the border with South Dakota)

      - Any location in Minnesota (including Star Lite Motel) would be north of any
      location in Nebraska


      Therefore, Lewis and Clark Lake, NE cannot be north of Star Lite Motel, MN.
      It must be south of it because Nebraska is south of Minnesota.</think>I need

      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      Lewis and Clark Lake is in Nebraska (NE), while Star Lite Motel is in Minnesota

      Step 2: Analyze the geographic relationship between these states.

      Minnesota is located entirely north of Nebraska. Minnesota shares its southern
      border with Iowa, which borders Nebraska to the northeast.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      Lewis and Clark Lake is located in northern Nebraska (along the border with
      South Dakota), but even the northernmost point of Nebraska is still south of
      the southernmost point of Minnesota.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since any location in Nebraska (including Lewis and Clark Lake) must be south
      of any location in Minnesota (including Star Lite Motel), Lewis and Clark Lake
      cannot be north of Star Lite Motel.

      to determine the geographical locations of two places:

      1. St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church in Perryville, Missouri

      2. Bayles Lake in Illinois


      Then I need to compare their latitudes to determine if the church is north of
      the lake.


      Perryville, Missouri is located in southeastern Missouri, not far from the Mississippi
      River.


      Bayles Lake is in Illinois. Illinois is generally north and northeast of Missouri.


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Missouri is generally south of Illinois (Missouri''s northern border touches
      Illinois'' southern border)

      - Perryville is in southeastern Missouri

      - Since Illinois is north of Missouri, and Bayles Lake is in Illinois, it''s
      very likely that Bayles Lake is north of St. Mary''s Church in Perryville.


      But I need to be more precise about their exact locations. Let me think about
      where they would be on a map:


      Perryville, MO is in the southeastern part of Missouri.

      Bayles Lake, IL would be somewhere in Illinois, which is entirely north and
      northeast of Perryville.


      Given the general geography of these states, it''s highly likely that Bayles
      Lake is north of St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church.

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations by examining
      their geographical coordinates.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions

      Missouri is generally south of Illinois, as Illinois forms Missouri''s northeastern
      border.


      ## Step 2: Locate the specific places

      - St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church is in Perryville, Missouri, which
      is in the southeastern part of Missouri

      - Bayles Lake is in Illinois, which as a state lies north of Missouri


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      Since Perryville is in southeastern Missouri, and Illinois is entirely north/northeast
      of this part of Missouri, Bayles Lake (being in Illinois) must be north of St.
      Mary''s Church.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church is not north of Bayles Lake.
      Rather, Bayles Lake is north of the church.'

      locations of two places and compare them:

      1. St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church in Perryville, Missouri

      2. Bayles Lake in Illinois


      I need to determine if the church in Missouri is north of the lake in Illinois.


      Let me think about the rough geography of these states:

      - Missouri is generally west and south of Illinois

      - Illinois is north of Missouri (though they share a border that runs east-west)


      Perryville, Missouri would be in eastern Missouri, likely somewhere along the
      Missouri-Illinois border.


      Bayles Lake in Illinois - I''m not certain where this is, but given that Illinois
      is generally north of Missouri, there''s a good chance that Bayles Lake is north
      of Perryville.


      However, I need to consider that Illinois extends quite far south, and the southernmost
      part of Illinois is actually south of some parts of Missouri. So it depends
      on exactly where in Illinois Bayles Lake is located.


      Without knowing the exact coordinates, my general geographic knowledge suggests
      that a location in Missouri is likely to be south of a location in Illinois.
      However, this isn''t definitive without more specific location information.


      Based on general state geography, a church in Missouri (especially Perryville
      which is in eastern Missouri) would likely be south of a lake in Illinois. So
      the answer would likely be NO - the church is not north of the lake.


      However, I should acknowledge this is based on general geographic knowledge
      rather than specific coordinates of these locations.</think># Is St. Mary''s
      of the Barrens Catholic Church (Perryville, Missouri) north of Bayles Lake (Illinois)?


      Let me think through this step by step by considering the geographic locations
      of both places.


      1) St. Mary''s of the Barrens Catholic Church is located in Perryville, Missouri.

      2) Perryville is in eastern Missouri, near the Illinois border.

      3) Missouri is generally south of Illinois (Illinois is above Missouri on the
      map).

      4) Bayles Lake is located in Illinois.

      5) While I don''t know the exact location of Bayles Lake within Illinois, Illinois
      is predominantly north of Missouri.

      6) Even considering that Illinois'' southern border dips down, locations in
      Missouri would typically be south of locations in Illinois.


      Based on the general geographic relationship between these two states, St. Mary''s
      of the Barrens Catholic Church in Missouri would be south of Bayles Lake in
      Illinois, not north of it.

      to determine the relative locations of Beacon Reservoir in Dutchess County,
      New York and Stillwater Reservoir in New York.


      First, let me think about where Dutchess County is located in New York. Dutchess
      County is in the southeastern part of New York State, in the Hudson Valley region,
      east of the Hudson River.


      Beacon is a city in Dutchess County, so Beacon Reservoir would be located in
      or near the city of Beacon in southeastern New York.


      Now, let me think about Stillwater Reservoir. Stillwater Reservoir is located
      in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York State, specifically in Herkimer
      County.


      Given these locations:

      - Beacon Reservoir is in southeastern New York (Dutchess County)

      - Stillwater Reservoir is in northern New York (Adirondack region)

      ## Step 1: Locate Beacon Reservoir

      Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, which is located in southeastern New
      York in the Hudson Valley region. Beacon is a city on the eastern shore of the
      Hudson River.


      ## Step 2: Locate Stillwater Reservoir

      Stillwater Reservoir is located in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New
      York State, in Herkimer County.


      ## Step 3: Compare their locations

      The Adirondack region where Stillwater Reservoir is located is substantially
      farther north in New York State than Dutchess County where Beacon Reservoir

      The Adirondack region is definitely further north in New York state than Dutchess
      County. Dutchess County borders the Hudson River in the southeastern part of
      the state, while the Adirondacks are in the northern part of the state.

      Stillwater Reservoir, if I recall correctly, is located in the Adirondack region,
      which is in the northern part of New York state. It''s likely in Hamilton County

      If Stillwater Reservoir is indeed in the Adirondacks, then it would be north
      of Beacon Reservoir, which would mean Beacon Reservoir is NOT north of Stillwater
      Reservoir.


      Let me check my geographical understanding. The Adirondack region is definitely

      of Stillwater Reservoir (in the Adirondacks).</think># Is Beacon Reservoir north
      of Stillwater Reservoir?


      I need to determine the geographic locations of both reservoirs in New York
      state.


      ## Step 1: Locate Beacon Reservoir

      Beacon Reservoir is in Dutchess County, NY, which is located in the Hudson Valley
      region in the southeastern part of New York state.


      ## Step 2: Locate Stillwater Reservoir

      Stillwater Reservoir is located in Herkimer County in the Adirondack Mountains
      region, which is in the north-central part of New York state.


      ## Step 3: Compare north-south positions

      The Adirondack region (where Stillwater Reservoir is) is significantly north
      of the Hudson Valley region (where Beacon Reservoir is).


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Beacon Reservoir is NOT located north of Stillwater Reservoir. Beacon Reservoir
      is in the southeastern part of New York state, while Stillwater Reservoir is
      in the northern part of the state.'

      Let me think about where these places are located:


      AFI Silver is likely in Silver Spring, Maryland, which is near Washington DC,
      in the central part of Maryland.


      North Tonawanda is a city in western New York state, near Buffalo and Niagara
      Falls.

      of New York state are generally north of Maryland.


      North Tonawanda specifically is in the northern part of New York state near
      the Canadian border, while Maryland is several states south of that.


      So AFI Silver in Maryland would be south of North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory
      in New York.</think>To determine if AFI Silver, MD is located north of North

      Maryland near Washington, DC.

      - North Tonawanda is a city in western New York state, near Buffalo and Niagara
      Falls.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Maryland is a state that sits significantly south of New York state.

      - North Tonawanda is located in the northern part of New York state, near the
      Canadian border.

      - Silver Spring, Maryland is much further south on the map.


      Step 3: Make the north-south comparison.

      - New York is north of Maryland in general.

      - North Tonawanda specifically is in the northern region of New York, making
      it even further north of any location in Maryland.


      NO, AFI Silver in Maryland is not located north of North Tonawanda Barrel Organ

      - Fort Worth is located in north-central Texas

      - Oklahoma is north of Texas

      - The Robert S. Kerr Reservoir would be in Oklahoma (since it''s marked as "OK")


      Since Texas is south of Oklahoma, and Fort Worth is in Texas, while the Robert

      in Fort Worth is south of the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir.


      To be more precise:

      - Fort Worth is in the northern part of Texas, near the border with Oklahoma

      - But even northern Texas is still south of most of Oklahoma

      - The Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is likely in eastern Oklahoma (based on my knowledge

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas

      - Fort Worth is in north-central Texas


      Step 3: Determine relative positioning.

      - Even though Fort Worth is in northern Texas, it''s still south of the Oklahoma
      border

      - The Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is within Oklahoma

      - Any location in Texas (including Fort Worth) would be south of locations in

      A location with a higher latitude is further north than a location with a lower

      Step 2: Locate Fort Worth specifically.

      Fort Worth is in north-central Texas, but it''s still well within Texas borders

      Step 3: Consider the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir location.

      Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is in eastern Oklahoma, on the Arkansas River.


      Step 4: Compare the latitudes.

      Since the Blackstone Hotel is in Fort Worth, Texas, and even northern Texas

      Texas, while Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is in Oklahoma.


      2) Looking at the geographic relationship between these states: Oklahoma is
      located directly north of Texas along their shared border.


      3) Fort Worth is located in the north-central part of Texas, but it''s still
      well within Texas borders.


      4) Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is in eastern Oklahoma along the Arkansas River.


      5) Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas, and Fort Worth is in Texas, the
      Blackstone Hotel must be south of the reservoir.


      NO - Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas is not located north of Robert S.
      Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma.'

      First, let me establish their locations:


      1. Green River Lake is in Kentucky (KY), which is a state south of Illinois.

      2. Holy Name Cathedral is in Chicago, Illinois (IL).


      Kentucky is entirely south of Illinois. The northern border of Kentucky roughly
      aligns with the southern part of Illinois. Chicago is in the northeastern part
      of Illinois, near Lake Michigan.


      Since Green River Lake is in Kentucky, and Kentucky is south of Illinois, and
      Chicago is in the northern part of Illinois, Green River Lake must be south

      Therefore, Green River Lake, KY is NOT located north of Holy Name Cathedral

      Step 2: Determine their relative north-south positions.

      - Illinois is located north of Kentucky (KY borders the southern part of Illinois)

      - Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, near Lake Michigan

      - Green River Lake is in central Kentucky

      Since Kentucky is entirely south of Illinois, and Chicago is in the northern

      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to know which city is further
      north. In the United States:


      Seattle, Washington is located in the northwest of the US, near the Canadian
      border.

      Portland, Oregon is south of Seattle.


      Since Seattle is north of Portland, and these buildings are in their respective
      cities:

      - St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral (in Seattle, WA) is north of

      - Aladdin Theater (in Portland, OR)

      - Seattle is approximately 145 miles north of Portland

      - Buildings in Seattle would generally be north of buildings in Portland


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since the Aladdin Theater is in Portland (the more southern city) and St. Mark''s
      Episcopal Cathedral is in Seattle (the more northern city), the Aladdin Theater
      cannot be north of St. Mark''s Cathedral.

      2. Allegheny Reservoir in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Then I need to compare their latitudes to determine if High Rock Lake is north
      of Allegheny Reservoir.


      Let me reason through this:


      High Rock Lake is located in North Carolina, which is a southeastern state in
      the US.

      Allegheny Reservoir is located in Pennsylvania, which is a northeastern/mid-Atlantic
      state.


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina in the United States.
      Pennsylvania borders New York to the north, while North Carolina is much further
      south, bordering South Carolina and Georgia.


      Since High Rock Lake is in North Carolina and Allegheny Reservoir is in Pennsylvania,
      it''s very likely that High Rock Lake is south of the Allegheny Reservoir, not
      north of it.


      To be certain, I should confirm the approximate coordinates:

      - High Rock Lake, NC is in the central part of North Carolina

      - Allegheny Reservoir, PA is in the northwestern part of Pennsylvania near the
      New York border

      I''ll determine this by examining the geographic locations of both bodies of
      water.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      North Carolina (NC) is a southeastern state, while Pennsylvania (PA) is a northeastern/mid-Atlantic
      state. Pennsylvania is positioned significantly north of North Carolina on a
      map of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      High Rock Lake is located in the central part of North Carolina.

      Allegheny Reservoir (also called Kinzua Dam) is in the northwestern part of
      Pennsylvania near the New York border.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Pennsylvania is entirely north of North Carolina, any body of water in
      North Carolina (including High Rock Lake) would be south of a body of water
      in Pennsylvania (including Allegheny Reservoir).


      NO, High Rock Lake, NC is not located north of Allegheny Reservoir, PA. It is

      To be more precise:

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern US

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Based on their state locations, determine the relative positions.

      Since High Rock Lake is in North Carolina (a southern state) and Allegheny Reservoir

      if Miller Outdoor Theatre in Texas is located north of Nimrod Lake in Arkansas.


      First, I need to determine the approximate locations of both places:


      1. Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Houston, Texas

      2. Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas


      Now I need to think about their relative positions. In the United States:

      - Arkansas is generally north of Texas

      - Arkansas borders the northeastern part of Texas

      - Houston is located in southeastern Texas


      Since Arkansas is generally north of Texas, and Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas while
      Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Houston (southeastern Texas), it''s very likely
      that Miller Outdoor Theatre is south of Nimrod Lake.


      To be more precise, I would need the exact coordinates, but based on the general
      geography of the United States, I can conclude that Miller Outdoor Theatre in
      Texas is south of Nimrod Lake in Arkansas, not north of it.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both places and
      compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Miller Outdoor Theatre is located in Houston, Texas, in the southeastern part
      of the state.

      - Nimrod Lake is located in Arkansas, in the west-central part of the state.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Arkansas.

      - Arkansas is positioned directly north of eastern Texas.

      - Texas extends further south than Arkansas.


      Step 3: Compare their specific positions.

      - Houston (where Miller Outdoor Theatre is) is in the southeastern part of Texas.

      - Nimrod Lake is in west-central Arkansas.

      - Arkansas as a whole is north of the part of Texas where Houston is located.


      Therefore, Miller Outdoor Theatre in Texas is located SOUTH of Nimrod Lake in
      Arkansas, not north of it.

      First, I need to know where these places are located:


      1. Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Houston, Texas.

      2. Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas.


      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to compare their latitudes:

      - Texas is generally south of Arkansas (Arkansas borders the northern part of
      Texas)

      - Houston is located in southeastern Texas

      - Nimrod Lake is likely in central or northern Arkansas


      Based on the general geography of the United States, Arkansas is north of Texas.
      Houston is in the southern part of Texas, making it even further south compared
      to Arkansas. So Miller Outdoor Theatre in Houston, Texas is very likely south
      of Nimrod Lake in Arkansas, not north of it.


      Therefore, Miller Outdoor Theatre, TX is NOT located north of Nimrod Lake, AR.</think>I

      - Arkansas is positioned directly north of Texas

      - Houston is located in the southeastern part of Texas


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Arkansas is north of Texas, and Houston is in the southern region of
      Texas, Miller Outdoor Theatre would be south of most Arkansas locations

      - Nimrod Lake is in west-central Arkansas


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Miller Outdoor Theatre in Houston, TX is positioned south of Nimrod Lake,

      First, let me consider the relative positions of Texas and Arkansas within the
      United States:

      - Arkansas is generally located to the northeast of Texas

      - Texas is south of Arkansas


      Now, I need to be more specific about these two locations:


      1. Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Texas. I believe it''s in Houston, which is
      in the southeastern part of Texas.

      2. Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas. I''m not certain of its exact location within

      Given that Arkansas is north of Texas, and Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Texas

      However, there could be exceptions if Miller Outdoor Theatre is in the northernmost

      Swift Reservoir is in Washington state (WA). Washington state is entirely north
      of California, as it borders Oregon which is north of California.


      Since Washington state is north of California, and Swift Reservoir is in Washington

      - Carson Mansion is located in Eureka, California, in the northern part of California
      along the coast.

      - Swift Reservoir is located in Washington state.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between California and Washington.

      - Washington state is entirely north of California.

      - California''s northern border connects with Oregon, and Oregon''s northern
      border connects with Washington.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Washington state is positioned entirely north of California on the map

      would be north of any location in California (including Carson Mansion).


      NO, Carson Mansion, CA is not located north of Swift Reservoir, WA. The mansion

      2. Swift Reservoir is in Washington (WA). Washington state is entirely north

      Eureka, CA where Carson Mansion is located is in the northern part of California,

      2. California (CA) is located on the west coast of the United States, south
      of Oregon, which is south of Washington.


      3. Since California is entirely south of Washington state, any location in California
      would be south of any location in Washington state.


      4. Therefore, Carson Mansion in California must be south of Swift Reservoir
      in Washington.


      The question asks if Carson Mansion is north of Swift Reservoir, which is the
      opposite of what I determined.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative north-south positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Carson Mansion is in California (CA)

      - Swift Reservoir is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast, south of Oregon and Washington

      - Washington is entirely north of California


      Step 3: Apply this state relationship to the specific locations.

      - Since Carson Mansion is in California, and Swift Reservoir is in Washington

      - And Washington is entirely north of California

      - Carson Mansion must be south of Swift Reservoir (not north)

      to compare the locations of Carson Mansion in California and Swift Reservoir
      in Washington.


      First, let me determine where these places are:


      1. Carson Mansion is in Eureka, California, which is in Northern California
      on the coast.

      2. Swift Reservoir is in Washington state (WA).


      In general, Washington state is north of California. Washington is the northernmost
      state on the west coast of the contiguous United States, while California is
      south of both Washington and Oregon.


      However, I need to be more precise since California is a large state, and the
      northern parts of California could potentially be at a similar latitude to some
      southern parts of Washington.


      Eureka, CA (where Carson Mansion is located) is in the far northern part of
      California, but still, any location in Washington state would typically be north
      of any location in California due to the geographical arrangement of the states.


      So Swift Reservoir in Washington would be north of Carson Mansion in California.</think>#
      Is Carson Mansion, CA located north of Swift Reservoir, WA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Carson Mansion is in Eureka, California (CA)

      - Swift Reservoir is in Washington state (WA)


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographic positions

      - Washington state is located entirely north of California

      - California is positioned south of both Oregon and Washington

      - Any location in Washington state (including Swift Reservoir) would be north
      of any location in California (including Carson Mansion)


      ## Step 3: Confirm direction

      Since Washington state is geographically north of California, Swift Reservoir
      (WA) must be north of Carson Mansion (CA).


      NO, Carson Mansion is not north of Swift Reservoir. It''s the opposite - Swift
      Reservoir in Washington is north of Carson Mansion in California.'

      part of the border between Oregon and Idaho. It''s in the northeastern part
      of Oregon in the Hell''s Canyon area.


      3. **Relative positions**: Northeastern Oregon (where Oxbow Dam is) is actually
      north of southern Idaho (where Salmon Falls Dam is). While Idaho is generally
      north of Oregon, these specific locations don''t follow that general pattern
      due to the shape of the state borders.

      southern part of Connecticut.


      2. Cranberry Lake is in New York state. I need to determine where in New York

      Battell Chapel is located on Yale University''s campus in New Haven, Connecticut.
      New Haven is situated in the southern part of Connecticut, along the Long Island
      Sound coastline.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Cranberry Lake, NY.

      Cranberry Lake is located in the Adirondack Mountains in the northern part of
      New York State.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      New York State extends north of Connecticut. The Adirondack region where Cranberry
      Lake is located is in the northern part of New York, while New Haven (containing
      Battell Chapel) is in southern Connecticut.

      Let me double-check the logic: Texas is south of Oklahoma. San Antonio is in
      the southern part of Texas. Therefore, San Antonio is definitely south of Oklahoma,
      which means the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio is south of Lake Lawtonka in
      Oklahoma.


      So the answer would be NO - the Majestic Theatre is not north of Lake Lawtonka;
      it''s south of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Majestic Theatre is in San Antonio, Texas

      - Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - San Antonio is located in south-central Texas

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas

      - Lake Lawtonka is in southwestern Oklahoma (near Lawton)


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas, and San Antonio is in the southern
      portion of Texas, any location in Oklahoma (including Lake Lawtonka) would be
      north of San Antonio.

      - Therefore, the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio is south of Lake Lawtonka,
      not north of it.

      1. Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, TX

      2. Lake Lawtonka, OK


      And then compare their latitudes to determine if the Majestic Theatre is north

      - Lake Lawtonka appears to be in Oklahoma (OK)


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is north of Texas. Since San Antonio is in Texas

      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Majestic Theatre is located in San Antonio, Texas

      - Lake Lawtonka is located in Oklahoma


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions

      - Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas on the US map

      - Texas is south of Oklahoma


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within states

      - San Antonio is in south-central Texas, quite far south in the state

      - Lake Lawtonka is in Oklahoma, which is entirely north of Texas


      ## Conclusion

      Since San Antonio is in Texas (which is south of Oklahoma), and Lake Lawtonka
      is in Oklahoma (which is north of Texas), the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio
      must be south of Lake Lawtonka, not north of it.

      First, let me identify where these places are:

      2. Holy Family Orphanage is in Michigan (MI)


      Let''s think about where these states are relative to each other. Illinois is
      generally south of Michigan. Michigan is in the northern part of the Midwest,

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Michigan is generally north of Illinois on a map

      - Michigan borders the northern parts of the US near Canada

      - Illinois is located south of Michigan in the Midwest region


      Step 3: More specifically about these locations:

      - Harold Washington Cultural Center is in Chicago, in the northeastern part
      of Illinois

      - Holy Family Orphanage is likely in the Upper Peninsula or main portion of

      of the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona and the Rockport Reservoir in Utah,
      and then compare their latitudes to determine which one is further north.


      Let''s start by recalling the locations:


      1. Navajo Generating Station is located in Arizona (AZ). Arizona is in the southwestern
      United States.

      2. Rockport Reservoir is located in Utah (UT). Utah is located north of Arizona.


      Given the general geography of the US, Utah is north of Arizona, so a location
      in Utah would typically be north of a location in Arizona. However, I need to
      be more precise because these specific locations could be near the state borders.


      The Navajo Generating Station was located near Page, Arizona, in the northern
      part of the state, close to the Utah border. It was on the Navajo Nation.


      Rockport Reservoir is in Summit County, Utah, which is in the northern part
      of Utah, not far from Salt Lake City.


      Northern Arizona is at a latitude of approximately 36-37 degrees North, while
      northern Utah is around 40-42 degrees North. Even the northernmost part of Arizona
      would typically be south of most of Utah.


      So based on this geographic knowledge, Rockport Reservoir in Utah should be
      north of the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona (AZ)

      - Rockport Reservoir is in Utah (UT)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Arizona and Utah.

      Utah is directly north of Arizona in the United States.


      Step 3: Look at specific locations within these states.

      - Navajo Generating Station was located near Page, Arizona, in the northern
      part of the state, close to the Utah border.

      - Rockport Reservoir is in Summit County, Utah, which is in the northern part
      of Utah, not far from Salt Lake City.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      Even though Navajo Generating Station is in northern Arizona, it still lies
      south of Rockport Reservoir. Northern Arizona has latitudes of approximately
      36-37 degrees North, while northern Utah where Rockport Reservoir is located
      has latitudes around 40-41 degrees North.


      NO - Navajo Generating Station is NOT located north of Rockport Reservoir. It
      is south of it.'

      1. Navajo Generating Station is in Arizona (AZ). Arizona is generally south
      of Utah, since Utah borders Arizona to the north.


      2. Rockport Reservoir is in Utah (UT).


      3. Since one location is in Arizona and the other is in Utah, and Utah is generally
      north of Arizona, there''s a good chance that Navajo Generating Station is south
      of Rockport Reservoir. However, I need to be more precise since border areas
      could be exceptions.


      4. The Navajo Generating Station was located near Page, Arizona, in the northernmost
      part of Arizona, close to the Utah border.


      5. Rockport Reservoir is in Summit County, Utah, which is in northern Utah but
      not on the southern border with Arizona.


      Based on this, the Navajo Generating Station in the far northern part of Arizona
      is likely south of Rockport Reservoir in northern Utah. So Navajo Generating
      Station is NOT north of Rockport Reservoir.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative locations of these two places.

      - Navajo Generating Station is located near Page, Arizona, in the northern part
      of Arizona.

      - Rockport Reservoir is located in Summit County, Utah, in the northern part
      of Utah.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Utah is generally north of Arizona, as they share a border with Utah above
      Arizona.

      - Page, Arizona (where Navajo Generating Station is) is indeed in the northernmost
      part of Arizona, close to the Utah border.

      - Rockport Reservoir is in northern Utah, significantly further north than the
      Arizona-Utah border.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      - Even though Navajo Generating Station is in the northern part of Arizona,
      it is still south of most of Utah, including Rockport Reservoir.


      NO, the Navajo Generating Station is not located north of Rockport Reservoir.'

      1. Blewett Falls Lake in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir in Pennsylvania (PA)


      First, let me consider the states themselves. Pennsylvania is a northern state
      that borders New York, while North Carolina is a southern state that''s significantly
      further south. Pennsylvania is definitely north of North Carolina.


      Since Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir
      is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina, we can conclude
      that Blewett Falls Lake is south of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, not north

      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think># Is Blewett Falls Lake, NC located north
      of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, PA?


      To answer this question, I need to analyze the geographic locations of these

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Determine the relative positions of the states

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States, while North Carolina
      is in the southeastern United States. Pennsylvania is positioned significantly
      north of North Carolina on the map.


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific water bodies

      Since Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina (a southern state) and Foster
      Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (a northern state), Blewett Falls
      Lake must be south of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, not north of it.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Blewett Falls Lake, NC is not located north of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir,

      Blewett Falls Lake is in North Carolina (NC).

      Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Geographically in the United States:

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, located in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region

      - North Carolina is a southern state, located in the Southeast region


      Pennsylvania is generally north of North Carolina. The entire state of PA is
      north of the entire state of NC.


      Since Blewett Falls Lake is in NC, and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in
      PA, and PA is north of NC, it follows that Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir would
      be north of Blewett Falls Lake.


      Therefore, Blewett Falls Lake is NOT north of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir.
      Instead, it is south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both bodies of water.

      - Blewett Falls Lake is located in North Carolina (NC)

      - Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is located in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern/mid-Atlantic region of the United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is entirely north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      Since Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina, and these bodies of water are
      within their respective states, Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir must be north
      of Blewett Falls Lake, not the other way around.

      (Fullerton, California) is located north of Shaver Lake, California, I need
      to compare the latitudes of these two locations.


      First, let me identify where each place is located:


      1. Fox Theatre is in Fullerton, California, which is in Orange County in Southern
      California.

      2. Shaver Lake is in Fresno County in Central California.


      Generally speaking, Southern California is south of Central California. So my
      initial guess would be that Fox Theatre (Fullerton) is south of Shaver Lake,
      not north of it.


      To be more precise:

      - Fullerton is in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, near Anaheim.

      - Shaver Lake is in the Sierra Nevada mountains east of Fresno.


      Central California and especially mountain locations like Shaver Lake are significantly
      north of Orange County. So Fox Theatre in Fullerton would be south of Shaver
      Lake, not north.


      So the answer would be NO, Fox Theatre (Fullerton, California) is not located
      north of Shaver Lake, CA. It''s located south of it.</think># Is Fox Theatre

      part of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area

      - Shaver Lake is in Fresno County in Central California, located in the Sierra
      Nevada mountains


      Looking at California''s geography:

      - Southern California (where Fullerton is) lies south of Central California
      (where Shaver Lake is)

      - Fullerton is near the bottom portion of California, while Shaver Lake is more
      in the middle of the state

      - Orange County is significantly south of Fresno County


      Therefore, Fox Theatre in Fullerton would be south of Shaver Lake, not north
      of it.

      Fullerton is a city in Orange County, which is in Southern California, in the
      Los Angeles metropolitan area.


      Shaver Lake is in the Sierra Nevada mountains in Fresno County, which is in
      Central California.

      it

      - Central California includes the Central Valley, Sierra Nevada mountains, and

      more precise about these specific locations.


      Ashokan Reservoir is in the Catskill Mountains region of New York State, which

      Since Maryland lies entirely south of New York state, any location in Maryland

      First, let me identify the states:

      - MD is Maryland, which is in the mid-Atlantic region of the US

      - NY is New York, which is in the northeastern US


      Generally speaking, New York is north of Maryland. Maryland borders Pennsylvania
      to its north, and New York is north of Pennsylvania.


      Fairview Plantation is in Maryland, so it would be in the mid-Atlantic region.

      Ashokan Reservoir is in New York state.


      Since New York is north of Maryland, and Fairview Plantation is in Maryland
      while Ashokan Reservoir is in New York, it''s highly likely that Fairview Plantation
      is south of Ashokan Reservoir, not north of it.

      Is Fairview Plantation, MD located north of Ashokan Reservoir, NY?

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Maryland is located in the mid-Atlantic region, south of New York

      Since Maryland is entirely south of New York state, any location in Maryland
      (including Fairview Plantation) would be south of locations in New York (including

      Therefore, Fairview Plantation, MD is NOT located north of Ashokan Reservoir,
      NY.

      Minnesota is generally north of Iowa. Minnesota borders Canada to the north,

      So Scituate Reservoir is NOT north of the Basilica. Rather, the Basilica is
      north of the Scituate Reservoir.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative locations of these two places.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      - Scituate Reservoir is in Rhode Island (RI)

      - The Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul is in Lewiston, Maine (ME)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic arrangement of these states.

      Maine is the northernmost state in New England, while Rhode Island is significantly
      further south. In the New England region, the states are roughly arranged (north
      to south) as:

      - Maine

      - New Hampshire/Vermont

      - Massachusetts

      - Rhode Island/Connecticut


      Step 3: Determine the relative position.

      Since Maine is north of Rhode Island, the Basilica in Lewiston, Maine would
      be north of the Scituate Reservoir in Rhode Island.


      NO (Scituate Reservoir is south of the Basilica, not north of it)'

      - Scituate Reservoir is in central Rhode Island.

      - Even though Lewiston is in southern Maine, it''s still far north of any point

      First, let me identify the general north-south relationship between Texas and

      south of Kansas. In general, locations in Kansas are north of locations in Texas.

      the locations of two bodies of water:

      1. Navajo Lake, New Mexico (NM)

      2. Barker Meadow Reservoir, Colorado (CO)


      I need to determine if Navajo Lake is north of Barker Meadow Reservoir.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - New Mexico (NM) is generally south of Colorado (CO)

      - Colorado is directly north of New Mexico


      So generally speaking, locations in New Mexico tend to be south of locations
      in Colorado. However, I need to be more specific about these particular bodies
      of water.


      Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado border.


      Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado. I believe it''s near Boulder, which
      is in the north-central part of Colorado.


      Given this information:

      - Navajo Lake is in northwestern New Mexico

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is likely in north-central Colorado

      - Colorado is north of New Mexico


      This suggests that Navajo Lake (in NM) is south of Barker Meadow Reservoir (in
      CO), not north of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two bodies of water.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both bodies of water.

      - Navajo Lake is located in northwestern New Mexico (NM)

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is located near Nederland in north-central Colorado
      (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between the states.

      - Colorado is directly north of New Mexico

      - The Colorado-New Mexico state border runs east-west


      Step 3: Analyze the specific locations within these states.

      - Even though Navajo Lake is in the northern part of New Mexico (near the Colorado
      border), it''s still in New Mexico

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is well within Colorado''s borders, not near the southern
      edge


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on north-south positioning.

      - Since Colorado is north of New Mexico, and these water bodies are not close
      enough to the border to create an exception, Navajo Lake must be south of Barker
      Meadow Reservoir


      NO'

      NM (New Mexico) is located north of Barker Meadow Reservoir, CO (Colorado).


      To figure this out, I need to think about the geographic locations:


      1. Navajo Lake is in New Mexico (NM)

      2. Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado (CO)


      Generally speaking, Colorado is located north of New Mexico in the United States.
      Colorado borders New Mexico to the north.


      Since Navajo Lake is in New Mexico, and Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado,
      it''s likely that Navajo Lake is south of Barker Meadow Reservoir.


      However, I should consider that Navajo Lake might be in the far northern part
      of New Mexico, and Barker Meadow Reservoir might be in the far southern part
      of Colorado. But even in this case, it''s still most likely that the Colorado
      location is north of the New Mexico location, given the geography of these states.</think>To
      determine if Navajo Lake, NM is located north of Barker Meadow Reservoir, CO,
      I need to consider the geographic locations of these two water bodies and their
      respective states.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Colorado is directly north of New Mexico in the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the locations within their states.

      Navajo Lake is located in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado border.

      Barker Meadow Reservoir is located in north-central Colorado, near Nederland
      (west of Boulder).


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Even though Navajo Lake is in the northern part of New Mexico, its location
      is still south of most points in Colorado. Barker Meadow Reservoir, being in
      north-central Colorado, is definitely at a higher latitude than Navajo Lake.

      1. Navajo Lake, New Mexico (NM)

      2. Barker Meadow Reservoir, Colorado (CO)


      Then I need to determine whether Navajo Lake is located north of Barker Meadow
      Reservoir.


      First, let me recall their general locations:


      - Navajo Lake is in northern New Mexico, likely near the Colorado border. New
      Mexico is generally south of Colorado.

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado. Colorado is generally north of New
      Mexico.


      Since New Mexico is south of Colorado, it would be unusual for something in
      New Mexico to be north of something in Colorado. However, state borders aren''t
      perfectly straight lines, and there could be some areas where this might be
      possible.


      Barker Meadow Reservoir, if I recall correctly, is near Boulder, Colorado, which
      is in the north-central part of Colorado, not far from Denver.


      Navajo Lake is in the northwestern part of New Mexico, near the Colorado border.


      Given that Colorado is north of New Mexico, and Barker Meadow is in the northern
      part of Colorado while Navajo Lake is in New Mexico (even if northern New Mexico),
      it''s very likely that Navajo Lake is south of Barker Meadow Reservoir.</think>#
      Determining if Navajo Lake, NM is north of Barker Meadow Reservoir, CO


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two water bodies.


      ## Step 1: Locate both reservoirs

      - Navajo Lake is located in northwestern New Mexico, near the Colorado border

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is located near Nederland in Boulder County, Colorado


      ## Step 2: Consider their positions within their states

      - Colorado is directly north of New Mexico

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir is in north-central Colorado (near Boulder)

      - Navajo Lake is in the northern part of New Mexico


      ## Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      - Even though Navajo Lake is in northern New Mexico, it''s still in New Mexico,
      which is south of Colorado

      - Barker Meadow Reservoir, being in north-central Colorado, is significantly
      further north than any point in New Mexico


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Navajo Lake in New Mexico is not north of Barker Meadow Reservoir in Colorado.
      It is south of it, as any location in New Mexico would be south of a location
      in north-central Colorado.'

      Let me work through this step-by-step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geographic relationship between West
      Virginia (WV) and Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is located north of West Virginia.


      2) R. D. Bailey Lake is located in southern West Virginia, in the Guyandotte
      River basin.


      3) Youghiogheny River Lake is located in southwestern Pennsylvania, near the
      Maryland border.


      4) Given that Pennsylvania is north of West Virginia, and these lakes are in
      their respective states without being in unusual border areas that might create
      exceptions, R. D. Bailey Lake would be south of Youghiogheny River Lake.


      5) Since R. D. Bailey Lake is in the southern part of WV, and Youghiogheny River
      Lake is in the southwestern part of PA, the general north-south relationship
      between the states holds for these specific locations.


      NO, R. D. Bailey Lake is not located north of Youghiogheny River Lake.'

      Specifically, I need to determine if R. D. Bailey Lake is located north of Youghiogheny
      River Lake.


      To solve this, I need to recall the approximate locations of these lakes.


      R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia, which is generally south of Pennsylvania.


      Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania, which is generally north of West
      Virginia.


      Given the general orientation of these states, it would be unlikely that a lake
      in West Virginia would be north of a lake in Pennsylvania, unless the WV lake
      is in the northern part of WV and the PA lake is in the southern part of PA.


      Since West Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, and these lakes are within their
      respective states, R. D. Bailey Lake (in WV) would likely be south of Youghiogheny

      2. Youghiogheny River Lake is located in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Pennsylvania is generally located north of West Virginia in the United States.
      The border between these states runs in a roughly east-west direction, with
      Pennsylvania being the northern state and West Virginia being the southern state.


      Since R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia (the more southern state) and Youghiogheny
      River Lake is in Pennsylvania (the more northern state), R. D. Bailey Lake would
      be located south of Youghiogheny River Lake, not north of it.

      R. D. Bailey Lake is in southern West Virginia, in the Appalachian region.


      Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania, near the border with

      3) Pennsylvania is generally located north of West Virginia in terms of latitude.


      4) While there can be exceptions at border areas, R. D. Bailey Lake is in southern
      WV, not near the PA border.


      5) The Youghiogheny River Lake, even though in southwestern PA, is still at
      a higher latitude than southern West Virginia.


      Since R. D. Bailey Lake in West Virginia is located south of Youghiogheny River

      Specifically, it''s asking if R. D. Bailey Lake is located north of Youghiogheny
      River Lake.


      To answer this, I need to think about the general geography of West Virginia
      and Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is generally north of West Virginia. West Virginia
      is south of Pennsylvania.


      R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia, which suggests it''s likely south of

      Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania, which suggests it''s likely north
      of features in West Virginia.


      Based on the general geography of these states, I would expect that R. D. Bailey
      Lake (in WV) is south of Youghiogheny River Lake (in PA), not north of it.


      Therefore, the answer is likely NO, R. D. Bailey Lake is not located north of
      Youghiogheny River Lake.</think># Is R. D. Bailey Lake, WV located north of

      I need to consider the geographic locations of these two lakes:


      1. R. D. Bailey Lake is located in West Virginia (WV)

      2. Youghiogheny River Lake is located in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Looking at the general geography of these states:

      - Pennsylvania is positioned north of West Virginia

      - West Virginia is positioned south of Pennsylvania


      Since R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia (the more southern state) and Youghiogheny
      River Lake is in Pennsylvania (the more northern state), R. D. Bailey Lake would
      be south of Youghiogheny River Lake, not north of it.

      one is farther north.


      Step 1: Let me think about the general geography of West Virginia (WV) and Pennsylvania
      (PA).

      Pennsylvania is generally north of West Virginia. Pennsylvania borders West
      Virginia on West Virginia''s northern border.


      Step 2: Let''s consider the specific locations.

      R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia (WV).

      Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Given that Pennsylvania is generally north of West Virginia, and these lakes
      are in their respective states, it''s likely that Youghiogheny River Lake in
      PA is north of R. D. Bailey Lake in WV.


      However, I need to be cautious because state borders aren''t perfectly straight
      lines, and lakes could be in unusual portions of each state (like a northern
      part of WV or a southern part of PA).


      Step 3: Let me think about the specific locations of these lakes within their
      states.

      R. D. Bailey Lake is in southern West Virginia, in the Guyandotte River basin.

      Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania, spanning the PA-MD
      border.


      Given that Pennsylvania is north of West Virginia, and these lakes are in their
      standard regions of their states, Youghiogheny River Lake in PA would be north
      of R. D. Bailey Lake in WV.


      So, no, R. D. Bailey Lake, WV is NOT located north of Youghiogheny River Lake,
      PA. It''s the opposite - Youghiogheny River Lake, PA is north of R. D. Bailey
      Lake, WV.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      Let me determine the relative positions of these two lakes:


      1) First, I''ll consider the general geography of West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
      Pennsylvania is located directly north of West Virginia.


      2) R.D. Bailey Lake is located in Wyoming County in southern West Virginia,
      in the Guyandotte River basin.


      3) Youghiogheny River Lake is located in southwestern Pennsylvania (and partially
      in Maryland), in the Laurel Highlands region.


      4) Since Pennsylvania is north of West Virginia, and these lakes are in their
      respective states in typical locations (not in unusual border areas), Youghiogheny
      River Lake in PA would be north of R.D. Bailey Lake in WV.


      # Answer: NO


      R.D. Bailey Lake in West Virginia is NOT located north of Youghiogheny River
      Lake in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania lake is north of the West Virginia lake,
      following the general north-south arrangement of these two states.'

      to determine the locations of both R. D. Bailey Lake in West Virginia and Youghiogheny
      River Lake in Pennsylvania, and then compare their north-south positions.


      First, let me consider their states:

      - R. D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia (WV)

      - Youghiogheny River Lake is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is north of West Virginia. Pennsylvania borders
      West Virginia''s northern edge. This gives me an initial hypothesis that R.
      D. Bailey Lake might be south of Youghiogheny River Lake, but I need to check
      their specific locations within their respective states.


      Let me think about where these lakes are located more specifically:

      - R. D. Bailey Lake is in southern West Virginia

      - Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania, near the Maryland
      border


      Given these more specific locations, it seems likely that R. D. Bailey Lake
      in southern WV is south of Youghiogheny River Lake in southwestern PA. So the
      answer appears to be NO.</think>I''ll solve this by determining the relative
      positions of these two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general positions.

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located north of West Virginia (WV) on the US map.


      Step 2: Locate the specific bodies of water.

      - R. D. Bailey Lake is located in southern West Virginia, in the Guyandotte
      River basin.

      - Youghiogheny River Lake is located in southwestern Pennsylvania, near the
      Maryland border.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Even though both are in the southwestern portions of their respective states,
      since Pennsylvania itself is entirely north of West Virginia, Youghiogheny River
      Lake in PA would be at a higher latitude than R. D. Bailey Lake in southern
      WV.


      NO, R. D. Bailey Lake, WV is not located north of Youghiogheny River Lake, PA.
      It is located south of it.'

      Let me think about the geographical locations:


      1. West Virginia (WV) is a state that is generally south of Pennsylvania (PA).

      2. Pennsylvania is north of West Virginia.


      Since R.D. Bailey Lake is in West Virginia and Youghiogheny River Lake is in
      Pennsylvania, it''s likely that R.D. Bailey Lake is south of Youghiogheny River
      Lake.


      However, I should be careful because state borders are irregular, and lakes
      in border regions could have different relative positions than the general state
      positions.


      Based on my knowledge, R.D. Bailey Lake is located in southern West Virginia,
      while Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania, near the border
      with Maryland. Given the general geography of the region, I believe Youghiogheny

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Pennsylvania is generally north of West Virginia.


      Step 2: Locate the specific lakes.

      R. D. Bailey Lake is located in southern West Virginia in the Guyandotte River
      basin.

      Youghiogheny River Lake is located in southwestern Pennsylvania, near the Maryland
      border.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      R. D. Bailey Lake is positioned in the southern portion of West Virginia.

      Youghiogheny River Lake is in the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania.

      Even though Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern PA (one of the southernmost
      parts of the state), Pennsylvania''s southern border is still generally north
      of southern West Virginia where R. D. Bailey Lake is located.

      - The Pantages Theatre is in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN)


      Geographically, Minnesota is north of Iowa. Minnesota borders Canada to the
      north, while Iowa is south of Minnesota, sharing a border with it.


      Since Minneapolis is in Minnesota and Des Moines is in Iowa, generally Minneapolis
      is north of Des Moines.


      Therefore, the Basilica of St. John in Des Moines, Iowa would be SOUTH of the

      - The Pantages Theatre is in Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Minnesota is located directly north of Iowa on the US map. Minnesota borders

      Step 3: Consider the cities within these states.

      Minneapolis is a major city in Minnesota, while Des Moines is the capital city

      2) To determine if one is north of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.
      If the Basilica is at a higher latitude than the Pantages Theatre, then it''s
      north of it. Otherwise, it''s not.


      3) Des Moines, Iowa is located in the central part of Iowa, while Minneapolis,
      Minnesota is located in the southeastern part of Minnesota.


      4) Generally speaking, Minnesota is north of Iowa, as it borders Canada to the
      north while Iowa is entirely within the United States and south of Minnesota.


      5) Des Moines is in central Iowa, and Minneapolis is in southern Minnesota,
      but Minnesota as a whole is still north of Iowa.


      6) Therefore, the Basilica of St. John in Des Moines, Iowa would be south of

      3) Minnesota is directly north of Iowa in the United States

      4) Even though both cities aren''t at the extreme northern/southern ends of
      their respective states, Minneapolis is still significantly further north than
      Des Moines


      Since Minnesota is north of Iowa, and Minneapolis is in Minnesota while Des

      that Stockton Lake in Missouri is likely south of Saylorville Lake in Iowa,
      not north of it.


      To be more precise, I should consider the specific locations of these lakes
      within their respective states. However, given the general geographic arrangement
      of these states (Iowa is directly north of Missouri), it''s highly likely that
      Saylorville Lake in Iowa is north of Stockton Lake in Missouri.


      So my reasoning suggests that Stockton Lake, MO is NOT north of Saylorville
      Lake, IA - rather, it would be south of it.</think># Is Stockton Lake, MO located
      north of Saylorville Lake, IA?


      I need to think about the geographic locations of these two lakes and their
      respective states.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these lakes are located.

      - Stockton Lake is in Missouri (MO)

      - Saylorville Lake is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Iowa is located directly north of Missouri in the United States


      Step 3: Infer the likely relative positions of the lakes.

      - Since Iowa is north of Missouri, and these lakes are within their respective
      states, Saylorville Lake (in Iowa) is almost certainly north of Stockton Lake
      (in Missouri)


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on this geographic reasoning.

      - Stockton Lake in Missouri cannot be north of Saylorville Lake in Iowa, as
      it is in a state that lies south of Iowa

      1. Stockton Lake is in Missouri (MO).

      2. Saylorville Lake is in Iowa (IA).


      Geographically:

      - Missouri is a state that''s generally south of Iowa

      - Iowa borders Missouri on Missouri''s northern edge


      So based on the general geographic relationship between these states, it seems
      likely that Stockton Lake in Missouri would be south of Saylorville Lake in
      Iowa.


      To be more precise:

      - Stockton Lake is in southwestern Missouri

      - Saylorville Lake is near Des Moines in central Iowa


      Since Iowa is entirely north of Missouri, and these lakes are not at the extreme
      edges of their states that might create an exception, Stockton Lake would be
      south of Saylorville Lake, not north of it.</think># Is Stockton Lake, MO located

      2. Saylorville Lake is located in Iowa (IA)

      3. Iowa is a state that borders Missouri to the north

      4. Generally, locations in Missouri will be south of locations in Iowa

      5. Specifically, Stockton Lake is in southwest Missouri

      6. Saylorville Lake is near Des Moines in central Iowa


      Since Iowa is positioned entirely north of Missouri on the map, and these lakes
      are not in unusual border areas that might create exceptions, Stockton Lake
      must be south of Saylorville Lake, not north of it.

      3. First, let''s think about the states themselves. Missouri (MO) is generally
      south of Iowa (IA). Iowa borders Missouri on Missouri''s northern border.


      4. Since Stockton Lake is in Missouri and Saylorville Lake is in Iowa, there''s
      a good chance that Stockton Lake is south of Saylorville Lake (not north), but
      I need to be careful about the exact locations of these lakes within their respective

      5. Stockton Lake is in southwestern Missouri.


      6. Saylorville Lake is in central Iowa, near Des Moines.


      7. Given that Iowa is directly north of Missouri, and considering the locations
      of these lakes within their states, Stockton Lake (in Missouri) would be south
      of Saylorville Lake (in Iowa).

      Stockton Lake is located in Missouri (MO).

      Saylorville Lake is located in Iowa (IA).


      Step 3: Determine relative positioning.

      Since Missouri is south of Iowa, and these lakes are in their respective states,
      Stockton Lake would be south of Saylorville Lake, not north of it.

      Let me think about US geography:

      - Kentucky (KY) is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan (MI) is a state in the northern United States, bordering the Great
      Lakes


      Generally speaking, Michigan is north of Kentucky. Michigan is one of the northernmost
      states in the contiguous US, while Kentucky is more mid-south.


      Royal Oak is a city in Michigan, likely in the southern part of Michigan (near
      Detroit).

      Buckhorn Lake would be somewhere in Kentucky.


      Since Michigan is generally north of Kentucky, and Royal Oak is in Michigan
      while Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky, it''s very likely that Buckhorn Lake is
      NOT north of Royal Oak Music Theatre. Buckhorn Lake is likely south of Royal

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Kentucky is a southern/mid-south state

      - Michigan is a northern state that borders the Great Lakes


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Michigan is significantly north of Kentucky in the United States. Royal Oak
      is in the southern part of Michigan (near Detroit), but even southern Michigan
      is still north of Kentucky''s northernmost points.


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      Since Michigan is north of Kentucky, and these locations are in their respective

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Michigan is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - Kentucky is located in the southeastern/central United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Michigan is significantly north of Kentucky

      - Royal Oak is in the Detroit metropolitan area in southeastern Michigan

      - Buckhorn Lake is in eastern Kentucky


      Since Michigan is north of Kentucky, and these specific locations follow this

      First, let me identify where these places are:

      1. Buckhorn Lake is in Kentucky (KY)

      2. Royal Oak Music Theatre is in Michigan (MI)


      Now I need to determine their relative north-south positions. In the United

      - Kentucky is located south of Michigan, in the central-southern United States


      Step 3: Consider the locations within their states.

      - Even if Buckhorn Lake is in northern Kentucky and Royal Oak Music Theatre
      is in southern Michigan, the overall north-south relationship between the states
      would determine their relative positions.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Michigan is north of Kentucky, a location in Michigan (Royal Oak Music

      - Lake Bowen is in South Carolina (SC)

      - O''Reilly Theater is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic position of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, located in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States

      - Rosary Cathedral is in Toledo, Ohio


      Step 2: Think about the general geography of these states.

      Ohio is generally north of Kentucky. Ohio borders Lake Erie on its northern
      edge, while Kentucky is south of Ohio.


      Step 3: More specifically:

      - Toledo is in the northwestern part of Ohio, quite far north in the state (near

      - Berea is in central/eastern Kentucky


      Step 4: Based on this geographic knowledge, Toledo, Ohio should be significantly

      Given these general positions, it''s very likely that Toledo, Ohio (where Rosary

      To answer this question, I need to determine the approximate latitude of both
      locations:


      Maryland is generally south of New York state in the US. New York is a northern
      state bordering Canada, while Maryland is a mid-Atlantic state.


      Lake Centennial is in Maryland (specifically noted as being in Columbia, Maryland
      from my knowledge), which would place it in the central part of Maryland.


      Rondout Reservoir is in New York state, which is north of Maryland.


      Given the general geography of the United States, locations in New York state

      3) Geographically, New York state is positioned north of Maryland in the United
