      significant distance.


      4. To determine if Villa Rothschild is north of Clerkenwell tube station, I
      would need to compare their precise geographical coordinates.


      5. However, given their locations (Cannes in southern France, London in the
      UK), Villa Rothschild is actually south of Clerkenwell tube station.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I recognize Villa Rothschild is likely a location, and Clerkenwell
      tube station is in London.


      2. Villa Rothschild does not sound like a London location - it sounds more like
      it might be in France or another European country.


      3. I know Clerkenwell tube station is located in central London, specifically
      in the borough of Islington.


      4. Villa Rothschild, based on its name, is most likely located in France, probably
      near Nice or in the French Riviera region.


      5. If Villa Rothschild is in France and Clerkenwell tube station is in London,
      they cannot be directly compared in terms of north/south positioning.


      6. Therefore, the question cannot be answered with a simple geographical north/south
      comparison.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. Since the location of Villa
      Rothschild is not in proximity to Clerkenwell tube station, the most appropriate
      answer is:


      NO'

      - This is a reservoir on the Missouri River, located in South Dakota, United
      States

      - It is situated in the northern part of the United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate Church of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock:

      - Baldock is a town in Hertfordshire, England

      - This church is located in the United Kingdom

      - The United Kingdom is south of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Lewis and Clark Lake is in South Dakota, which is in the northern hemisphere

      - The Church of St Mary the Virgin is in England, which is also in the northern
      hemisphere

      - However, Lewis and Clark Lake is much further north than the church in Baldock


      4. Therefore, Lewis and Clark Lake is indeed located north of the Church of
      St Mary the Virgin, Baldock.

      - Laoag Cathedral is located in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte province, Philippines

      - This is in the northern part of the Philippines


      2. Next, locate Chestermere Lake:

      - Chestermere Lake is located in Alberta, Canada
