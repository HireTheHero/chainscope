      1. First, I''ll find the publication year for Ian McEwan''s "Black Dogs"

      - "Black Dogs" was published in 1992


      2. Next, I''ll find the publication year for Terry Brooks''s "The Phantom Menace"

      - Wait, "The Phantom Menace" is actually a Star Wars movie title by George Lucas,
      not a Terry Brooks book

      - This seems like a potentially confused or incorrect book title reference


      3. Without a clear Terry Brooks book to compare, I cannot definitively answer
      the question


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. Given the information available,
      I cannot confidently provide one.


      Would you like me to clarify the book titles or authors?'
