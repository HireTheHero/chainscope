      is located east of Boone Lake in Tennessee, we need to consider their geographic
      locations in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Big Hill Lake, Kansas.

      - Big Hill Lake is located in southeastern Kansas, near the town of Cherryvale.

      - Kansas is in the central part of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Boone Lake, Tennessee.

      - Boone Lake is located in northeastern Tennessee, near the city of Johnson

      - Sparks Shot Tower is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Understand US geography.


      - Pennsylvania is on the eastern side of the United States.

      - Illinois is located more centrally in the United States, west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Consider relative positions.


      - Philadelphia, PA is significantly east of Peoria, IL.

      - Therefore, the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Peoria
      is west of the Sparks Shot Tower in Philadelphia.

      - Nashville Municipal Auditorium is located in Nashville, Tennessee.

      - The Cathedral of All Souls is located in Asheville, North Carolina.


      **Step 2: Understand longitude**

      - Longitude measures how far east or west a location is.

      - The more negative the longitude (in the Western Hemisphere), the farther west
      the location is.

      - So, a location with a longitude of -86 is west of a location with a longitude
      of -82.


      **Step 3: Find the approximate longitudes**

      - Nashville, TN is approximately at longitude **-86.78**.

      - Asheville, NC is approximately at longitude **-82.55**.


      **Step 4: Compare**

      - Since -86.78 (Nashville) is less than -82.55 (Asheville), Nashville is farther

      \ state of New York, specifically in Albany County.\n- New York is on the East\
      \ Coast of the United States.\n- Its approximate longitude is around 74.00\xB0\
      W.\n\nStep 3: Compare the longitudes.\n\n- The longitude of Chicago (~87.62\xB0\
      W) is a larger number (further west) than the longitude of the Basic Creek Reservoir\
      \ (~74.00\xB0W), since longitude increases as you move westward in the Western\

      Step 1: Identify the location of St. Ambrose Cathedral.

      - St. Ambrose Cathedral is located in Des Moines, which is the capital city
      of the state of Iowa.

      - Des Moines is in the central part of Iowa, which is in the Midwestern United

      1. Identify the locations of both reservoirs.

      2. Compare their longitudinal coordinates or general positions relative to each
      other.


      Step 1: Locate Lake Icaria, Iowa.

      - Lake Icaria is a reservoir located near Corning in Adams County, southwestern
      Iowa.

      - Iowa is in the central United States, and Adams County is in the western half
      of the state.


      Step 2: Locate Meander Creek Reservoir, Ohio.

      - Meander Creek Reservoir is located near Austintown and Canfield in Mahoning
      County, northeastern Ohio.

      - Ohio is located east of Iowa, and Mahoning County is in the eastern part of
      Ohio, very close to the Pennsylvania border.


      Step 3: Compare positions.

      - Since Iowa is west of Ohio, and both specific locations within their states
      align with this general east-west orientation (Lake Icaria in southwestern Iowa
      and Meander Creek Reservoir in northeastern Ohio), it follows that Lake Icaria
      is west of Meander Creek Reservoir.

      Virginia. It is situated along the Ohio River, which forms much of the western
      border of West Virginia.

      - This places the power station in the western part of the state.

      - Fairfax County is in northern Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C.,
      and is significantly farther east than most of West Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their locations.

      - Since Pleasants Power Station is in western West Virginia and Lake Accotink
      is in northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., Lake Accotink is clearly to the
      east of the power station.
