      within Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Considering Youghiogheny River Lake''s location in Pennsylvania:

      - The Youghiogheny River flows through the southwestern part of Pennsylvania.

      - Youghiogheny River Lake would therefore be in the southwestern region of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Comparing the two locations:

      - Brookville Lake Dam is in eastern Indiana.

      - Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania.

      - Even though Pennsylvania is generally east of Indiana, the southwestern part
      of Pennsylvania may be closer in longitude to eastern Indiana.

      - However, Pennsylvania''s western border is still east of Indiana''s eastern
      border.


      NO - Brookville Lake Dam in Indiana is not east of Youghiogheny River Lake in
      Pennsylvania. Since Indiana is entirely west of Pennsylvania, any location in
      Indiana (including Brookville Lake Dam) would be west of locations in Pennsylvania

      - Lake Francis Case is a reservoir on the Missouri River in South Dakota.

      - St. Raphael''s Cathedral is in Dubuque, Iowa, which is on the eastern border
      of Iowa along the Mississippi River.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the states.

      - South Dakota is west of Iowa in the United States.

      - The Missouri River in South Dakota is entirely within the western portion
      of the Midwest region.

      - Dubuque is on the far eastern edge of Iowa, bordering Illinois and Wisconsin
      at the Mississippi River.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Since South Dakota is west of Iowa, and Lake Francis Case is in South Dakota,
      while Dubuque is on the eastern edge of Iowa, Lake Francis Case must be west
      of St. Raphael''s Cathedral.


      NO, Lake Francis Case, SD is not located east of St. Raphael''s Cathedral in
      Dubuque, Iowa. It is located to the west.'

      - Aladdin Theater is in Portland, Oregon, which is in the northwestern United
      States.

      - Hebgen Lake is in Montana, which is also in the northwestern United States,
      but east of Oregon.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions.

      - Oregon is located on the Pacific coast.

      - Montana is an inland state, located to the east of Oregon.

      - Portland is in the northern part of Oregon, near its western border.

      - Hebgen Lake is in the southwestern part of Montana, near Yellowstone National
      Park.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Since Montana is east of Oregon, and Hebgen Lake is in Montana while the Aladdin
      Theater is in Portland, Oregon, Hebgen Lake must be east of the Aladdin Theater.

      - Therefore, the Aladdin Theater cannot be east of Hebgen Lake; it is west of
      Hebgen Lake.


      NO'

      Step 1: Let me identify where Portland, Oregon is located. Portland is in the

      Step 2: Let me identify where Hebgen Lake, Montana is located. Hebgen Lake is
      in southwestern Montana, near the border with Idaho and Wyoming, not far from
      Yellowstone National Park.


      Step 3: Now I need to determine their east-west relationship. The United States
      generally follows a pattern where locations further east have higher longitude
      values (measured in degrees east of the Prime Meridian).


      Step 4: Montana is east of Oregon in the United States. Portland is on the western
      side of Oregon, while Hebgen Lake is in the southwestern part of Montana.


      Step 5: Even though Hebgen Lake is in the western part of Montana, Montana as
      a whole is east of Oregon. The western edge of Montana is still east of Portland,
      Oregon.


      Therefore, Aladdin Theater in Portland, Oregon is located WEST of Hebgen Lake,
      Montana, not east of it.

      Step 1: Let me identify where Hershey, PA is located. Hershey is in central
      Pennsylvania, not far from Harrisburg (the state capital).


      Step 2: Let me identify where Southampton, NY is located. Southampton is on
      the eastern end of Long Island, New York.

      eastward from New York City into the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 4: Compare the relative east-west positions. While New York state is generally
      east of Pennsylvania, Southampton is specifically on the far eastern end of
      Long Island, which puts it significantly east of central Pennsylvania where
      Hershey is located.

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between California and
      Arizona.

      - Arizona is located east of California in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Yorba Linda is in southern California, in Orange County.

      - Black Canyon Lake is in east-central Arizona in the Apache-Sitgreaves National
      Forest.


      Step 4: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since California is west of Arizona, and these locations are not in unusual
      border areas that might create exceptions, Friends Church in Yorba Linda, CA
      would be west of Black Canyon Lake, AZ.

      - This means Black Canyon Lake, AZ is east of Friends Church in Yorba Linda,

      - Shasta Dam is in northern California, near Redding

      - Salt Lake City (where Grand America Hotel is located) is in northern Utah


      Step 4: In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - California locations are generally west of Utah locations

      - Since Shasta Dam is in California and Grand America Hotel is in Utah, Shasta
      Dam would be west of Grand America Hotel

      - This means Grand America Hotel would be east of Shasta Dam


      Therefore, Shasta Dam is NOT east of Grand America Hotel. It''s the opposite

      I''ll solve this step by step by determining the locations of both landmarks
      and comparing their east-west positions.


      ## Step 1: Locate the Basilica of San Albino

      The Basilica of San Albino is located in Mesilla, New Mexico, which is in the
      southern part of New Mexico near Las Cruces.


      ## Step 2: Locate King Mountain Wind Farm

      King Mountain Wind Farm is located in Upton County, Texas, which is in west
      Texas.


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - New Mexico is generally west of Texas

      - Mesilla, NM is in southern New Mexico near the Texas border

      - Upton County, TX is in west Texas

      - In the United States, lower longitude numbers indicate more western locations


      However, since Mesilla is in the southern part of New Mexico near the border
      with Texas, and Upton County is in west Texas (not far east Texas), I need to
      consider their specific positions.


      Based on geography, west Texas (where King Mountain Wind Farm is located) is
      east of southern New Mexico (where the Basilica of San Albino is located). New
      Mexico is west of Texas overall, and this holds true even when comparing the
      western part of Texas to the southern part of New Mexico.
