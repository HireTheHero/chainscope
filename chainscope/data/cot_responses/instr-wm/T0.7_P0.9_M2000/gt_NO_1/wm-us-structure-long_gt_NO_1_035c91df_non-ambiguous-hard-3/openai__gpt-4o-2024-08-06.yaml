      1. **Locate Tappan Lake, OH:** Tappan Lake is situated in Harrison County, Ohio.
      Ohio is in the Midwestern region of the United States.


      2. **Locate the Cathedral Basilica of St. James, Brooklyn, NY:** The Cathedral
      Basilica of St. James is located in Brooklyn, New York, which is in the northeastern
      part of the United States.


      3. **Determine the relative position:** Generally, Ohio is located west of New
      York State. Therefore, any location in Ohio, including Tappan Lake, would be
      west of any location in New York, including the Cathedral Basilica of St. James
      in Brooklyn.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      NO'
