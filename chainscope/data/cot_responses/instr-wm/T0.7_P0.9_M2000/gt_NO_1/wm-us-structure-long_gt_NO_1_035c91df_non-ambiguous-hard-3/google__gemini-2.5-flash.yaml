      answer.


      **Step 1: Locate Brookville Lake Dam, IN**

      * Brookville, Indiana is in the eastern part of Indiana.

      * Indiana is in the **Central Time Zone**, and its eastern border is roughly
      at 85 degrees West longitude.

      * Let''s say Brookville is approximately at **85 degrees West longitude**.


      **Step 2: Locate Youghiogheny River Lake, PA**

      * Youghiogheny River Lake is in southwestern Pennsylvania.

      * Pennsylvania is in the **Eastern Time Zone**.

      * Southwestern Pennsylvania is significantly east of Indiana.

      * Specifically, the western border of Pennsylvania is around 80 degrees West
      longitude. Youghiogheny River Lake is within Pennsylvania, so it will be **east
      of 80 degrees West longitude**, perhaps around 79-80 degrees West.


      **Step 3: Compare Longitudes**

      * Brookville Lake Dam, IN: ~85 degrees West

      * Youghiogheny River Lake, PA: ~79-80 degrees West


      **Key Principle:** The smaller the West longitude number, the further East the
      location is.


      * 85 degrees West is a larger number than 79-80 degrees West.

      * Therefore, 85 degrees West is **west** of 79-80 degrees West.


      **Conclusion:** Brookville Lake Dam, IN is located **west** of Youghiogheny
      River Lake, PA.

      \ 120\xB0W. Therefore, Panguitch Lake, UT is East of California.\n\nSince the\
      \ question asks if San Andreas Lake, CA, is located *east* of Panguitch Lake,\

      would be **California**.


      2.  **Identify Panguitch Lake, UT:** This is a real and well-known lake. Its
      location is **Utah**.


      3.  **Determine relative positions of California and Utah:** California is to
      the west of Utah.


      4.  **Compare "San Andreas Lake, CA" (interpreted as being in California) with
      Panguitch Lake, UT (in Utah):** Since California is west of Utah, anything in
      California would be to the west of something in Utah.


      Therefore, San Andreas Lake, CA (interpreted as being in California) is located
      *west* of Panguitch Lake, UT.

      answer.


      **Step 1: Determine the location of Gibson Generating Station, IL.**

      A quick search reveals that Gibson Generating Station is located in **Gibson
      City, Illinois**.


      **Step 2: Determine the location of Mountaineer Wind Energy Center, WV.**

      A quick search reveals that Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is located near **Keyser,
      West Virginia**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes of the two locations.**

      *   Gibson City, IL: Approximately **-88.37 degrees West longitude**

      *   Keyser, WV: Approximately **-79.16 degrees West longitude**


      **Step 4: Interpret the longitudes in terms of East/West position.**

      On a map, as you move from left to right (West to East), the *negative longitude
      values become less negative* (closer to zero).


      *   -88.37 is further west than -79.16.

      *   Therefore, Keyser, WV (-79.16) is geographically to the east of Gibson City,
      IL (-88.37).


      **Step 5: Answer the question.**

      The question is: "Is Gibson Generating Station, IL located east of Mountaineer
      Wind Energy Center, WV?"


      Since Gibson Generating Station is at -88.37 and Mountaineer Wind Energy Center
      is at -79.16, Gibson Generating Station is *west* of Mountaineer Wind Energy
      Center.


      **NO**'

      1.  **Locate Rosary Cathedral (Toledo, Ohio):** Toledo, Ohio is in the Midwest,
      specifically in the western part of Ohio.

      2.  **Locate Barrow Street Theatre (New York, NY):** New York City is on the
      East Coast of the United States.

      3.  **Determine relative longitudes:** Generally, places further west in the
      US have a higher longitude (closer to 180 degrees west), while places further
      east have a lower longitude (closer to 0 degrees west). Since Toledo, OH is
      west of New York City, NY, its longitude will be a larger negative number (e.g.,
      around -83 degrees) compared to New York City (e.g., around -74 degrees).

      4.  **Interpret "east of":** For a location A to be "east of" location B, location
      A must have a smaller longitude (i.e., be geographically to the right on a standard
      map) than location B.


      Based on this, Toledo, OH is geographically *west* of New York, NY. Therefore,
      Rosary Cathedral (Toledo, Ohio) is *not* located east of Barrow Street Theatre,
      NY; it is located west of it.


      **NO**'

      Genetti Hotel, PA is located east of Durfee Hall, CT.


      **Step 1: Determine the longitude of Durfee Hall, CT.**

      Durfee Hall is located at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

      A quick search for "Durfee Hall Yale University longitude" or "Yale University
      longitude" gives an approximate longitude of **-72.93 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Determine the longitude of Genetti Hotel, PA.**

      There are multiple Genetti Hotels in Pennsylvania, but the most prominent and
      likely one referred to is the **Genetti Hotel & Conference Center in Williamsport,
      PA**.

      A quick search for "Genetti Hotel Williamsport PA longitude" gives an approximate
      longitude of **-77.01 degrees West**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   Durfee Hall, CT: -72.93 degrees West

      *   Genetti Hotel, PA: -77.01 degrees West


      On a longitude scale, as you move east, the negative number gets closer to zero
      (or becomes less negative).

      *   -72.93 is *greater* than -77.01.


      Therefore, the location with the longitude of -72.93 degrees West is *east*
      of the location with the longitude of -77.01 degrees West.


      This means Durfee Hall, CT is east of Genetti Hotel, PA.


      The question asks: "Is Genetti Hotel, PA located east of Durfee Hall, CT?"


      Since Durfee Hall, CT is east of Genetti Hotel, PA, it means Genetti Hotel,
      PA is *west* of Durfee Hall, CT.
