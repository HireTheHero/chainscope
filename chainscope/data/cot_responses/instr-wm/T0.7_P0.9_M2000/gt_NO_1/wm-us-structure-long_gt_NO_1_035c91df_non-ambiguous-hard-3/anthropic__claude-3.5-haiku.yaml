    edd1f990-cf93-4403-beb3-7f74f3baff80: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Aladdin Theater in Portland, Oregon

      - Portland is in the western part of Oregon


      2. Next, locate Hebgen Lake in Montana

      - Hebgen Lake is in southwestern Montana, near the border with Wyoming


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Portland, Oregon is west of Hebgen Lake, Montana

      - This means Aladdin Theater is west of Hebgen Lake


      4. The question asks: "Is Aladdin Theater located east of Hebgen Lake?"

      - Since Aladdin Theater is west of Hebgen Lake, it is NOT east of Hebgen Lake

      Since Big Hill Lake is west of Tennessee, and Boone Lake is in Tennessee, Big
      Hill Lake is west of Boone Lake.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      5. The question asks if it is east of the Cyclorama Building.


      Since the power plant is west, not east, of the Cyclorama Building, the answer
      is:


      NO'
    efcd394c-1cfd-4f37-983c-0372f3e828e2: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Muskingum River Power Plant in Ohio

      2. Then, I''ll locate Cyclorama Building at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

      3. I''ll determine their relative east-west positions


      Muskingum River Power Plant is located in southeastern Ohio, near Marietta.

      Gettysburg is located in southern Pennsylvania.


      Looking at a map, Muskingum River Power Plant is west of Gettysburg.


      Therefore, the Muskingum River Power Plant is NOT east of the Cyclorama Building
      at Gettysburg.


      The answer is: NO'

      - These locations are in different states, separated by a significant distance


      4. Determining east/west positioning:

      - New York is east of Illinois

      - Therefore, Beacon Reservoir is east of Skokie Lagoons, not the other way around


      5. The question asks: "Is Skokie Lagoons, IL located east of Beacon Reservoir?"

      - The answer is NO, because Beacon Reservoir is east of Skokie Lagoons, not
      the other way around

      1. First, I''ll locate Fort Worth, Texas on a map

      - Fort Worth is in northern Texas, in the western part of the state


      2. Next, I''ll locate Birmingham, Alabama on a map

      - Birmingham is in northern Alabama, in the eastern part of the state


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Fort Worth is west of Birmingham

      - This means any location in Fort Worth will be west of any location in Birmingham


      4. The question asks if the Blackstone Hotel (in Fort Worth) is east of the
      Independent Presbyterian Church (in Birmingham)

      - Since Fort Worth is west of Birmingham, the Blackstone Hotel is west of the

      - This is in Southern California, specifically Santa Barbara County

      - Santa Barbara is located on the California coast, west of the mountain ranges


      2. Next, I''ll locate the Hyatt Regency Phoenix

      - This is in Phoenix, Arizona

      - Phoenix is located in the desert region of central Arizona


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Santa Barbara is west of Phoenix

      - This means Our Lady of Sorrows Church is west of the Hyatt Regency Phoenix


      4. The question asks: "Is Our Lady of Sorrows Church located east of Hyatt Regency
      Phoenix?"

      - Since the church is west of the Hyatt Regency Phoenix, it is NOT east of it

      1. First, I''ll locate Pomme de Terre Lake in Missouri

      2. Then, I''ll locate Sutton Lake in West Virginia

      3. Then I''ll compare their geographical positions


      Step 1: Pomme de Terre Lake is located in central Missouri, in the west-central
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Sutton Lake is located in north-central West Virginia.


      Step 3: Comparing their positions:

      - Missouri is west of West Virginia

      - Pomme de Terre Lake is in the western part of Missouri

      - Sutton Lake is in the eastern part of West Virginia


      Therefore, Pomme de Terre Lake is WEST of Sutton Lake, not east.
