      \ Giuseppe has a larger area than the Department of Loreto, let's break it down\
      \ step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Location and Context**:\n   - San Marzano\
      \ di San Giuseppe is a small town in Italy.\n   - The Department of Loreto refers\
      \ to a region in Peru, which is a larger administrative division similar to\
      \ a state or province.\n\n2. **Determine the Area of Each**:\n   - San Marzano\
      \ di San Giuseppe is a town and, like most towns, it covers a relatively small\
      \ area. The area of San Marzano di San Giuseppe is approximately 19 square kilometers.\n\
      \   - The Department of Loreto is the largest department in Peru. It covers\
      \ an area of approximately 368,852 square kilometers.\n\n3. **Compare the Two\
      \ Areas**:\n   - The Department of Loreto, with its vast area of 368,852 square\
