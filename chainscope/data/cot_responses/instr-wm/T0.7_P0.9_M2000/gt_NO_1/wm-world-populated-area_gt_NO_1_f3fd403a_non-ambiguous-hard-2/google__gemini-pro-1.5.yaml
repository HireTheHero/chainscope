      2. **Consider the typical size of towns vs. departments:**  Departments (similar
      to provinces or states) are generally much larger than towns.


      3. **Reasoning:**  A town in Italy is extremely unlikely to be larger than a
      department in Peru.

      while towns are smaller.


      3. **Infer the likely size difference:** Given the typical size difference between
      a town and a department, it''s highly probable that the Department of Loreto
      is larger than San Marzano di San Giuseppe.
