      First, I need to identify both places:

      - San Marzano di San Giuseppe is a municipality in Italy

      - Department of Loreto is a department (administrative division) in Peru


      Now I need to find their respective areas:

      - San Marzano di San Giuseppe has an area of approximately 19 square kilometers
