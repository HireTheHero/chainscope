      Step 1: Identify Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt.

      Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was a German nobleman who lived in the 16th-17th
      centuries. He was born around 1550-1560.


      Step 2: Identify Louis King.

      This is challenging because "Louis King" could refer to:

      - A person with the first name Louis and surname King

      - Any of several kings named Louis (Louis I through Louis XVIII of France, etc.)


      Without specific information about which "Louis King" is meant, I cannot make
      a definitive comparison. However, if we''re referring to a modern person named
      Louis King, they would almost certainly have been born later than a 16th century
      nobleman.


      If we''re referring to French kings named Louis, most lived between the 8th
      and 19th centuries. The earliest, Louis I (Louis the Pious), was born in 778,
      while the latest, Louis XVIII, was born in 1755.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt (born ~1550-1560) was born:

      - Later than early French kings named Louis (I through XIV)

      - Possibly around the same time as Louis XV (born 1710)

      - Earlier than Louis XVIII (born 1755)

      - Earlier than any modern person named Louis King


      Given the ambiguity about which "Louis King" is referenced, I cannot give a
      definitive answer.


      NO, Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was not born later than most historical
      figures named Louis who were kings, as he lived in the 16th century while many
      kings named Louis lived earlier. However, he was born earlier than the later
      Louis kings and any modern person named Louis King.'

      Step 1: Identify Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt.

      Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt appears to be a historical figure from a
      noble German family (Zobel von Giebelstadt). Based on the name structure and
      "von" title, he was likely from the medieval or early modern period in German
      history.


      Step 2: Identify which Louis King is being referenced.

      This is ambiguous as "Louis King" could be:

      - A person with the first name Louis and surname King

      - Any of the many King Louis (I through XVIII) of France

      - Kings named Louis from other countries


      Step 3: Without specific birth dates for either individual, I cannot make a

      Since I don''t have sufficient information about either person''s birth date,
      I cannot determine who was born earlier or later.


      NO


      (Note: I''ve answered "no" because I cannot verify that Johann Georg Zobel von

      Step 1: Identify Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt.

      Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt appears to be a historical German noble figure,
      likely from the Zobel von Giebelstadt family which was a noble family from Franconia,
      Germany. Based on the name structure and "von Giebelstadt" title, he would have
      lived sometime between the medieval period and the 19th century.

      This is challenging because "Louis King" could refer to:

      - A person with the first name Louis and surname King

      Given the limitations in my information, I cannot determine with confidence

      NO, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this question based on
      the information available to me.'

      von Giebelstadt and Louis King were born to compare their birth dates.


      Step 1: Identify Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt.

      Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was a German nobleman who lived in the 16th-17th
      centuries. He was born in 1577.


      Step 2: Identify Louis King.

      This is tricky because "Louis King" could be interpreted in different ways:

      - It could refer to a person with the first name Louis and surname King

      - It could refer to a King named Louis (of which there were many in various
      countries)


      Since the question appears to be comparing historical figures, I''ll assume
      it refers to a King named Louis. There were many King Louis in history, particularly
      in France (Louis I through Louis XVIII), spanning from the 8th century to the
      19th century.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Even the earliest King Louis (Louis I of France, also known as Louis the Pious)
      was born in 778, which is earlier than Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt (born
      1577).

      The latest King Louis (Louis XVIII of France) was born in 1755, which is still
      earlier than Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion.

      Since Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt (born 1577) was born later than any
      King Louis I can identify, the answer would be YES.


      However, if "Louis King" refers to a person with that specific name rather than
      a monarch, I would need different information to answer accurately.


      Based on the most likely interpretation of historical King Louis figures: YES'

      Step 1: Identify Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt.

      Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt appears to be a historical noble from the
      Zobel von Giebelstadt family, likely from Germany. While I don''t have his exact
      birth date in my knowledge base, the naming convention and "von Giebelstadt"
      title suggests he was likely born between the 15th-18th centuries.


      Step 2: Identify Louis King.

      Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was a German nobleman who lived in the 16th-17th
      centuries. He was born in 1598.


      Step 2: Identify Louis King.

      This is challenging because "Louis King" could refer to several people. If this

      Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt appears to be a historical noble from the
      Zobel von Giebelstadt family, which was a German noble family. Based on the

      If referring to a person with surname "King," I don''t have definitive information
      about a notable historical figure with this exact name and birth date.

      If referring to French kings named Louis, they range from Louis I (born 778)

      Heinrich von Isny (also known as Heinrich II of Isny) was a German Dominican
      friar who became Bishop of Basel and later Archbishop of Mainz. He lived in
      the 13th century, with his death occurring in 1288. He was likely born in the
      early 13th century, around 1200-1220.

      Francesco III Gonzaga was Duke of Mantua and Duke of Montferrat from 1540 to
      1550. He was born on March 10, 1533.


      Step 2: Find Johann Konrad Dippel''s birth year.

      Johann Konrad Dippel was a German theologian, alchemist, and physician. He was
      born on August 10, 1673.


      Step 3: Compare the birth years.

      Francesco III Gonzaga: born in 1533

      Johann Konrad Dippel: born in 1673


      Step 4: Determine who was born later.

      1673 is later than 1533, so Johann Konrad Dippel was born later than Francesco
      III Gonzaga.


      Since the question asks if Francesco III Gonzaga was born later than Johann
      Konrad Dippel, and we''ve established that the opposite is true:


      NO'

      would need his exact birth year, but based on available information, both lived
      in roughly the same period.


      Since the more well-known Jacques Tourneur is the film director born in 1904,
