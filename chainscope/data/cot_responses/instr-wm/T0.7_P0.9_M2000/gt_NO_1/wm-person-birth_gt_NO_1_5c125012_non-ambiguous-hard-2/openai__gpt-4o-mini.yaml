      is not well-documented, but it is generally accepted that he lived around the
      early medieval period.

      period. He is known to have lived during the 3rd century, specifically during
      the Three Kingdoms period, which is generally dated from 220 to 280 AD.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - If Corentin of Quimper is considered to have been born in the 5th or 6th century,

      - Liang Jiong, on the other hand, lived in the 3rd century, which would place
      his lifetime around 200-300 AD.


      Since the 5th or 6th century (when Corentin was likely born) is later than the

      The answer to the question is **NO**, Marie de Coucy was not born later than
      Eduard Duller.'
    b525fc54-9e2b-475d-bde4-a7d199bf911d: 'To determine if Marie de Coucy was born
      later than Eduard Duller, we need to establish the birth dates of both individuals.


      1. **Marie de Coucy**: She was born around 1350. Historical records indicate
      she was a French noblewoman from the 14th century.


      2. **Eduard Duller**: There is limited widely known historical information about
      Eduard Duller, and he does not appear to be a prominent historical figure. However,
      if we assume he was a figure from a later time, we would need to find his birth
      date to compare.


      Assuming Eduard Duller was born in the 19th century (which is a common assumption
      for less prominent figures), he would have been born after 1800.


      Given that Marie de Coucy was born around 1350 and Eduard Duller, if he was
      indeed born in the 19th century, would have been born much later, we can conclude
      that:


      Marie de Coucy was born significantly earlier than Eduard Duller.


      Thus, the answer to the question "Was Marie de Coucy born later than Eduard
      Duller?" is:


      **NO**.'
    d7cd0b52-a30a-4783-80c5-d67add2a637b: 'To answer the question, we need to determine
      the birth dates of both Marie de Coucy and Eduard Duller.


      1. **Marie de Coucy**: She was born around 1340. She was a historical figure
      known for her role in the 14th century, particularly in relation to the Hundred
      Years'' War.


      2. **Eduard Duller**: There is no widely recognized historical figure by this
      name, and it is possible that the name may refer to a less known individual
      or could be a misspelling. However, without specific information on Eduard Duller,
      it''s challenging to establish a birth date.


      Given that Marie de Coucy was born in the 14th century, if Eduard Duller was
      a historical figure from a later period, then the answer would likely be YES.
      Conversely, if Eduard Duller was born earlier than 1340, the answer would be
      NO.


      Since we don''t have clear information about Eduard Duller, it''s difficult
      to definitively answer the question. However, based on the available data, if
      we assume that he is a figure from a later time period, the answer would be:


      **YES**.'
