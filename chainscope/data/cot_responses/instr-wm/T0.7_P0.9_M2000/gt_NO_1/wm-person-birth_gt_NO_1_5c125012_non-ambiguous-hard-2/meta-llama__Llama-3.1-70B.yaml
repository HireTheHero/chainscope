      Now, we need to compare their birth years. Heinrich von Isny was born around
      1325, and Caterina Martinelli was born in 1589. Since 1589 is later than 1325,
      we can conclude that Caterina Martinelli was born later than Heinrich von Isny.

      of King Christian IV of Denmark. According to historical records, Anna was born
      on August 14, 1575.


      3. **Henriette von Crayen**: She was a German noblewoman. Unfortunately, I don''t
      have information on her birth date, as she is not as widely documented as Anna
      of Oldenburg.


      4. **Comparison of birth dates**: Since we don''t have the birth date for Henriette
      von Crayen, we can''t make a direct comparison.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that we don''t have the birth date for Henriette von
