      1. **Richard de Umfraville**: Richard de Umfraville, Earl of Angus, was an English
      nobleman who lived during the 13th century. He is often noted as having been
      active during the late 13th century, but specific birth years are not always
      clearly documented. However, he is generally considered to have been born around
      the mid-13th century, roughly between 1240 and 1250.


      2. **Jeanne d''Avaugour**: Jeanne d''Avaugour was a Breton noblewoman, and her
      birth is generally placed around 1280. She is known for her marriage to Robert
      IV of Dreux.


      Now, compare the estimated birth years:


      - Richard de Umfraville: c. 1240-1250

      - Jeanne d''Avaugour: c. 1280


      Based on these estimates, Richard de Umfraville was born earlier than Jeanne
      d''Avaugour.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'

      1. **Richard de Umfraville**: Richard de Umfraville was an English nobleman

      Since both individuals were active in the 13th century, we need to compare their
      likely birth periods more closely. Unfortunately, without exact birth dates,
      we can only make general assumptions based on historical records.


      Given the lack of precise birth dates and considering the general time frames
      in which they were active, it is not possible to definitively state that Richard
      de Umfraville was born later than Jeanne d''Avaugour or vice versa. Historical
