    08ef521e-edb7-4f9f-b867-b95c0f5ce3e2: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Nicholas Eymerich was a Spanish Dominican friar and inquisitor who lived
      from 1320 to 1399.


      2. Angelo Sala was an Italian physician and chemist who lived from 1576 to 1637.


      3. Comparing their birth years:

      - Eymerich: born in 1320

      - Sala: born in 1576


      4. 1320 comes before 1576, meaning Eymerich was born earlier than Sala.


      5. The question asks if Eymerich was born later than Sala, which is the opposite
      of what we found.

      1. First, let me identify when Gerard I of Toul lived:

      - Gerard I of Toul died in 994

      - He became Bishop of Toul in 963

      - Based on typical age patterns for bishops, he was likely born around 920-935

      1) First, let me find when Gerard de Lisle, 1st Baron Lisle was born

      - Gerard de Lisle was born around 1304


      2) Next, let me find when Elizabeth Fulhame was born

      - Elizabeth Fulhame was active in the late 18th century

      - She published her major work in 1794

      - Her exact birth date is not known but she was likely born in the mid-18th
      century (around 1750s)


      3) Now I can compare:

      - Gerard de Lisle: born around 1304

      - Elizabeth Fulhame: born around 1750s

      - 1304 is earlier than 1750s


      Therefore, Gerard de Lisle was NOT born later than Elizabeth Fulhame.

      - She was born around 1334

      - Christoph Christian von Dabelow was a German jurist

      - He was born in 1768

      - He died in 1830


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Margaret Graham: born c. 1334

      - Christoph Christian von Dabelow: born 1768

      - 1334 comes before 1768


      Therefore, Margaret Graham was NOT born later than von Dabelow.

      1. First, let me find when Roger Niger lived:

      - Roger Niger (also known as Roger le Noir) died in 1241

      - He was Bishop of London

      - He was likely born in the late 12th century, probably around 1170-1180


      2. Now, let me find when Jacobus Voorda lived:

      - Jacobus Voorda was a Dutch legal scholar

      - He lived from 1698 to 1768

      - So he was born in 1698


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Roger Niger: born around 1170-1180

      - Jacobus Voorda: born in 1698

      - 1170s is earlier than 1698


      Therefore, the answer is: NO

      (Roger Niger was NOT born later than Jacobus Voorda - he was born about 500

      1. First, let me find when Elisabeth of Bohemia lived

      - Elisabeth of Bohemia was born in 1618

      - She died in 1680


      2. Now, let me find when Suzy Covey lived

      - Suzy Covey was a computer scientist and educator

      - She lived in the 20th century

      - She passed away in 2007


      3. Compare the dates

      - Elisabeth of Bohemia: born 1618

      - Suzy Covey: born in the 20th century (1900s)

      - Therefore, Elisabeth was born about 300 years before Suzy Covey

    a6d192ce-d034-4241-b1e1-aab1bf2c6a16: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me find when John V, Lord of Arkel lived:

      - John V of Arkel lived from 1362 to 1428


      2. Next, let me find when Cyriacus Spangenberg lived:

      - Cyriacus Spangenberg lived from 1528 to 1604


      3. Now I can compare their birth years:

      - John V of Arkel: born in 1362

      - Cyriacus Spangenberg: born in 1528

      - 1362 comes before 1528


      4. Therefore, John V of Arkel was born EARLIER than Cyriacus Spangenberg, not
      later.

      4. The question asks if Harsigny was born later than Morlaiter

      - Since 1300 comes before 1699, Harsigny was born EARLIER, not later


      NO'
    fe9ad005-809c-4949-bc93-5cf0aca0f625: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Guillaume de Harsigny was a French physician who lived in the 14th century

      - He died in 1393

      - He was born around 1300


      2) Giovanni Maria Morlaiter was an Italian sculptor of the Rococo period

      - He lived from 1699 to 1781


      3) Comparing their birth dates:

      - Harsigny: around 1300

      - Morlaiter: 1699


      4) 1300 comes before 1699


      Therefore: NO, Guillaume de Harsigny was not born later than Giovanni Maria
      Morlaiter. He was born about 400 years earlier.


      The answer is: NO'
