      for Richard de Umfraville.**  There were several Richard de Umfravilles.  The
      most likely one in a question like this is Richard de Umfraville, 2nd Earl of
      Angus, who lived approximately 1267-1307.  We need to keep in mind there were
      others though.


      * **Step 2: Find approximate birth dates for Jeanne d''Avaugour.** Jeanne d''Avaugour,
      Duchess of Brittany, was born in 1300 and died in 1327.


      * **Step 3: Compare the dates.** 1267 (approximate birth of Richard de Umfraville,
      2nd Earl of Angus) is earlier than 1300 (birth of Jeanne d''Avaugour).


      * **Step 4: Answer the question.** Richard de Umfraville (most likely the 2nd
      Earl of Angus) was born *earlier* than Jeanne d''Avaugour.


      NO

      need to determine which one is meant.  Since Jeanne d''Avaugour is a relatively
      well-known historical figure, it''s likely the Richard de Umfraville in question
      is the one who was Earl of Angus and contemporary to her. This Richard de Umfraville,
      8th Earl of Angus, was born around 1310 - 1320.

      to find his birth date or at least an approximate timeframe.  He was consecrated
      as bishop in 1229. Bishops are typically adults, often older, when consecrated.


      2. **Identify Jacobus Voorda:** Research indicates that Jacobus Voorda is likely
      a less well-known figure, and finding information about his birth and death
      dates is difficult.  However, the name "Jacobus" (James/Jacob) suggests a later
      period than the 13th century, when Roger Niger lived.  The surname "Voorda"
      appears to be of Dutch origin, further suggesting a time period after Roger
      Niger.


      3. **Compare Timeframes:**  Roger Niger died in 1241.  Given the name and likely
      origin of Jacobus Voorda, it''s highly probable he lived much later than the

    f74584b3-3a83-4cdb-8a8c-cd1aff24c529: '1. **Find approximate birth/death dates
      for Benjamin of Tudela:**  Benjamin of Tudela is known for his travels documented
      in *The Travels of Benjamin of Tudela*.  These travels took place between approximately
      1160 and 1173.  Therefore, he was likely born sometime before 1160.  A reasonable
      estimate might be between 1130 and 1140.


      2. **Find approximate birth/death dates for Gabriele de'' Gabrielli:** Gabriele
      de'' Gabrielli, also known as Pope Adrian VI, was born in 1459 and died in 1523.


      3. **Compare the dates:** Benjamin of Tudela was born around the mid-12th century.

    ffd4aa66-7b5c-4b70-af79-7ceffedf2add: '1. **Find approximate birth/death dates
      for Benjamin of Tudela:**  Benjamin of Tudela is known for his travels documented
      between approximately 1160 and 1173.  While his exact birth date is uncertain,
      it''s safe to assume he was born sometime before 1160, likely in the first half
      of the 12th century.


      2. **Find approximate birth/death dates for Gabriele de'' Gabrielli:** Gabriele
      de'' Gabrielli, also known as Pope Adrian IV, was born between 1100 and 1125
      and died in 1159.


      3. **Compare the dates:** Benjamin of Tudela was born before 1160. Gabriele
      de'' Gabrielli died in 1159.


      4. **Conclusion:**  Since Benjamin of Tudela was likely born before 1160 and
      Gabriele de'' Gabrielli died in 1159, Benjamin of Tudela could have been born
      before, during, or after Gabriele''s lifetime. It is not definitively later.

      Guillaume de Harsigny (William of Harcigny) is associated with the Fourth Crusade
      (1202-1204).  Precise birth and death dates are generally difficult to find
      for figures of this era, especially those not of the highest nobility.  However,
      to participate in the crusade as anything other than a child, he would likely
      have been born sometime in the latter half of the 12th century.  Let''s assume
