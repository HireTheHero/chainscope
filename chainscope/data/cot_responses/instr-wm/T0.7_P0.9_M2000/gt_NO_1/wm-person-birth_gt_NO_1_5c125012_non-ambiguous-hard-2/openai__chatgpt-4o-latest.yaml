      \ the question simply says \"Louis King\", and does not specify a number or\
      \ country, we have to assume it refers to the most prominent or earliest known.\n\
      \n5. **Is it possible Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was born later than\
      \ *any* Louis King?**\n   - Yes, for example, Louis XIV was born in 1638, which\
      \ is *after* 1543.\n   - So if the question is comparing Johann Georg Zobel\
      \ von Giebelstadt to Louis XIV, then he was born earlier.\n\n6. **But the question\
      \ asks: Was Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt born later than Louis King?**\n\
      \   - Without a specific \"Louis\", we consider the earliest credible Louis\
      \ King.\n   - Since there were kings named Louis born before 1543, such as Louis\
      \ IX and Louis I, then Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was born *after* them.\n\
      \n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the question is whether Johann Georg Zobel von\
      \ Giebelstadt was born later than *a* Louis King, then YES.\n   - If the question\
      \ is whether he was born later than *all* Louis Kings, then NO.\n   - However,\
      \ the phrasing \"Was Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt born later than Louis\
      \ King?\" implies a specific individual.\n\n8. **Assuming the most famous Louis\
      \ King, Louis XIV (born 1638)**:\n   - Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt (born\
      \ 1543) was born earlier than Louis XIV.\n\nFinal determination: Since Johann\
      \ Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was born in 1543, and the most likely reference\
      \ is to a prominent King Louis (e.g., Louis XIV or Louis XVI), who were born\
      \ after 1543, then:\n\n**NO**, Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was not born\
      \ later than Louis King (assuming the Louis is Louis XIV or similar)."

      **Step 1: Identify Gero II, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark**

      - Gero II was a nobleman in the Holy Roman Empire.

      - He lived during the 10th century.

      - Gero II was born around the year 975 and died in 1015.

      - He served as Royal Governor of Chile.

      - He was born in 1568 and died in 1617.

      Step 1: Identify who Guillaume Arrufat is, and when he was born.

      Guillaume Arrufat is not a widely known historical figure, so we need to determine
      his identity and birth date. Guillaume Arrufat may refer to a historical cleric
      or ecclesiastical figure, possibly in the 17th or 18th century, but without
      an exact date, we need to make an informed estimation.


      However, assuming the question refers to Guillaume Arrufat de Saint-Flour, a
      French bishop, he was born in 1630.


      Step 2: Identify who Bridget of York is, and when she was born.

      Bridget of York was a daughter of King Edward IV of England and Elizabeth Woodville.
      She was born on November 10, 1480.


      Step 3: Compare the birth dates.

      - Bridget of York: born in 1480

      1630 is later than 1480.

      in the 13th and 14th centuries. His exact birth date is not well-documented,
      but he died in 1337.


      Step 3: Estimate Lucido Conti''s birth date.

      - Since Lucido Conti died in 1337 and was a cardinal, we can reasonably assume
      he was an adult by the early 14th century. Most cardinals were appointed after
      reaching maturity, typically in their 30s or older. If we estimate that he was
      at least 60 at death, he could have been born around 1270 or earlier.


      Step 4: Compare birth dates.

      - Yusuf al-Mustansir was born in 1228.

      - Lucido Conti was likely born around 1270 or earlier.


      Conclusion:

      Lucido Conti was born after Yusuf al-Mustansir.

      - Henry V of Rosenberg (also known as Heinrich V. von Rosenberg) was a Bohemian
      nobleman.

      - He was born in the 15th century, specifically in 1456.
