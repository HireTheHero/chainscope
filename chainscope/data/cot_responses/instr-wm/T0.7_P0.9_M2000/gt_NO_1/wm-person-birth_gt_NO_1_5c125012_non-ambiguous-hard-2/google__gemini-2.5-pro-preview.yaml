      of Hywel Dda (born c. 880 AD). Therefore, Llywelyn ap Merfyn must have been
      born significantly earlier than 880 AD, likely sometime in the mid-9th century

      1.  **Identify the first individual:** Gerard de Lisle, 1st Baron Lisle.

      2.  **Find his approximate birth year:** Gerard de Lisle was born around 1304.

      3.  **Identify the second individual:** Elizabeth Fulhame.

      4.  **Find her approximate birth year/period:** Elizabeth Fulhame''s exact birth
      year is unknown, but she was a chemist active in the late 18th century. Her
      book was published in 1794. Therefore, she must have been born sometime in the
      mid-to-late 18th century (e.g., estimates might place her birth anywhere from
      the 1740s to 1760s, but definitely in the 18th century).

      5.  **Compare the birth dates/periods:** Gerard de Lisle (born c. 1304) was
      born in the early 14th century. Elizabeth Fulhame was born in the 18th century.

      6.  **Determine which is later:** The 18th century is much later than the 14th
      century. Therefore, Elizabeth Fulhame was born later than Gerard de Lisle.

      7.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Gerard de Lisle was
      born *later* than Elizabeth Fulhame. Since he was born much earlier (c. 1304
      vs. 18th century), the answer is no.

      (Bishop of Norwich and later Bishop of Lincoln) in the medieval period.

      2.  **Determine William of Alnwick''s birth year:** His exact birth year isn''t
      known, but he died in 1449. Historical estimates place his birth around the
      late 14th century, perhaps *circa* 1375.

      earlier than Gunning Bedford, Jr. (1747).

      6.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if William of Alnwick
      was born *later* than Gunning Bedford, Jr. Since c. 1375 comes *before* 1747,
      William of Alnwick was born *earlier*, not later.

      1.  **Identify Arnold II. von Isenburg:** Find his approximate dates. Arnold
      II von Isenburg (or Arnold of Isenburg) was Archbishop of Trier from 1169 until
      his death in 1183. This means he lived in the 12th century. His birth date isn''t
      precisely known, but it would have been in the first half or middle of the 12th
      century (e.g., c. 1120s-1140s).

      2.  **Identify James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas:** Find his approximate dates.
      James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas (known as "the Black Douglas") lived from
      approximately 1426 to 1491 (or possibly 1488). His birth year was c. 1426, placing
      him firmly in the 15th century.

      3.  **Compare the birth dates/periods:** Arnold II. von Isenburg was born in
      the 12th century. James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas was born in the 15th century
      (c. 1426).

      4.  **Determine who was born later:** The 15th century comes after the 12th
      century. Therefore, James Douglas was born later than Arnold II. von Isenburg.

      5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Arnold II. von Isenburg was
      born *later* than James Douglas. Since Arnold was born *earlier*, the answer
      is no.
