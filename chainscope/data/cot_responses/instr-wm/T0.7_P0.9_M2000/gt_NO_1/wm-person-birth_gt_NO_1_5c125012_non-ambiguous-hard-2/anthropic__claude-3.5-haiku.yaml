    e01d50a3-2c52-40f7-99b1-309e2e9cf770: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s identify when Abbas Ibn Firnas lived:

      - Abbas Ibn Firnas was an Andalusian polymath who lived from 810 to 887 CE

      - He was known for early attempts at human flight and was a significant scholar
      in medieval Islamic Spain


      2. Next, let''s identify when Eilika of Schweinfurt lived:

      - Eilika of Schweinfurt was a German noblewoman who lived from around 1040 to
      1110 CE

      - She was a member of the Schweinfurt noble family in medieval Germany


      3. Comparing their lifetimes:

      - Abbas Ibn Firnas: 810-887 CE

      - Eilika of Schweinfurt: 1040-1110 CE


      4. Determining the chronological order:

      - Abbas Ibn Firnas lived from 810-887 CE

      - Eilika of Schweinfurt lived from 1040-1110 CE

      - This means Abbas Ibn Firnas lived earlier than Eilika of Schweinfurt


      5. Answering the specific question: "Was Abbas Ibn Firnas born later than Eilika
      of Schweinfurt?"


      The answer is: NO'
