      2. I''ll first find the year Beach Red was released

      3. Beach Red was released in 1967


      4. Starstruck was directed by Gillian Armstrong

      5. I''ll find the year Starstruck was released

      6. Starstruck was released in 1982


      7. Comparing the years: 1967 is earlier than 1982


      8. Therefore, Beach Red was NOT released later than Starstruck


      The answer is: NO'

      3. Now I compare the years:

      - Minnaram: 1994

      - War: 2002


      4. Is 1994 later than 2002?

      - No, 1994 is earlier than 2002


      5. Therefore, Minnaram was NOT released later than War.


      The answer is: NO.'
