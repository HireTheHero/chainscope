      "Former Hacker Testifies at Private''s Court-Martial" was published on July
      2, 2013.


      2. Now I can compare the dates:

      - October comes after July

      - Both articles are from 2013

      - October 22 is later than July 2


      3. Therefore, "Seven Die in Iran After Drinking Homemade Alcohol" (October 22,
      2013) was published later than "Former Hacker Testifies at Private''s Court-Martial"
      (July 2, 2013).
