      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" has a runtime of approximately 110 minutes
      (1 hour and 50 minutes).

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged: Part I" has a runtime of approximately 97 minutes
      (1 hour and 37 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business": 110 minutes

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged: Part I": 97 minutes

      - 110 minutes > 97 minutes


      Therefore, Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" has a longer total runtime than
      John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged: Part I".

      Step 1: Identify the films in question.

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" (also known as "Conseil de famille" in French)

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged" (which is actually a trilogy: Part I, Part
      II, and Part III)

      - John Putch directed "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (2012), which has a runtime
      of about 112 minutes.

      - However, he did not direct Part I or Part III. Part I was directed by Paul

      film IS longer, so the answer would be:


      YES'
    ddb61ae4-544b-4238-b571-33cb96c22862: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      First, I need to identify the specific films in question:

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" (1984)

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged" film adaptations


      For John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged," I should note that he directed "Atlas Shrugged:
      Part II" (2012), which is the second film in a trilogy. The complete Atlas Shrugged
      trilogy consists of:

      - Part I (2011) - directed by Paul Johansson

      - Part II (2012) - directed by John Putch

      - Part III (2014) - directed by J. James Manera


      Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" (1984) has a runtime of approximately 110
      minutes.


      John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" has a runtime of approximately 112 minutes.


      Since the question is comparing the total runtime, and John Putch only directed
      Part II of the Atlas Shrugged trilogy, I''m comparing:

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business": 110 minutes

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged: Part II": 112 minutes


      NO (Costa-Gavras''s Family Business does not have a longer total runtime than
      John Putch''s Atlas Shrugged)'

      which film has the longer runtime.

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" (1984)

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged" (which is actually a trilogy: Part I in 2011,
      Part II in 2012, and Part III in 2014)


      Step 2: Determine the runtime of Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business."

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" has a runtime of approximately 110 minutes.


      Step 3: Determine the runtime of John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged."

      - John Putch directed "Atlas Shrugged: Part II" (2012), which has a runtime
      of about 112 minutes.

      - However, this is just one part of the trilogy. The complete "Atlas Shrugged"
      trilogy has a total runtime of approximately 297 minutes (with Part I at 97
      minutes, Part II at 112 minutes, and Part III at 88 minutes).


      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      - Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business": 110 minutes

      - John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged" (Part II only): 112 minutes

      - The complete "Atlas Shrugged" trilogy: 297 minutes


      Even if we only consider the part directed by John Putch (Part II), it''s slightly
      longer than Costa-Gavras''s film. If we consider the entire trilogy (though
      only Part II was directed by Putch), it''s significantly longer.


      NO, Costa-Gavras''s "Family Business" does not have a longer total runtime than
      John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged."'

      Since the question asks about John Putch''s "Atlas Shrugged," I''ll use the

      Upon checking, I believe this refers to "Witness for the Prosecution" (1957),
      but there''s a problem - Robert Montgomery didn''t direct this film (Billy Wilder
      did). Robert Montgomery directed films like "Lady in the Lake" (1947), but I

      "Aadi" is a 2002 Telugu film directed by V. V. Vinayak starring Jr. NTR. Its
      runtime is approximately 165 minutes (2 hours and 45 minutes).

      Since I cannot confirm the existence or runtime of "Your Witness" by Robert
      Montgomery, I cannot make a valid comparison.

      with a runtime of approximately 67 minutes.

      - Ryuhei Kitamura''s "Sky High" (2003, Japanese film, not to be confused with
      the 2005 Disney movie) has a runtime of approximately 120 minutes.


      Step 2: Compare the runtimes.

      - Ben 10: Race Against Time = 67 minutes

      - Sky High (Kitamura) = 120 minutes

      - 67 minutes is less than 120 minutes


      Step 3: Determine if Alex Winter''s film has a longer runtime than Kitamura''s
      film.

      Ram Gopal Varma directed "Shiva" in 1990 (with a remake in 2006). The original
      film has a runtime of approximately 137 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      Kanyini: 53 minutes

      - "Kanyini" is a documentary film directed by Melanie Hogan.

      1990 Hindi remake, both directed by Ram Gopal Varma.

      Kanyini (2006) has a runtime of approximately 53 minutes.

      The original Telugu "Shiva" (1989) has a runtime of approximately 137 minutes.

      The Hindi remake "Shiva" (1990) has a runtime of approximately 145 minutes.

      Since both versions were directed by Ram Gopal Varma, I''ll consider both, but
      either way the runtime is over 130 minutes.


      Step 4: Compare the runtimes.

      Kanyini: 53 minutes

      Shiva: 137-145 minutes (depending on version)
