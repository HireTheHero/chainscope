      Movies are typically made in a standardized format, with a certain amount of
      time dedicated to each part of the film. The total runtime of a movie is the
      sum of the runtimes of each part.


      In general, movies are made in two parts: the feature film and the trailer.
      The feature film is the main body of the movie, and it usually runs for a certain
      amount of time. The trailer is a short clip of the movie that is shown before
      or after the feature film.


      The total runtime of a movie can vary depending on the specific film. Some movies
      are longer than others, and some movies have a longer trailer than others.
