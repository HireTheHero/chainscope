      - Being a feature film, it would run around 90-100 minutes


      3. Comparing the runtimes:

      - Little Red Rodent Hood: ~7 minutes

      - Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade: ~95 minutes


      4. 7 minutes is clearly less than 95 minutes


      NO'

      1. First, let me identify what these works are:

      - "Little Red Rodent Hood" is a 1952 Looney Tunes animated short

      - "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" is a 1978 exploitation film


      2. For runtimes:

      - As a Looney Tunes cartoon short, "Little Red Rodent Hood" would typically
      run around 6-8 minutes

      - "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" is a feature film, which typically runs
      around 90-100 minutes


      3. Given these facts:

      - An animated short cannot be longer than a feature film

      - The difference in runtime is very substantial


      NO'

      2) For animated shorts from this era:

      - Looney Tunes shorts typically ran about 6-7 minutes


      3) For exploitation films from the 1970s:

      - These typically ran feature length, usually around 90 minutes

      - "Emanuelle" films specifically were generally feature length


      4) Therefore:

      - Little Red Rodent Hood: ~7 minutes

      - Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade: ~90 minutes

      - Warner Bros animated shorts from this era typically ran between 6-8 minutes

      short it would almost certainly be much shorter than a feature film
