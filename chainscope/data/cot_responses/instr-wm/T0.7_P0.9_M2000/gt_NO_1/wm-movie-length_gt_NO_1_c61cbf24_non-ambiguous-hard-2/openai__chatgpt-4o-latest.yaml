      the total runtimes of two films:


      1. "Apache War Smoke" directed by Harold F. Kress

      2. "Chandralekha" directed by Nambirajan


      **Step 1: Determine the runtime of "Apache War Smoke"**

      - "Apache War Smoke" is a 1952 American Western film.

      - The runtime of "Apache War Smoke" is approximately 67 minutes.


      **Step 2: Determine the runtime of "Chandralekha" by Nambirajan**

      - There are multiple films with the title "Chandralekha", but the one by Nambirajan
      is a Tamil film released in 1995.

      - The runtime of this "Chandralekha" is approximately 145 minutes.


      **Step 3: Compare the runtimes**

      - "Apache War Smoke": 67 minutes

      - "Chandralekha" (1995): 145 minutes


      Since 67 < 145, "Apache War Smoke" does NOT have a longer runtime than "Chandralekha".

      \ but not a film titled *Family Business*.\n   - There may be confusion here.\
      \ Assume for the purpose of this question that we're referring to a film titled\
      \ *Family Business* that is attributed (perhaps incorrectly) to Costa-Gavras.\n\
      \n3. **Check if Costa-Gavras directed a film titled *Family Business***:\n \
      \  - There is no well-known film called *Family Business* directed by Costa-Gavras.\n\
      \   - The known *Family Business* (1989) is directed by Sidney Lumet, with a\
      \ runtime of approximately 110 minutes.\n\n4. **Identify John Putch's *Atlas\
      \ Shrugged***:\n   - John Putch directed *Atlas Shrugged: Part II* (2012).\n\
      \   - The *Atlas Shrugged* film trilogy includes:\n     - *Part I* (2011) \u2013\
      \ ~97 minutes\n     - *Part II* (2012, directed by John Putch) \u2013 ~112 minutes\n\
      \     - *Part III* (2014) \u2013 ~99 minutes\n   - Total runtime of the trilogy:\

      2. John Putch's *Atlas Shrugged*\n\nFirst, let's clarify the works:\n\n1. **Family\
      \ Business**: This might be a confusion, as *Family Business* (1989) is a film\
      \ directed by Sidney Lumet, not Costa-Gavras. Costa-Gavras is known for political\
      \ films like *Z*, *Missing*, and *State of Siege*. There does not appear to\
      \ be a film titled *Family Business* directed by Costa-Gavras. However, he did\
      \ direct a film titled *Le Capital* (2012), which deals with business themes.\
      \ Perhaps there's confusion between films.\n\nBut assuming the question intends\
      \ a Costa-Gavras film titled *Family Business*, and assuming such a film exists\
      \ (despite no record), we continue with the assumption for the sake of reasoning.\n\
      \n2. **Atlas Shrugged**: This is a film trilogy based on Ayn Rand\u2019s novel.\
      \ The trilogy was directed by three different directors. John Putch directed\
      \ *Atlas Shrugged: Part II* (2012), the second part of the trilogy.\n\nSo we\
      \ need to compare:\n\n- The runtime of Costa-Gavras's *Family Business* (assumed\
      \ to exist), or perhaps we reinterpret the question as: Is the runtime of a\
      \ Costa-Gavras film (perhaps *Le Capital*) longer than John Putch\u2019s *Atlas\
      \ Shrugged: Part II*?\n\nBut the question asks about the total runtime of John\
      \ Putch's *Atlas Shrugged*, which he only directed Part II of. So perhaps the\
      \ question assumes John Putch directed the entire trilogy (which is incorrect),\
      \ or it's referring only to Part II.\n\nLet\u2019s interpret the question as:\
      \ Is the runtime of Costa-Gavras\u2019s *Family Business* longer than the runtime\
      \ of John Putch's *Atlas Shrugged: Part II*?\n\nNow, step-by-step:\n\n1. **John\
      \ Putch's Atlas Shrugged: Part II** has a runtime of approximately 112 minutes.\n\
      \n2. **Costa-Gavras's film (possibly *Le Capital*)** has a runtime of approximately\
      \ 114 minutes.\n\nComparing:\n\n- 114 minutes (*Le Capital*) vs. 112 minutes\
      \ (*Atlas Shrugged: Part II*)\n\nThus, if we assume *Le Capital* is the intended\
      \ Costa-Gavras film, then its runtime is slightly longer.\n\nFinal step:\n\n\
      Given the ambiguity, but assuming the intended films are Costa-Gavras's *Le\
      \ Capital* and John Putch's *Atlas Shrugged: Part II*, then:\n\n**Answer: YES**\

      **Step 1: Find the runtime of "Two Weeks with Love"**

      - "Two Weeks with Love" (1950) is a musical romantic comedy film directed by
      Roy Rowland.

      - Its runtime is approximately **92 minutes**.

      \ Camorrista* directed by Giuseppe Tornatore: This is a real and known film,\

      **Step 2: Determine runtimes.**\n\n- *Il Camorrista* (1986): The runtime is\

      \ it's reasonable to conclude that even if a version existed, it would likely\
      \ not exceed 165 minutes \u2014 as that's quite long for a drama.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\

      \ 2: Verify the existence of the films**\n- Giuseppe Tornatore did direct \"\
      Il Camorrista\" (1986), which is a known film.\n- Wim Wenders, however, is not\
      \ known to have directed a version of \"The Scarlet Letter\". The most famous\
      \ adaptations of \"The Scarlet Letter\" (based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel)\
      \ include ones by directors like Roland Joff\xE9 (1995) and earlier versions,\
      \ but not by Wim Wenders. So this might be a fictional or mistaken attribution.\n\
      \nStill, let's assume for the sake of reasoning that there is a film titled\
      \ \"The Scarlet Letter\" by Wim Wenders. We would need to compare the runtime.\n\
      \n**Step 3: Determine the runtime of \"Il Camorrista\"**\n- \"Il Camorrista\"\
      \ (1986) has a runtime of approximately 116 minutes (some sources list slightly\
      \ different times, but generally around 2 hours).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the\
      \ runtime of Wim Wenders\u2019s \"The Scarlet Letter\"**\n- Since Wim Wenders\
      \ did not direct a known version of \"The Scarlet Letter\", we can reasonably\
      \ conclude that such a film either does not exist or is unknown.\n- Therefore,\
      \ we cannot assign a runtime to it.\n\n**Step 5: Answer the question**\n- The\
      \ question assumes both films exist and asks to compare runtimes.\n- Since one\
      \ of the films (Wim Wenders\u2019s \"The Scarlet Letter\") does not exist or\
      \ is not a known work, we cannot logically say it has a longer or shorter runtime.\n\
      \n**Conclusion:**\nGiven that Wim Wenders did not direct a film titled \"The\
      \ Scarlet Letter\", and we cannot determine its runtime, the answer to whether\
      \ it has a longer runtime than \"Il Camorrista\" is:\n\n**NO**."

      \ obscure or lesser-known version, it's likely that such a film by Wenders does\
      \ not exist or is very obscure.\n\n2. **Check *Il Camorrista* by Giuseppe Tornatore**:\n\

      \ *The Scarlet Letter* does not exist or is not verifiable as a film with a\
      \ known runtime.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- If Wenders's *The Scarlet Letter* does not\

      **Step 1: Determine the runtime of *Mutiny on the Bunny*.**


      *Mutiny on the Bunny* is a Looney Tunes animated short film directed by Friz
      Freleng. It was released in 1950 and features Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam. Most
      Looney Tunes shorts from that era typically have a runtime of about 7 to 8 minutes.

      Vienna V*.**


      This title refers to a recorded Christmas concert directed by Humphrey Burton.
      Such televised concert specials usually run between 60 and 90 minutes. In particular,
      *Christmas in Vienna V* is known to feature performances by prominent vocalists

    ce83f719-7ca6-4031-a58f-35cff7164181: 'To answer the question of whether Friz
      Freleng''s *Mutiny on the Bunny* has a longer total runtime than Humphrey Burton''s
      *A Gala Christmas in Vienna / Christmas in Vienna V*, we need to determine the
      runtimes of both productions and compare them.


      **Step 1: Find the runtime of *Mutiny on the Bunny*.**


      *Mutiny on the Bunny* is a Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies animated short directed
      by Friz Freleng, featuring Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam. It was released in 1950.


      Typical Warner Bros. cartoon shorts from this era run about 7 to 8 minutes in
      length. Specifically, *Mutiny on the Bunny* has a runtime of approximately **7
      minutes**.


      **Step 2: Find the runtime of *A Gala Christmas in Vienna / Christmas in Vienna
      V*.**


      This is a televised concert film directed by Humphrey Burton, part of the "Christmas
      in Vienna" series. These concerts typically feature classical and popular music
      performed by famous singers and orchestras, and are recorded for television
      broadcast and home video.


      Such televised concerts usually have runtimes around **60 to 90 minutes**, depending
      on the version and editing.


      From available sources, *Christmas in Vienna V* has a runtime of approximately
      **84 minutes**.


      **Step 3: Compare the runtimes.**


      - *Mutiny on the Bunny*: ~7 minutes

      - *A Gala Christmas in Vienna / Christmas in Vienna V*: ~84 minutes


      **Conclusion:**


      Friz Freleng''s *Mutiny on the Bunny* does **not** have a longer total runtime
      than Humphrey Burton''s *A Gala Christmas in Vienna / Christmas in Vienna V*.

      \ Sam.\n- Typical Looney Tunes shorts from this era have runtimes of approximately\
      \ 6 to 8 minutes.\n- Specifically, \"Mutiny on the Bunny\" has a runtime of\
      \ around 7 minutes.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the runtime of \"A Gala Christmas\
      \ in Vienna / Christmas in Vienna V\"**\n- This is a concert film directed by\
      \ Humphrey Burton.\n- These Vienna Christmas Gala productions are usually musical\
      \ performances featuring several artists.\n- Such televised concert specials\
      \ typically run for approximately 60 to 90 minutes.\n- \"Christmas in Vienna\
      \ V\" is known to have a runtime of roughly 80 to 90 minutes.\n\n**Step 3: Compare\
      \ the runtimes**\n- \"Mutiny on the Bunny\": ~7 minutes\n- \"Christmas in Vienna\
      \ V\": ~80\u201390 minutes\n\nClearly, the runtime of \"A Gala Christmas in\
      \ Vienna / Christmas in Vienna V\" is significantly longer than that of \"Mutiny\

      1. Identify the correct films and their runtimes.

      2. Compare the runtimes.


      **Step 1: Understand the films involved.**


      - *Sherman''s March* is a 1986 documentary film by Ross McElwee. It has a well-known
      runtime of approximately 155 minutes (2 hours and 35 minutes).


      - *Yolki* (also known as *Six Degrees of Celebration*) is a Russian film series.
      However, it was not directed by Ignas Jonynas. Ignas Jonynas is a Lithuanian
      director known for the film *The Gambler* (2013), not *Yolki*.


      So there seems to be confusion: Ignas Jonynas did not direct *Yolki*.


      Let''s proceed assuming the question is asking about a single *Yolki* film (likely
      the original from 2010), which was directed by Timur Bekmambetov and others.


      The 2010 *Yolki* has a runtime of approximately 90 minutes.

      Step 1: Identify "Yolki"

      "Yolki" (also known as "Six Degrees of Celebration") is a Russian film franchise
      that began in 2010. It is not directed by Ignas Jonynas; it was directed by
      Timur Bekmambetov and others. Ignas Jonynas is known for films like "The Gambler"
      (2013). So there may be a confusion in the question. However, assuming the question
      refers to "Yolki" as a single film, we use the runtime of the original "Yolki"
      (2010), which is approximately 90 minutes.


      Step 2: Identify "Sherman''s March"

      Ross McElwee''s "Sherman''s March" is a documentary film released in 1986. It
      has a notably long runtime of approximately 155 minutes (2 hours and 35 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes

      - "Yolki" (2010): ~90 minutes

      - "Sherman''s March": ~155 minutes


      Step 4: Conclusion

      "Yolki" has a shorter runtime than "Sherman''s March".

      Step 1: Identify the correct films.

      - "Yolki" is a Russian film series produced by Timur Bekmambetov, with multiple
      installments starting from 2010. It is not directed by Ignas Jonynas.

      - Ignas Jonynas is a Lithuanian director known for films such as "The Gambler"
      (2013), not "Yolki".

      - Ross McElwee is an American documentary filmmaker. One of his most well-known
      works is "Sherman''s March" (1986).


      So already, there''s a mismatch: Ignas Jonynas did not direct "Yolki".


      However, assuming the question intends to compare the runtime of "Yolki" (2010)
      and "Sherman''s March" (1986), let''s proceed.


      Step 2: Find the runtimes.

      - "Yolki" (2010), the first film in the series, has a runtime of approximately
      90 minutes.

      - "Sherman''s March" (1986) has a runtime of approximately 155 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - 90 minutes (Yolki) vs. 155 minutes (Sherman''s March)


      Therefore, "Yolki" does NOT have a longer runtime than "Sherman''s March".

      \ the runtime of Olle Hellbom's Pippi Longstocking.\n- Olle Hellbom directed\
      \ a Swedish film adaptation of \"Pippi Longstocking\" in 1969.\n- However, there\
      \ was also a TV series from which the film was compiled.\n- The 1969 film \u201C\
      Pippi L\xE5ngstrump\u201D (Pippi Longstocking), directed by Olle Hellbom, has\
      \ a runtime of approximately 100 minutes.\n- There were also other films such\
