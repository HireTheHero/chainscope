      \ - It's important to note that Costa-Gavras did not direct a film titled \"\

      1. **Little Red Rodent Hood (Friz Freleng)**: This is a classic Warner Bros.
      animated short film featuring characters like Sylvester the Cat. Most Warner
      Bros. cartoons from this era typically have a runtime of about 7 to 8 minutes.


      2. **Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade (Joe D''Amato)**: This is an Italian
      exploitation film from the late 1970s, part of the "Black Emanuelle" series.
      Such films typically have a standard feature-length runtime, which usually ranges
      from 90 to 100 minutes.


      Based on the typical runtimes of animated shorts and feature films:


      - "Little Red Rodent Hood" is approximately 7 to 8 minutes long.

      - "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" is approximately 90 to 100 minutes long.


      Now, comparing these runtimes:


      - 7 to 8 minutes (Little Red Rodent Hood) is significantly shorter than 90 to
      100 minutes (Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade).


      Thus, the answer to the question is **NO**. "Little Red Rodent Hood" does not
      have a longer total runtime than "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade."'

    b23046eb-a745-41d0-947d-9f0ba773a842: 'To answer the question, we need to determine
      the total runtime of Olle Hellbom''s "Pippi Longstocking" and compare it to
      the runtime of Chakrapani''s "Manithan Maravillai."


      1. **Olle Hellbom''s "Pippi Longstocking":** This is a series of films based
      on the Pippi Longstocking books by Astrid Lindgren. The most notable ones directed
      by Olle Hellbom include "Pippi Longstocking" (1969), "Pippi Goes on Board" (1969),
      "Pippi in the South Seas" (1970), and "Pippi on the Run" (1970). Each of these
      films has an approximate runtime of around 90 minutes. Therefore, the total
      runtime for these four films combined is approximately 360 minutes.


      2. **Chakrapani''s "Manithan Maravillai":** This is a standalone Tamil film
      from 1962. The typical runtime for films of that era is around 150 to 180 minutes.
      For the purpose of this comparison, we can assume an average runtime of about
      150 minutes.


      Now, comparing the total runtimes:


      - Total runtime of Olle Hellbom''s "Pippi Longstocking" films: ~360 minutes

      - Runtime of Chakrapani''s "Manithan Maravillai": ~150 minutes


      Based on these approximations, Olle Hellbom''s "Pippi Longstocking" films have
      a longer total runtime than Chakrapani''s "Manithan Maravillai."

      \  - Olle Hellbom directed several films based on Astrid Lindgren's \"Pippi\

      \ (1969)\n     - \"Pippi Goes on Board\" (1969)\n     - \"Pippi in the South\

      \ - \"Pippi Longstocking\" (1969): 101 minutes\n     - \"Pippi Goes on Board\"\
      \ (1969): 83 minutes\n     - \"Pippi in the South Seas\" (1970): 86 minutes\n\
      \   - Total runtime: 101 + 83 + 86 = 270 minutes\n\n2. **Manithan Maravillai\
      \ by Chakrapani:**\n   - \"Manithan Maravillai\" is a Tamil film released in\

      - Chakrapani's \"Manithan Maravillai\" has a runtime of 140 minutes.\n\nBased\

      2. **Chakrapani's \"Manithan Maravillai\"**:\n   - \"Manithan Maravillai\" is\

      **NO**'
    735a0b6e-1235-4c57-a4e9-b0d47622a988: 'To determine which film has a longer total
      runtime, we need to know the runtimes of both Emily Squires''s "The Best of
      Kermit on Sesame Street" and Sachin Gupta''s "Paranthe Wali Gali."


      1. **The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street**: This is a compilation of segments
      featuring Kermit the Frog from the children''s television show "Sesame Street."
      Such compilations typically have a runtime around the length of a standard children''s
      feature or special, which is often about 30 to 60 minutes.


      2. **Paranthe Wali Gali**: This is an Indian romantic comedy film. Standard
      feature films, including Indian films, typically have a runtime of about 90
      to 120 minutes.


      Given these typical runtimes, it''s reasonable to conclude that "Paranthe Wali
      Gali," as a full-length feature film, likely has a longer total runtime than
      "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street," which is a compilation and likely shorter.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'

      1. **The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street**: This is a compilation of segments

      can vary, but typically they are around 30 to 60 minutes long.


      2. **Paranthe Wali Gali**: This is an Indian romantic comedy film directed by
      Sachin Gupta. The typical runtime for a feature film like this is around 90
      to 120 minutes.
