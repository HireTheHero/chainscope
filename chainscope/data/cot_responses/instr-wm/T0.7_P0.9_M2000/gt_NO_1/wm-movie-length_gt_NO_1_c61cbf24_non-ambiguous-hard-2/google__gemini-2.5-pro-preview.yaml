      1.  **Identify "Loopy De Loop":** This is a series of animated theatrical shorts
      produced by Hanna-Barbera (William Hanna and Joseph Barbera) from 1959 to 1965.
      It''s not a single movie, but a collection of shorts. To find its *total* runtime,
      we need the number of shorts and their average length.

      2.  **Calculate Loopy De Loop''s Total Runtime:** There were 48 Loopy De Loop
      theatrical shorts produced. Each short typically runs for about 6 to 7 minutes.
      Using an average of 6.5 minutes: 48 shorts * 6.5 minutes/short = 312 minutes.
      (Even using the low end of 6 minutes gives 48 * 6 = 288 minutes).

      3.  **Identify "War Requiem":** This is a specific 1989 film directed by Derek
      Jarman, based on Benjamin Britten''s musical work of the same name. We need
      its runtime.

      4.  **Find War Requiem''s Runtime:** Standard sources (like IMDb, Wikipedia)
      list the runtime of Derek Jarman''s film "War Requiem" as approximately 92 minutes.

      5.  **Compare the Runtimes:** We are comparing the total runtime of the Loopy
      De Loop series (~312 minutes or at least 288 minutes) with the runtime of the
      single film War Requiem (92 minutes).

      6.  **Conclusion:** 312 minutes (or even 288 minutes) is significantly longer
      than 92 minutes.

      1.  **Identify the first movie and its runtime:** The first movie is "Cats and
      Bruises", directed by Friz Freleng. This is a Looney Tunes animated short film
      released in 1965. Its standard runtime is approximately 6 minutes.

      2.  **Identify the second movie and its runtime:** The second movie is "Spiritual

      1.  **Identify the first movie:** "Peter Lord''s War Story". We need to find
      information about a movie titled *War Story* directed by Peter Lord.

      2.  **Research the first movie:** Peter Lord is famous for his work with Aardman
      Animations (e.g., *Chicken Run*, *The Pirates! Band of Misfits*). Searches for
      a feature film titled *War Story* directed specifically by Peter Lord do not
      yield any results for a known, released movie with that specific director/title
      combination. There *is* a 2014 film titled *War Story* directed by Mark Jackson,
      but not Peter Lord. Since a feature film "Peter Lord''s War Story" doesn''t
      appear to exist, it doesn''t have a standard runtime.

      3.  **Identify the second movie:** "Al Tantay''s Juan & Ted: Wanted". We need
      to find the runtime for the movie *Juan & Ted: Wanted*, directed by Al Tantay.

      4.  **Research the second movie:** *Juan & Ted: Wanted* is a 2003 Filipino comedy
      film directed by Al Tantay. According to sources like IMDb, its runtime is 105
      minutes.

      5.  **Compare the runtimes:** Since "Peter Lord''s War Story" as described doesn''t
      seem to be an actual feature film with a recorded runtime, it cannot have a
      runtime *longer* than the 105 minutes of *Juan & Ted: Wanted*.


      **Conclusion:** Based on the available information, the first movie likely doesn''t
      exist as described, and therefore cannot have a longer runtime than the second
      movie.

      by *Peter Lord*. There is a 2014 film called "War Story", but it was directed
      by Mark Jackson. There was also a series of animated shorts by Aardman called
      "War Story", but these are very short (around 5 minutes each) and not a single
      feature film. Therefore, a feature film titled "War Story" directed by Peter
      Lord with a standard runtime doesn''t seem to exist.

      3.  **Identify the second movie and director:** "Juan & Ted: Wanted" directed
      by Al Tantay.

      4.  **Find information about this movie:** This is a Filipino comedy film released
      in 2000. Its runtime is approximately 107 minutes (1 hour and 47 minutes).

      5.  **Compare the runtimes:** Since "Peter Lord''s War Story" as a feature film
      does not exist, it doesn''t have a runtime to compare. Therefore, it cannot
      have a *longer* runtime than "Juan & Ted: Wanted". Even if we considered the
      Mark Jackson "War Story" (90 mins), it is shorter than "Juan & Ted: Wanted"
      (107 mins). If we considered a single Aardman short (~5 mins), it is also significantly
      shorter.


      **Conclusion:** Based on the information available, Peter Lord did not direct

      featuring Tweety and Sylvester). Short films like this typically have runtimes
      around 6-7 minutes. IMDb lists its runtime as 7 minutes.

      2.  **Identify the second movie and its runtime:** "Come Dance with Me!" (Original
      French title: *Voulez-vous danser avec moi?*) is a 1959 feature film directed
      by Michel Boisrond, starring Brigitte Bardot. Feature films generally have much
      longer runtimes. IMDb lists its runtime as 91 minutes.

      3.  **Compare the runtimes:** Compare the runtime of "Room and Bird" (7 minutes)
      with the runtime of "Come Dance with Me!" (91 minutes).

      4.  **Determine the answer:** Is 7 minutes longer than 91 minutes? No, it is
      not.

      1.  **Identify the first film:** *Room and Bird*, directed by Friz Freleng.

      2.  **Determine its nature and runtime:** *Room and Bird* is a 1951 Warner Bros.
      Merrie Melodies animated short film featuring Tweety and Sylvester. Animated
      shorts from this era typically run for about 6-7 minutes. Its listed runtime
      is **7 minutes**.

      3.  **Identify the second film:** *Come Dance with Me!* (original title: *Voulez-vous
      danser avec moi?*), directed by Michel Boisrond.

      4.  **Determine its nature and runtime:** *Come Dance with Me!* is a 1959 French-Italian
      feature film starring Brigitte Bardot. Feature films have significantly longer
      runtimes than animated shorts. Its listed runtime is **91 minutes**.

      5.  **Compare the runtimes:** We need to compare the runtime of *Room and Bird*
      (7 minutes) with the runtime of *Come Dance with Me!* (91 minutes).

      6.  **Answer the question:** Is 7 minutes longer than 91 minutes? No, it is
      much shorter.
