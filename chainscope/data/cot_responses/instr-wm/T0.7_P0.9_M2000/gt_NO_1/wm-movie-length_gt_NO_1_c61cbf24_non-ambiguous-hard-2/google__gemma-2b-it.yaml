      **YES**.


      Here''s why:


      1. **Thumb Wars** is directed by Steve Oedekerk, who also directed **Blind Chance**.

      2. The runtime of **Thumb Wars** is not specified in the context, so we cannot
      determine its total runtime.

      3. **Blind Chance** has a runtime of 105 minutes.'
    7b41015c-0f30-48af-aed2-684615faf8de: '


      **YES**


      By comparing the total runtime of Thumb Wars (2 hours 24 minutes) and Blind
      Chance (1 hour 52 minutes), it is clear that Thumb Wars has a longer total runtime.'
    cb44b47b-e160-4663-b1e6-56ab1b38dd9f: "\n\n**YES**, the total runtime of Steve\

      \ \"Blind Chance\"."
    dc7d6321-6d83-46d4-ac0d-e930593aa479: '**YES.**


      Here''s the reasoning:


      * **Thumb Wars:** 122 minutes

      * **Blind Chance:** 100 minutes


      Therefore, Thumb Wars has a longer total runtime than Blind Chance.'

    de459d61-0e15-4d14-a3ac-04f4839011ee: '

      2. **However, Blind Chance was released in 2002, while Thumb Wars was released
      in 2010.** So, if we consider only the runtime of the two movies after they
      were released, then Thumb Wars has a longer total runtime than Blind Chance.


      Therefore, the answer is YES. Thumb Wars has a longer total runtime than Blind
      Chance.'
