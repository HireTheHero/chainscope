    81668b79-b9ec-471a-b5b6-59643b6c34c5: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to identify these locations:

      - Conestee is in South Carolina (SC)

      - Pebble Creek is in Florida (FL)


      2. South Carolina is located north of Florida on the US East Coast


      3. In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Both South Carolina and Florida are on the East Coast

      - South Carolina and Florida are roughly aligned on a north-south axis

      - There isn''t a significant east-west offset between these states


      4. Therefore, Conestee, SC and Pebble Creek, FL would be roughly on the same
      longitude (east-west line)


      NO - Conestee, SC is not meaningfully east of Pebble Creek, FL. They are approximately
      on the same longitude.'

      2) Next, locate Pebble Creek, FL:

      - Pebble Creek is in Florida

      - Florida is also on the east coast, but further south than South Carolina


      3) Compare relative east-west positions:

      - Both states are along the Atlantic coast

      - Therefore, a location in Florida would generally be east of a location in
      South Carolina

      Since Pebble Creek, FL would be east of Conestee, SC, Conestee cannot be east
      of Pebble Creek.

      - Sleepy Hollow Lake is south of Albany

      - Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is north of Albany

      - Looking at their positions relative to each other east-west:

      - Sleepy Hollow Lake is closer to the Hudson River

      - Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is slightly further west from the Hudson


      4) Therefore, Sleepy Hollow Lake is slightly east of Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek


      Answer: YES'

      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      * Sleepy Hollow Lake is located in Greene County, NY

      * Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is located in Saratoga County, NY (near Clifton
      Park)


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      * Sleepy Hollow Lake is in eastern New York, along the Hudson River

      * Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is also in eastern New York, but further north near
      Albany


      3. Comparing their east-west positions:

      * Sleepy Hollow Lake is very close to the Hudson River

      * Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is slightly west of the Hudson River


      4. Final comparison:

      * Since Sleepy Hollow Lake is right along the Hudson River and Clifton Knolls-Mill
      Creek is slightly west of it, Sleepy Hollow Lake is further east


      Therefore: YES'

      2) To determine east/west positioning, I can use these facts:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest

      - Georgia is in the Southeast

      - When comparing states on similar latitudes, the state further east will be
      more eastern

      be east of Bowersville.

      1) First, let me recall the geography of these two cities in Florida:

      - North Bay Village is located on islands in Biscayne Bay, between Miami and
      Miami Beach

      - Oakland Park is located in Broward County, inland from the Atlantic Ocean


      2) Looking at their relative positions:

      - North Bay Village is in Miami-Dade County, which is south of Broward County

      1. First, let me establish where these cities are:

      - Webberville is in Michigan

      - Botkins is in Ohio


      2. Let me consider their positions within their states:

      - Webberville is in central Michigan

      - Botkins is in western Ohio


      3. Given the geography of Michigan and Ohio:

      - Ohio is east of Michigan

      - Even western Ohio is generally east of central Michigan


      4. Therefore, since Botkins is in western Ohio, and Webberville is in central
      Michigan, Botkins must be east of Webberville.


      5. The question asks if Webberville is east of Botkins, which is the opposite
      of what we found.

      1) Let me recall the general geography of Michigan and Ohio:

      - Michigan is north of Ohio

      - The MI-OH border runs east-west


      2) Webberville, MI is:

      - Located in central Michigan

      - Slightly east of Lansing, MI


      3) Botkins, OH is:

      - Located in western Ohio

      - North of Dayton, OH


      4) When comparing the longitude:

      - Webberville is near the center of Michigan

      - Botkins is in the western portion of Ohio

      - Given Ohio is east of Michigan, but Botkins is in western Ohio while Webberville
      is in central Michigan, they are likely close in longitude

      - Looking at a map, Webberville is actually slightly WEST of Botkins

      4) Final comparison:

      - Webberville is further west in its state than Botkins is in its state

      - Given that Michigan and Ohio share roughly the same longitudinal span, Webberville
      must be west of Botkins


      NO'
