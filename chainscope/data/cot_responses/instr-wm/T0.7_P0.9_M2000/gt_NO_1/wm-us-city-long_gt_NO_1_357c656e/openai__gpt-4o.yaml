      1. **Malabar, FL**: Located in Florida, Malabar is situated on the east coast
      of the state, near Melbourne, FL. Florida is generally east of many locations
      in the southeastern United States due to its peninsular shape.


      2. **Elloree, SC**: This town is located in South Carolina, which is north of
      Florida. South Carolina is generally positioned to the west of the eastern coast

      NY is located east of Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek, NY, we need to examine the
      geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Identify the location of Sleepy Hollow Lake, NY**: Sleepy Hollow Lake is
      a residential community located in Greene County, New York. It is near the town
      of Athens, to the west of the Hudson River.


      2. **Identify the location of Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek, NY**: Clifton Knolls-Mill
      Creek is a neighborhood in the town of Clifton Park, which is located in Saratoga
      County, New York. Clifton Park is situated north of Albany and also to the west
      of the Hudson River.


      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Clifton Park lies to the north of
      Albany, while Sleepy Hollow Lake is further south in Greene County. Since both
      locations are west of the Hudson River, the key is to determine their relative
      east-west positions.


      4. **Determine the east-west orientation**: Sleepy Hollow Lake, being in Greene
      County and more to the southwest relative to Albany, is positioned further west
      than Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek in Saratoga County. Saratoga County is generally
      further east compared to Greene County.

      Arizona cities. Vail, being in southern Arizona, is more to the south and west
      of Winslow.


      Based on these geographic positions, Winslow, AZ is indeed located east of Vail,
      AZ.
