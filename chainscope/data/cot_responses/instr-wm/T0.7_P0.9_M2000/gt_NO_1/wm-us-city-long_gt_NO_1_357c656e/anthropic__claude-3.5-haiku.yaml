      1. First, I''ll locate Simi Valley, CA:

      - Simi Valley is in Ventura County

      - It is located in Southern California

      - Specifically, it is west of Los Angeles


      2. Next, I''ll locate Crowley Lake, CA:

      - Crowley Lake is in Mono County

      - It is located in Eastern California

      - It is east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Simi Valley is west of Los Angeles

      - Crowley Lake is east of the Sierra Nevada mountains

      - This means Crowley Lake is much further east than Simi Valley


      4. Conclusion:

      - Simi Valley is west of Crowley Lake


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      1. First, let''s locate Simi Valley, CA:

      - Simi Valley is located in Ventura County, in Southern California

      - It is west of Los Angeles, in the coastal region


      2. Next, let''s locate Crowley Lake, CA:

      - Crowley Lake is located in Mono County, in Eastern California

      2. Next, I''ll locate Sunset Hills, MO. Sunset Hills is in St. Louis County,
      in eastern Missouri.


      3. I''ll compare their relative positions. Looking at a map of Missouri, Sunset
      Hills is northwest of Festus.


      4. Since Sunset Hills is northwest of Festus, this means Festus is southeast
      of Sunset Hills.


      5. "East" means to the east, so if Festus is southeast of Sunset Hills, it is
      NOT east of Sunset Hills.

      1. First, I''ll locate East End, AR (Arkansas) and Biwabik, MN (Minnesota) on
      a map.


      2. Arkansas is located in the southern central part of the United States.
