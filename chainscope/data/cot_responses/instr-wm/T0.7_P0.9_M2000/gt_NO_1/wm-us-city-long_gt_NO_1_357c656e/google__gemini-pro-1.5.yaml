      south of Sunset Hills, the question becomes whether it is significantly enough
      east to be considered "east of" Sunset Hills despite being primarily south.  A

      in the western part of South Carolina. Port Wentworth, GA, is near the coast
      of Georgia.


      2. **General East/West Orientation:** South Carolina is generally east of Georgia.
      However, since Edmund is in *western* SC and Port Wentworth is near the *coast*
      of GA, the simple "SC is east of GA" logic doesn''t apply directly.


      3. **Relative Positions:**  We need to consider how far west Edmund is within
      SC and how far east Port Wentworth is within GA.  Port Wentworth is quite far
      east within Georgia, being a coastal city.  Edmund, while in western SC, is
      not extremely far west.

      placement. A quick search shows Edmund, SC is at approximately -81.3 degrees
      longitude and Port Wentworth, GA is at approximately -81.2 degrees longitude.
