      2. Yolanda of Flanders:

      - She was a medieval noblewoman

    4b41fb7a-f26c-4045-ba0f-7f6c79bafe22: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find out when Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March lived and died:

      - Roger Mortimer was born in 1327

      - He died in 1360

      - This means he lived to be about 33 years old


      2. Now, let''s find out when Benedict IX lived and died:

      - Benedict IX was Pope from 1032 to 1044, and again briefly in 1045

      - He was born around 1012

      - He died around 1056

      - This means he lived to be about 44 years old


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Roger Mortimer died at around 33 years old

      - Benedict IX died at around 44 years old


      4. The question asks: Was Roger Mortimer older at his time of death than Benedict
      IX?

      - Since Benedict IX was older at death (44) compared to Roger Mortimer (33),
      the answer is NO.


      Answer: NO'

      \   - Antonio di Vincenzo: 47 years old\n   - Karl Josef von Bachmann: 79 years\
