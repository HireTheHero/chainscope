      The entire continent of Antarctica is in the far south of the globe.


      6. New Zealand, including Chatham Islands, is located in the southern hemisphere

      locations of two geographical features: the Transantarctic Mountains and Te
      Whanga Lagoon.


      Step 1: Determine where the Transantarctic Mountains are located.

      The Transantarctic Mountains are a major mountain range in Antarctica. As the
      name suggests, they traverse across Antarctica, dividing the continent into
      East and West Antarctica. They are located entirely within Antarctica, which
      is in the Southern Hemisphere, at the South Pole.


      Step 2: Determine where Te Whanga Lagoon is located.

      Te Whanga Lagoon is located on Chatham Island, which is part of New Zealand.
      Chatham Island is in the South Pacific Ocean, east of New Zealand''s main islands.
      New Zealand is also in the Southern Hemisphere, but much further north than
      Antarctica.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Antarctica is the southernmost continent on Earth, centered around the South
      Pole. The Transantarctic Mountains are therefore very far south.

      New Zealand, including Chatham Island where Te Whanga Lagoon is located, is
      at a much more northerly latitude than Antarctica.


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions.

      Since Te Whanga Lagoon (on Chatham Island, New Zealand) is located north of
      Antarctica, and the Transantarctic Mountains are in Antarctica, the Transantarctic
      Mountains must be south of Te Whanga Lagoon.


      Therefore, the Transantarctic Mountains are NOT located north of Te Whanga Lagoon;
      they are located south of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the geographic locations of both places and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the location of the Transantarctic Mountains.

      The Transantarctic Mountains are a major mountain range in Antarctica. They
      run across the Antarctic continent, dividing East Antarctica from West Antarctica.
      Antarctica is the southernmost continent on Earth, positioned at the South Pole.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Te Whanga Lagoon.

      Te Whanga Lagoon is located on Chatham Island, which is part of New Zealand.
      Chatham Island is in the South Pacific Ocean, east of New Zealand''s main islands.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Antarctica is entirely south of every other continent. It has the southernmost
      land on Earth. New Zealand, including Chatham Island where Te Whanga Lagoon
      is located, is also in the Southern Hemisphere but is much further north than
      Antarctica.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion.

      Since Antarctica (containing the Transantarctic Mountains) is south of New Zealand
      (containing Te Whanga Lagoon), the Transantarctic Mountains must be south of
      Te Whanga Lagoon, not north.


      NO'

      Since the Transantarctic Mountains are in Antarctica, which is the southernmost
      continent on Earth, and Te Whanga Lagoon is on Chatham Island, which is part
      of New Zealand in the Pacific Ocean, the Transantarctic Mountains are located
      south of Te Whanga Lagoon.

      The Transantarctic Mountains are a major mountain range in Antarctica. They
      extend across the continent, separating East Antarctica from West Antarctica.


      Step 2: Identify where Te Whanga Lagoon is located.

      Te Whanga Lagoon is located on Chatham Island, which is part of New Zealand.
      Chatham Island is in the Pacific Ocean, east of mainland New Zealand.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Antarctica is the southernmost continent on Earth, located entirely in the Southern
      Hemisphere and containing the South Pole.

      New Zealand and its territories, including Chatham Island, are also in the Southern
      Hemisphere but are located much further north than Antarctica.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Antarctica is the southernmost landmass on Earth, any location in New

    d29e781f-3a17-42bc-a836-809cd3b85fcd: '<think>Let me solve this by determining
      the locations of both the Transantarctic Mountains and Te Whanga Lagoon.


      1. Transantarctic Mountains: These mountains are located in Antarctica. As the
      name suggests, they run across Antarctica, dividing the continent into East
      and West Antarctica. Since they''re in Antarctica, they are in the southern
      hemisphere, very close to the South Pole.


      2. Te Whanga Lagoon: I believe Te Whanga Lagoon is located on Chatham Island,
      which is part of New Zealand. Chatham Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean,
      east of mainland New Zealand. New Zealand is also in the southern hemisphere,
      but much further north than Antarctica.


      So comparing their latitudes:

      - Transantarctic Mountains: Located in Antarctica, very far south (high southern
      latitude)

      - Te Whanga Lagoon: Located on Chatham Island, New Zealand, which is also in
      the southern hemisphere but much further north (lower southern latitude)


      In terms of north-south positioning, places with lower southern latitudes are
      north of places with higher southern latitudes. Since Te Whanga Lagoon is at
      a lower southern latitude than the Transantarctic Mountains, the Transantarctic
      Mountains are south of Te Whanga Lagoon, not north.</think># Is Transantarctic
      Mountains located north of Te Whanga Lagoon?


      Let me think step by step about the locations of these two places:


      1) The Transantarctic Mountains are located in Antarctica. As their name suggests,
      they run across the Antarctic continent, dividing East Antarctica from West
      Antarctica.


      2) Te Whanga Lagoon is located on Chatham Island, which is part of New Zealand.
      Chatham Islands are in the Pacific Ocean east of mainland New Zealand.


      3) Antarctica is the southernmost continent on Earth, containing the South Pole.


      4) New Zealand and its territories, including Chatham Island, are located much
      further north than Antarctica.


      5) In terms of latitude, Antarctica (including the Transantarctic Mountains)
      is at a much higher southern latitude than Chatham Island (including Te Whanga
      Lagoon).


      6) Something north of another place means it has a lower southern latitude (or
      higher northern latitude).


      Since the Transantarctic Mountains are in Antarctica (far south) and Te Whanga
      Lagoon is in Chatham Island/New Zealand (much further north), the Transantarctic
      Mountains cannot be north of Te Whanga Lagoon.

      located in Antarctica, which is at the southernmost part of the Earth.


      2. Te Whanga Lagoon - I need to figure out where this is located. Te Whanga
      Lagoon is located on Chatham Island, which is part of New Zealand. Chatham Islands
      are located in the Pacific Ocean, east of mainland New Zealand.


      Now let''s think about their relative positions in terms of latitude (north-south
      positioning):


      - Antarctica is the southernmost continent, centered on the South Pole

      - New Zealand is located in the southern hemisphere, but much farther north
      than Antarctica

      - The Transantarctic Mountains, being in Antarctica, are very far south (high
      southern latitude)

      - Te Whanga Lagoon on Chatham Island would be at a latitude similar to New Zealand,
      which is much farther north than Antarctica


      So is the Transantarctic Mountains located north of Te Whanga Lagoon? Since
      Antarctica (and thus the Transantarctic Mountains) is the southernmost land
      mass on Earth, and Te Whanga Lagoon is on an island much farther north, the

      Bay and Lake Manchar are located.


      Antongil Bay is a large bay on the northeastern coast of Madagascar, which is
      an island nation off the southeastern coast of Africa.


      Lake Manchar (also spelled Manchar Lake) is a large freshwater lake in Pakistan,
      specifically in the Sindh province.


      So we have:

      - Antongil Bay: located in northeastern Madagascar (in the southern hemisphere)

      - Lake Manchar: located in Pakistan (in the northern hemisphere)


      Since Madagascar is in the southern hemisphere and Pakistan is in the northern
      hemisphere, Antongil Bay would be south of Lake Manchar, not north of it.</think>To
      determine if Antongil Bay is located north of Lake Manchar, I need to identify
      where each body of water is located.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Antongil Bay.

      Antongil Bay is a large bay located on the northeastern coast of Madagascar,
      an island nation off the southeastern coast of Africa. Madagascar is in the
      southern hemisphere.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Manchar.

      Lake Manchar (or Manchar Lake) is a freshwater lake located in the Sindh province
      of Pakistan. Pakistan is in the northern hemisphere of Asia.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Madagascar is in the southern hemisphere (below the equator) and Pakistan
      is in the northern hemisphere (above the equator), any location in Pakistan
      would be north of any location in Madagascar.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Lake Manchar is in Pakistan (northern hemisphere) and Antongil Bay is
      in Madagascar (southern hemisphere), Lake Manchar is north of Antongil Bay,
      not the other way around.

      locations of two lakes: Lake Rukwa and Lake Yliki.


      To determine whether Lake Rukwa is located north of Lake Yliki, I need to know
      where both lakes are located.


      Lake Rukwa is a lake in Tanzania, East Africa. Tanzania is located in the southern
      hemisphere, but relatively close to the equator.


      Lake Yliki (also spelled Yliki or Iliki) is a lake in Greece, in southern Europe.
      Greece is in the northern hemisphere.


      Since Lake Rukwa is in Tanzania (East Africa, relatively near but south of the
      equator) and Lake Yliki is in Greece (southern Europe, northern hemisphere),
      Lake Rukwa is south of Lake Yliki, not north of it.


      So the answer is NO, Lake Rukwa is not located north of Lake Yliki.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two lakes by identifying their
      geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Lake Rukwa.

      Lake Rukwa is located in southwestern Tanzania in East Africa. Tanzania is in
      the southern part of East Africa.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Yliki.

      Lake Yliki (also spelled Yliki or Iliki) is located in central Greece, in southern
      Europe. Greece is in the northern hemisphere.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Tanzania is located near but south of the equator (in the southern hemisphere),
      while Greece is well into the northern hemisphere.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Greece (where Lake Yliki is) is in the northern hemisphere and Tanzania
      (where Lake Rukwa is) is closer to the equator and partially in the southern
      hemisphere, Lake Rukwa is south of Lake Yliki, not north of it.

      ## Step 3: Compare latitudes

      Since Lake Sibinacocha is in Peru (South America) and the Gulf of Honduras is

      Lake Sibinacocha is a high-altitude lake located in Peru, in the Andes Mountains
      of South America.


      Step 2: Determine the location of the Gulf of Honduras.

      The Gulf of Honduras is a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea bordered by Belize,
      Guatemala, and Honduras in Central America.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Peru is in South America, which is south of Central America.

      Central America (where the Gulf of Honduras is located) is north of South America
      (where Lake Sibinacocha is located).


      Step 4: Make the north/south determination.

      Since Lake Sibinacocha is in South America and the Gulf of Honduras is in Central
      America, Lake Sibinacocha is south of the Gulf of Honduras, not north of it.

      Pocdol Mountains (also known as Bacon-Manito) are located in the Bicol Region

      locations of both places and compare them.


      Step 1: Locate Patenggang Lake.

      Patenggang Lake (also known as Situ Patenggang) is located in West Java, Indonesia,
      in the highlands near Bandung.


      Step 2: Locate Pocdol Mountains.

      The Pocdol Mountains (also called Bacon-Manito) are a volcanic mountain range
      in the Bicol Peninsula, which is in the southeastern part of Luzon island in
      the Philippines.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Indonesia is located south of the Philippines. West Java (where Patenggang Lake
      is) is in southern Indonesia, while the Bicol Peninsula (where Pocdol Mountains
      are) is in the Philippines.


      Looking at their positions on a map, Patenggang Lake would be south of the Pocdol
      Mountains, not north.


      NO'
    62aba30e-728a-469f-b270-eca9bfdbb8af: '<think>Let me think step by step to answer
      this geographical question.


      First, I need to identify the locations of both places:

      1. Patenggang Lake (also called Situ Patenggang)

      2. Pocdol Mountains


      Patenggang Lake/Situ Patenggang is a lake in West Java, Indonesia. It''s located
      in the highlands near Bandung.


      The Pocdol Mountains (also known as Bacon-Manito) are a mountain range located
      in the Philippines, specifically in the Bicol Region of Luzon Island.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - Indonesia is generally south of the Philippines in terms of latitude

      - West Java (where Patenggang Lake is) is in the western part of Indonesia

      - The Bicol Region (where Pocdol Mountains are) is in the southeastern part
      of Luzon, Philippines


      Since Indonesia is south of the Philippines, and Patenggang Lake is in Indonesia
      while Pocdol Mountains are in the Philippines, Patenggang Lake would be south
      of the Pocdol Mountains, not north.</think>To answer whether Patenggang Lake
      is located north of Pocdol Mountains, I need to determine the geographic locations
      of both places.


      Step 1: Identify Patenggang Lake''s location.

      Patenggang Lake (also known as Situ Patenggang) is located in West Java, Indonesia.
      It''s in the highlands near Bandung city.


      Step 2: Identify Pocdol Mountains'' location.

      Pocdol Mountains (also called Bacon-Manito) are located in the Bicol Region
      on Luzon Island in the Philippines.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Indonesia is generally located south of the Philippines. West Java (where Patenggang
      Lake is) is in the southern part of Southeast Asia, while the Philippines (where
      Pocdol Mountains are) is in the northern part of Southeast Asia.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Indonesia is south of the Philippines, Patenggang Lake must be south of
      Pocdol Mountains, not north of them.


      NO'
    65017dc3-4e3f-4d46-b611-4bc5e1ebe22e: '<think>Let me think about the locations
      of these two natural features:


      1. Patenggang Lake (also called Situ Patenggang): I believe this is a lake located
      in West Java, Indonesia.


      2. Pocdol Mountains: These mountains are located in the Philippines, specifically
      in the Bicol Region on Luzon Island.


      If I''m correct about these locations, then Patenggang Lake in Indonesia would
      be south of the Pocdol Mountains in the Philippines, since Indonesia is generally
      south of the Philippines.


      Let me verify:

      - Indonesia is located south of the Philippines

      - West Java (where Patenggang Lake is) is in the western part of Indonesia

      - The Bicol Region (where Pocdol Mountains are) is in the southeastern part
      of Luzon in the Philippines


      Given these geographical positions, Patenggang Lake would not be north of Pocdol
      Mountains. Instead, it would be south and somewhat west of them.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both Patenggang
      Lake and Pocdol Mountains.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Patenggang Lake.

      Patenggang Lake (also known as Situ Patenggang) is located in West Java, Indonesia.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Pocdol Mountains.

      The Pocdol Mountains are located in the Bicol Region of Luzon Island in the
      Philippines.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Indonesia is located south of the Philippines. West Java (where Patenggang Lake
      is) is in the western part of Indonesia, while the Bicol Region (where Pocdol
      Mountains are) is in the southeastern part of Luzon in the Philippines.


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      Since Indonesia is south of the Philippines, Patenggang Lake would be south
      of the Pocdol Mountains, not north.


      NO'

      2. Next, I need to identify where Pocdol Mountains are located. The Pocdol Mountains
      are a mountain range in the Philippines, specifically in the Bicol Region of
      Luzon Island.


      3. Now I need to determine their relative positions. Indonesia is south of the
      Philippines in general. Java island, where Patenggang Lake is located, is in
      the southern part of Indonesia. The Philippines, where Pocdol Mountains are
      located, is north of Indonesia.


      4. So Patenggang Lake (in Indonesia) is south of Pocdol Mountains (in the Philippines).


      Therefore, Patenggang Lake is NOT located north of Pocdol Mountains. It''s located
      south of them.</think># Is Patenggang Lake located north of Pocdol Mountains?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) Patenggang Lake (also known as Situ Patenggang) is located in West Java,
      Indonesia.


      2) The Pocdol Mountains are located in the Bicol Region on Luzon island in the
      Philippines.


      3) Geographically, Indonesia lies south of the Philippines.


      4) Since Patenggang Lake is in Indonesia and Pocdol Mountains are in the Philippines,
      the lake must be south of the mountains.


      Therefore, NO, Patenggang Lake is not located north of Pocdol Mountains.'
    b29cccac-14e7-4a73-ac01-64a54f642afc: '<think>To answer whether Patenggang Lake

      Patenggang Lake (also known as Lake Patenggang or Situ Patenggang) is located
      in West Java, Indonesia. It''s in the highlands near Bandung.


      Pocdol Mountains (also spelled as Pocdol or Pocdol Range) are located in the
      Philippines, specifically in the Bicol Region on Luzon Island.


      Indonesia is generally south of the Philippines in Southeast Asia. West Java
      (where Patenggang Lake is) is in the western part of Indonesia, while the Bicol
      Region (where Pocdol Mountains are) is in the southeastern part of Luzon in
      the Philippines.


      Since the Philippines is north of Indonesia, and Patenggang Lake is in Indonesia
      while Pocdol Mountains are in the Philippines, Patenggang Lake must be south
      of Pocdol Mountains, not north.</think>I need to determine the locations of
      both geographic features and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify where Patenggang Lake is located.

      Patenggang Lake (also called Situ Patenggang) is located in West Java, Indonesia,
      in the highlands near Bandung.


      Step 2: Identify where Pocdol Mountains are located.

      The Pocdol Mountains are located in the Bicol Region on Luzon Island in the
      Philippines.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      Indonesia is located south of the Philippines in Southeast Asia. West Java (where
      Patenggang Lake is) is in the western part of Indonesia, while the Bicol Region
      (where Pocdol Mountains are) is in the southeastern part of Luzon, Philippines.


      Step 4: Make the north-south determination.

      Since the Philippines (containing Pocdol Mountains) is north of Indonesia (containing
      Patenggang Lake), Patenggang Lake cannot be north of Pocdol Mountains. It is
      actually south of them.


      NO'
    d70470ca-e4f2-4bd0-baa3-91e9bcc394a9: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of both Patenggang Lake and Pocdol Mountains, and
      then compare their relative positions to determine if Patenggang Lake is north
      of Pocdol Mountains.


      First, let me think about where Patenggang Lake is located:

      - Patenggang Lake (also spelled Patenggan or Situ Patenggang) is a lake in West
      Java, Indonesia.

      - Indonesia is in Southeast Asia.

      - West Java is on the island of Java in western Indonesia.


      Now, let me think about where Pocdol Mountains are located:

      - Pocdol Mountains (also known as Bacon-Manito) are located in the Bicol Region
      of the Philippines.

      - The Philippines is also in Southeast Asia, but east of Indonesia.


      Now, I need to compare their latitudes:

      - The Philippines is generally north of Indonesia.

      - Java (where Patenggang Lake is) is in the southern part of Indonesia.

      - The Bicol Region (where Pocdol Mountains are) is in the southeastern part
      of Luzon, the main northern island of the Philippines.


      So, Java is south of the Philippines, which means Patenggang Lake in Java, Indonesia
      is south of Pocdol Mountains in the Philippines.</think>I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two geographical features.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Patenggang Lake.

      Patenggang Lake (also called Situ Patenggang) is located in West Java, Indonesia,
      on the island of Java.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Pocdol Mountains.

      The Pocdol Mountains are located in the Bicol Region on the island of Luzon
      in the Philippines.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Indonesia is generally south of the Philippines. Java island (where Patenggang
      Lake is) is in the southern part of Indonesia, while Luzon (where Pocdol Mountains
      are) is in the northern Philippines.


      Step 4: Determine their relative positions.

      Since the Philippines is north of Indonesia, and specifically Luzon is north
      of Java, Patenggang Lake must be south of Pocdol Mountains, not north.

      Lake Chapala is a lake in Mexico. It''s located in western Mexico, in the state

      de Dios region of Peru

      - It''s near Puerto Maldonado in southeastern Peru

      - Peru is in South America


      Next, let me think about Great Craggy Mountains:

      - Great Craggy Mountains (or Craggy Mountains) are located in western North
      Carolina, USA

      - They''re part of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Appalachian Mountain range

      - North Carolina is in North America


      Now I need to determine if Lake Sandoval is north of Great Craggy Mountains:

      - Lake Sandoval is in Peru (South America)

      - Great Craggy Mountains are in North Carolina, USA (North America)

      - North America is north of South America

      2. **Great Craggy Mountains**: These mountains are located in western North
      Carolina in the United States, North America. They''re part of the Blue Ridge
      mountain range in the Appalachian Mountains.


      3. **Geographical comparison**: Peru is in South America, which is south of
      North America. The United States is entirely north of Peru. Since Lake Sandoval
      is in Peru (South America) and Great Craggy Mountains are in the United States
      (North America), Lake Sandoval is south of Great Craggy Mountains, not north.

      To answer this question, I need to know where both locations are:


      1. Lake Sandoval: Lake Sandoval is located in Peru, in the Amazon rainforest
      region, specifically in the Madre de Dios region in southeastern Peru.


      2. Great Craggy Mountains: The Great Craggy Mountains (or Craggy Mountains)
      are located in western North Carolina in the United States, near Asheville.


      Now I can determine their relative positions:

      - Lake Sandoval is in Peru, which is in South America

      - The Great Craggy Mountains are in North Carolina, USA, which is in North America


      Since North America is north of South America, and Peru is south of the United
      States, Lake Sandoval is located SOUTH of the Great Craggy Mountains, not north.</think>I
      need to determine the locations of both Lake Sandoval and the Great Craggy Mountains
      to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Lake Sandoval.

      Lake Sandoval is located in Peru, specifically in the Madre de Dios region in
      southeastern Peru, within the Amazon rainforest basin of South America.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Great Craggy Mountains.

      The Great Craggy Mountains (or Craggy Mountains) are located in western North
      Carolina in the United States, which is in North America.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      North America is located north of South America on the globe. The United States
      (where the Great Craggy Mountains are) is in the northern hemisphere, while
      Peru (where Lake Sandoval is) is closer to the equator in the southern hemisphere.


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      Since Lake Sandoval is in South America and the Great Craggy Mountains are in
      North America, Lake Sandoval is south of the Great Craggy Mountains, not north.

      the locations of Lake Sandoval and the Great Craggy Mountains.


      Step 1: Identify where Lake Sandoval is located.

      Lake Sandoval is a lake in Peru, in the Amazon rainforest. It''s located in
      southeastern Peru, in the Madre de Dios region.


      Step 2: Identify where the Great Craggy Mountains are located.

      The Great Craggy Mountains (or Craggy Mountains) are located in western North
      Carolina in the United States, near Asheville. They''re part of the Blue Ridge
      Mountains in the Appalachian Mountain range.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes to determine which is further north.

      Peru is in South America, which is primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, though
      parts of northern South America do extend into the Northern Hemisphere. Lake
      Sandoval is in southeastern Peru, which is definitely in the Southern Hemisphere.


      The Great Craggy Mountains in North Carolina are in the United States, which
      is in North America and entirely in the Northern Hemisphere.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion.

      Since Lake Sandoval is in the Southern Hemisphere and the Great Craggy Mountains
      are in the Northern Hemisphere, Lake Sandoval is south of the Great Craggy Mountains,
      not north of them.


      So the answer is NO, Lake Sandoval is not located north of Great Craggy Mountains.</think>#
      Is Lake Sandoval located north of Great Craggy Mountains?


      Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the location of Lake Sandoval. Lake Sandoval is
      located in the Madre de Dios region of southeastern Peru in South America. Peru
      is located in the Southern Hemisphere.


      2) Next, I need to identify the location of the Great Craggy Mountains. The
      Great Craggy Mountains are located in western North Carolina in the United States,
      which is in North America. North Carolina is located in the Northern Hemisphere.


      3) Comparing these locations: Any location in the Northern Hemisphere is north

      Lake Sandoval is a lake in Peru, in the Amazon rainforest. It''s located in

      Given these locations:

      - Lake Sandoval is in Peru (South America)

      - Great Craggy Mountains are in North Carolina, USA (North America)


      Peru is in South America, which is south of North America. Therefore, Lake Sandoval

      determine the locations of both Lake Sandoval and the Great Craggy Mountains
      to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify where Lake Sandoval is located.

      Lake Sandoval is an oxbow lake located in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest, specifically
      in the Madre de Dios region of southeastern Peru, South America.


      Step 2: Identify where the Great Craggy Mountains are located.

      The Great Craggy Mountains (or Craggy Mountains) are located in western North
      Carolina in the United States, North America. They''re part of the Blue Ridge
      Mountains in the Appalachian Mountain range.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine north/south positioning.

      Peru is in South America, which is entirely south of North Carolina, USA (which
      is in North America). Therefore, Lake Sandoval must be south of the Great Craggy
      Mountains, not north of them.

      Let me recall what I know about these lakes:


      Songkhla Lake is a large lake in southern Thailand. It''s in the southern part
      of Thailand, near the border with Malaysia.


      Taudaha Lake - I believe this is a small lake in Nepal, located in the Kathmandu
      Valley.


      Given these locations:

      - Songkhla Lake is in Thailand (Southeast Asia)

      - Taudaha Lake is in Nepal (South Asia)


      Nepal is located north of Thailand in Asia. Thailand is situated in Southeast
      Asia while Nepal is in South Asia, closer to the Himalayas. Since Nepal is north
      of Thailand, and Taudaha Lake is in Nepal, while Songkhla Lake is in Thailand,
      Songkhla Lake cannot be north of Taudaha Lake. It would be south of Taudaha
      Lake.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations

      Songkhla Lake is located in southern Thailand, near the border with Malaysia.
      It''s one of the largest lakes in Thailand.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Taudaha Lake.

      Taudaha Lake is a small lake located in Nepal, specifically in the Kathmandu
      Valley.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Thailand is in Southeast Asia, while Nepal is in South Asia near the Himalayas.

      Nepal is situated significantly north of Thailand on the Asian continent.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these locations.

      Since Taudaha Lake is in Nepal (a northern country) and Songkhla Lake is in
      Thailand (a southern country), Songkhla Lake is south of Taudaha Lake, not north
      of it.

      I need to recall where each of these places is located:


      1. Lake Omodeo: If I recall correctly, Lake Omodeo is a lake in Sardinia, Italy.
      Sardinia is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of continental Europe.


      2. Lysefjord: Lysefjord is a fjord in Norway. Norway is in Northern Europe.


      To determine which is further north, I need to compare their latitudes:


      - Norway is one of the northernmost countries in Europe, located in Scandinavia.

      - Sardinia, Italy is in Southern Europe, in the Mediterranean Sea.


      Norway is definitely north of Italy/Sardinia. So Lysefjord (in Norway) must
      be north of Lake Omodeo (in Sardinia, Italy).

      Lake Omodeo is an artificial lake located in Sardinia, Italy. Sardinia is an
      island in the Mediterranean Sea in Southern Europe.

      Since Norway is significantly further north than Sardinia, Lysefjord must be
      north of Lake Omodeo, not the other way around.


      NO, Lake Omodeo is not located north of Lysefjord. Lake Omodeo is south of Lysefjord.'

      \ if Thanon Thong Chai Range is located north of Baiyang Lake, I need to identify\
      \ the geographical locations of both places:\n\n1. **Thanon Thong Chai Range**:\
      \ This is a mountain range located in northern Thailand. It's part of the mountain\
      \ ranges that extend through northern Thailand near the Myanmar border, at approximately\
      \ 18-19 degrees North latitude.\n\n2. **Baiyang Lake**: This is a lake located\
      \ in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Taiwan is positioned between approximately 22-25 degrees\
      \ North latitude, with Baiyang Lake being in northern Taiwan.\n\n3. **Comparing\
      \ positions**: Since Taiwan (where Baiyang Lake is located) is at a higher latitude\
      \ (22-25\xB0N) than northern Thailand (where Thanon Thong Chai Range is located,\
      \ 18-19\xB0N), Baiyang Lake is actually north of the Thanon Thong Chai Range.\n\

      Nuba Mountains and Lake Balaton.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Nuba Mountains.

      The Nuba Mountains are located in Sudan, in northeastern Africa.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Balaton.

      Lake Balaton is located in western Hungary, in Central Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Hungary (in Europe) is located significantly north of Sudan (in Africa),
      Lake Balaton is north of the Nuba Mountains, not the other way around.

      2. The Hijaz Mountains (also called the Hejaz Mountains) are located in western

      Now, to determine their relative positions:

      - Uganda is in East Africa, south of the equator

      - Saudi Arabia is in the Middle East, north of the equator


      Since Uganda is south of the equator and Saudi Arabia is north of it, Lake Mutanda

      Racetrack Playa is a dry lake bed located in Death Valley National Park, California,

      Moberly Lake is in British Columbia, Canada. British Columbia is a province

      Generally speaking, locations in Canada are north of locations in the continental
      United States, especially when comparing British Columbia to California. California
      is quite far south in the United States, while British Columbia is along the

      First, let me think about where Imperial Reservoir is located:

      Imperial Reservoir is located on the lower Colorado River along the California-Arizona

      Given these locations:

      - Imperial Reservoir is in the southwestern United States

      2) Next, I need to identify where the Ajay River is located. I''m trying to
      recall, but I''m not immediately certain about an "Ajay River." Let me think
      about major rivers in relation to the Putorana Plateau.


      Some rivers associated with the Putorana region include the Yenisei River and
      its tributaries. However, I don''t immediately recall an "Ajay River" in this

      The Ajay River I''m familiar with is located in India, flowing through the states
      of Jharkhand and West Bengal before joining the Ganges. India is significantly
      south of Siberia where the Putorana Plateau is located.


      If the Ajay River refers to the one in India, then it is definitely south of
      the Putorana Plateau, not north.


      Let me double check if there''s another Ajay River I''m missing, but based on
      my knowledge, the Ajay River in India is the most notable one by that name.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to identify the locations of both the Ajay River
      and the Putorana Plateau.


      Step 1: The Putorana Plateau is located in northern Siberia, Russia. It''s a
      significant geographical feature in the northern part of Central Siberia.


      Step 2: The Ajay River (also spelled Ajoy) is located in eastern India, flowing
      through the states of Jharkhand and West Bengal before joining the Ganges River.


      Step 3: Comparing their locations, India is located in South Asia, which is
      significantly south of Siberia in Russia. The Putorana Plateau in northern Russia
      is thousands of kilometers north of the Ajay River in India.


      NO - the Ajay River is not located north of the Putorana Plateau. It is located

      \n3. **Comparison**: When comparing latitudes, higher numbers in the Northern\
      \ Hemisphere indicate locations farther north. Since the Putorana Plateau (67-70\xB0\
      N) has a much higher latitude than the Ajay River (23-24\xB0N), the Putorana\
      \ Plateau is located much farther north.\n\n# Answer: NO\n\nThe Ajay River is\

      1. I might be unfamiliar with the specific name "Ajay River"

      2. It might be a local name for a river in that region

      3. There might be an Ajay River elsewhere in the world


      The Putorana Plateau has several rivers flowing through it or near it, including:

      Plateau, not north.</think># Is Ajay River located north of Putorana Plateau?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify where both locations are situated.


      2) The Putorana Plateau is located in northern Siberia, Russia, above the Arctic
      Circle. It''s one of the northernmost plateau regions in Russia.


      3) The Ajay River (also spelled Ajoy) is located in eastern India, flowing through
      the states of Jharkhand and West Bengal before joining the Ganges River system.


      4) Comparing their locations: India is located in South Asia, well south of
      Russia. The Putorana Plateau in northern Russia is thousands of kilometers north
      of the Ajay River in India.


      5) Therefore, the Ajay River is located south of the Putorana Plateau, not north
      of it.

      Step 2: Identify where Dudipatsar Lake is located.

      Dudipatsar Lake is located in the Kaghan Valley in northern Pakistan.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      Pakistan is located north of India. Since Dudipatsar is in northern Pakistan
      and Velachery Lake is in southern India, Velachery Lake must be south of Dudipatsar,
      not north.

      Campeche is located north of Lake Athapapuskow, I need to recall the geographic
      locations of both places.


      Bay of Campeche: The Bay of Campeche is in the southern part of the Gulf of
      Mexico, off the western coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. It''s in the
      southern part of North America.


      Lake Athapapuskow: Lake Athapapuskow is located in Manitoba, Canada, near the
      Saskatchewan border. It''s in the northern part of North America.


      In terms of latitude, places in Canada are generally much further north than
      places in Mexico. So Lake Athapapuskow, being in Manitoba, Canada, would be
      north of the Bay of Campeche, which is in southern Mexico.


      Therefore, the Bay of Campeche is NOT north of Lake Athapapuskow. Instead, it''s
      south of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these two
      geographic features.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Bay of Campeche.

      The Bay of Campeche is located in the southern part of the Gulf of Mexico, adjacent
      to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. It''s in the southern portion of North America.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Athapapuskow.

      Lake Athapapuskow is located in Manitoba, Canada, near the Saskatchewan border
      in the northern part of North America.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Canada is significantly further north than Mexico. Manitoba is in the northern
      part of Canada, while the Bay of Campeche is in southern Mexico.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on these positions.

      Since Canada is north of Mexico, Lake Athapapuskow must be north of the Bay
      of Campeche, not the other way around.

      is in southern Europe.


      Pielinen: Lake Pielinen is located in eastern Finland. Finland is in northern

      1. Troodos Mountains: This is a mountain range located in Cyprus, an island

      of Europe, or considered part of Western Asia by some classifications.


      2. Lake Peipus: This is a large lake on the border between Estonia and Russia.

      Estonia is much further north in Europe compared to Cyprus. Estonia is in Northern

      Step 1: Identify the location of Troodos Mountains.

      The Troodos Mountains are located in Cyprus, an island country in the eastern
      Mediterranean Sea in Southern Europe.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Peipus.

      Lake Peipus is a large lake that forms part of the border between Estonia and

      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Estonia and Russia (where Lake Peipus is located) are in Northern Europe, significantly
      further north than Cyprus (where the Troodos Mountains are located) in the Mediterranean
      region.


      Step 4: Determine relative position.

      The Sudirman Range is a mountain range located in Indonesia, specifically in
      the western part of New Guinea Island (in the Papua province of Indonesia).
      The Sudirman Range contains Puncak Jaya (formerly known as Carstensz Pyramid),

      - Indonesia, including Papua province where the Sudirman Range is located, is
      generally south of the Philippines.

      - The Philippine Sea is east of the Philippines.

      - So the Sudirman Range would be south or southwest of the Philippine Sea.


      Therefore, the Sudirman Range is NOT located north of the Philippine Sea. It''s

      ## Step 2: Locate the Philippine Sea

      The Philippine Sea is a marginal sea east of the Philippines in the western
      Pacific Ocean.


      ## Step 3: Determine their relative positions

      - Indonesia (including Papua where the Sudirman Range is) is located in Southeast

      Lake is located north of the Yablonoi Mountains. Let me think about the locations
      of these geographical features.


      1) Dongting Lake is located in China, specifically in the northeastern part
      of Hunan Province in central-eastern China. It''s one of the largest freshwater
      lakes in China and is connected to the Yangtze River.


      2) The Yablonoi Mountains (also spelled as Yablonovy) are located in Russia,
      specifically in eastern Siberia. They form part of the watershed between the
      Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean basins.


      3) In terms of latitude, China is generally south of Russia. Central-eastern
      China where Dongting Lake is located would be significantly south of eastern
      Siberia where the Yablonoi Mountains are located.


      So, if we''re asking whether Dongting Lake is north of the Yablonoi Mountains,
      the answer would be no. The lake is south of the mountains.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative locations of Dongting Lake and

      Step 1: Identify where Dongting Lake is located.

      Dongting Lake is located in central-eastern China, specifically in Hunan Province.
      It''s one of China''s largest freshwater lakes.


      Step 2: Identify where the Yablonoi Mountains are located.

      The Yablonoi (or Yablonovy) Mountains are located in eastern Siberia in Russia,
      forming part of the watershed between the Arctic Ocean and Pacific Ocean drainage
      basins.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Russia is located north of China. Eastern Siberia (where the Yablonoi Mountains
      are) is in the northern part of Russia, while Dongting Lake is in central-eastern
      China.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since the Yablonoi Mountains are in Russia (far north) and Dongting Lake is
      in central-eastern China (much further south), the lake cannot be north of the
      mountains.

      Let me think about where each of these is located:


      1. Salar de Arizaro: This is a salt flat (salar) located in Argentina, specifically
      in the Puna de Atacama plateau in the northwestern part of the country, in Salta
      Province. It''s part of the Central Andes region of South America.


      2. Acarai Mountains: These mountains form part of the border between Guyana

      of South America, separating the Amazon Basin from the Guiana Shield.


      Now let''s think about their relative positions:

      - Argentina is in the southern part of South America

      - Guyana and northern Brazil are in the northern part of South America


      So Salar de Arizaro in Argentina is south of the Acarai Mountains which are

      Let me recall what I know about each:


      Caraballo Mountains:

      The Caraballo Mountains are a mountain range located in the Philippines, specifically
      in Luzon island. The Philippines is in Southeast Asia.


      Nakaumi:

      Nakaumi (or Lake Nakaumi) is a brackish lake/lagoon located in Japan, between
      Shimane and Tottori Prefectures.

      Is Lake of the Arbuckles located north of Wizard Lake?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the locations of both lakes.

      2) Lake of the Arbuckles is a reservoir located in south-central Oklahoma in
      the United States.

      3) Wizard Lake is located in Alberta, Canada.

      4) Geographically, Canada is north of the United States.

      5) Since Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma (USA) and Wizard Lake is in Alberta
      (Canada), Lake of the Arbuckles must be south of Wizard Lake.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO


      Lake of the Arbuckles is not located north of Wizard Lake; it is located south
      of it.'

      So if the question is "Is Vembanad located north of Wular Lake?", the answer
      would be "NO".</think>To answer this question, I need to identify the locations
      of both water bodies and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify Vembanad''s location.

      Vembanad is a lake (also called a backwater) located in Kerala state in southern
      India.


      Step 2: Identify Wular Lake''s location.

      Wular Lake is located in Jammu and Kashmir in northern India.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Kerala is in the southern part of India and Jammu and Kashmir is in the
      northernmost part of India, Vembanad is located south of Wular Lake, not north
      of it.

      if Vembanad is located north of Wular Lake.


      First, I need to identify where these two bodies of water are located:


      1. Vembanad: Vembanad Lake is located in Kerala, in the southern part of India.
      Kerala is one of the southernmost states in India.


      2. Wular Lake: Wular Lake is located in Jammu and Kashmir, in the northern part
      of India. It''s one of the largest freshwater lakes in Asia and is located in
      the Kashmir Valley.


      In terms of north-south positioning in India:

      - Jammu and Kashmir is in the far north of India

      - Kerala is in the far south of India


      Therefore, Vembanad (in Kerala, south India) is located SOUTH of Wular Lake
      (in Kashmir, north India), not north of it.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the geographical locations of both Vembanad and Wular Lake.


      Step 1: Identify where Vembanad is located.

      Vembanad Lake is located in Kerala state in southern India. It''s the longest
      lake in India and opens into the Arabian Sea.


      Step 2: Identify where Wular Lake is located.

      Wular Lake is located in Jammu and Kashmir, in the far northern part of India.
      It''s one of the largest freshwater lakes in Asia.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Looking at India''s geography, Jammu and Kashmir is in the northernmost part
      of the country, while Kerala is near the southernmost tip of India.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these locations.

      Since Vembanad is in Kerala (south India) and Wular Lake is in Jammu and Kashmir
      (north India), Vembanad is positioned significantly south of Wular Lake, not
      north of it.

      India.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Chandra Taal.

      Chandra Taal (also known as Chandratal or "Moon Lake") is located in the Spiti
      Valley of Himachal Pradesh, which is in the Himalayan mountains in northern
      India.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Since Singanallur Lake is in Tamil Nadu (southern India) and Chandra Taal is
      in Himachal Pradesh (northern India), Singanallur Lake is located south of Chandra
      Taal, not north of it.

      Mount Apo is the highest mountain in the Philippines, located on the island
      of Mindanao in the southern Philippines.


      Lake Kizi (sometimes spelled Kizi Lake) is located in Russia, specifically in
      northwestern Siberia.


      Given that:

      - Mount Apo is in the Philippines, which is in Southeast Asia

      - Lake Kizi is in Siberia, Russia, which is in northern Asia


      The Philippines is significantly south of Russia. In fact, Russia is one of
      the northernmost countries in Asia, while the Philippines is in the tropical
      region of Southeast Asia.


      So Mount Apo (Philippines) is located south of Lake Kizi (Russia), not north
      of it.</think># Is Mount Apo located north of Lake Kizi?


      I need to determine the geographic locations of both places to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify Mount Apo''s location.

      Mount Apo is located in the southern Philippines, specifically on the island
      of Mindanao. The Philippines is in Southeast Asia, relatively close to the equator.


      Step 2: Identify Lake Kizi''s location.

      Lake Kizi is located in northern Siberia, Russia. Russia extends across northern
      Asia and is situated at much higher latitudes than the Philippines.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Russia (where Lake Kizi is) is located in the northern hemisphere at much higher
      latitudes than the Philippines (where Mount Apo is). Since Mount Apo is in a
      tropical country far south of Russia, it cannot be north of Lake Kizi.

    01d5bc19-0f5e-492c-8f48-3e6e8397b4f6: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of both Sheep Range and Ruby Mountain, and then compare
      their positions to see if Sheep Range is north of Ruby Mountain.


      Let me think about where these places are:


      1. Sheep Range is a mountain range located in Nevada, USA. It''s in the southern
      part of Nevada, north of Las Vegas.


      2. Ruby Mountain (or Ruby Mountains) is also located in Nevada, but it''s in
      the northeastern part of the state, near the town of Elko.


      If I look at Nevada''s geography:

      - Las Vegas is in the southern part of Nevada

      - Sheep Range is north of Las Vegas, but still in the southern half of the state

      - Ruby Mountains are in northeastern Nevada, which is further north than the
      Sheep Range


      So based on this information, Sheep Range is NOT north of Ruby Mountain. Instead,
      Ruby Mountain is north of Sheep Range.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of these two geographic features.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Sheep Range.

      Sheep Range is a mountain range located in southern Nevada, north of Las Vegas
      in Clark County.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Ruby Mountain.

      Ruby Mountain (or Ruby Mountains) is located in northeastern Nevada in Elko
      County.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      When looking at a map of Nevada, the Ruby Mountains are located significantly
      further north in the state compared to the Sheep Range. Elko County (where Ruby
      Mountain is) is in the northern part of Nevada, while Clark County (where Sheep
      Range is) is in the southern part.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Ruby Mountain is located in the northeastern part of Nevada and Sheep
      Range is in the southern part, Sheep Range is NOT north of Ruby Mountain.

      Ruby Mountains are also in Nevada, but they''re located in the northeastern

      Step 3: Now I need to compare their north-south positions.

      Nevada extends from south to north. Las Vegas is in the southern part of Nevada,
      and Elko is in the northeastern part.

      Since Sheep Range is near Las Vegas in southern Nevada, and Ruby Mountains are
      in northeastern Nevada, Ruby Mountains would be north of Sheep Range, not the
      other way around.</think>I need to determine the locations of both Sheep Range
      and Ruby Mountain, and then compare their positions north-south.

      Step 2: Identify where Ruby Mountain is located.

      Ruby Mountain (or Ruby Mountains) is also in Nevada, but is located in the northeastern
      part of the state, near the town of Elko.


      Step 3: Compare their relative north-south positions.

      Looking at a map of Nevada, Elko and the Ruby Mountains are significantly further
      north in the state compared to the Sheep Range.


      Since Ruby Mountain is in northeastern Nevada and Sheep Range is in southern
      Nevada, Ruby Mountain is actually north of Sheep Range, not the other way around.

      step by step.


      First, I need to identify the locations of both the Sheep Range and Ruby Mountain.


      Sheep Range is a mountain range located in Nevada, USA, north of Las Vegas in
      the Desert National Wildlife Refuge.


      Ruby Mountain (or more commonly known as the Ruby Mountains) is also a mountain
      range in Nevada, but it''s located in the northeastern part of the state, near
      the town of Elko.


      To determine their relative positions, I need to consider their locations within
      Nevada:

      - Sheep Range is in southern Nevada, north of Las Vegas

      - Ruby Mountains are in northeastern Nevada


      If I think about Nevada''s geography, the Ruby Mountains are in the northeastern
      part of the state, while the Sheep Range is in the southern part of the state.
      This would mean that Sheep Range is actually south of Ruby Mountain, not north
      of it.</think>To answer whether Sheep Range is located north of Ruby Mountain,
      I need to identify the geographic locations of both features.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Sheep Range.

      Sheep Range is a mountain range located in southern Nevada, specifically in
      the Desert National Wildlife Refuge north of Las Vegas.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Ruby Mountain.

      Ruby Mountain (or the Ruby Mountains) is located in northeastern Nevada, near
      the town of Elko.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      When comparing these locations within Nevada, the Ruby Mountains are situated
      in the northeastern part of the state, while the Sheep Range is in the southern
      portion.


      Step 4: Determine their relative positions.

      Since northeastern Nevada is farther north than southern Nevada, Ruby Mountain
      is actually north of Sheep Range, not the other way around.

      1. Sheep Range is a mountain range located in Nevada, USA, north of Las Vegas.

      2. Ruby Mountains is also a mountain range in Nevada, but it''s located in the
      northeastern part of the state, near Elko.


      If I recall correctly, Las Vegas is in southern Nevada, so Sheep Range is in
      southern Nevada. And Elko is in northeastern Nevada, so Ruby Mountains is in
      northeastern Nevada.


      Given that Nevada is roughly rectangular with the longer dimension running north-south,
      and northeastern Nevada is north of southern Nevada, Ruby Mountains should be
      north of Sheep Range, not the other way around.


      So Sheep Range is NOT located north of Ruby Mountain. Instead, Ruby Mountain

      Ruby Mountain (or the Ruby Mountains) is a mountain range in northeastern Nevada,
      near the town of Elko.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      Nevada extends significantly in the north-south direction. Elko and the Ruby
      Mountains are in the northeastern part of Nevada, while the Sheep Range is in
      the southern part of the state.

      in southwestern China. It''s a major lake near the city of Dali.


      Khyargas Nuur: Khyargas Nuur (or Lake Khyargas) is a lake in Mongolia. It''s

      Now to determine their relative positions:

      - China is south of Mongolia

      - Yunnan province is in southern China

      To determine this, I need to identify the geographic locations of both lakes
      and compare their latitudes.


      ## Step 1: Locate Erhai Lake

      Erhai Lake is located in Yunnan Province in southwestern China, near the city

      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Since Mongolia is entirely north of China, and Khyargas Nuur is in Mongolia
      while Erhai Lake is in southern China, Erhai Lake must be south of Khyargas
      Nuur, not north of it.

      Let me think about the locations of each:


      Laguna de Leche (meaning "Milk Lagoon") is a lake in Cuba. Cuba is an island

      Belmont Lake is in Ontario, Canada. Ontario is a province in Canada, which is

      Ontario, Canada is much further north, generally between 42-57 degrees North
      latitude.

      south of Belmont Lake.</think>To determine if Laguna de Leche is north of Belmont
      Lake (Ontario), I need to find the geographic locations of both bodies of water

      - Laguna de Leche is a lake located in Cuba, in the Caribbean region.

      - Belmont Lake is located in Ontario, Canada.


      Step 2: Compare the approximate latitudes.

      - Cuba is situated in the Caribbean, roughly between 19-23 degrees North latitude.

      - Ontario, Canada is much further north, generally between 42-57 degrees North
      latitude.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Belmont Lake is in Ontario, it sits at a much higher latitude than any
      point in Cuba.

      - This means Laguna de Leche (in Cuba) must be south of Belmont Lake (in Ontario).

      Given these locations:

      - Lake Baskunchak is in southern Russia

      - Shammar Mountains are in northern Saudi Arabia


      Saudi Arabia is located south of Russia. The Arabian Peninsula is definitely
      south of the Caspian region and Astrakhan Oblast where Lake Baskunchak is located.

      northern part of the Caspian Depression.


      Step 2: Identify the Shammar Mountains'' location.

      The Shammar Mountains (also spelled Shammer) are a mountain range located in
      northern Saudi Arabia, in the Arabian Peninsula.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Russia is located in the northern hemisphere, while Saudi Arabia is significantly
      south of Russia. The Arabian Peninsula where the Shammar Mountains are located
      is far south of the Caspian region where Lake Baskunchak is situated.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their global positions.

      Since Saudi Arabia is south of Russia, the Shammar Mountains must be south of
      Lake Baskunchak, not north of it.

      Calabogie Lake is located in Ontario, Canada. It''s in eastern Ontario, in the
      Ottawa Valley region.


      Nettilling Lake is located in Nunavut, Canada. It''s on Baffin Island, which
      is in the Arctic region of Canada.


      Nunavut is in the far northern part of Canada, while Ontario is much further

      Given this information, Nettilling Lake is almost certainly further north than

      Step 2: Identify where Nettilling Lake is located.

      Nettilling Lake is one of the largest lakes in Nunavut, Canada. It''s located

      Nunavut and Baffin Island are in the far northern region of Canada, well into

      Step 4: Make a determination based on their relative positions.

      Since Nettilling Lake is in the Arctic region of Canada (Nunavut) and Calabogie
