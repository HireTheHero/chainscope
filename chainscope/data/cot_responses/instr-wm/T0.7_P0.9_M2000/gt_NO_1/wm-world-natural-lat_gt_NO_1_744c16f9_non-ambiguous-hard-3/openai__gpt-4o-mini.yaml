      - Lake Sandoval (Peru) is in South America.

      - The Great Craggy Mountains (North Carolina) are in North America.

      1. **Location of Songkhla Lake**: Songkhla Lake is located in southern Thailand,
      near the city of Songkhla. It is the largest natural lake in Thailand.


      2. **Location of Taudaha Lake**: Taudaha Lake is located in the Kathmandu Valley
      of Nepal, near the city of Kathmandu.


      Now we can compare their locations:


      - Songkhla Lake is in Thailand (southern region).

      - Taudaha Lake is in Nepal (northern region).


      Given that Nepal is situated to the north of Thailand, we can conclude that
      Taudaha Lake is actually north of Songkhla Lake.

      - The Rif Mountains are in Morocco, which is in North Africa.


      Given that Nigeria is south of Morocco, the Mambilla Plateau cannot be north

      north of Schwarzsee, let''s first identify their locations.


      1. **Simandou**: This is a mountain range and a mining area in Guinea, West
      Africa. It is known for its significant iron ore deposits.


      2. **Schwarzsee**: This refers to several lakes with the name "Schwarzsee,"
      but one of the most notable is located in Switzerland, near the region of the
      Swiss Alps.


      Now, to compare their locations:


      - Simandou is situated in West Africa.

      - Schwarzsee (specifically the one in Switzerland) is located in Europe.


      Next, we need to establish the relative positions:


      - West Africa (where Simandou is) is generally south of Europe (where Schwarzsee
      is located).

      - Therefore, Simandou cannot be north of Schwarzsee.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      NO.'

      1. **Simandou**: Simandou is a mountain range and associated mining area located

      2. **Schwarzsee**: The term "Schwarzsee" can refer to multiple lakes or places

      - Simandou is situated in West Africa, specifically located south of the Sahara
      Desert.

      - Schwarzsee, particularly the one in Switzerland, is located in Central Europe,
      and it is situated at a higher latitude compared to Guinea.


      Since Switzerland (where Schwarzsee is located) is further north than Guinea
      (where Simandou is located), it follows that Simandou is indeed south of Schwarzsee.
