      if Saronic Gulf is located north of Gjende.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - The Saronic Gulf is a gulf of the Aegean Sea located in Greece, between the
      peninsula of Attica and the northeastern Peloponnese.

      - Gjende is a lake in Jotunheimen National Park in Norway.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate latitudes.

      - Greece is located in southern Europe, and the Saronic Gulf is situated around
      37-38 degrees North latitude.

      - Norway is in northern Europe, and Gjende lake is located around 61 degrees
      North latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Since Norway (where Gjende is located) is much further north in Europe than
      Greece (where the Saronic Gulf is located), Gjende has a higher latitude than
      the Saronic Gulf.


      Step 4: Determine if Saronic Gulf is north of Gjende.

      - Since Gjende has a higher latitude than the Saronic Gulf, the Saronic Gulf
      is south of Gjende, not north of it.


      NO, the Saronic Gulf is not located north of Gjende. The Saronic Gulf is in

      1) First, I need to identify the locations of both lakes.

      2) Lake Chapala is located in Mexico, in the state of Jalisco, near Guadalajara.

      4) In terms of latitude, Mexico is south of Canada.

      5) Therefore, Lake Chapala (in Mexico) is located south of Pakowki Lake (in

      Thong Chai Range and Baiyang Lake, and then compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Thanon Thong Chai Range.

      The Thanon Thong Chai Range is a mountain range in northern Thailand, running
      roughly north-south along the western part of the country near the Myanmar border.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Baiyang Lake.

      Baiyang Lake (also known as Baiyangdian) is a large freshwater lake located
      in Hebei Province in northern China.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Thailand is located in Southeast Asia, while Hebei Province in China is in East
      Asia. Geographically, Thailand is south of China. Since the Thanon Thong Chai
      Range is in northern Thailand and Baiyang Lake is in northern China, the mountain
      range must be south of the lake.


      NO, the Thanon Thong Chai Range is not located north of Baiyang Lake. It is
      located south of Baiyang Lake.'

      3) The Philippine Sea is a marginal sea east of the Philippines, bounded by
      the Philippine archipelago on the west, Taiwan to the northwest, and Japan to
      the north.


      4) Geographically, New Guinea (where the Sudirman Range is located) is south
      of the equator and south of the Philippines.


      5) Since the Philippine Sea is east of the Philippines, and the Sudirman Range
      is south of the Philippines, the Sudirman Range must be southwest of the Philippine
      Sea.

      is located north of the Philippine Sea, I need to identify the locations of
      both geographic features.


      Step 1: Identify the location of the Sudirman Range.

      The Sudirman Range is a mountain range located in the western portion of New
      Guinea island, specifically in the Indonesian province of Papua (formerly Irian
      Jaya). It contains Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid), the highest peak in Oceania.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Philippine Sea.

      The Philippine Sea is a marginal sea east of the Philippines, occupying part
      of the western Pacific Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      New Guinea island (where the Sudirman Range is located) is south of the equator
      and southeast of the Philippines. The Philippine Sea is north of New Guinea
      and east of the Philippines.


      Step 4: Determine their north-south relationship.

      Since the Sudirman Range is in New Guinea, which is south of the Philippine
      Sea, the Sudirman Range cannot be north of the Philippine Sea.


      NO, the Sudirman Range is not located north of the Philippine Sea. It is located

      Step 1: Identify where Guardafui Channel is located.

      The Guardafui Channel is a waterway between the Horn of Africa (specifically
      the northeastern tip of Somalia, Cape Guardafui) and the Arabian Peninsula (Yemen).
      It connects the Gulf of Aden to the Indian Ocean. This places it in northeastern
      Africa/southwestern Asia.


      Step 2: Identify where Lake Boyukshor is located.

      Lake Boyukshor is a saltwater lake located in Azerbaijan, specifically near
      the capital city of Baku. It''s one of the lakes in the Absheron Peninsula by
      the Caspian Sea.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine which is further north.

      Azerbaijan is located in the Caucasus region, which is significantly further
      north than the Horn of Africa. Azerbaijan is roughly between 38-42 degrees north
      latitude, while the Guardafui Channel is around 11-12 degrees north latitude.

      Since Azerbaijan (where Lake Boyukshor is located) is at a much higher latitude
      than the Guardafui Channel, the Guardafui Channel is NOT north of Lake Boyukshor.
      In fact, it''s the opposite - Lake Boyukshor is north of the Guardafui Channel.
