      might be later in the year than Amber House.  Regardless, the English version

      Since I can''t determine which was published later *in* 2012 without more information,
      I can only say that one was not published in a year *after* the other.  Therefore,

      3. **Compare the release dates.** Semiosis (Feb 2018) was indeed released before
      the US release of The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle (Sept 2018). However,
      it was released around the same time as the UK release.  We need to know which
      release is being referenced in the question. Assuming the question refers to
      the initial publication date (UK), then they were released around the same month.  The
      question does not provide enough information to determine which book came out
      *later* within the same month.


      NO (assuming UK release of Turton''s book is meant). It was not released *later*.

      2. **Clarify "Red Dwarf":**  "Red Dwarf" is primarily a TV series.  Doug Naylor
      co-created the series and wrote many episodes and novels based on it.  To answer
      accurately, we need to know if the question refers to the first airing of the
      TV series or the release of a specific "Red Dwarf" *book* written by Naylor.  Since
      the question specifically mentions books by *both* authors, we''ll assume it
      refers to a Red Dwarf novel.


      3. **Find publication dates:** Research is needed to find the dates. "Devices
      and Desires" was published in 1989.  Doug Naylor wrote several Red Dwarf novels.
      "Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers," the first, was published in 1989. Other
      books in the series followed later.

      novel, "Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers," were published in the same year,

      assume we''re talking about the most prominent one.

      3. **We need the release date of Pierce Brown''s *Golden Son*.**

      A quick search shows a Fandemonium book about the Red Hot Chili Peppers was
      released in 2004. *Golden Son* was released in 2015.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

      3. **Compare the dates:** Both were published in the same year.  Further research
      might be needed to determine precise release dates within the year if a simple
      yes/no is required. However, given the phrasing of the question, it''s plausible
      one was released even a day later than the other.


      4. **Consider the question:** The question asks if *The Naked God* was released
      *later* than *Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years*.


      5. **Conclusion:**  It''s possible.  Without more precise publication information,
      a definitive YES or NO is difficult. However, since it''s *possible* it was
      released later, the most accurate answer based on available information leaning
      towards probability is:


      YES

      year. Further research is needed to determine if one was released earlier in
      the year than the other.  *Exo* appears to have a publication date of May 2014,
      while *Waterloo* appears to have a publication date of May 22, 2014, in the
      UK, and June 3, 2014, in the US.


      4. **Determine if *Exo* was released *later* than *Waterloo*:**  *Exo*''s May
      2014 publication predates both the UK and US release dates for *Waterloo*.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.

      2. **Find publication date of *While the Light Lasts*:** This short story collection
      was published in 1997 as well. However, further research reveals it was published
      posthumously, compiling stories from much earlier in Christie''s career.  The
      copyright date is listed as 1924-1994.  The important date here is 1997, the
      publication date of the collection.

      would be needed to determine which was published first.  Without that information,
      a definitive answer is impossible.


      Therefore, I cannot give a YES/NO answer.

      Since both were published in the same year, I need more information to determine
      which was published *later*.  However, if the question is simply if Hannibal
      was released *after* (at any point after, even in the same year), then it''s
      possible.  Without more specific release dates, I cannot definitively say yes
      or no.


      However, based on readily available information, I have to say **NO**, assuming
      "later" implies after the other in the same year.  If just at a later point
      in time, without knowing the exact month of publication for both, it''s impossible
      to give a definitive answer.

      3. **Compare the dates:**  While both were published in 1956, *Against the Fall
      of Night* predates *Diamonds Are Forever*. The revised and expanded *City and
      the Stars* was also published in 1956.  It''s difficult to ascertain with certainty
      which specific 1956 publication came first without more specific date information.  However,
      the question asks about *The City and the Stars* (the 1956 version) not *Against
      the Fall of Night*.


      4. **Answer the question:** Since both were published in the same year, it is
      possible that Diamonds are Forever came out earlier in the year. More information
      is needed to be certain.  However, based on available information, a definitive
      YES or NO cannot be given.  If forced to choose, the most accurate answer based
      on the information at hand would be to lean towards NO.  But more information
      is needed to be 100% certain.

      to find the exact month of publication for each book to make a definitive determination.
      Without that, a precise answer isn''t possible.


      Since the question asks specifically about the 1956 version of *The City and

      we cannot definitively say without more information.

      heavily revised version, published as *The City and the Stars*, was released
      in 1960.  Since the question doesn''t specify which version, we need to consider
      both dates.


      2. **Find publication date of *Diamonds Are Forever*:** Published in 1955.


      3. **Compare the dates:** 1953 is earlier than 1955, and 1960 is later than
      1955.


      4. **Determine the answer:** Since the revised version of *The City and the
      Stars* was published in 1960, which is later than 1955, the answer concerning
      that version is YES.  However, the original version, *Against the Fall of Night*,
      was published in 1953, which is earlier than 1955.


      So, the final answer depends on which version the question refers to. If it''s
      *The City and the Stars*, the answer is YES.  If it''s *Against the Fall of
      Night*, the answer is NO.  Since the question uses the title *The City and the
      Stars*, we will use the 1960 date.


      Final Answer: YES

    ce85f8e5-3d99-41f5-b7a3-7f13446b76e6: '1. **Identify the authors:** John Ringo
      and Jeffrey Archer (despite the pseudonym used in the question).

      2. **Realize the trick:** "The Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare" is a reference
      to Jeffrey Archer, a British author and politician who was made a life peer.  "The
      Gospel According to Judas" is a book attributed to him, though with controversy
      surrounding its true authorship and whether it was ever actually released beyond
      early drafts.

      3. **John Ringo''s "Into the Looking Glass" exists:** This is a real book within
      the "Looking Glass" series.

      4. **Determine if "The Gospel According to Judas" was ever published:** While
      associated with Archer, and drafts possibly existing, it appears never to have
      been formally released.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.  Since "Into the Looking Glass" was published,
      and "The Gospel According to Judas" was seemingly not, the former *must* have
      been released later.

      is a sequel to *The Talisman* (1984) co-written with Peter Straub.  *Black House*
      was likely released later in the year than *Rebecca''s Tale* given the publication
      history, although this cannot be confirmed without more specific release dates.


      However, the question only asks if *Black House* was released *later* than *Rebecca''s
