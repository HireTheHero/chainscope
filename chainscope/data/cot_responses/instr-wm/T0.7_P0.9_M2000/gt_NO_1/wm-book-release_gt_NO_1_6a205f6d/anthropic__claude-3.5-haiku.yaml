      3. Compare the publication years

      - Both books were published in the same year (2002)


      4. Since they were published in the same year, "later" would mean a later date
      within 2002

      - I do not have precise month/day information to definitively say which was
      published later in 2002


      5. Without specific month/day details, I cannot confidently determine which
      book was released later.


      Given the information available to me, I cannot definitively answer YES or NO.


      However, if forced to give a binary answer, I would say: NO (since I cannot
      confirm one was definitively later than the other)'
