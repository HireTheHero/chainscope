      2. **Identify the Publication Year of "Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit" by Jeanette
      Winterson**: "Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit" was published in 1985.


      3. **Compare the Publication Years**: Since both books were published in the
      same year, 1985, we cannot determine which one was released later without knowing
      the exact release dates within that year.


      Given that both books were published in 1985, and without specific information
      about the exact release dates, it is not possible to definitively say that one
      was released later than the other. Therefore, the answer to the question is
      NO, as we cannot confirm that "Walking on Glass" was released later than "Oranges
      Are Not the Only Fruit" based on the available information.

      2. **Publication Year of Joseph Heller''s "Catch-22"**: "Catch-22" was published

      Since both books were published in the same year (1961), we need to consider

      Given the information available and without specific month details:

      - If "James and the Giant Peach" was published after "Catch-22" in 1961, the
      answer would be YES.

      - If "James and the Giant Peach" was published before or in the same month as
      "Catch-22" in 1961, the answer would be NO.

      published in March 1961, and Joseph Heller''s "Catch-22" was published in October
      1961. Given this, since "Catch-22" was published later in the year, the answer

      information about the release dates of "Because of Mr. Terupt" by Rob Buyea
      or "Great House" by Nicole Krauss. Therefore, without additional information,
      it''s not possible to provide a definitive YES or NO answer to whether "Because
      of Mr. Terupt" was released later than "Great House".


      In general, if two books are published in different years, it''s relatively
      straightforward to determine which one was released later based on the publication
      year. However, if both books were published in the same year, the specific release
      dates within that year would be needed to determine which one was released later.
      Without this information, it''s challenging to provide a conclusive answer.


      To give a more specific response, we would need the exact release dates or more
      information about the publication history of these two books.

      released later than "The Monkey Wrench Gang," we need to compare their release
      dates. Let''s break it down:


      1. **Identify the Release Year of "Shake Hands Forever"**: "Shake Hands Forever"
      by The Baroness Rendell of Babergh (also known as Ruth Rendell) was published
      in 1975.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of "The Monkey Wrench Gang"**: "The Monkey Wrench
      Gang" by Edward Abbey was published in 1975.


      Given that both books were published in the same year, 1975, we cannot definitively
      say one was released later than the other without knowing the exact dates of
      publication within that year. However, the question does not provide or ask
      for that level of detail, and given the information typically available, we
      might consider them as being released in the same year without specifying which
      came out first.


      Given the information and the nature of the question, a precise YES or NO answer
      requires knowing the exact release dates, which are not provided. However, considering
      typical interpretations and the fact that both were published in 1975, the most
      straightforward answer based on the year alone would be NO, as they were not
      released in different years.

      Typically, books released in the same year could be published at any time within
      those 12 months, making it difficult to say which was released later without
      specific dates. However, considering the question asks for a simple YES or NO

      God Delusion" was released later than Clive Cussler''s "Skeleton Coast," we
      need to compare their publication dates.


      1. **Identify the release year of Richard Dawkins''s "The God Delusion"**: "The
      God Delusion" was published in 2006.


      2. **Identify the release year of Clive Cussler''s "Skeleton Coast"**: "Skeleton
      Coast" was published in 2006 as well.


      Since both books were published in the same year, we cannot definitively say
      one was released later than the other without knowing the specific release dates
      (month and day) within that year. However, the question does not provide or
      ask for that level of detail, and given the information typically available,
      we might consider them as being released in the same year without specifying
      which came out first.


      Given the information and the nature of the question, a precise YES or NO answer
      requires knowing the exact release dates, which are not provided. However, considering
      typical interpretations and the fact that both were published in 2006, the most
      straightforward answer based on the year alone would be NO, as they were not
      released in different years.

      released in the same year could be published at any time within those 12 months.

      2. **Identify the publication year of Alastair Reynolds''s "Shadow Captain"**:

      days, weeks, or months within that year.


      Given the information provided, the answer to whether "Fire & Blood" was released

      2. **Identify the publication year of "Before I Fall" by Lauren Oliver**: "Before

      Given that both books were published in the same year, 2010, it might initially

      publication dates within that year. However, considering the nature of the question
      and typical publishing practices, we can make an inference.


      In most cases, books released in the same year are likely to have been published
      at different times within that year. However, without specific release dates,
      we might assume that determining which was released "later" could be complex.


      But, considering the question asks for a simple YES or NO answer regarding whether
      "Skippy Dies" was released later than "Before I Fall," and given that I don''t

      Since both books were published in the same year, we cannot definitively say
      one was released later than the other without knowing the specific publication
      dates within that year. However, the question does not provide or ask for that
      level of detail, and given the information typically available, we might consider
      them as being released in the same year without specifying which came out first.

      requires knowing the exact publication dates, which are not provided. However,
      considering typical interpretations and the fact that both were published in

      they were not released in different years.
