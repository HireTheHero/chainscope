      1. First, let me recall when Live and Let Die was published

      - Live and Let Die was published in 1954

      - It was Ian Fleming''s second James Bond novel


      2. Now, let me recall when The Caves of Steel was published

      "later" than the other.

      - I''m actually not able to verify the existence or publication date of this
      book with confidence


      2. Let me find when Alexander Weinstein''s "Children of the New World" was released

      - "Children of the New World" was published in 2016


      3. Since I cannot verify the existence or publication date of "Two Experts Pick
      the Greatest," I cannot make a valid comparison between the publication dates
      of these two books.


      Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this question,
      as I don''t have enough verified information about one of the books to make
      the comparison.'
