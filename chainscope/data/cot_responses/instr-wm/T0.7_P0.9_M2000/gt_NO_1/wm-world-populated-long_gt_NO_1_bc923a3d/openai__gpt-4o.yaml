      - Lushoto, Tanzania, is situated in East Africa.

      - Sarrin, Syria, is located in the Middle East, specifically in the northern
      part of Syria.


      To determine the east-west relationship:


      - Lushoto, being in Tanzania, is generally positioned to the southeast of Syria
      geographically.

      - Sarrin, in Syria, is situated to the northwest of Tanzania.


      Therefore, when comparing the longitudinal positions, Lushoto is actually located
      to the east of Sarrin.


      The answer is: **YES**.'

      a village located in Nassau County on Long Island, New York, USA. It is situated
      at approximately 73.4 degrees west longitude.


      2. **Identify the location of Joliette Regional County Municipality:** Joliette

      3. **Compare the longitudes:** Both Joliette and Massapequa Park are located
      at approximately the same western longitude.


      Since both locations are at roughly the same longitude, Joliette Regional County
      Municipality is neither east nor west of Massapequa Park. Therefore, the question
      of whether Joliette is east of Massapequa Park is not applicable in this context.

      - Skipwith, North Yorkshire, is situated in the northern part of England.

      - Horndean, Hampshire, is located in the southern part of England.


      By examining a map of England or considering the general geography:


      - North Yorkshire (where Skipwith is located) is north of Hampshire (where Horndean
      is located).

      - In terms of longitude, North Yorkshire is generally west of Hampshire.


      Based on these observations, Skipwith is located west of Horndean.

    b2d36792-679a-418e-b6eb-4177bc624adc: 'To determine whether Thingangyun Township
      is located east of Pyinmana, let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the location of Thingangyun Township:** Thingangyun is a township
      in the eastern part of Yangon, which is a major city in Myanmar.


      2. **Identify the location of Pyinmana:** Pyinmana is a town located in the
      Naypyidaw Union Territory of Myanmar. It is part of the capital region, Naypyidaw,
      and is located further north from Yangon.


      3. **Determine the relative positions:** Yangon, where Thingangyun Township
      is located, is situated to the south of Naypyidaw. Since Pyinmana is part of
      the Naypyidaw Union Territory, it is further north compared to Yangon.


      4. **Compare longitudes:** Generally, Naypyidaw (including Pyinmana) is located
      slightly to the east of Yangon, but the distance in longitude is not significant
      as Naypyidaw is primarily north of Yangon.


      Based on these steps, Thingangyun Township (in Yangon) is generally to the west
      of Pyinmana (in Naypyidaw).

      1. **Budgam**: Budgam is a district located in the union territory of Jammu

      2. **Mandi Dabwali**: Mandi Dabwali is a town located in the Sirsa district
      of Haryana, India. It is situated in the northwestern part of India.


      Now, we compare the longitudinal positions of both locations:


      - Jammu and Kashmir (where Budgam is located) is generally to the north of the
      Indian subcontinent, and Budgam itself is further to the north.

      - Haryana (where Mandi Dabwali is located) is situated more towards the central

      - Since Yuli is on the eastern coast of Taiwan, it is relatively further east
      within the context of the island.


      Given this information, Yuli, Hualien is indeed east of Fuga Island.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      3. **Relative Positioning**: Assuming Stepan is a place in Eastern Europe or
