      state of Wyoming.

      2. Topolobampo is located in Mexico, on the western coast, in the state of Sinaloa.

      3. We know that the western coast of Mexico (Topolobampo) is along the Pacific
      Ocean, and Wyoming is inland, toward the central-northern region of the U.S.

      4. Generally, the western coast of Mexico lies to the west of most inland U.S.

      1. Cody is located in Wyoming, United States. Wyoming is in the western part
      of the United States, but still relatively inland, far from the Pacific coast.


      2. Topolobampo is located in Mexico, on the Pacific coast, in the state of Sinaloa.
      Sinaloa is located on Mexico''s west coast, along the Gulf of California (Sea
      of Cortez).


      3. Generally speaking, Mexico''s Pacific coastline (including the Gulf of California
      region where Topolobampo is located) lies significantly further west compared
      to much of the interior of the United States, including the state of Wyoming.


      4. Cody, Wyoming, although western within the United States, is still positioned
      significantly east of the Pacific coastline areas of Mexico. Wyoming is positioned
      well east of states like California, Nevada, and Arizona, all of which are themselves
      east or northeast of Topolobampo.

    f01959b9-a3fd-4bad-919f-fb7c51cb82b8: 'Let''s think step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations clearly.

      - Cody is located in Wyoming, USA.

      - Topolobampo is located in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, on the western coast
      of Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider their relative geographical positions.

      - Wyoming is located inland in the western part of the United States. Specifically,
      Cody, Wyoming, is in the northwestern part of Wyoming.

      - Topolobampo is located on the western coast of Mexico, facing the Gulf of
      California (Sea of Cortez). Its longitude is relatively far west, close to the
      west coast.


      Step 3: Reason about their longitudes.

      - The west coast of Mexico (including Topolobampo) is typically west of the
      central region of the United States.

      - Wyoming, although considered part of the "western" United States, is actually
      located inland, east of the west coast line of the continent. Therefore, Wyoming
      (including Cody) is east of the western coast of Mexico.

      south of Bulgaria, but the question is specifically about east/west positioning,
      not north/south.


      Step 2: Mati is a coastal town near Athens, Greece. Athens and its coastal towns
      are generally located in the southeastern part of Greece, close to the eastern
      shoreline of mainland Greece, facing the Aegean Sea.


      Step 3: Belovo is located in Bulgaria. Belovo is situated in the Pazardzhik
      Province in western-central Bulgaria, southwest of the capital Sofia.


      Step 4: Since Mati is located near Athens, and Athens is in the southeastern
      part of Greece, it is relatively far east. Belovo, in contrast, is located further
      west, toward central-western Bulgaria.


      Step 5: Therefore, Mati, Greece, being located near the eastern coast of mainland
      Greece, is indeed east of Belovo, Bulgaria, which lies farther west.

      northern England and slightly towards the east.


      Step 4: Confirming the relative longitude positions.

      Skipwith is indeed located further east than Horndean. Horndean is relatively
      more towards the southwest compared to Skipwith.

      - Budgam is located in Jammu and Kashmir, India.

      - Mandi Dabwali is located in Haryana, India.


      Step 2: Consider relative positions.

      - Jammu and Kashmir is situated to the north/northwest of Haryana.

      - Haryana is positioned more to the south-east compared to Jammu and Kashmir.


      Step 3: Specifically check the longitude (east-west coordinate).

      - Budgam (in Jammu and Kashmir) lies towards the north and northwest region
      of India.

      - Mandi Dabwali (in Haryana) lies further south-east, closer to the central-eastern
      region of India.


      Step 4: Determine relative east-west position.

      - Budgam is located to the north-northwest of Mandi Dabwali, which means it
      is generally positioned westward rather than eastward of Mandi Dabwali.


      Therefore, the conclusion is:

      1. Budgam is located in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, India.

      2. Mandi Dabwali is located in the state of Haryana, India, near the border
      of Punjab and Rajasthan.

      3. Jammu and Kashmir is located to the north and slightly northwest of Haryana.

      4. Budgam, being in Jammu and Kashmir, is situated significantly to the north-northwest

      5. To determine east or west relative positions, we must consider their longitudinal
      positions. Generally, Jammu and Kashmir locations tend to be located further
      north and somewhat west compared to Haryana locations.


      Considering the general geographical layout:

      - Haryana is situated to the southeast of Jammu and Kashmir.

      - Budgam (in Jammu and Kashmir) is thus located northwest of Mandi Dabwali (in
      Haryana).

      - Therefore, Budgam is NOT located east of Mandi Dabwali, but rather northwest
      or west-northwest of it.

      1. Yuli, Hualien is located in eastern Taiwan, specifically within Hualien County,
      Taiwan.

      2. Fuga Island is part of the Babuyan Islands group, located in the northern
      Philippines, to the north of Luzon Island.

      3. Taiwan is situated north of the Philippines, and slightly to the northwest
      of the Babuyan Islands.

      4. Given that Yuli, Hualien is on the eastern coast of Taiwan, we must determine
      if it is positioned east or west of Fuga Island.

      5. Since Taiwan is northwest of the Babuyan Islands, including Fuga Island,
      it means that even the eastern coast of Taiwan (including Yuli, Hualien) is
      still located west of Fuga Island.

      1. Yuli is located in Hualien County, Taiwan. Hualien County is situated along
      the eastern coast of Taiwan island.

      2. Fuga Island is one of the northernmost islands of the Philippines, part of
      the Babuyan Islands, located north of Luzon island.

      3. Taiwan, including Hualien County, is located generally north of the Philippine

      4. Fuga Island lies southwest relative to Taiwan island.

      5. Considering the positions: Taiwan island (including Yuli, Hualien County)
      is located northeast of Fuga Island. Thus, Yuli is not east, but rather northeast
      (and more precisely, north-northeast) of Fuga Island.


      Thus, Yuli, Hualien is NOT located directly east of Fuga Island.

    458a378a-ddb9-4d89-a229-724cb8d0d166: 'Let''s think step by step:


      Step 1: Identify locations clearly.

      - Branchville, New Jersey, is located in Sussex County, in the northwestern
      part of New Jersey.

      - Vincentown, New Jersey, is located in Burlington County, in the southern-central
      portion of New Jersey.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions on the map.

      - Branchville, NJ, being located in Sussex County, is in the northwest region
      of the state.

      - Vincentown, NJ, in Burlington County, is more centrally and southerly located.


      Step 3: Determine east-west relationship clearly.

      - Typically, Sussex County and its towns (like Branchville) are located toward
      the northwestern part of New Jersey.

      - Burlington County (and Vincentown within it) is generally more to the southeast
      compared to Sussex County. Thus, Vincentown would typically be located east
      (and south) of Branchville.


      Therefore, Branchville is located west of Vincentown, not east.

    d2483b37-073c-42d6-b444-991705874e2f: 'Step-by-step reasoning:


      1. Menominee County is located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA. It is
      on the western edge of the Upper Peninsula, along Lake Michigan, near the border
      with Wisconsin.


      2. Rossport, Ontario, is situated along the northern shore of Lake Superior
      in Canada, roughly north-northeast of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.


      3. Geographically, Lake Superior is located north and somewhat east of Menominee
      County, Michigan. Given that Rossport lies along the northern shore of Lake
      Superior, its longitude is likely farther east than Menominee County, Michigan.


      4. Menominee County is near the border between Michigan and Wisconsin, on the
      western side of Michigan''s Upper Peninsula, meaning it is relatively far west
      compared to much of Ontario.


      5. Rossport, Ontario, located on the northern shore of Lake Superior, is situated
      farther east in longitude compared to Menominee County, Michigan.

      \ of Michigan, along the western shore of Lake Michigan. It borders Wisconsin\
      \ to the south.\n- Rossport, Ontario is a small community located along the\
      \ northern shore of Lake Superior, in Ontario, Canada.\n\nStep 2: Compare their\
      \ relative longitudes.\n- Menominee County, Michigan is toward the western edge\
      \ of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It is near the border with Wisconsin, thus\
      \ relatively far west compared to most of Michigan.\n- Rossport, Ontario is\
      \ located on the north shore of Lake Superior, considerably eastward relative\
      \ to areas around western Lake Superior, but still north of the central portion\

      \ Superior is generally located west of Lake Michigan.\n- Rossport, Ontario\
      \ (on northern Lake Superior) is likely westward compared to most places along\

      1. Tumed Left Banner is located within Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, near
      the city of Hohhot in northern China.

      2. Sanmenxia is located in western Henan province, in central-eastern China.

      3. Inner Mongolia (and specifically Tumed Left Banner near Hohhot) is situated
      significantly to the north and slightly west relative to Henan province.

      4. Sanmenxia, being in western Henan, is located southeast of Inner Mongolia''s
      Tumed Left Banner.


      Thus, Tumed Left Banner is located to the northwest (and certainly not east)
