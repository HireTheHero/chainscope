      1. First, I''ll locate Mason, Wisconsin on a map

      - Mason is a small town in Bayfield County, Wisconsin, located in the northwestern
      part of the state


      2. Next, I''ll locate East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana

      - This parish is located in southeastern Louisiana, where the state capital
      Baton Rouge is situated


      3. Now I''ll compare their relative positions

      - Wisconsin is north of Louisiana

      - More specifically, Mason, Wisconsin is in the far northwest of Wisconsin

      - East Baton Rouge Parish is in southeastern Louisiana


      4. Considering east/west positioning

      - Mason, Wisconsin is west of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana

      - This means it is NOT east of East Baton Rouge Parish
