    fdb64b36-5626-4fd5-9a29-5a22ae94b5d3: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me identify the general locations:

      - Mad River, CA is in northern California

      - Lookingglass, OR is in southern Oregon


      2) In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Mad River, CA is near the California coast

      - Lookingglass, OR is inland in Douglas County, but not far east


      3) Looking at their approximate coordinates:

      - Mad River, CA is very close to the Pacific coast

      - Lookingglass, OR is several miles inland from the coast


      4) When comparing two points on the West Coast, the location further inland
      is generally more eastern


      5) Since Lookingglass is inland and Mad River is closer to the coast, Mad River
      must be WEST of Lookingglass


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      - Hougang is located in the North-East Region of Singapore

      - North Region is, as its name suggests, in the northern part of Singapore


      3. When comparing their relative positions:

      - Hougang lies to the east of the North Region

      - This can be verified by looking at any map of Singapore''s planning areas


      Therefore: YES, Hougang is located east of North Region, Singapore.'
