    5501d41e-1c43-47be-a58f-aeb4be307388: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Cody, Wyoming is a town in the northwestern part of Wyoming state in the United
      States.

      - Topolobampo is a port town located in Sinaloa state on the west coast of Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider their general positions.

      - Wyoming is in the western United States, but not on the Pacific coast.

      - Topolobampo is on Mexico''s Pacific coast.


      Step 3: Compare their positions relative to each other.

      - Wyoming is north of Mexico.

      - More importantly for the east/west question: Topolobampo, being on Mexico''s
      Pacific coast, is further west than most of the continental United States.

      - Cody, Wyoming, while in the western US, is still east of the Pacific coastline
      of Mexico.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Cody, Wyoming is east of Topolobampo, Mexico.


      YES, Cody, Wyoming is located east of Topolobampo.'

      - Laura is a small town located in the Mid North region of South Australia.

      - Carrickalinga is a coastal town located on the Fleurieu Peninsula, south of
      Adelaide.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      - Laura is in the Mid North region, which is generally north of Adelaide.

      - Carrickalinga is on the Fleurieu Peninsula, which is south of Adelaide and
      faces the Gulf St Vincent.


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - Laura is located inland in the Mid North.

      - Carrickalinga is on the western coast of the Fleurieu Peninsula.

      - In South Australia, coastal areas along Gulf St Vincent (where Carrickalinga
      is) tend to be west of the inland areas of the Mid North (where Laura is).


      Step 4: Based on their geographic positions in South Australia, Laura would
      be east of Carrickalinga.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify this. Let me double-check...


      Laura is indeed in the Mid North region, roughly 200km north of Adelaide, and
      slightly to the east. Carrickalinga is on the western coast of the Fleurieu
      Peninsula, southwest of Adelaide.


      So the correct answer is:


      YES'
    df16ac5d-4a22-43d9-9bc1-0bde3338fe19: 'I need to determine the relative positions
      of Laura and Carrickalinga in South Australia.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Laura is located in South Australia.

      Laura is a small town located in the Mid North region of South Australia, approximately
      216 km north of Adelaide.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Carrickalinga is located in South Australia.

      Carrickalinga is a coastal town located on the western coast of the Fleurieu
      Peninsula, approximately 60 km south of Adelaide.


      Step 3: Let me determine their relative east-west positioning.

      In South Australia, coastal locations on the Fleurieu Peninsula like Carrickalinga
      tend to be on the western side of the state. Laura, being in the Mid North region,
      is more inland and generally to the east of the coastal areas of the Fleurieu
      Peninsula.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Laura is positioned more to the east compared to Carrickalinga, which is on
      the western coast.


      NO'

      Marettimo, being off the western coast of Sicily, is in the western Mediterranean.
      Anghiari, being in eastern Tuscany, is more centrally located in the Italian

      Actually, I need to be more precise. Coxheath is more directly northeast of
      Crowhurst rather than due east. When we say something is "east of" another place,
      we typically mean it''s primarily to the east. Since Coxheath has a significant

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Mad River is in California, USA

      - Lookingglass is in Oregon, USA


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of California and Oregon.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California

      - On the west coast of the United States, locations generally run north-south


      Step 3: Determine the relative east-west positioning.

      - Without specific coordinates, I need to consider if Mad River is far enough
      east in California to be east of Lookingglass in Oregon


      Step 4: Looking at more specific geography:

      - Mad River, California is in Trinity County in northwestern California

      - Lookingglass, Oregon is near Roseburg in southwestern Oregon

      - When comparing locations on the same latitude in California and Oregon, the
      Oregon location is typically east of the California location

      Step 1: I need to identify where Whitemark is located.

      Whitemark is a small town located on Flinders Island, which is in Bass Strait
      between mainland Australia and Tasmania.


      Step 2: I need to identify where Forbes, New South Wales is located.

      Forbes is a town in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia.


      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions.

      - Flinders Island (where Whitemark is) is located off the northeastern coast
      of Tasmania.

      - This puts Whitemark significantly southeast of mainland Australia.

      - Forbes is in inland New South Wales, in the eastern part of Australia.


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - While both are in eastern Australia, Flinders Island is further to the east
      than the inland town of Forbes.

      - Whitemark (on Flinders Island) would be east of Forbes, New South Wales.


      YES'

      Boldre is in the south but also toward the southwest of England, while Corley
      is in the Midlands but more toward the center of England. Hampshire is generally
      to the south and slightly west of Warwickshire.


      Therefore, Boldre is NOT east of Corley. In fact, Boldre is west and south of
      Corley.

      Step 1: I need to determine the location of Big Rapids, Michigan.

      Big Rapids is a city in Mecosta County in the central part of Michigan''s Lower
      Peninsula.


      Step 2: I need to determine the location of Rush County, Indiana.

      Rush County is located in eastern Indiana.


      Step 3: I need to compare their east-west positions.

      Michigan is generally east and north of Indiana. However, since Indiana is directly
      south of Michigan, I need to be more precise about the east-west relationship.


      Step 4: Looking at their specific positions:

      - Big Rapids is in central Michigan

      - Rush County is in eastern Indiana


      Since Michigan''s western border is west of Indiana''s western border, and Big
      Rapids is in central Michigan (not eastern Michigan), while Rush County is in
      eastern Indiana (not western Indiana), Big Rapids would be roughly north or
      slightly northwest of Rush County.


      Therefore, Big Rapids, Michigan is NOT east of Rush County, Indiana. It would
      be north or slightly northwest of it.

      Wait, I made a mistake in my conclusion. If Hougang is in the North-East Region
      and the North Region is in the northern part of Singapore, then Hougang would
      be located east of the North Region.


      YES'
    cc0d28db-7d25-4e90-9c54-b3a73c0bea61: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Hougang is located in Singapore.

      Hougang is a residential town located in the North-East Region of Singapore.


      Step 2: Let me identify where the North Region of Singapore is located.

      The North Region of Singapore includes areas like Woodlands, Yishun, and Sembawang,
      which are in the northern part of Singapore.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      Since Hougang is in the North-East Region, and the North Region is in the northern
      part of Singapore, Hougang would be east of the North Region.


      To visualize this: North Region is in the north, while Hougang is in the northeast,
      which means Hougang is positioned to the east of the North Region.


      YES, Hougang is located east of North Region, Singapore.'

      Step 1: I need to identify where Tumed Left Banner is located.

      Tumed Left Banner (also called Tumote Left Banner or Tumd Left Banner) is a
      banner in Inner Mongolia, northern China.


      Step 2: I need to identify where Sanmenxia is located.

      Sanmenxia is a city in western Henan province, central China.


      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions.

      Inner Mongolia is located in northern China, while Henan province is in central
      China. On a map of China, Inner Mongolia is positioned to the north and west
      of Henan province.


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Tumed Left Banner in Inner Mongolia is located in the northern part of China,
      but importantly, it''s positioned to the west of Henan province where Sanmenxia
      is. Therefore, Tumed Left Banner is west of Sanmenxia, not east.

      Tumed Left Banner (also known as Tumote Left Banner or Tumd Left Banner) is
      a banner in Inner Mongolia, China. It''s located in the central part of Inner
      Mongolia, near Hohhot (the capital city of Inner Mongolia).


      Step 2: I need to identify where Sanmenxia is located.

      Sanmenxia is a city in western Henan province, China.


      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions.

      Inner Mongolia is located in northern China, while Henan province is in central-eastern
      China. Specifically, Hohhot and the Tumed Left Banner area are in north-central
      China, while Sanmenxia is further south and east.
