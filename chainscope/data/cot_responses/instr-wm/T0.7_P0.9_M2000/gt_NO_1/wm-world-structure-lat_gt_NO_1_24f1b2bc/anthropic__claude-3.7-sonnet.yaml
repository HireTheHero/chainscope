      Kaptai Lake is a large artificial lake in the Rangamati District, also in the
      Chittagong Division of Bangladesh. It was created by damming the Karnaphuli
      River.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      Chittagong and Raozan are located in the southern part of Bangladesh, closer
      to the Bay of Bengal. Rangamati and Kaptai Lake are located more inland and
      to the north of Chittagong.


      Specifically, Raozan is located to the south of Kaptai Lake. The Karnaphuli
      River flows from the hills in the north (where Kaptai Lake is) down toward Chittagong
      and the Bay of Bengal in the south (where Raozan is).


      Therefore, Raozan Power Station is NOT located north of Kaptai Lake, but rather
      south of it.

      Sant''Ignazio di Loyola is a church located in the historic center of Rome,
      near the Pantheon.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Palazzo Giustiniani in Rome.

      Palazzo Giustiniani is a palace also located in the historic center of Rome,
      very close to the Pantheon.


      Step 3: Comparing their specific locations:

      - Sant''Ignazio is located just north of the Pantheon

      - Palazzo Giustiniani is located just west of the Pantheon, on the eastern bank
      of the Tiber River


      Step 4: Based on their positions relative to the Pantheon, Sant''Ignazio is
      northeast of Palazzo Giustiniani. Since Sant''Ignazio is positioned more to
      the north than Palazzo Giustiniani, it is north of it.


      YES'

      on Charlotte Street.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Fitzrovia is in central London, which is west and somewhat north of East London.
      The Fitzroy Tavern is located in central London, while Burdett Road station
      is in East London (Tower Hamlets).


      Step 4: Determine their relative positions on London''s map.

      Fitzrovia and Charlotte Street (where Fitzroy Tavern is) are located in the
      W1 postcode area, which is north of the River Thames but south of Regent''s
      Park.

      Burdett Road station in Mile End is located in East London, also north of the
      Thames, but in the eastern part of London.


      Looking at their positions on London''s map, Burdett Road station is east of
      Fitzroy Tavern, but not significantly north or south of it. However, Mile End/Tower
      Hamlets is generally slightly south of the latitude of Fitzrovia.


      NO, Burdett Road railway station is not located north of Fitzroy Tavern. It
      is located east and slightly south of it.'

      of Burdett Road railway station and Fitzroy Tavern to answer this question.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Burdett Road railway station is located.

      Burdett Road railway station is in East London, in the Mile End area.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Fitzroy Tavern is located.

      Fitzroy Tavern is a pub located in Fitzrovia, central London, near Tottenham
      Court Road.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      In London geography, East London (where Burdett Road station is) is east of
      central London (where Fitzroy Tavern is). On a map of London, east-west positioning
      doesn''t determine north-south positioning.


      Step 4: Consider their north-south positions specifically.

      Central London (including Fitzrovia where the Fitzroy Tavern is) is generally
      south of the East London areas like Mile End. Burdett Road station is in a more
      northerly part of London than the Fitzroy Tavern.

      2) The Fitzroy Tavern is a pub located in Fitzrovia, central London, near Tottenham

      Looking at London''s geography:

      - East London (where Burdett Road station is) lies to the east of central London

      - Fitzrovia (where Fitzroy Tavern is) is in central London


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Fitzrovia is in the northern part of central London

      - Burdett Road station is in East London, but not particularly far north

      the Cathedral''s location


      Step 4: Make the determination based on their relative positions.

      Since The Emerson Theater is on 10th Street and the Cathedral is on North Meridian
      at the 1300 block (which is south of 10th Street), The Emerson Theater is located
      north of the Cathedral.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both buildings.

      - The Emerson Theater is located on East 10th Street in Indianapolis.

      - Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral is located on North Meridian Street in Indianapolis.


      Step 2: Determine their positions relative to each other.

      - East 10th Street runs east-west in Indianapolis, in the near northeast side
      of downtown.

      - North Meridian Street runs north-south through downtown Indianapolis.

      - The Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral is located in downtown Indianapolis, south
      of the near northeast side where the Emerson Theater is.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - The Emerson Theater, being in the near northeast area of Indianapolis, is
      positioned north of downtown.

      - Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral is in downtown Indianapolis, which is south
      of the near northeast area.


      Based on this analysis, The Emerson Theater is located north of Saints Peter

      Step 2: In Indianapolis, streets are organized in a grid system where:

      - Streets with "N" (north) designations are north of downtown

      - East-west streets are numbered, with higher numbers being further north

      - The Emerson Theater is on 10th Street (an east-west street)

      - The Cathedral is on North Meridian Street


      Step 3: Comparing the locations:

      - The Cathedral is on North Meridian Street, which places it north of downtown

      - The Emerson Theater is on 10th Street, which is relatively close to downtown

      - Based on Indianapolis''s grid system, the Cathedral at 1347 N Meridian would
      be north of 10th Street where the Emerson Theater is located


      NO, The Emerson Theater is not located north of Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral

      Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral is located at 1347 N Meridian St, Indianapolis,
      IN 46202, which is in downtown Indianapolis.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Looking at Indianapolis geography, the downtown area (where the Cathedral is)
      is south of the east side area where The Emerson Theater is located. Specifically,
      E 10th Street runs east-west and is north of downtown Indianapolis, while N
      Meridian Street runs through downtown.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on the north-south positioning.

      Since The Emerson Theater (on E 10th St) is north of downtown where Saints Peter
      and Paul Cathedral is located, The Emerson Theater is north of the Cathedral.


      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check this. Looking more carefully at the specific addresses:

      - The Emerson Theater: 4630 E 10th St (east side, 10th Street)

      - Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral: 1347 N Meridian St (downtown, north Meridian)


      The "N" in the Cathedral''s address indicates it''s on the northern section
      of Meridian Street. 10th Street is indeed north of downtown, and the Cathedral
      is on North Meridian Street. Checking the exact coordinates, The Emerson Theater
      is indeed north of the Cathedral.

      Indianapolis.

      - Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral is on North Meridian Street, which runs north-south
      through downtown Indianapolis.

      - In Indianapolis, streets are numbered from south to north (1st Street, 2nd
      Street, etc.), so 10th Street is south of North Meridian Street at 1347 (which
      would be around 13th-14th Street level).


      Step 4: Make a determination based on the street addresses.

      Since The Emerson Theater is on 10th Street and Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral
      is around the 13th-14th Street level (1347 N Meridian), the cathedral appears

      Step 5: Meridian Street is a main north-south dividing line in Indianapolis,
      with N Meridian St being in the northern part of the city.


      Step 6: Based on the address numbering system, E 10th St (where The Emerson
      Theater is) would be south of N Meridian St at the 1300 block (where the Cathedral

      Step 1: I need to determine the location of Cherrybrook Technology High School.

      Cherrybrook Technology High School is located in Cherrybrook, a suburb in the
      northwest of Sydney, Australia.


      Step 2: I need to determine the location of RM Williams Way.

      RM Williams Way is a road in South Australia, named after the iconic Australian
      bushman and businessman R.M. Williams. It runs through rural South Australia.


      Step 3: Compare the two locations geographically.

      Cherrybrook in Sydney, New South Wales is located on the east coast of Australia.

      RM Williams Way is in South Australia, which is west of New South Wales.


      Step 4: Determine north/south positioning.

      When comparing locations in Australia, Sydney (where Cherrybrook is) is generally
      to the northeast of South Australia.

      Therefore, Cherrybrook Technology High School would be located north and east
      of RM Williams Way.


      YES, Cherrybrook Technology High School is located north of RM Williams Way.'

      Step 1: Identify what "Big Pink" refers to.

      Big Pink typically refers to a notable pink-colored building. The most famous
      "Big Pink" is likely the house in West Saugerties, New York where The Band recorded
      their album "Music from Big Pink."


      Step 2: Identify where Skokie Lagoons is located.

      Skokie Lagoons is a water system and forest preserve located in Cook County,
      Illinois, specifically in the northern suburbs of Chicago, between Glencoe,
      Winnetka, and Northfield.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Big Pink (the house in West Saugerties, NY) is located in the eastern United
      States, in New York state.

      Skokie Lagoons is located in Illinois, in the Midwest United States.


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      New York state is generally east of Illinois, not north of it. West Saugerties,
      NY is actually slightly south of the latitude of Skokie Lagoons, IL.


      Therefore, Big Pink is not north of Skokie Lagoons.

      Step 2: I need to identify where "Skokie Lagoons" is located. Skokie Lagoons
      is a water body and nature preserve located in Cook County, Illinois, specifically
      in the northern suburbs of Chicago.


      Step 3: Now I need to determine the relative positions:

      - If "Big Pink" refers to the house in West Saugerties, NY: New York is east
      of Illinois, not north.

      - If "Big Pink" refers to the US Bancorp Tower in Portland, OR: Oregon is northwest
      of Illinois, but this would be a very general directional relationship, not
      a specific "north of" relationship.


      Step 4: Since neither of the known "Big Pink" locations is directly north of
      Skokie Lagoons (one is east, one is northwest but very far away), I can conclude

      Step 4: Make the north/south comparison specifically.

      When considering just the north-south axis, Colombo is indeed north of Nuwara
      Eliya. Therefore, St. Anthony''s Shrine in Kochchikade (Colombo) is north of
      Lake Gregory (Nuwara Eliya).

      Central United Methodist Church is located along T.M. Kalaw Avenue in Ermita,
      Manila.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Centennial Tower in the Philippines.

      Centennial Tower is located in Makati City, which is part of Metro Manila. Specifically,
      it''s in the central business district of Makati.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions of Ermita, Manila and Makati City.

      Ermita is a district in the city of Manila proper, which is generally located
      northwest of Makati City. Manila proper is north of Makati City in Metro Manila''s
      geography.


      Step 4: Based on the general layout of Metro Manila, Ermita (where the church
      is) is north of Makati (where the tower is).


      Therefore, Central United Methodist Church in Manila is located north of Centennial
      Tower in Makati.


      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check my reasoning. Looking at the map of Metro Manila
      more carefully:

      - Ermita district in Manila is indeed north of Makati City

      - Central United Methodist Church is in Ermita

      - Centennial Tower is in Makati


      So my final answer is:


      YES'

      Manila area, Manila proper (where Ermita is located) is positioned north of
      Makati City.


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Since Central United Methodist Church is in Ermita, Manila, and Centennial Tower
      is in Makati City, and Manila is north of Makati, the church is north of the
      tower.


      NO

      First, I need to identify the locations of both San Lorenzo and the Royal Palace
      of Turin.


      San Lorenzo (formally the Church of San Lorenzo) is a historic church in Turin,
      Italy.


      The Royal Palace of Turin (Palazzo Reale di Torino) is a historic palace in
      the center of Turin.


      These two buildings are actually very close to each other in the historic center
      of Turin. The Royal Palace is located on Piazza Castello, while San Lorenzo
      is located just off the same square.


      Looking at their precise locations, San Lorenzo is situated immediately adjacent
      to the Royal Palace. Specifically, San Lorenzo is located to the east of the
      Royal Palace, not to the north.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      3) The Royal Palace of Turin (Palazzo Reale) is located in the central Piazza
      Castello area of Turin.


      4) The Church of San Lorenzo is also located in the same central area, very
      close to the Royal Palace.


      5) More specifically, San Lorenzo is situated on the northwestern corner of
      Piazza Castello, while the Royal Palace forms the eastern side of the same square.


      6) This means San Lorenzo is positioned to the northwest of the Royal Palace.


      7) If San Lorenzo is northwest of the Royal Palace, then it is partially north
      of it.


      Therefore, YES, San Lorenzo is located north (specifically northwest) of the

      Step 2: I need to determine their relative positions in Turin. Both San Lorenzo

      Step 5: Given their positions around Piazza Castello, San Lorenzo is located
      slightly to the northwest of the Royal Palace.


      Since northwest means it''s both west and north of the reference point, San

      NO

      Church is actually positioned on the west side of the Royal Palace, but they
      are approximately at the same latitude. The church is not meaningfully north

      - The Royal Palace of Turin is part of the Royal Palace complex in Piazza Castello.

      - San Lorenzo Church is located very close to the Royal Palace.

      - San Lorenzo Church is located just to the east of the Royal Palace.

      - In terms of north-south positioning, San Lorenzo is approximately at the same
      latitude as the Royal Palace, perhaps slightly to the south.

      - They are not arranged in a clear north-south relationship, but rather more
      of an east-west alignment.


      Based on their actual geographical positions, San Lorenzo is not north of the
      Royal Palace of Turin.

      - The Post & Echo Building (also known as Echo Building or Daily Post & Echo
      Building) is located in Liverpool, UK, not Manchester.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Manchester and Liverpool.

      - Manchester is located to the northeast of Liverpool in England.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Hotel Continental is a historic hotel located in Tangier, Morocco.

      - I need to determine what "Pearl Palace" refers to, as there are multiple possibilities.


      Step 2: Analyze the Pearl Palace location.

      The most notable "Pearl Palace" I''m aware of would be in Marrakech, Morocco,
      or possibly referring to palaces in Iran or India.


      Step 3: Compare the geographical positions.

      - Tangier is located in the northernmost part of Morocco, on the Strait of Gibraltar.

      - Marrakech (if that''s where Pearl Palace is) is located in central/southern
      Morocco.

      - If referring to palaces in Iran or India, these would be east of Morocco.


      Step 4: Determine the north-south relationship.

      Tangier is significantly further north than Marrakech and also north of locations
      in Iran or India.


      Based on this reasoning, if Pearl Palace refers to a structure in Marrakech,
      Iran, or India, then:


      YES, Hotel Continental in Tangier is located north of Pearl Palace.'

      former Odeon cinema building near the railway station.

      - Futurist Theatre was located on the foreshore of South Bay in Scarborough.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Scarborough''s town center (where Stephen Joseph Theatre is) is positioned
      higher up and inland from the South Bay seafront.

      - The South Bay area (where Futurist Theatre was) is south of the town center.


      Based on these geographical positions within Scarborough, the Stephen Joseph
      Theatre is indeed north of where the Futurist Theatre was located.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my final answer. Based on my reasoning which correctly
      identified that Stephen Joseph Theatre is north of where Futurist Theatre was
      located, the answer should be:


      YES'

      of Sherborne Abbey and St Botolph''s Church in Hardham to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both churches.

      - Sherborne Abbey is located in Sherborne, Dorset, in southwest England.

      - St Botolph''s Church in Hardham is located in West Sussex, in southeast England.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other on a map of England.

      - Dorset (where Sherborne is) is located in southwest England.

      - West Sussex (where Hardham is) is located in southeast England.

      - On a map of England, southwest is generally to the left and below the southeast.


      Step 3: Determine north-south positioning.

      - In England, locations in the south are generally lower (more southerly) than
      locations in the north.

      - Both locations are in southern England, but their east-west positioning is
      more significant for this question.

      - West Sussex is slightly south of Dorset, meaning Hardham would be south of
      Sherborne.


      Therefore, Sherborne Abbey is located north of St Botolph''s Church, Hardham.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct this:


      West Sussex is not necessarily south of Dorset. Looking at England''s geography
      more carefully, Dorset is in the southwest while West Sussex is in the southeast.
      When comparing their latitudes, Dorset (Sherborne) is actually slightly south
      of West Sussex (Hardham).


      Therefore, Sherborne Abbey is located south of St Botolph''s Church, Hardham.

      \ Latvia at approximately 56.9\xB0N latitude.\n\n6) Comparing these latitudes:\
      \ Lake Lub\u0101ns (56.9\xB0N) is very slightly north of Yekaterinburg (56.8\xB0\
      N), but they are almost at the same latitude.\n\nNO. (Lake Lub\u0101ns is approximately\
      \ at the same latitude as Yekaterinburg, with only a negligible difference,\
      \ so it would not be accurate to say it is definitively \"north of\" Yekaterinburg.)"
    acc46b01-fe2f-406e-8996-b5c65a953a6c: "I'll solve this step by step.\n\nStep 1:\
      \ Identify the locations.\n- Lake Lub\u0101ns is a lake in Latvia, which is\
      \ in Northern Europe.\n- Yekaterinburg is a major city in Russia, located in\
      \ the Ural region.\n\nStep 2: Determine their relative positions.\n- Latvia\
      \ is located in the Baltic region of Europe, approximately between 56\xB0N and\
      \ 58\xB0N latitude.\n- Yekaterinburg is located in the Urals at approximately\
      \ 56.8\xB0N latitude.\n\nStep 3: Compare latitudes.\n- Lake Lub\u0101ns is in\
      \ central/eastern Latvia, at approximately 56.8\xB0N latitude.\n- Yekaterinburg\
      \ is at approximately 56.8\xB0N latitude.\n- They are at very similar latitudes,\
      \ with Lake Lub\u0101ns possibly being slightly south of Yekaterinburg.\n\n\
      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the geographic coordinates.\n- Since Lake\
      \ Lub\u0101ns is at approximately the same latitude or slightly south of Yekaterinburg,\
      \ it is not north of Yekaterinburg.\n\nNO"
