      \n1. **Hvalsey Church Location:**\n   - Hvalsey Church is a Norse ruin located\
      \ in Greenland. Specifically, it is situated near the village of Qaqortoq on\
      \ the island of Greenland.\n\n2. **USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) Location:**\n   -\
      \ The USCGC Escanaba (WPG-77) was a United States Coast Guard cutter. However,\
      \ as a ship, its location would not be fixed. Generally, during its active service\
      \ in World War II, it operated in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nFor the purpose\
      \ of this question, if you are referring to the last known coordinates or a\
      \ specific event's location of the USCGC Escanaba, you would need to specify\
      \ that. However, since ships move, a fixed comparison is not straightforward\
      \ without more context.\n\nAssuming you refer to a notable event like where\
      \ it sunk:\n\n- **Sinking of USCGC Escanaba:**\n  - The USCGC Escanaba sank\
      \ in the North Atlantic Ocean near the coast of Greenland.\n\nNow, let's compare:\n\
      \n- **Latitude of Hvalsey Church:** Approximately 60.8\xB0N (Qaqortoq area).\n\
      - **Latitude of North Atlantic near Greenland (where Escanaba sank):** This\
      \ is generally around 60\xB0N to 61\xB0N.\n\nGiven that the sinking location\
      \ could vary slightly based on specific coordinates, it's roughly in the same\
      \ latitude range. Therefore, based on this general understanding:\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\
      Hvalsey Church is likely at a similar latitude or just slightly north compared\
      \ to the typical operating or sinking area of the USCGC Escanaba if considering\
      \ its service near Greenland. However, exact coordinates would be required for\
      \ a precise answer.\n\nHence, the answer with the given general information\
      \ is **NO**, Hvalsey Church is not definitively located north of the sinking\
      \ location of the USCGC Escanaba."

      1. The Emerson Theater is located at 4634 E 10th St, Indianapolis, IN 46201.

      2. The Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral is located at 1347 N Meridian St, Indianapolis,

      - The Emerson Theater is on 10th Street, which is further south compared to
      the location of the Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral on Meridian Street, which
      is north of downtown Indianapolis.


      Therefore, The Emerson Theater is not located north of the Saints Peter and
      Paul Cathedral.

      Roman Catholic Church is situated on West Street in Drogheda.


      2. **Identify the location of Saint Laurence Gate:** Saint Laurence Gate is
