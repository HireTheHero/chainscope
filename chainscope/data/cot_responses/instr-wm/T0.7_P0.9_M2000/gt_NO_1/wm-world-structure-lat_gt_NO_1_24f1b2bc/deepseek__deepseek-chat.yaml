      the locations of Kaibab Lake and Buffavento Castle and assess whether Kaibab
      Lake is north of Buffavento Castle.


      ### Step 1: Locate Kaibab Lake

      Kaibab Lake is a reservoir located in northern Arizona, United States. It is
      situated near Williams, Arizona, and is part of the Kaibab National Forest.


      ### Step 2: Locate Buffavento Castle

      Buffavento Castle is a medieval castle located in northern Cyprus. It is situated
      on the Kyrenia mountain range, near the city of Kyrenia (Girne).


      ### Step 3: Compare the Locations

      - Kaibab Lake is in the United States (North America).

      - Buffavento Castle is in Cyprus (Europe and Asia).


      ### Step 4: Determine Relative Positions

      Since Kaibab Lake is in North America and Buffavento Castle is in Cyprus, which
      is in the eastern Mediterranean, Kaibab Lake is not directly north of Buffavento
      Castle. Instead, it is located to the west and slightly north of Cyprus.


      ### Conclusion

      NO, Kaibab Lake is not located directly north of Buffavento Castle.'

      \ Jahanpanah is located north of the Cathedral Church of St. Luke in Orlando,\
      \ Florida. To answer this, I need to understand where both places are located.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to clarify where Jahanpanah\
      \ and the Cathedral Church of St. Luke are situated.\n\n- **Cathedral Church\
      \ of St. Luke**: This is a well-known church located in Orlando, Florida. I\
      \ can easily find its exact location using an online map or directory.\n\n-\
      \ **Jahanpanah**: This name sounds unfamiliar to me in the context of Orlando,\
      \ Florida. It seems more like a name from South Asia, possibly a city or a region\
      \ in India or Pakistan. I need to verify this.\n\n### Step 2: Research Jahanpanah\n\
      \nTo proceed, I should conduct some research on Jahanpanah.\n\nUpon a quick\
      \ search, I find that Jahanpanah refers to a historical city in India, specifically\
      \ a part of Delhi. It was one of the cities established by the Tughlaq dynasty\
      \ in the 14th century. Today, it's a neighborhood within the larger metropolitan\
      \ area of Delhi.\n\nThis means Jahanpanah is located in India, not in the United\
      \ States or specifically in Orlando, Florida.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Locations\n\
      \nNow that I know:\n\n- **Cathedral Church of St. Luke** is in Orlando, Florida,\
      \ USA.\n- **Jahanpanah** is in Delhi, India.\n\nGiven that India is in South\
      \ Asia and Florida is in North America, these two locations are in entirely\
      \ different continents.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Relative Directions\n\n\
      Since Jahanpanah is in India and the Cathedral Church of St. Luke is in Florida,\
      \ USA, I need to determine their relative positions on the globe.\n\nGenerally,\
      \ India is located to the east of the United States. Therefore, from the perspective\
      \ of someone in Florida looking towards India, India would be to the east, not\
      \ north.\n\nHowever, to be precise, I should consider their latitudes.\n\n-\
      \ **Orlando, Florida**: Approximately 28.5383\xB0 N latitude.\n- **Delhi, India**:\
      \ Approximately 28.6139\xB0 N latitude.\n\nBoth locations are at similar latitudes,\
      \ with Delhi being slightly north of Orlando. However, the difference is minimal\
      \ in the context of their global positions.\n\n### Step 5: Consider the Context\
      \ of the Question\n\nThe question asks if Jahanpanah is located north of the\
      \ Cathedral Church of St. Luke in Orlando, Florida. Given that both are at similar\
      \ latitudes but in different hemispheres, the term \"north\" might be misleading.\n\
      \nHowever, based on the latitude measurements:\n\n- Jahanpanah (Delhi, India)\
      \ is at approximately 28.6139\xB0 N.\n- Cathedral Church of St. Luke (Orlando,\
      \ Florida) is at approximately 28.5383\xB0 N.\n\nSince 28.6139\xB0 N is slightly\
      \ north of 28.5383\xB0 N, technically, Jahanpanah is north of the Cathedral\
      \ Church of St. Luke.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nConsidering the latitudes:\n\
      \n- Jahanpanah is at a slightly higher latitude (further north) than the Cathedral\
      \ Church of St. Luke.\n\nTherefore, **YES**, Jahanpanah is located north of\

      \ The question is: **Is Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station located north of\
      \ Istana Lama?**\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to\
      \ understand where these two places are located.\n\n- **Isimba Hydroelectric\
      \ Power Station**: This is a hydroelectric power plant in Uganda. From what\
      \ I recall, it's situated along the Victoria Nile.\n  \n- **Istana Lama**: This\
      \ term translates to \"Old Palace\" in Malay. It seems to be associated with\
      \ Malaysia, possibly a historical site or a palace there.\n\n### Step 2: Locating\
      \ Uganda and Malaysia on the Map\n\nTo determine if one is north of the other,\
      \ I need to know their relative positions on the globe.\n\n- **Uganda**: Located\
      \ in East Africa, near the equator.\n  \n- **Malaysia**: Situated in Southeast\
      \ Asia, also near the equator but in a different hemisphere.\n\n### Step 3:\
      \ Understanding the Concept of North\n\nIf we're to determine if one place is\
      \ north of another, we need to consider their latitudes.\n\n- **Uganda** is\
      \ in the Northern Hemisphere, just south of the equator.\n  \n- **Malaysia**\
      \ is also in the Northern Hemisphere, specifically in Southeast Asia.\n\n###\
      \ Step 4: Comparing the Latitudes\n\nSince both countries are in the Northern\
      \ Hemisphere, I need to see which one is farther north.\n\n- **Uganda's** latitude\
      \ ranges from approximately **1\xB0 South to 4\xB0 North**.\n  \n- **Malaysia's**\
      \ latitude ranges from approximately **1\xB0 North to 7\xB0 North**.\n\nFrom\
      \ this, it seems that Malaysia is generally at a higher latitude (more north)\
      \ than Uganda.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Relative Positions\n\nGiven that\
      \ Malaysia is at a higher latitude than Uganda, locations within Malaysia (like\
      \ Istana Lama) would be north of locations in Uganda (like Isimba Hydroelectric\
      \ Power Station).\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nBased on the geographical locations\
      \ and latitudes:\n\n- **Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station** is in Uganda.\n\
      \  \n- **Istana Lama** is in Malaysia.\n  \nSince Malaysia is north of Uganda,\
      \ **Istana Lama** is north of **Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station**.\n\n**Final\
      \ Answer:** **NO**, Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station is not located north\
      \ of Istana Lama. Instead, Istana Lama is located north of Isimba Hydroelectric\
      \ Power Station."

      \ the Stephen Joseph Theatre is located north of the Futurist Theatre. To answer\
      \ this, I'll need to determine the geographical positions of both theatres.\
      \ Here's how I plan to approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations of\
      \ Both Theatres\n\nFirst, I need to find out where each theatre is located.\
      \ Let's start with the Stephen Joseph Theatre.\n\n#### Stephen Joseph Theatre\n\
      \nI recall that the Stephen Joseph Theatre is associated with the playwright\
      \ Alan Ayckbourn. From what I know, Alan Ayckbourn has been closely connected\
      \ to Scarborough in North Yorkshire, England. A quick search confirms that the\
      \ Stephen Joseph Theatre is indeed located in Scarborough.\n\n#### Futurist\
      \ Theatre\n\nNext, I need to locate the Futurist Theatre. I'm less familiar\
      \ with this one, but I believe it's also in Scarborough. A quick check confirms\
      \ that the Futurist Theatre is indeed situated in Scarborough, North Yorkshire,\
      \ England.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Specific Addresses or Locations\n\n\
      To accurately determine which theatre is north of the other, I need to find\
      \ their specific addresses or at least their general locations within Scarborough.\n\
      \n#### Stephen Joseph Theatre\n\nThe Stephen Joseph Theatre is located on Westborough,\
      \ Scarborough, YO11 1JW. This is in the town center area.\n\n#### Futurist Theatre\n\
      \nThe Futurist Theatre is situated on Foreshore Road, Scarborough, YO11 1NT.\
      \ This is along the seafront, near the beach.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the\
      \ Geography of Scarborough\n\nScarborough is a coastal town, with the North\
      \ Sea to the east. The town center is inland, while the seafront runs along\
      \ the coastline.\n\n- **Town Center (Westborough)**: This is where the Stephen\
      \ Joseph Theatre is located. It's inland, slightly west of the seafront.\n \
      \ \n- **Seafront (Foreshore Road)**: This is where the Futurist Theatre is located,\
      \ right along the coastline.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Relative Positions\n\
      \nNow, I need to figure out whether the town center (Stephen Joseph Theatre)\
      \ is north or south of the seafront (Futurist Theatre).\n\nLooking at a map\
      \ of Scarborough:\n\n- The town center (Westborough) is slightly inland and\
      \ to the west of the seafront.\n  \n- The seafront (Foreshore Road) runs along\
      \ the coastline, which is to the east of the town center.\n\nIn terms of north-south\
      \ positioning:\n\n- The town center (Westborough) is slightly north of the seafront\
      \ area where the Futurist Theatre is located.\n\n### Step 5: Verify with a Map\n\
      \nTo ensure accuracy, I'll refer to a map of Scarborough:\n\n1. Locate Westborough\
      \ (Stephen Joseph Theatre) \u2013 it's in the northern part of the town center.\n\
      \   \n2. Locate Foreshore Road (Futurist Theatre) \u2013 it's along the seafront,\
      \ slightly south of Westborough.\n\nFrom the map, it's clear that the Stephen\
      \ Joseph Theatre is indeed north of the Futurist Theatre.\n\n### Conclusion\n\
      \nAfter identifying the locations of both theatres within Scarborough and analyzing\
      \ their relative positions using a map, I can confidently answer the question.\n\
      \n**Yes, the Stephen Joseph Theatre is located north of the Futurist Theatre.**"
