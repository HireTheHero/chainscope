      1. Let me locate both structures:

      - Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station is in Bavaria, Germany

      - General Walker Hotel was in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Germany


      2. Looking at their specific locations:

      - Walchensee Power Station is near Kochel am See

      - Berchtesgaden is in the far southeastern corner of Germany


      3. Comparing their positions:

      - Walchensee is roughly in central Bavaria

      - Berchtesgaden is further south, near the Austrian border

      1. St. Peter''s Roman Catholic Church is located on West Street in Drogheda.


      2. Saint Laurence Gate is a barbican (fortified gateway) located on the eastern
      side of Drogheda.


      3. Looking at the layout of Drogheda:

      - West Street runs east-west through the center of the town

      - Saint Laurence Gate is east of the town center

      - St. Peter''s Church is in the central part of West Street


      4. Since St. Peter''s Church is in the central area and Saint Laurence Gate
      is on the eastern side, they are roughly on the same east-west line, with St.
      Peter''s being west of the gate.


      5. In terms of north-south positioning, they are approximately on the same latitude.


      Answer: NO (St. Peter''s Church is not north of Saint Laurence Gate - they are
      roughly on the same north-south line)'

      - 43rd Street is south of 49th Street


      3. Since the Lyric Theatre is on 43rd Street and Tower 49 is on 49th Street,
      and lower numbered streets are south of higher numbered streets...


      NO - The Lyric Theatre is located south of Tower 49, not north of it.'
