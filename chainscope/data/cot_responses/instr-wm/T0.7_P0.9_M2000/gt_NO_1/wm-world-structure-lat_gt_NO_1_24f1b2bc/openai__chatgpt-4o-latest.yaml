      metropolitan area of Melbourne, whereas the Thomson Dam is further east in a
      more remote area. Since Melbourne (and therefore the Monash Freeway) is to the
      west and slightly south of the Thomson Dam, the freeway is positioned to the
      **southwest** of the dam.


      4. **Determine if Monash Freeway is north of Thomson Dam**: Given that the freeway
      is to the southwest and not directly north of the dam, the answer must be **NO**.


      **Final Answer: NO.**'

      Freeway is a major freeway in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It runs from Melbourne''s
      central business district to the southeastern suburbs.


      2. **Locate Thomson Dam**: The Thomson Dam is in Victoria, Australia, and is
      the largest water supply dam for Melbourne. It is located in the eastern part
      of the state.


      3. **Determine relative positions**: The Thomson Dam is situated to the east
      of Melbourne, in a more remote area, whereas the Monash Freeway runs through
      the metropolitan area and extends southeast.


      4. **Compare north-south positioning**: The Thomson Dam is located in a more
