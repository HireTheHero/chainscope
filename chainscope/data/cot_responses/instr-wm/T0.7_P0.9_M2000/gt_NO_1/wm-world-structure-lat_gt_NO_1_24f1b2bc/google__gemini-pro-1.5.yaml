      2. **Determine the location of the rocket launch site:**  Indonesia''s primary
      rocket launch site is the LAPAN Rocket Launch Site, located on Pameungpeuk Island,
      Garut Regency, West Java.


      3. **Compare the latitudes:** Sidoarjo (Gelora Delta Stadium) is located in
      East Java. Garut Regency (LAPAN Rocket Launch Site) is located in West Java.
      West Java is generally west of East Java, but more importantly, a quick check
      reveals Garut is *south* of Sidoarjo.


      4. **Conclude:** Since the rocket launch site is south of the stadium, it is
      not north of it.

      requires an internet search or access to a map of Burlington, Vermont.


      2. **Determine the latitude/longitude or street addresses of each.** This will
      allow for a direct comparison.


      3. **Compare the latitudes of the two locations.**  A higher latitude indicates
      a location further north.


      (After performing the search)


      Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is located at 20 Pine Street.

      Cathedral Church of St. Paul is located at 2 Cherry Street.


      While street addresses aren''t perfect for determining North/South, a quick
      map check shows Pine Street is North of Cherry Street.

      Futurist Theatre *used* to stand on the seafront.  However, the Futurist Theatre
      was demolished in 2017.


      Therefore, although geographically the Stephen Joseph Theatre was situated north-west
      of the Futurist Theatre, the question uses present tense. As the Futurist no
      longer exists, the question is unanswerable in its current form.


      So, I cannot answer YES or NO.

      England (demolished in 2017).

      3. **Determine relative positions:**  The Stephen Joseph Theatre is near the
