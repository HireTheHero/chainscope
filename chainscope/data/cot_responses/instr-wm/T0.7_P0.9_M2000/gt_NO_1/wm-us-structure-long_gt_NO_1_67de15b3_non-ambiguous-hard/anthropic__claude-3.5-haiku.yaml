      - Gibson Generating Station is west of Sutton Lake

      - Indiana is west of West Virginia


      Therefore, Gibson Generating Station is NOT east of Sutton Lake.


      The answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Fontana Lake, NC:

      - Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina, in the Great Smoky Mountains region

      - It is located in a western part of North Carolina


      2. Next, I''ll locate Genetti Hotel, PA:

      - Genetti Hotel is located in Williamsport, Pennsylvania

      - Williamsport is in north-central Pennsylvania


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Fontana Lake is in western North Carolina

      - Genetti Hotel is in north-central Pennsylvania

      - These locations are in different states and different regions of the eastern
      United States


      4. Determining east/west relationship:

      - Western North Carolina is west of Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, Fontana Lake is west of the Genetti Hotel, not east


      5. Final reasoning:

      - Since Fontana Lake is west of Genetti Hotel, the answer to "Is Fontana Lake,
      NC located east of Genetti Hotel, PA?" is NO.
