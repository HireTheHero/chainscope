      1. **Location of Otero County, NM**: Otero County is located in the southern
      part of New Mexico. It is bordered by the state of Texas to the east and is
      relatively far from the northern border of New Mexico.

      2. **Locate Brown County, Wisconsin**: Brown County is located in the northeastern
      part of Wisconsin, near the shores of Lake Michigan. It is in the northern part
      of the state.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Since Leake County is in Mississippi and Brown
      County is in Wisconsin, we need to compare their latitudes to determine which
      is farther north. Generally, states in the northern part of the U.S. (like Wisconsin)
      are at higher latitudes compared to those in the southern part (like Mississippi).


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Brown County, Wisconsin is at a higher latitude
      than Leake County, Mississippi, it follows that Leake County is south of Brown
      County.
