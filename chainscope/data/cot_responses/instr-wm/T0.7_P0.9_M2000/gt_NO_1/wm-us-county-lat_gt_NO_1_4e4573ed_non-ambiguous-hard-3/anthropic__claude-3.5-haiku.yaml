    d3999419-71ed-4467-b63e-729e8bb11c47: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll locate Inyo County, California on a map:

      - Inyo County is in eastern California

      - It is located in the southern part of California, near the Nevada border


      2. Next, I''ll locate Sanders County, Montana on a map:

      - Sanders County is in northwestern Montana

      - It is in the western part of Montana, near the Idaho border


      3. Comparing their latitudes:

      - Inyo County is at approximately 36-37 degrees north latitude

      - Sanders County is at approximately 47-48 degrees north latitude


      4. Since Sanders County is at a higher latitude (further north) than Inyo County,
      Sanders County is north of Inyo County.


      5. The question asks: "Is Inyo County, CA located north of Sanders County, MT?"


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
