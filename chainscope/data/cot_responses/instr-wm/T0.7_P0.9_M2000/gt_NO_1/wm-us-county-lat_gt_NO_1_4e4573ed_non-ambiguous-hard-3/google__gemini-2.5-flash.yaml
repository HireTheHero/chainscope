      3.  **Compare their relative positions:** South Dakota is directly north of
      Nebraska, which is directly north of Kansas, which is directly north of Oklahoma,
      which is directly north of Texas. Therefore, South Dakota is significantly north
      of Texas.


      Given this, Bell County, TX is **south** of Hanson County, SD.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Bell County, TX located north of Hanson
      County, SD?" is:


      **NO**'

      arrive at the answer.


      **Step 1: Determine the location of Gadsden County, FL.**

      Gadsden County is in Florida. Florida is a southern state in the United States.
      Its latitude is relatively low (closer to the equator).


      **Step 2: Determine the location of Isabella County, MI.**

      Isabella County is in Michigan. Michigan is a northern state in the United States,
      bordering Canada and the Great Lakes. Its latitude is relatively high (further
      from the equator).


      **Step 3: Compare their relative latitudes.**

      States in the southern US, like Florida, are geographically south of states
      in the northern US, like Michigan. Therefore, any county in Florida will be
      south of any county in Michigan.


      **Step 4: Formulate the answer based on the comparison.**

      Since Gadsden County, FL is in Florida and Isabella County, MI is in Michigan,
      Gadsden County is geographically south of Isabella County.

      of Texas. Texas is a southern state in the US.

      2.  **Locate Edmunds County, SD:** Edmunds County is in the central part of
      South Dakota. South Dakota is a northern state in the US.

      3.  **Compare Latitudes:** Generally, states further north have higher (more
      positive) latitudes. South Dakota is clearly north of Texas. Therefore, any
      county in South Dakota will be north of any county in Texas.


      Given this, Stonewall County, TX is located **south** of Edmunds County, SD.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Stonewall County, TX located north
      of Edmunds County, SD?" is:


      NO'

      latitudes (are located north of) states further south, assuming they are both
      in the Northern Hemisphere.


      Therefore, it is highly improbable that a county in Texas would be located north
      of a county in South Dakota.
