      of both movies:


      - *Afsar*, directed by Chetan Anand, was released in **1950**.

      - *Mark of the Gorilla*, directed by William Berke, was released in **1950**.


      Since both movies were released in the same year, we need to check the exact
      release dates if available:


      - *Afsar* was released on **June 30, 1950**.

      - *Mark of the Gorilla* was released on **February 17, 1950**.


      Since February comes before June, *Mark of the Gorilla* was released earlier
      than *Afsar*.


      Thus, the answer to the question **"Was Chetan Anand''s Afsar released later
      than William Berke''s Mark of the Gorilla?"** is:


      **YES.**'
