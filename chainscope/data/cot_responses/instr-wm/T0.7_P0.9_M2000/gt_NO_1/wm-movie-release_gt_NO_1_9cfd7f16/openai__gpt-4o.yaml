      2. **Chuck Jones''s "Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5"**: This collection
      was released on October 30, 2007.


      Now, comparing the two dates:


      - "Speed" was released in 2007 (but we need the exact date to compare accurately).

      - "Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5" was released on October 30, 2007.


      Assuming "Speed" was released before October 30, 2007, the answer would be "NO,"
      but if it was released after that date, the answer would be "YES."

      - Vikram Bhatt''s "Speed" was released on October 19, 2007.

      by Claude Zidi, and it was released in 1978.


      2. **Release Date of "Germany in Autumn":** "Germany in Autumn" is a collaborative
      German film directed by multiple filmmakers, including Alexander Kluge, and
      it was released in 1978.


      Both films were released in the same year, 1978. Without specific release months
      and days, we cannot definitively conclude whether one was released later than
      the other. However, if we consider the question strictly based on the information
