      2. Let me find when Hour of Decision was released:

      - Hour of Decision was directed by C. M. Pennington-Richards

      - It was released in 1957


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Both films were released in the same year (1957)

      - Since they were released in the same year, I cannot definitively say one was
      released later than the other without knowing the exact release dates

      - Without more specific date information, I cannot determine if one was released
      later than the other


      NO (because there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Piker''s Peak was
      released later than Hour of Decision)'
