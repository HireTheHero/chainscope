      1. **Yury of Smolensk**: Yury of Smolensk, also known as Yury Svyatoslavich,
      was a Russian noble who lived during the late 14th and early 15th centuries.

      1. **Otto III von Rietberg**: Otto III von Rietberg was a historical figure
      from the Rietberg family, a noble family in Germany. He lived during the late
      15th and early 16th centuries, specifically from 1475 to 1535. This gives him
      a lifespan of 60 years.

      century. He was born around 910 and died in 909. This gives him a lifespan of
      approximately 99 years.

      - Otto III von Rietberg lived for 60 years.

      - Adalbero von Augsburg lived for approximately 99 years.

      \ lived longer than Abbad ibn Bishr, we need to look at the life spans of each\
      \ individual.\n\n1. **Gao Huan (\u9AD8\u6E19):** Gao Huan was a prominent military\
      \ leader during the Northern Wei dynasty in China. He was born in 496 AD and\
      \ died in 547 AD.\n\n2. **Abbad ibn Bishr:** Abbad ibn Bishr was a companion\
      \ of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He died in the Battle of Yamama in 632 AD.\
      \ His birth date is not precisely recorded, but it is generally estimated that\
      \ he was born around 597 AD.\n\nNow, let's calculate the approximate life spans:\n\
      \n- **Gao Huan's life span:** 547 AD - 496 AD = 51 years.\n- **Abbad ibn Bishr's\
      \ approximate life span:** 632 AD - 597 AD = 35 years.\n\nBased on this information,\
      \ Gao Huan lived longer than Abbad ibn Bishr.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **YES**."
