      throughout Chinese history. The prompt specifies "Northern Dynasties," which
      helps narrow it down.  A prominent Gao Bin from this period served the Northern
      Wei Dynasty (386-534 AD).  Pinpointing his exact birth and death years can be

    d102865b-38eb-43ac-9e20-849500e80503: '1. **Find the lifespan of Grimoald III
      of Benevento:** Grimoald III reigned from 788 to 806 AD.  This means he lived
      at least those years, although he may have been born earlier and died later.


      2. **Find the lifespan of John IV, Count of Oldenburg:** John IV lived from
      approximately 1403 to 1423.


      3. **Compare the lifespans:** Grimoald III lived in the 8th and potentially
      early 9th century. John IV lived in the 15th century. Therefore, John IV lived
      significantly later than Grimoald III.


      4. **Determine who lived longer:**  Since they lived in such different time
      periods, the length of their individual reigns is irrelevant to the question
      of who *lived longer*. Grimoald III could not have lived longer than someone
      born centuries after he died.


      NO.

      '
    d60de7ba-a973-42de-89d0-cd746f69c26d: '1. **Find lifespan of Grimoald III of Benevento:**
      Grimoald III ruled from 788 to 806 (some sources say 817).  This means he lived
      at least 18 years, possibly longer.  We need to determine his birth year to
      be precise.  He was likely born shortly before 788, since he became Prince on
      the death of his father.


      2. **Find lifespan of John IV, Count of Oldenburg:**  John IV ruled from 1440
      to 1482/1483. This gives a reign of around 42/43 years. Again, we need a birth
      year.  Since he ruled for so long, it is likely he was an adult when he became
      Count.


      3. **Compare lifespans:** Even if Grimoald lived until 817, that''s still over
      600 years before John IV''s reign. Therefore, Grimoald III definitely lived
      *earlier* in time than John IV.  However, the question is about lifespan *length*.  We
      don''t have enough information to determine their exact birth or death dates.
      While John IV ruled longer, he might have been older when he became Count.


      4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively say who lived *longer*. We only know
      who lived *earlier*.


      NO
