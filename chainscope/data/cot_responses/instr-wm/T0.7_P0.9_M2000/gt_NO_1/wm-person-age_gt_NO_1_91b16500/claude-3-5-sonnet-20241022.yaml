      - He died at age 38


      3. Now I can compare:

      - William II de Cantilupe''s exact birth date is not well documented, but he
      was an adult during the early-mid 13th century

      - Even if he was relatively young when he died in 1251 (say in his 30s or 40s),
      he likely lived longer than Gren''s 38 years


      4. Conclusion:

      Based on available historical records, William II de Cantilupe most likely lived
      longer than Friedrich Gren who died at just 38 years old.

      3. Reasoning:

      - While we don''t have Grimoald III''s exact birth date, we know he died in

      - He ruled for 18 years (788-806)

      - She lived from 1253 to 1320

      - This means she lived for 67 years


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Princess Yangguo: 31 years

      - Blanche de France: 67 years

      - 67 years is longer than 31 years


      NO (Princess Yangguo did not live longer than Blanche de France)'

      1. Let me recall the lifespans of both figures:

      - Princess Yangguo lived 1695-1729

      - Blanche de France lived 1253-1320


      2. Calculate their ages:

      - Princess Yangguo: 1729 - 1695 = 34 years

      - Blanche de France: 1320 - 1253 = 67 years


      3. Compare:

      - Blanche de France lived significantly longer than Princess Yangguo


      NO (Princess Yangguo did not live longer than Blanche de France)'

      1. First, I need to find when William III de Cantilupe lived:

      - William III de Cantilupe died in 1254

      - His birth date appears to be around 1216


      2. Next, I need to find when Antonio Arcioni lived:

      - Antonio Arcioni died in 1405

      - His birth date appears to be around 1350


      3. Now I can calculate their approximate lifespans:

      - William III de Cantilupe: 1216 to 1254 = approximately 38 years

      - Antonio Arcioni: 1350 to 1405 = approximately 55 years


      4. Comparing the lifespans:

      - Arcioni lived about 55 years

      - Cantilupe lived about 38 years

      - 55 is greater than 38


      NO (William III de Cantilupe did not live longer than Antonio Arcioni)'
