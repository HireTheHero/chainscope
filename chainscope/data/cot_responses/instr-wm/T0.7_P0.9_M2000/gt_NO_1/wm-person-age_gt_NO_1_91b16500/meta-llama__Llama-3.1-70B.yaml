      \u5100 (Gao Miaoyi) was a concubine of the Chinese Emperor Gaozong of Tang during\
      \ the Tang dynasty in China.\n\n2. **Identify Abd ar-Rahman IV**: Next, we identify\
      \ Abd ar-Rahman IV. Abd ar-Rahman IV was the Umayyad emir of C\xF3rdoba in al-Andalus\
      \ (present-day Spain) in the 10th century.\n\n3. **Find Birth and Death Years**:\n\
      \   - **\u9AD8\u5999\u5100 (Gao Miaoyi)**: The historical records for Gao Miaoyi\
      \ are not as detailed as those for more prominent figures, but it's known she\
      \ lived during the Tang dynasty, which spanned from 618 to 907 AD. Assuming\
      \ she was a concubine of Emperor Gaozong, who reigned from 649 to 683 AD, we\
      \ can estimate her lifespan to be within this period. Let's approximate her\
      \ birth to be around 640 AD and her death to be sometime in the late 7th century,\
      \ though exact dates are not readily available.\n   - **Abd ar-Rahman IV**:\
      \ Abd ar-Rahman IV was born in 976 AD and died in 1018 AD.\n\n4. **Compare Lifespans**:\n\
      \   - Given the estimated lifespan of \u9AD8\u5999\u5100 (let's say 640 AD -\
      \ 700 AD for simplicity, though these dates are speculative) and the known lifespan\
      \ of Abd ar-Rahman IV (976-1018 AD), we can see that Abd ar-Rahman IV lived\
      \ for approximately 42 years.\n   - The estimated lifespan of \u9AD8\u5999\u5100\
      \ would span roughly 60 years, assuming she died in 700 AD. However, without\
      \ precise birth and death dates, this is a rough estimation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Given the estimated lifespan of \u9AD8\u5999\u5100 and the known lifespan\
      \ of Abd ar-Rahman IV, if we rely on the rough estimates provided, it appears\
      \ that \u9AD8\u5999\u5100 (Gao Miaoyi) lived longer than Abd ar-Rahman IV. However,\
      \ the question's answer hinges on the accuracy of the lifespan estimates for\
      \ Gao Miaoyi, which are not provided with certainty.\n\nGiven the information\
      \ and the steps of reasoning, and considering that the lifespan of \u9AD8\u5999\
      \u5100 is estimated and not precisely known, making an accurate comparison is\
      \ challenging. However, based on the rough estimates and known historical context,\
      \ the answer leans towards \"YES\" because Gao Miaoyi's estimated lifespan exceeds\
      \ that of Abd ar-Rahman IV. But please note, this answer comes with the caveat\
      \ that Gao Miaoyi's exact lifespan is not known, which introduces uncertainty.\n\

      \ Oi) is. \u65E5\u4E0B\u90E8\u8001 was a Japanese historical figure who lived\
      \ during the Asuka period (538-710 AD) and was known for his role in the Yamato\
      \ court.\n\n2. **Identify Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi**: Next, we identify Abd al-Rahman\
      \ al-Sufi. Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi was a Persian astronomer who lived during the\
      \ 10th century AD and is known for his contributions to astronomy.\n\n3. **Find\
      \ Birth and Death Years**:\n   - **\u65E5\u4E0B\u90E8\u8001 (Kusakabe no Oi)**:\
      \ The historical records for Kusakabe no Oi are not as detailed as those for\
      \ more prominent figures, but it's known he lived during the Asuka period. Assuming\
      \ he was active around the late 6th century AD and considering the average lifespan\
      \ and the historical context, if we approximate his lifespan to be similar to\
      \ that of average historical figures of his time, we might guess his birth to\
      \ be around 550 AD and his death perhaps in the late 6th or early 7th century\
      \ AD, though exact dates are not readily available.\n   - **Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi**:\
      \ Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi was born in 903 AD and died in 986 AD.\n\n4. **Compare\
      \ Lifespans**:\n   - Given the approximate lifespan of \u65E5\u4E0B\u90E8\u8001\
      \ (let's say 550 AD - 620 AD for simplicity, though these dates are speculative)\
      \ and the known lifespan of Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (903-986 AD), we can see that\
      \ al-Sufi lived for approximately 83 years.\n   - The speculative lifespan of\
      \ \u65E5\u4E0B\u90E8\u8001 would span roughly 70 years, assuming he died in\
      \ 620 AD. However, without precise birth and death dates for Kusakabe no Oi,\
      \ this is a rough estimation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the speculative nature\

      who lived in the Middle Ages, and Bartolomeo Raimondi was an Italian Renaissance
      sculptor.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: The next step is to determine the lifespans
      of these two individuals. Wilhelm von Saillon lived in the 14th century, and
      Bartolomeo Raimondi lived in the 15th and 16th centuries. Wilhelm von Saillon''s
      exact birth and death dates are not widely documented, but it''s known that
      he lived during the 14th century. Bartolomeo Raimondi is known to have lived
      from 1455 to 1515.


      3. **Compare their lifespans**: Given the estimated lifespans, we can compare
      them. Wilhelm von Saillon''s lifespan is estimated to be within the 14th century,
      while Bartolomeo Raimondi''s lifespan is from 1455 to 1515. This means that
      Bartolomeo Raimondi lived for approximately 60 years, while Wilhelm von Saillon''s
      lifespan is not precisely known.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information, it seems plausible that
      Bartolomeo Raimondi lived longer than Wilhelm von Saillon, especially since
      Wilhelm von Saillon''s lifespan is not precisely known, and the estimated range
      for his lifespan falls within the 14th century, which is earlier than Bartolomeo
      Raimondi''s lifespan.


      Given these considerations, the answer to whether Wilhelm von Saillon lived
      longer than Bartolomeo Raimondi is likely $\boxed{NO}$.

      1. **Identify the figures**: First, I need to know who Yury of Smolensk and
      Elizabeth le Despenser are. Yury of Smolensk was a medieval Russian prince who
      lived in the 14th century. Elizabeth le Despenser was an English noblewoman
      who lived in the 14th and 15th centuries.


      2. **Determine the time periods**: Next, I should determine the time periods
      in which they lived. Yury of Smolensk is known to have lived in the 14th century,
      and Elizabeth le Despenser lived in the 14th and 15th centuries.


      3. **Find the lifespans**: To compare their lifespans, I need their birth and
      death years. Yury of Smolensk is believed to have lived around the 14th century,
      but specific dates are not widely documented. Elizabeth le Despenser is known
      to have lived from 1322 to 1389.


      4. **Compare the lifespans**: Assuming I had the lifespans, the next step would
      be to compare them directly. However, without the specific dates for Yury of
      Smolensk, this step cannot be accurately completed.


      Given the lack of specific information on Yury of Smolensk, including his birth
      and death years, it''s not possible to compare his lifespan directly with Elizabeth
      le Despenser''s based on the information provided. Therefore, I must rely on
      the assumption that without explicit details on Yury of Smolensk, a direct comparison
      cannot be made.


      However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and I cannot verify the
      lifespan of Yury of Smolensk, I will proceed under the assumption that the question
      implies a need for a definitive answer based on available historical data, which
      in this case, seems to be incomplete or not readily available for Yury of Smolensk.


      Given the constraints and the format required for the answer, and acknowledging
      the lack of specific information to make a direct comparison:

      3. **Find the lifespans**: To compare their lifespans, we need their birth and
      death years. Yury of Smolensk was born around 1289 and died in 1310, giving
      him a lifespan of approximately 21 years. Elizabeth le Despenser was born around
      1322 and died in 1389, giving her a lifespan of approximately 67 years.


      4. **Compare the lifespans**: Given their lifespans, it''s evident that Elizabeth
      le Despenser lived significantly longer than Yury of Smolensk. Yury of Smolensk''s
      lifespan of 21 years is considerably shorter compared to Elizabeth le Despenser''s
      lifespan of 67 years.


      Based on the lifespans of Yury of Smolensk and Elizabeth le Despenser, we can
      confidently say that Elizabeth le Despenser lived longer than Yury of Smolensk.

      of Smolensk and Elizabeth le Despenser are. Yury of Smolensk was a medieval
      ruler of the Principality of Smolensk, a region in what is now Russia. Elizabeth
      le Despenser, also known as Elizabeth de Burghersh, was an English noblewoman
      who lived during the 14th century.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: The next step is to determine the lifespans
      of these two individuals. Yury of Smolensk is believed to have lived from around

      precisely known but is believed to have been during the 14th century. Given
      the uncertainty around Elizabeth le Despenser''s exact lifespan and the known
      lifespan of Yury of Smolensk, it''s reasonable to conclude that Yury of Smolensk

      of Smolensk, it''s challenging to provide a definitive answer.


      Given the information and the steps of reasoning, and considering that Yury

      historical figure, possibly associated with the Montfort family in medieval
      Europe. Nicholas III of Saint Omer, on the other hand, is a more well-known
      figure associated with the Saint Omer family and the Crusades.


      2. **Find Birth and Death Years**: The next step is to determine the birth and

      context, it''s plausible that Nicholas III of Saint Omer might have lived longer
      than Rupen of Montfort. However, without specific details on Rupen of Montfort''s
      lifespan, this is a speculative conclusion.

    9cc126de-66d9-4205-bdb6-c1984d3f17ff: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the historical figures**: First, we need to identify who Rupen
      of Montfort and Nicholas III of Saint Omer are. Rupen of Montfort is a historical
      figure from the Crusades period, while Nicholas III of Saint Omer is a medieval
      nobleman from the Principality of Achaea.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: The next step is to determine the lifespans
      of these two individuals. Rupen of Montfort is believed to have lived around
      the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Specific details about his birth and
      death dates are not widely documented, but given the context, we can estimate
      his lifespan to be roughly within this period. Nicholas III of Saint Omer, on
      the other hand, is known to have lived in the 13th century, but without more
      specific records, it''s challenging to pinpoint his exact lifespan.


      3. **Compare their lifespans**: Given the estimated lifespans, we can compare
      them. Since Rupen of Montfort''s exact dates are not well-documented and assuming
      he was active around the Crusades, if we consider that he might have been born
      around the mid-12th century and potentially lived into the early 13th century,
      his lifespan could overlap with or be slightly before that of Nicholas III of
      Saint Omer.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information and considering the potential
      overlap or the fact that Rupen of Montfort might have lived entirely within
      the 12th and early 13th centuries, while Nicholas III of Saint Omer is known
      to have lived in the 13th century, it seems plausible that Nicholas III of Saint
      Omer could have lived longer than Rupen of Montfort, especially if Rupen of
      Montfort died before Nicholas III of Saint Omer''s birth.


      Given these considerations, the answer to whether Rupen of Montfort lived longer
      than Nicholas III of Saint Omer is likely **NO**'
    d1f97c6e-ba34-4c8d-b32e-1a86807ae142: 'To answer this question, let''s follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the figures**: First, we need to know who Rupen of Montfort and
      Nicholas III of Saint Omer are. Rupen of Montfort is a historical figure from
      the Crusader states in the Middle East during the 12th century, specifically
      in the Principality of Antioch. Nicholas III of Saint Omer is a figure from
      the same time period and region, also associated with the Crusader states.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: The next step is to find out when each of
      them lived. Rupen of Montfort is believed to have lived around the late 12th
      century, though specific birth and death years are not widely documented. Nicholas
      III of Saint Omer is also known to have lived around the late 12th century,
      with his death occurring in 1217.


      3. **Compare their lifespans**: Given the available information, it''s challenging
      to provide a precise comparison. Rupen of Montfort''s lifespan is not well-documented,
      and we don''t have specific birth and death years for him. However, Nicholas
      III of Saint Omer''s death year is known to be 1217, which provides a reference
      point.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Rupen of Montfort''s lifespan is not well-documented,
      and we don''t have specific birth and death years for him, it''s challenging
      to provide a definitive answer to whether he lived longer than Nicholas III
      of Saint Omer. However, given the context of the Crusader states in the late
      12th century and the lack of specific information on Rupen of Montfort''s lifespan,
      it''s plausible that he might have lived a similar lifespan to Nicholas III
      of Saint Omer.


      Based on the information provided and considering the lack of specific data
      on Rupen of Montfort''s lifespan, it''s not possible to definitively answer
      whether he lived longer than Nicholas III of Saint Omer. However, based on the
      context and the absence of specific information, it''s plausible that their
      lifespans could have been similar, given their involvement in the Crusader states
      during the same time period.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Rupen of Montfort lived longer than Nicholas
      III of Saint Omer is likely **NO**'

      a few steps:


      1. **Identify the figures**: First, we need to identify who Rupen of Montfort
      and Nicholas III of Saint Omer are. Rupen of Montfort was a French nobleman
      who lived in the 13th century. Nicholas III of Saint Omer was a Lord of Thebes
      in Greece during the same period.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: To compare their lifespans, we need to find
      their birth and death years. Rupen of Montfort lived from around 1200 to 1249,
      while Nicholas III of Saint Omer''s birth and death years are not as well-documented,
      but it''s believed he lived during the 13th century.


      3. **Compare their lifespans**: With the birth and death years, we can now compare
      their lifespans. Rupen of Montfort lived for approximately 49 years, from around
      1200 to 1249. Nicholas III of Saint Omer''s exact lifespan is not known, but
      it''s reasonable to assume that he lived during the 13th century, which means
      his lifespan could have overlapped with Rupen''s or even exceeded it.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information available, it''s difficult to determine
      definitively whether Rupen of Montfort lived longer than Nicholas III of Saint
      Omer. While Rupen''s lifespan is well-documented, Nicholas III''s is not, and
      there''s a possibility that he lived longer.


      Given the lack of specific information about Nicholas III of Saint Omer''s lifespan,
      the answer is likely "NO" based on the assumption that Rupen of Montfort lived
      for approximately 49 years, while Nicholas III''s lifespan is not precisely
      known but could have overlapped or exceeded Rupen''s.


      However, please note that this answer comes with the caveat that without more
      specific details on Nicholas III''s lifespan, the comparison is not definitive.

      \ China, known for his role in the events leading up to the Three Kingdoms period.\n\
      \n2. **Identify Aarne Valkama**: Next, we identify Aarne Valkama. Aarne Valkama\
      \ was a Finnish wrestler who competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n3. **Find\
      \ Birth and Death Years**:\n   - **\u99AC\u67A2 (Ma Chuo)**: The historical\
      \ records for Ma Chuo are not as detailed as those for more prominent figures,\
      \ but it's known he lived during the late 2nd and early 3rd century AD. Assuming\
      \ he was active around the 190s AD and considering the average lifespan and\
      \ the tumultuous period he lived in, if we approximate his lifespan to be similar\
      \ to that of average historical figures of his time, we might guess his birth\
      \ to be around 160 AD and his death perhaps in the early 200s AD, though exact\
      \ dates are not readily available.\n   - **Aarne Valkama**: Aarne Valkama was\

      \ (1905-1969), we can see that Valkama lived for approximately 64 years.\n \
      \  - The speculative lifespan of \u99AC\u67A2 would span roughly 50 years, assuming\
      \ he died in 210 AD. However, without precise birth and death dates for Ma Chuo,\
      \ this is a rough estimation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the speculative nature\
      \ of Ma Chuo's dates and the known dates for Aarne Valkama, if we rely on the\
      \ rough estimates provided, Aarne Valkama lived longer than the speculated maximum\
      \ lifespan of \u99AC\u67A2. However, the question's answer hinges on the accuracy\

      \nGiven the information and the steps of reasoning, and considering that the\
      \ lifespan of Ma Chuo is speculative and not precisely known, making an accurate\
      \ comparison is challenging. However, based on the rough estimates and known\

      1166 to 1199. Empress Zhang was a Chinese empress during the Eastern Han dynasty,
      known for her influence on political affairs.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: The next step is to determine the lifespans
      of these two individuals. Patriarch Michael II of Antioch is known to have lived
      from around 1166 to 1199, a period of approximately 33 years. Empress Zhang,

      12 years.


      3. **Compare their lifespans**: Given the known lifespans, we can now compare
      them. Patriarch Michael II of Antioch lived for approximately 33 years, while
      Empress Zhang lived for about 12 years.

      hand, is likely Empress Zhang (Wang Zhaojun) from Chinese history, who lived
      around the 1st century BC.


      2. **Determine the time periods**: Next, we need to determine the time periods
      in which they lived. Patriarch Michael II of Antioch is known to have lived
      in the 12th century, while Empress Zhang lived around the 1st century BC.

      birth and death years. Unfortunately, specific birth and death years for both
      figures are not readily available in the information provided.


      4. **Compare the lifespans**: Without specific birth and death years, it''s
      challenging to compare their lifespans accurately. However, we can make some
      general observations based on the time periods they lived in. Empress Zhang
      lived in the 1st century BC, which is significantly earlier than the 12th century
      when Patriarch Michael II of Antioch lived. This suggests that Empress Zhang
      might have lived longer than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch.


      Given the lack of specific birth and death years for both historical figures
      and considering the time periods in which they lived, it''s difficult to provide
      a definitive YES or NO answer. However, based on the general observation that
      Empress Zhang lived in an earlier time period, it''s reasonable to assume that
      she might have lived longer than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch.

      4. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific information about Dymitr Aba''s
      lifespan, we cannot accurately compare his lifespan with that of John II, Count
      of Ziegenhain. However, the question format requires a YES or NO answer, so
      I''ll provide a response based on the assumption that without specific details
      on Dymitr Aba, we cannot accurately compare their lifespans.


      Given the lack of information on Dymitr Aba and following the required format
      for a YES or NO answer without being able to accurately compare their lifespans,
      the response would have to be based on an inability to confirm the question''s
      premise accurately.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      \ we need to know who \u9A6C\u5168\u8282 (Ma Quanjie) is. Ma Quanjie is a Chinese\
      \ historical figure who lived during the Qing dynasty.\n\n2. **Identify A. L.\
      \ Abdul Majeed**: Next, we identify A. L. Abdul Majeed. A. L. Abdul Majeed is\
      \ a Sri Lankan politician and former Minister of Ports and Shipping.\n\n3. **Find\
      \ Birth and Death Years**:\n   - **\u9A6C\u5168\u8282 (Ma Quanjie)**: The historical\
      \ records for Ma Quanjie are not as detailed as those for more prominent figures,\
      \ but it's known he lived during the Qing dynasty, which spanned from 1644 to\
      \ 1912. Assuming he was active during the later part of the dynasty and considering\
      \ the average lifespan and the historical context, we might guess his lifespan\
      \ to be similar to that of average historical figures of his time, which could\
      \ range from the late 1700s to the early 1900s.\n   - **A. L. Abdul Majeed**:\
      \ A. L. Abdul Majeed was born in 1936 and died in 2012.\n\n4. **Compare Lifespans**:\n\
      \   - Given the potential lifespan of \u9A6C\u5168\u8282 (let's say 1770-1830\
      \ for simplicity, though these dates are speculative) and the known lifespan\
      \ of A. L. Abdul Majeed (1936-2012), we can see that Abdul Majeed lived for\
      \ approximately 76 years.\n   - The speculative lifespan of \u9A6C\u5168\u8282\
      \ would span roughly 60 years, assuming he died in 1830. However, without precise\
      \ birth and death dates for Ma Quanjie, this is a rough estimation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Given the speculative nature of Ma Quanjie's dates and the known dates for\
      \ A. L. Abdul Majeed, if we rely on the rough estimates provided, A. L. Abdul\
      \ Majeed lived longer than the speculated maximum lifespan of \u9A6C\u5168\u8282\

      \ is speculative and not precisely known, making an accurate comparison is challenging.\
      \ However, based on the rough estimates and known historical context, the answer\
      \ leans towards \"NO\" because Abdul Majeed's known lifespan exceeds the speculative\

      \ a few steps:\n\n1. **Identify the historical figures**: First, we need to\
      \ identify who \u9A6C\u5168\u8282 (Ma Quanjie) and A. L. Abdul Majeed are. \u9A6C\
      \u5168\u8282 is a historical figure from ancient China, while A. L. Abdul Majeed\
      \ is likely a modern figure, possibly from the political or cultural sphere.\n\
      \n2. **Determine their lifespans**: The next step is to determine the lifespans\

      \ **Aaron ben Gershon abu al-Rabi**: Aaron ben Gershon abu al-Rabi lived during\

      \ their birth and death years. Since we don't have specific dates for either\
      \ figure, we can't make a direct comparison.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information\
      \ on the birth and death years of both \u9148\u74CA (Li Qiong) and Aaron ben\
      \ Gershon abu al-Rabi, it's not possible to compare their lifespans accurately.\
      \ However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and I cannot verify\
      \ their lifespans, I must provide a speculative response based on the information\

      \ - 220 CE) and Aaron ben Gershon abu al-Rabi lived in the 13th century (1200s\
      \ CE), it's unlikely that Li Qiong lived longer than Aaron ben Gershon abu al-Rabi.\
      \ This is because the Han dynasty was significantly earlier than the 13th century,\
      \ and the average lifespan during those times was shorter compared to later\

      a few steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify the historical figures**: The first step is to identify who Otto
      III. von Rietberg and Adalbero von Augsburg are. Otto III. von Rietberg was
      a Count of Rietberg, a noble title in medieval Germany, and lived in the 13th
      century. Adalbero von Augsburg was a bishop of Augsburg in Germany during the
      11th century.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: The next step is to determine the lifespans
      of these two individuals. Otto III. von Rietberg is believed to have lived from
      approximately 1245 to 1295. Specific details about his birth and death dates
      are not widely documented, but given the context, we can estimate his lifespan
      to be roughly within the 13th century. Adalbero von Augsburg, on the other hand,

      3. **Compare their lifespans**: Given the estimated lifespans, we can compare
      them. Otto III. von Rietberg''s estimated lifespan of approximately 50 years
      (1245-1295) falls within the 13th century, while Adalbero von Augsburg''s lifespan

      von Rietberg, given the significant difference in their lifespans (approximately
      200 years).


      Given these considerations, the answer to whether Otto III. von Rietberg lived

      3. **Find the lifespans**: The lifespan of Otto III. von Rietberg is known to
      be from approximately 1247 to 1295, while the lifespan of Adalbero von Augsburg
      is not as well-documented. However, Adalbero von Augsburg is believed to have
      lived in the 10th century, which would place his lifespan in the range of the
      900s.


      4. **Compare the lifespans**: Based on the known lifespans, Otto III. von Rietberg
      lived for approximately 48 years, while Adalbero von Augsburg''s lifespan is
      not precisely known, but it is estimated to be in the 900s. Given the uncertainty
      in Adalbero von Augsburg''s lifespan, we cannot definitively say whether Otto
      III. von Rietberg lived longer than him.


      5. **Conclusion**: Due to the lack of specific information on Adalbero von Augsburg''s
      lifespan, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the question. However, based
      on the estimated lifespans, it appears that Otto III. von Rietberg might have
      lived longer than Adalbero von Augsburg, but without precise dates for Adalbero
      von Augsburg, we cannot say for certain.

    d6cbb0cc-2237-4130-9871-044494a22017: 'To answer this question, we need to establish
      the lifespans of both Theodora Komnene Angelina and Grimoald III of Benevento.


      1. **Identify Theodora Komnene Angelina''s lifespan**: Theodora Komnene Angelina
      was a Byzantine noblewoman who lived in the 12th century. Her lifespan is not
      precisely documented, but she was known to have lived during the reign of Emperor
      Manuel I Komnenos (1143-1180), suggesting she lived around the mid-12th century.


      2. **Identify Grimoald III of Benevento''s lifespan**: Grimoald III was a Lombard
      Duke of Benevento who lived in the 8th century. His reign is documented from
      788 to 806 AD, indicating a lifespan that includes at least those years.


      3. **Compare lifespans**: To determine if Theodora Komnene Angelina lived longer
      than Grimoald III of Benevento, we need to know their birth and death years.
      Since the birth and death years of Theodora Komnene Angelina are not precisely
      known, we can''t make a direct comparison. However, we can estimate her lifespan
      based on historical context.


      4. **Estimate Theodora Komnene Angelina''s lifespan**: Given that Theodora Komnene
      Angelina was active during the reign of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (1143-1180),
      we can assume she was likely born in the early 12th century (e.g., around 1110-1120
      AD) and lived into the mid-12th century. If we estimate her lifespan to be approximately
      50-60 years, it would span from roughly 1110-1120 AD to 1160-1170 AD.


      5. **Compare lifespans**: Grimoald III of Benevento lived from at least 788
      AD to 806 AD, giving him a minimum lifespan of 18 years. Theodora Komnene Angelina''s
      estimated lifespan (1110-1120 AD to 1160-1170 AD) would be significantly longer,
      spanning at least 50-60 years.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given the estimated lifespans, Theodora Komnene Angelina
      likely lived longer than Grimoald III of Benevento, assuming the estimated lifespan
      for Theodora Komnene Angelina is accurate. However, the answer hinges on the
      accuracy of the lifespan estimates, which are based on historical context and
      not precise birth and death dates for Theodora Komnene Angelina.


      Given the information and the steps of reasoning, and considering the estimated
      lifespan of Theodora Komnene Angelina, the answer leans towards "YES" because
      Theodora Komnene Angelina''s estimated lifespan is significantly longer than
      Grimoald III of Benevento''s known minimum lifespan. But please note, this answer
      comes with the caveat that Theodora Komnene Angelina''s exact lifespan is not
      precisely known, which introduces uncertainty.

      southern Italy during the late 8th and early 9th centuries.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: To compare their lifespans, we need to find
      their birth and death years. Theodora Komnene Angelina is believed to have lived
      around the late 12th century and into the early 13th century. Specific details
      about her birth and death dates are not widely documented, but given the context
      of her marriages and activities, we can estimate her lifespan to be roughly
      within the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Grimoald III of Benevento is
      known to have lived in the late 8th and early 9th centuries, with specific records
      indicating he died in 806 AD.


      3. **Compare their lifespans**: Given the estimated lifespans, we can compare
      them. Since Theodora Komnene Angelina''s exact dates are not well-documented
      and assuming she was active around the late 12th and early 13th centuries, her
      lifespan could overlap with or be entirely after the lifespan of Grimoald III

      of Benevento lived longer than Theodora Komnene Angelina, especially if Theodora
      Komnene Angelina was born after Grimoald III of Benevento''s death.

      3. **Compare the lifespans**: If we had the lifespans, the next step would be
      to compare them directly. However, without the specific dates for Friedrich
      Gren, this step cannot be accurately completed.


      Given the lack of specific information on Friedrich Gren, including his birth
      and death years, it''s not possible to compare his lifespan directly with William
      II de Cantilupe''s based on the information provided. Therefore, I must rely
      on the assumption that without explicit details on Friedrich Gren, a direct
      comparison cannot be made.


      However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and I cannot verify the
      lifespan of Friedrich Gren, I will proceed under the assumption that the question
      implies a need for a definitive answer based on available historical data, which
      in this case, seems to be incomplete or not readily available for Friedrich
      Gren.


      Given the constraints and the format required for the answer, and acknowledging
      the lack of specific information to make a direct comparison:

      historical figures with this name), it''s challenging to provide an accurate
      lifespan. However, for the sake of this exercise, let''s assume we''re referring

      \ \u9AD8\u4FDD\u5BE7 is a Chinese historical figure from the Tang dynasty. Abdallah\
      \ ibn Buluggin is a figure from the history of the Taifa of Granada in Andalusia,\
      \ Spain.\n\n2. **Determine the time periods**: Next, we determine the time periods\
      \ in which they lived. \u9AD8\u4FDD\u5BE7 lived during the Tang dynasty, which\
      \ spanned from 618 to 907 CE. Abdallah ibn Buluggin lived in the 11th century\
      \ CE, during the Taifa of Granada period.\n\n3. **Find the lifespans**: To compare\
      \ their lifespans, we need their birth and death years. Unfortunately, the specific\
      \ birth and death years for \u9AD8\u4FDD\u5BE7 (Gao Baoning) are not widely\
      \ documented, making it difficult to accurately determine his lifespan. However,\
      \ Abdallah ibn Buluggin is known to have lived from 1056 to 1095 CE.\n\n4. **Compare\
      \ the lifespans**: Given the lack of specific birth and death years for \u9AD8\
      \u4FDD\u5BE7, we can only make a general comparison. If we assume that \u9AD8\
      \u4FDD\u5BE7 lived during the Tang dynasty, which spanned from 618 to 907 CE,\
      \ and if we consider an average lifespan for that time period, it's possible\
      \ that \u9AD8\u4FDD\u5BE7 could have lived longer than Abdallah ibn Buluggin,\
      \ who lived from 1056 to 1095 CE. However, without specific dates, this is a\
      \ speculative comparison.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information on \u9AD8\
      \u4FDD\u5BE7's birth and death years, it's challenging to provide a definitive\
      \ answer. However, based on the available information and the assumption that\
      \ \u9AD8\u4FDD\u5BE7 lived during the Tang dynasty, it's possible that he could\
      \ have lived longer than Abdallah ibn Buluggin.\n\nThe final answer is: YES\n\

      \ **Find Birth and Death Years**:\n   - **\u67F4\u8AF4 (Chai Yin)**: Historical\
      \ records indicate that \u67F4\u8AF4 lived during the Tang dynasty, which spanned\
      \ from 618 to 907 AD. He served in various positions and was active during the\
      \ reigns of several emperors. His exact birth and death years are not widely\
      \ documented, but given the context of the Tang dynasty, we can estimate that\
      \ he was born in the mid- to late 8th century and died in the early to mid-9th\
      \ century.\n   - **Geldemar Carpenel**: Historical records suggest that Geldemar\
      \ Carpenel was active during the 12th century, specifically during the time\
      \ of the Crusader States in the Holy Land. He was involved in the political\
      \ and military affairs of the region. His exact birth and death years are not\

      death years. Werner Schaler was born in 1923 and passed away in 1997, giving
      him a lifespan of 74 years. Heinrich von Besmedin, on the other hand, is a historical
      figure whose exact lifespan is not as widely documented. However, given the
      context of medieval Europe, we can assume he lived during the Middle Ages, possibly
      in the 12th or 13th century.


      3. **Compare Lifespans**: With the information we have, we can compare their
      lifespans. Werner Schaler lived from 1923 to 1997, which is a span of 74 years.
      Heinrich von Besmedin''s lifespan is more challenging to pinpoint, but we can
      estimate that he lived for a shorter period, considering the historical context
      and the shorter lifespans typical of that era.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the available information and considering that Werner
      Schaler lived for 74 years, and Heinrich von Besmedin likely lived for a shorter
      period, it''s plausible that Werner Schaler lived longer than Heinrich von Besmedin.
      However, without specific dates for Heinrich von Besmedin, this conclusion is
      based on the assumption that his lifespan was shorter.


      Given the information and the steps of reasoning, the answer to the question
      is likely "YES." Werner Schaler lived longer than Heinrich von Besmedin, based
      on the available information and the estimated lifespans.


      **Answer: YES**

    5099d151-9911-43b8-97b9-821f9cf25c37: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Werner Schaler**: First, we need to know who Werner Schaler is.
      After research, it appears that Werner Schaler was a German poet and writer
      who lived in the 20th century. His birth and death dates are not widely documented,
      but given the context of his literary works, we can estimate his lifespan to
      be around the early to mid-20th century.


      2. **Identify Heinrich von Besmedin**: Next, we identify Heinrich von Besmedin.
      Heinrich von Besmedin was a German nobleman who lived in the 13th century. Specific
      details about his birth and death dates are not widely documented, but given
      the context of his historical period, we can estimate his lifespan to be around
      the late 13th century.


      3. **Compare Lifespans**: Given the estimated lifespans, we can compare them.
      Since Werner Schaler''s exact dates are not well-documented, we can consider
      him to have lived in the early to mid-20th century. Heinrich von Besmedin, on
      the other hand, lived in the late 13th century.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information and considering the significant
      gap in time between the lifespans of Werner Schaler (early to mid-20th century)
      and Heinrich von Besmedin (late 13th century), it''s highly likely that Werner
      Schaler lived longer than Heinrich von Besmedin.


      Given the information and the steps of reasoning, the answer to whether Werner
      Schaler lived longer than Heinrich von Besmedin is **YES**'

      a few steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify the historical figures**: First, we need to know who Grimoald
      III of Benevento and John IV, Count of Oldenburg are. Grimoald III was a Lombard
      duke of Benevento, ruling from 788 to 806. John IV was a German nobleman and
      count of Oldenburg, ruling from 1526 to 1529.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: The next step is to determine the lifespans
      of these two individuals. For Grimoald III, we know that he ruled from 788 to
      806, but we don''t have specific birth and death dates. However, given the typical
      lifespan of people in the 8th century and the duration of his rule, we can estimate
      that he might have lived for around 40-50 years. For John IV, we know that he
      ruled from 1526 to 1529, and historical records suggest he died in 1529, which
      means his lifespan was approximately 3 years.


      3. **Compare their lifespans**: Given the estimated lifespans, we can compare
      them. Grimoald III, with an estimated lifespan of 40-50 years, clearly lived
      longer than John IV, who had a lifespan of only 3 years.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information and considering the estimated
      lifespans, it is safe to say that Grimoald III of Benevento lived longer than

      Given the lack of specific information on Princess Yangguo''s lifespan and the
      limited lifespan of Blanche de France, the answer to the question is likely
      $\boxed{YES}$. However, this answer is based on the assumption that Princess
      Yangguo''s fictional lifespan in the novel is longer than Blanche de France''s
      historically recorded lifespan.

    c7bd0127-a333-4f05-be25-29f12a04fb8c: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the historical figures**: First, we need to know who Princess
      Yangguo and Blanche de France are. Princess Yangguo is a fictional character
      from the Chinese novel "The Legend of the Condor Heroes" by Jin Yong. Blanche
      de France, on the other hand, is a historical figure who was the daughter of
      Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: To compare their lifespans, we need to know
      when they were born and when they died. Princess Yangguo is a fictional character,
      so we can''t determine her exact lifespan. However, Blanche de France was born
      in 1253 and died in 1323.


      3. **Compare their lifespans**: Since Princess Yangguo is a fictional character,
      we can''t compare her lifespan directly with Blanche de France. However, we
      can make an educated guess based on the information we have. If we assume that
      Princess Yangguo''s lifespan is similar to that of a real-life person who lived
      during the same time period as Blanche de France, we can estimate that she might
      have lived for around 70-80 years.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information we have, we can''t definitively
      answer whether Princess Yangguo lived longer than Blanche de France. However,
      if we make an educated guess, it seems likely that Blanche de France lived longer,
      as her lifespan was 70 years, while Princess Yangguo''s estimated lifespan is
      similar to that of a real-life person from the same time period.


      Given the lack of specific information about Princess Yangguo''s lifespan and
      the need for an educated guess, the answer to the question is likely "NO."

      follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the figures**: First, I need to identify who Zita of Bourbon-Parma
      and Al-Tabarani are. Zita of Bourbon-Parma was an Empress of Austria and Queen
      of Hungary, while Al-Tabarani was a prominent Islamic scholar.


      2. **Determine the time periods**: Next, I should determine the time periods
      in which they lived. Zita of Bourbon-Parma lived from 1892 to 1989, while Al-Tabarani
      lived in the 10th century AD.


      3. **Find the lifespans**: To compare their lifespans, I need their birth and
      death years. Zita of Bourbon-Parma lived for 97 years (1892-1989), while Al-Tabarani
      lived for an unknown number of years in the 10th century.


      4. **Compare the lifespans**: Since Al-Tabarani''s lifespan is unknown, it''s
      not possible to compare their lifespans directly. However, based on the information
      provided, it''s clear that Zita of Bourbon-Parma lived a significantly longer
      life, spanning almost a century.


      Given the lack of specific information on Al-Tabarani''s lifespan, it''s not
      possible to provide a definitive answer based on a direct comparison. However,
      based on the known lifespans, it''s evident that Zita of Bourbon-Parma lived
      a much longer life than Al-Tabarani, who lived in the 10th century.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Zita of Bourbon-Parma lived longer than Al-Tabarani
      is likely **YES**'

      \u6000\u5409 (Xue Huaiji)**: First, we need to know who \u859B\u6000\u5409 is.\
      \ \u859B\u6000\u5409 was a Tang Dynasty official and poet in ancient China.\n\
      \n2. **Identify Abdul Aziz ibn Harith ibn Asad Yemeni Tamimi**: Next, we identify\

      \ jurist from the Yemeni Tamimi tribe, known for his contributions to Islamic\
      \ jurisprudence and hadith studies.\n\n3. **Find Birth and Death Years**:\n\

      \u6000\u5409 indicate that he lived during the Tang Dynasty in ancient China.\
      \ The exact birth and death years of \u859B\u6000\u5409 are not readily available,\
      \ but we can approximate his lifespan based on historical context. Assuming\
      \ he was active during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) and considering the average\
      \ lifespan of individuals in that era, we might guess his birth to be around\
      \ 650 AD and his death perhaps in the 700s AD, though exact dates are not readily\
      \ available.\n   - **Abdul Aziz ibn Harith ibn Asad Yemeni Tamimi**: Abdul Aziz\
      \ ibn Harith ibn Asad Yemeni Tamimi lived during the early Islamic period, and\
      \ while his exact birth and death years are not widely documented, he is believed\
      \ to have lived during the 7th century AD.\n\n4. **Compare Lifespans**:\n  \

      \ that Abdul Aziz lived during the same general period.\n   - The speculative\
      \ lifespan of \u859B\u6000\u5409 would span roughly 100 years, assuming he died\
      \ in 750 AD. However, without precise birth and death dates for \u859B\u6000\

      to know who these individuals are. William III de Cantilupe was an English nobleman
      and military leader active during the 13th century. Antonio Arcioni was an Italian
      Renaissance artist known for his work in the 15th and 16th centuries.


      2. **Determine Their Lifespans**: Once we have identified them correctly, we
      need to find out their birth and death years. William III de Cantilupe lived
      from 1216 to 1254. Antonio Arcioni''s birth and death dates are not as well-documented,
      but based on the context of his work, he likely lived during the 15th and 16th
      centuries.


      3. **Compare Lifespans**: With the correct identification and lifespans, we
      can then compare how long each lived.


      Given the lack of specific, well-documented birth and death dates for Antonio
      Arcioni, it''s difficult to make a direct comparison. However, considering that
      William III de Cantilupe lived for approximately 38 years, and given the historical
      context of Antonio Arcioni''s life, it''s reasonable to assume that Arcioni
      likely lived longer than 38 years.

      these steps:


      1. **Identify the historical figures**: First, we need to identify who William
      III de Cantilupe and Antonio Arcioni are. William III de Cantilupe was a 13th-century
      English nobleman and landowner. Antonio Arcioni, on the other hand, is not a
      widely recognized historical figure, making it challenging to find specific
      information about him.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: The next step is to determine the lifespans
      of these two individuals. William III de Cantilupe is known to have lived from
      around 1252 to 1308, making his lifespan approximately 56 years. Antonio Arcioni''s
      lifespan is not readily available, and without specific details, it''s difficult
      to proceed.


      3. **Compare their lifespans**: Given the estimated lifespans, we can compare
      them. Since William III de Cantilupe''s lifespan is known to be 56 years, if
      we assume that Antonio Arcioni lived for a similar or shorter period, it''s
      likely that William III de Cantilupe lived longer.

      \ historical figure who lived during the Tang dynasty.\n\n2. **Identify Abdullah\

      \ guess based on the historical context and the average lifespan of individuals\

      \ considering the average lifespan and the historical period he lived in, we\
      \ might approximate his lifespan to be similar to that of average individuals\
      \ of his time. Let's assume he lived approximately from 800 AD to 860 AD, though\

      1. **Identify the figures**: The first step is to identify who Friedrich Gren
      and Theodora Komnene Angelina are. Friedrich Gren is a lesser-known historical
      figure, and without more specific information, it''s challenging to pinpoint
      his identity. Theodora Komnene Angelina, on the other hand, is a figure from
      Byzantine history, known for her role in the political and social dynamics of
      the Byzantine Empire.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: The next step is to determine the lifespans
      of these two individuals. Theodora Komnene Angelina is believed to have lived
      in the 12th century, with specific dates not widely documented. Given the context,
      we can estimate her lifespan to be roughly within the 1100s. Friedrich Gren,
      without more specific information, remains a challenge to pinpoint his exact
      lifespan.


      3. **Compare their lifespans**: Given the estimated lifespans, we can compare
      them. Since Friedrich Gren''s exact dates are not well-documented and assuming
      he was a lesser-known figure, if we consider that he might have been born around
      the same time as Theodora Komnene Angelina and potentially lived into the 13th
      century, his lifespan could overlap with or be slightly before that of Theodora
      Komnene Angelina.

      it seems plausible that Theodora Komnene Angelina could have lived longer than

      \ AD) and the approximate lifespan of Abbad ibn Bishr (early 7th century AD),\
      \ we can make a comparison.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the known lifespan\
      \ of Gao Huan and the approximate lifespan of Abbad ibn Bishr, it's likely that\
      \ Abbad ibn Bishr lived longer than Gao Huan. The early 7th century AD, during\
      \ which Abbad ibn Bishr is believed to have lived, spans several decades, while\
      \ Gao Huan's lifespan was 51 years.\n\nGiven the information and the steps of\
      \ reasoning, and considering that Abbad ibn Bishr's lifespan is not precisely\
      \ known but likely extended into the early 7th century AD, the answer to whether\
      \ \u9AD8\u6E19 (Gao Huan) lived longer than Abbad ibn Bishr is **NO**"
    a2afb861-b0e6-440f-a2b7-971a256c756e: "To answer this question, we need to determine\
      \ the lifespans of \u9AD8\u6E19 (Gao Huan) and Abbad ibn Bishr.\n\n1. **Identify\
      \ \u9AD8\u6E19 (Gao Huan)**: First, we need to know who \u9AD8\u6E19 (Gao Huan)\
      \ is. Gao Huan was a prominent figure in Chinese history during the Northern\
      \ and Southern dynasties period. He played a significant role in the political\
      \ landscape of that era.\n\n2. **Identify Abbad ibn Bishr**: Next, we identify\
      \ Abbad ibn Bishr. Abbad ibn Bishr was a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad\
      \ and is known for his participation in early Islamic history.\n\n3. **Find\
      \ Birth and Death Years**:\n   - **\u9AD8\u6E19 (Gao Huan)**: Gao Huan was born\
      \ in 496 AD and died in 547 AD, living for 51 years.\n   - **Abbad ibn Bishr**:\
      \ Abbad ibn Bishr's birth year is not precisely known, but he died in 632 AD.\n\
      \n4. **Compare Lifespans**:\n   - Given the known lifespan of Gao Huan (496-547\
      \ AD, 51 years) and the approximate lifespan of Abbad ibn Bishr (died in 632\
      \ AD), we can see that Gao Huan lived for 51 years.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based\
      \ on the known lifespan of Gao Huan and the approximate lifespan of Abbad ibn\
      \ Bishr, we can conclude that \u9AD8\u6E19 (Gao Huan) did not live longer than\
      \ Abbad ibn Bishr. While the exact birth year of Abbad ibn Bishr is not known,\
      \ he died in 632 AD, which is later than Gao Huan's death in 547 AD.\n\nGiven\
      \ the information and the steps of reasoning, the answer to the question is\
      \ **NO**"
    d1ead858-58ae-4b88-9170-6f1368f03411: "To answer this question, we need to follow\
      \ a few steps:\n\n1. **Identify \u9AD8\u6E19 (Gao Huo)**: \u9AD8\u6E19, or Gao\
      \ Huo, was a Chinese general and warlord during the late Eastern Han dynasty\
      \ and the Three Kingdoms period of China. He is known for his role in the events\
      \ leading up to the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n2. **Identify Abbad ibn Bishr**:\
      \ Abbad ibn Bishr was a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He is known\
      \ for his role in the early days of Islam and his participation in various battles\
      \ and expeditions during the lifetime of the Prophet.\n\n3. **Find Birth and\
      \ Death Years**:\n   - **\u9AD8\u6E19 (Gao Huo)**: The historical records for\
      \ Gao Huo are not as detailed as those for more prominent figures, but it's\
      \ known he lived during the late 2nd and early 3rd century AD. Assuming he was\
      \ active around the 190s AD and considering the average lifespan and the tumultuous\
      \ period he lived in, if we approximate his lifespan to be similar to that of\
      \ average historical figures of his time, we might guess his birth to be around\
      \ 160 AD and his death perhaps in the early 200s AD, though exact dates are\
      \ not readily available.\n   - **Abbad ibn Bishr**: Abbad ibn Bishr is believed\
      \ to have been born in the late 6th century AD and is known to have died in\
      \ the Battle of Badr in 624 AD.\n\n4. **Compare Lifespans**:\n   - Given the\
      \ approximate lifespan of \u9AD8\u6E19 (let's say 160 AD - 210 AD for simplicity,\
      \ though these dates are speculative) and the known lifespan of Abbad ibn Bishr\
      \ (late 6th century AD - 624 AD), we can see that Abbad ibn Bishr lived for\
      \ approximately 60 to 70 years.\n   - The speculative lifespan of \u9AD8\u6E19\
      \ would span roughly 50 years, assuming he died in 210 AD. However, without\
      \ precise birth and death dates for Gao Huo, this is a rough estimation.\n\n\
      5. **Conclusion**: Given the speculative nature of Gao Huo's dates and the known\
      \ dates for Abbad ibn Bishr, if we rely on the rough estimates provided, Abbad\
      \ ibn Bishr lived longer than the speculated maximum lifespan of \u9AD8\u6E19\
      . However, the question's answer hinges on the accuracy of the lifespan estimates\
      \ for Gao Huo, which are not provided with certainty.\n\nGiven the information\
      \ and the steps of reasoning, and considering that the lifespan of Gao Huo is\
      \ speculative and not precisely known, making an accurate comparison is challenging.\
      \ However, based on the rough estimates and known historical context, the answer\
      \ leans towards \"NO\" because Abbad ibn Bishr's known lifespan exceeds the\
      \ speculative maximum lifespan of Gao Huo. But please note, this answer comes\
      \ with the caveat that Gao Huo's exact lifespan is not known, which introduces\
      \ uncertainty.\n\n**Answer: NO**\n\n"
