      1. First, who is Zita of Bourbon-Parma?

      - She was the last Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary

      - She lived from 1892 to 1989 (97 years old)


      2. Who is Al-Tabarani?

      - He was a medieval Islamic scholar and hadith collector

      - He lived from 260 AH to 360 AH in the Islamic calendar

      - This corresponds to approximately 873-970 CE in the Gregorian calendar


      3. Comparing their lifespans:

      - Zita lived from 1892 to 1989 (97 years)

      - Al-Tabarani lived from approximately 873 to 970 CE (about 97 years)


      4. Comparing their time periods:

      - Zita lived in the late 19th and 20th centuries

      - Al-Tabarani lived in the 9th-10th centuries


      5. Comparing their actual lifespans:

      - Both lived approximately 97 years

      - Zita lived slightly later in history


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Zita of Bourbon-Parma did not live longer than
      Al-Tabarani.'
