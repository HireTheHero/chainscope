      Phalen.

      2. We need to determine the area of Lake Windigo.

      3. We need to compare the two areas.


      Lake Phalen (Minnesota, USA) has an area of approximately 430 acres (source:
      Ramsey County Parks and Recreation).


      Lake Windigo (Minnesota, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness)  is significantly
      smaller. While precise acreage is hard to find readily, descriptions and maps
      suggest it is much smaller than Phalen.


      Therefore, Lake Phalen is larger than Lake Windigo.

      * **Step 2:  Realize the comparison.** We are comparing the area of a lake/reservoir
      (Lago di Luzzone) to the area of an entire nature park (Lake Abant Nature Park).
      Nature parks encompass much more than just the lake within them.
