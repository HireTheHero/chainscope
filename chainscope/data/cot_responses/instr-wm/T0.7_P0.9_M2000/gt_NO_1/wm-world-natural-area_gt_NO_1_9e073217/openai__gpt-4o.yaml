      1. **Research Hadero Lake**: Hadero Lake, also known as Lake Hadero, is located
      in Ethiopia. It is not widely recognized as one of the larger lakes in the world,
      and information about its exact size might not be readily available in common
      references.


      2. **Research Mountain Island Lake**: Mountain Island Lake is located in North
      Carolina, USA. It is a reservoir formed by the damming of the Catawba River.
      While not as large as some other lakes in the region, it is relatively well-documented.


      3. **Comparing the Sizes**: Without exact figures for Hadero Lake, it is challenging
      to make a precise comparison. However, Mountain Island Lake is a known reservoir
      with a measurable size (approximately 3,281 acres or 13.28 square kilometers).


      Given the relative obscurity and likely smaller size of Hadero Lake compared
      to the documented size of Mountain Island Lake, it is reasonable to conclude
      that Hadero Lake is smaller.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**.'

      1. **Mistastin Crater**: Mistastin Crater, located in Labrador, Canada, is a

      crater contains a lake, Mistastin Lake, which is roughly oval in shape and occupies
      a significant portion of the crater. However, the lake itself is much smaller
      than the entire crater diameter.


      2. **Lake Como**: Lake Como is a lake located in the Lombardy region of Italy.
      It has an area of about 146 square kilometers, making it one of the largest

      - The entire Mistastin Crater, with a diameter of 28 kilometers, would have
      a maximum theoretical area (assuming a perfect circle) of about 615 square kilometers,

      - Mistastin Lake itself, which is part of the crater, is significantly smaller

      Therefore, if comparing the total area of the Mistastin Crater (including land)
      to Lake Como, Mistastin Crater is larger. However, if comparing just the water
      bodies, Lake Como is larger than Mistastin Lake.

      1. **Lake Sampaloc:** Lake Sampaloc is located in the city of San Pablo, in
      the province of Laguna, Philippines. It is the largest of the Seven Lakes of
      San Pablo. The area of Lake Sampaloc is approximately 104 hectares (or 1.04
      square kilometers).


      2. **Lake Afton:** Lake Afton is located in Sedgwick County, Kansas, USA. It
      is a man-made lake primarily used for recreation. The area of Lake Afton is
      approximately 100 hectares (or 1 square kilometer).


      Now, comparing the two areas:

      - Lake Sampaloc: 104 hectares

      - Lake Afton: 100 hectares


      Lake Sampaloc has a larger area than Lake Afton.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'
    b3ceb4a5-d229-4c23-bbe2-f45d3f56ea86: 'To answer whether Lake Sampaloc has a larger
      area than Lake Afton, let''s first consider the sizes of each lake.


      1. **Lake Sampaloc**: This is a volcanic crater lake located in the city of
      San Pablo, Laguna, Philippines. It is one of the Seven Lakes of San Pablo and
      is the largest among them. The area of Lake Sampaloc is approximately 104 hectares.


      2. **Lake Afton**: This is a small lake located in Kansas, USA, primarily used
      for recreational activities. Lake Afton covers an area of about 100 acres.


      Now, let''s convert these measurements to the same unit for easier comparison:


      - 1 hectare is equivalent to approximately 2.471 acres.

      - Therefore, the area of Lake Sampaloc in acres is 104 hectares * 2.471 acres/hectare
      = approximately 257.0 acres.


      Comparing the areas:

      - Lake Sampaloc: ~257 acres

      - Lake Afton: ~100 acres


      Lake Sampaloc is indeed larger than Lake Afton.

      reduced rainfall, damming, and water diversion. Historically, its surface area

      Given that both lakes are small, we need to determine which is larger. However,
      Licancabur Lake, being a crater lake, is typically quite small, even for a mountain
      lake. While specific measurements may not be readily available for both, crater

      1. **Alice Lake (Sawtooth Wilderness):** Alice Lake is located in the Sawtooth
      Wilderness of Idaho, USA. It is a popular hiking destination and known for its
      scenic beauty, but it is not particularly large in terms of surface area. The
      Sawtooth Wilderness contains many small to medium-sized alpine lakes.


      2. **Knoll Lake:** Knoll Lake is located in Arizona, USA, and is part of the
      Mogollon Rim region. It is another popular recreational lake, but like Alice
      Lake, it is not exceptionally large.


      By comparing the two, both lakes are relatively small and are not among the
      large lakes in their respective regions. However, specific size comparisons
      are not commonly documented in easily accessible sources.


      Based on typical size descriptions and without exact measurements, Alice Lake
      is generally smaller in surface area compared to Knoll Lake.


      Thus, the answer is: **NO**, Alice Lake does not have a larger area than Knoll
      Lake.'
