      1. I need to find the release dates of both songs.


      2. However, I cannot find any song called "Cassidy''s Hotel" after searching.
      This might be an incorrect song title or a non-existent song.


      3. Jason Aldean''s "Girl Like You" was released in 2018 as part of his album
      "Rearview Town."


      4. Since I cannot verify the existence or release date of "Cassidy''s Hotel,"
      I cannot make a valid comparison between the two release dates.


      5. Without being able to compare both dates, I cannot provide a definitive answer.


      Since I cannot verify one of the songs to make the comparison, I cannot give
      a YES or NO answer with confidence. The question cannot be answered as presented.'

      - "Kem kan eg ringe" was released in 2010

      - It appeared on his album "D'' e glede"


      3. Now I can compare:

      - 2006 (Speak) vs 2010 (Kem kan eg ringe)

      - 2006 comes before 2010


      Therefore, since Godsmack''s "Speak" (2006) came before Lars Vaular''s "Kem
      kan eg ringe" (2010), the answer is:


      NO'
