      1. First, I''ll find out when "Cassidy''s Hotel" was released

      - However, I do not recognize a song called "Cassidy''s Hotel"

      - This might be a song I''m not familiar with


      2. Next, I''ll find out when Jason Aldean''s "Girl Like You" was released

      - Jason Aldean released "Girl Like You" in 2022 on his album "Macon"


      3. Since I cannot confirm the release date of "Cassidy''s Hotel", I cannot definitively
      compare the two release dates


      4. Without being able to verify the details of "Cassidy''s Hotel", I cannot
      confidently answer whether it was released later or earlier than "Girl Like
      You"


      Therefore, I cannot provide a YES or NO answer. I would need more information
      about the song "Cassidy''s Hotel" to make a determination.'

      - This song was released in 2023, from their album "Butter Miracle, Suite Two"


      2. Next, I''ll check when "Piggyback" by Melanie Martinez was released:

      - This song was released in 2023, from her album "PORTALS"


      3. Comparing the release dates:

      - Both songs were released in 2023

      - Without specific month/day information, I cannot definitively say which came
      first


      4. Since I cannot conclusively determine the precise chronological order, I
      cannot confidently answer YES or NO.


      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. In such a case where I''m
      uncertain, I should indicate that.


      My answer is: UNCERTAIN'

      "Thug Love" by 50 Cent

      - This suggests the song might not exist or I cannot confidently verify its
      release date


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date for Hinder''s "Without You"

      - Hinder''s "Without You" was released in 2006 on their album "Extreme Behavior"


      3. Since I cannot confirm the release date of the 50 Cent song, I cannot definitively
      compare the two release dates


      4. Therefore, I cannot confidently answer whether "Thug Love" was released later
      than "Without You"


      Given the lack of clear information, the most responsible answer is:


      NO


      (Because I cannot confirm the 50 Cent song''s existence or date, so I cannot
      say it was released later)'
