      2.  **Determine its release date:** The song "The Celts" was originally the
      title track for the BBC documentary series *The Celts* in 1987 and featured
      on Enya''s self-titled album released the same year (*Enya*, later re-released
      as *The Celts* in 1992). The song was also released as a single in 1992. So,
      its earliest release was **1987**, with a single release in **1992**.

      3.  **Identify the second song:** Common''s "Geto Heaven Remix T.S.O.I. (The
      Sound of Illadelph)" featuring Macy Gray.

      4.  **Determine its release date:** This song was released as a single from
      Common''s album *Like Water for Chocolate*. The album and the single were released
      in **2000**.

      5.  **Compare the release dates:** Enya''s "The Celts" (1987/1992) was released
      before Common''s "Geto Heaven Remix T.S.O.I." (2000).

      6.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Enya''s song was

      Enya''s song was not released later.
