      was released in 2000 as well.  However, it was part of the Baduizm album originally
      released in 1997.  The song was re-released/remixed in 2000.

      3. **Compare the 2000 release dates:**  Need more specific release date information
      for both songs in 2000 to be certain.  Hello Time Bomb was part of the *Beautiful
      Midnight* album released in July 1999. The single "Hello Time Bomb" was released
      in 2000.  "Turn Me Away" was released as a single in 2000.  Without more specific
      2000 release dates for the *singles*, it''s impossible to be definitively certain.


      NO (with the caveat that more specific single release dates are needed for certainty)
