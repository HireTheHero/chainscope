      the release dates of both songs.


      1. **"Thug Love" by 50 Cent**: This song is from the album "The New Breed,"
      which was released in 2002. The specific release date of "Thug Love" is often
      considered to be around that time, but it may have been part of promotional
      releases earlier.


      2. **"Without You" by Hinder**: This song is from the album "Extreme Behavior,"
      which was released in 2005. The single "Without You" was released in 2006.


      Now, comparing the release years:

      - "Thug Love" (2002)

      - "Without You" (2006)


      Since 2006 is later than 2002, we conclude that "Thug Love" was released before
      "Without You."


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**.'
