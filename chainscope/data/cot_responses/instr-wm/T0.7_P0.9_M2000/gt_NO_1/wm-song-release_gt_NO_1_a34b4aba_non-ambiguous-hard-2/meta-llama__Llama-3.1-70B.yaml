      It to Me Right" was released later than Bridgit Mendler''s "Diving", we need
      to identify the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of Melanie Fiona''s "Give It to Me Right":**
      Melanie Fiona''s song "Give It to Me Right" was released in 2009.


      2. **Identify the release date of Bridgit Mendler''s "Diving":** I couldn''t
      find information on a song by Bridgit Mendler titled "Diving". Bridgit Mendler
      is known for songs like "Ready or Not" and has released several albums, but
      without specific details on "Diving", it''s challenging to compare directly.


      3. **Comparison:** Given the lack of information on "Diving" by Bridgit Mendler,
      a direct comparison to determine if "Give It to Me Right" by Melanie Fiona was
      released later than "Diving" cannot be accurately made.


      However, since the question requires a YES or NO answer and considering the
      information available:


      - If "Diving" by Bridgit Mendler does not exist or was not released (or the
      information is not available), we cannot accurately say it was released before
      "Give It to Me Right".

      - But, assuming "Diving" might exist but with no release date found, or considering
      the nature of the question which seems to presuppose the existence of both songs,
      we have to base our answer on what we know.


      Given the direct information available and the need for a definitive answer
      without the ability to confirm the existence or release date of "Diving" by
      Bridgit Mendler, the most straightforward approach based on the question''s
      structure and available data would lean towards an assumption that without evidence
      of "Diving" being released before 2009, "Give It to Me Right" could not be definitively
      said to be released later based on the information provided.

      2. **Identify the release date of "12-Bar Original" by The Beatles**: "12-Bar
      Original" is a rare instrumental track by The Beatles, and it was recorded on
      November 4, 1965. However, it was not officially released until 1996 as part
      of The Beatles'' "Anthology 2" album.


      Given these release dates, we can now compare them:


      - "Seconds" by U2 was released in 1983.

      - "12-Bar Original" by The Beatles was recorded in 1965 but was not officially
      released until 1996.


      Since 1983 is later than 1965, "Seconds" by U2 was released later than "12-Bar
      Original" by The Beatles.


      Therefore, the answer to whether "Seconds" by U2 was released later than "12-Bar
      Original" by The Beatles is **YES**'

      was released in 2001 as part of their album "In Search Of..."

      2019.


      2. **Compare the release dates**: 2013 is earlier than 2019.


      Given these release dates, we can conclude that "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington

      Therefore, the answer to whether "Hey Girl" was released later than "Summer

      "Hey Girl" was released later than Patrick Stump''s "Summer Days", let''s first

      1. **Billy Currington''s "Hey Girl"**: "Hey Girl" was released in 2013 as part
      of Billy Currington''s album "We Are Tonight".


      2. **Patrick Stump''s "Summer Days"**: I couldn''t find a song titled "Summer
      Days" by Patrick Stump. However, Patrick Stump is known for his work with the
      band Fall Out Boy and as a solo artist. He has released several songs and albums,
      but "Summer Days" doesn''t seem to be among them.


      Given the information available:


      - "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington was released in 2013.

      - "Summer Days" by Patrick Stump doesn''t seem to exist or couldn''t be found.


      Since "Summer Days" by Patrick Stump couldn''t be located, we cannot definitively
      say that it was released before or after "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington.


      However, considering the information we have, we can make a logical deduction
      based on the structure of the question. The question assumes that both songs
      exist, so we have to operate under that assumption. Given that "Summer Days"
      by Patrick Stump couldn''t be found, we cannot say that it was released before
      "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington.

      a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Identify the songs**: We have "Under the Gun" by The Sisters of Mercy and
      "Sunrise" by Simply Red.


      2. **Find release dates**: According to my knowledge cutoff in September 2021,
      I couldn''t find a song titled "Under the Gun" by The Sisters of Mercy. However,
      I found "Sunrise" by Simply Red, which was released in 2003 as part of their
      album "Home".


      3. **Comparison**: Given the lack of information on "Under the Gun" by The Sisters
      of Mercy, we cannot accurately compare the release dates.


      Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclusively say whether
      "Under the Gun" by The Sisters of Mercy was released later than "Sunrise" by
      Simply Red. The answer to the question is **UNKNOWN** due to missing information.
