      - "Science Fiction" was a track from their self-titled album "Divinyls" released
      in 1991.

      - Upon reviewing Pink Floyd''s discography, they don''t have a well-known song
      titled "Round and Around." Pink Floyd has songs like "Around and Around" which
      appeared on some bootlegs, but not an official track called "Round and Around."

      Step 2: Let me check if "Round and Around" by Pink Floyd exists.

      I need to clarify that Pink Floyd doesn''t have a song specifically titled "Round
      and Around." They have "Around and Around" which appeared on their early compilation
      "Relics" in 1971, though it was originally recorded earlier.

      Divinyls''s "Science Fiction" was released in 1983.

      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      2013 (Elastic Heart) comes before 2018 (Girls)

      - "Elastic Heart" by Diplo

      Step 2: Research the release dates of each song.

      - "Elastic Heart" is actually a song by Sia featuring Diplo and Labrinth as
      part of their group LSD. It was released in 2018.

      - However, there was an earlier version of "Elastic Heart" by Sia (without Diplo)

      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      - If we''re referring to the LSD version with Diplo''s involvement, both songs
      came out in 2018, with "Girls" likely being released slightly earlier that year.

      - If referring to the original "Elastic Heart," that was released in 2013, well
      before "Girls."


      Since the question specifically asks about "Diplo''s Elastic Heart," I should
      focus on the version where he was directly involved (the LSD version from 2018).


      NO - Diplo''s version of "Elastic Heart" was not released later than Charli

      Step 1: Identify the release date of Billy Currington''s "Hey Girl."

      Billy Currington''s "Hey Girl" was released in 2013 as a single from his album
      "We Are Tonight."


      Step 2: Identify the release date of Patrick Stump''s "Summer Days."

      Patrick Stump (of Fall Out Boy) released "This City" as a solo single, but I
      don''t believe he has a solo song specifically called "Summer Days." There is
      a Fall Out Boy song called "Summer Days (Summer Nights)" from their 2023 album
      "So Much (For) Stardust."


      If referring to this Fall Out Boy song, then it was released in 2023, which
      is much later than Currington''s 2013 song.


      If referring to another song by Patrick Stump called "Summer Days" that I''m
      not familiar with, it would likely be from his solo work around 2011-2012 when
      he was active as a solo artist.


      Based on the available information, and assuming the Fall Out Boy song is the
      one in question:


      NO - Billy Currington''s "Hey Girl" (2013) was NOT released later than Patrick
      Stump''s "Summer Days" (2023). It was released earlier.'

      - "Hey Girl" was released in 2013 as a single from Currington''s album "We Are
      Tonight."


      Step 2: Identify when Patrick Stump''s "Summer Days" was released.

      - Patrick Stump released "Soul Punk," his solo album containing "Summer Days,"
      in October 2011.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Billy Currington''s "Hey Girl": 2013

      - Patrick Stump''s "Summer Days": 2011

      - 2013 is later than 2011

      "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington was released in 2013 as a single from his album

      Patrick Stump (from Fall Out Boy) was involved with a song called "Summer Days"

      However, I should verify if this is the correct "Summer Days" being referenced,
      as Patrick Stump may have released a solo song with this title.


      Looking at Patrick Stump''s solo discography, he released a solo album called
      "Soul Punk" in 2011, but I don''t see a solo track called "Summer Days" in his
      major releases.


      If the question refers to the Martin Garrix collaboration (2019), then Billy
      Currington''s "Hey Girl" (2013) was released earlier.

      If the question refers to some other Patrick Stump song called "Summer Days"
      that was released before 2013, then the answer would be different.
