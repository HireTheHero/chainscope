      Melanie Fiona''s song "Give It to Me Right" was released in 2009.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of Bridgit Mendler''s "Ready or Not"**: Bridgit
      Mendler''s song "Ready or Not" was released in 2012.


      3. **Compare the Release Years**: Since 2009 is before 2012, "Give It to Me
      Right" by Melanie Fiona was released before "Ready or Not" by Bridgit Mendler.


      Given the information and the correction of the song title for Bridgit Mendler
      to "Ready or Not", the answer to whether Melanie Fiona''s "Give It to Me Right"
      was released later than Bridgit Mendler''s song is NO.'

      since I couldn''t find info on a song named "Diving" by Bridgit Mendler, but
      for the sake of the question, let''s proceed with "Diving" as it''s mentioned).


      1. **Melanie Fiona''s "Give It to Me Right"**: This song was released in 2009.
      It was a single from her debut studio album, "The Bridge".


      2. **Bridgit Mendler''s Music Career**: Bridgit Mendler is known for her singles

      releases. Her debut single "Ready or Not" was released in 2012, and her album
      "Hello My Name Is..." was released in 2012 as well.


      Given the information:

      - Assuming Bridgit Mendler''s earliest music releases were around 2012 (since

      Mendler''s music started releasing around 2012, it is reasonable to conclude
      that "Give It to Me Right" was released before any of Bridgit Mendler''s known
      music releases, including the hypothetical "Diving" if it were real and released
      in a similar timeframe.

      Fiona was released in 2009, and assuming Bridgit Mendler''s music started being

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Release Dates**: First, we need to identify the release dates
      of both "The Telephantasm" by Soundgarden and "Lot to Learn" by Luke Christopher.


      2. **Soundgarden''s The Telephantasm Release Date**: Soundgarden''s compilation
      album "Telephantasm" was released on September 28, 2010.


      3. **Luke Christopher''s Lot to Learn Release Date**: Luke Christopher''s song
      or album "Lot to Learn" needs a specific release date to compare. However, without
      specific details on "Lot to Learn" by Luke Christopher, we''ll have to consider
      general information. Luke Christopher is known for releasing music around the
      2010s, but the exact release date of "Lot to Learn" is not specified in the
      question. Assuming it''s part of his early work, we might consider it could
      be around or after 2010, given his rise to fame.


      4. **Comparison**: Since "The Telephantasm" was released on September 28, 2010,
      if "Lot to Learn" by Luke Christopher was released after this date, then "The
      Telephantasm" was released earlier. If "Lot to Learn" was released before September
      28, 2010, then "The Telephantasm" was released later.


      Given the information available and assuming "Lot to Learn" could have been
      released at any point, the question hinges on the specific release date of "Lot
      to Learn," which isn''t provided. However, considering Luke Christopher''s career
      started to take off in the early 2010s and assuming "Lot to Learn" might be
      part of his earlier releases, there''s a chance it could have been released
      after "The Telephantasm."


      Since the exact release date of "Lot to Learn" is not specified and considering
      the general time frames of both artists'' active periods, the most straightforward
      assumption based on available data would lean towards "The Telephantasm" being
      released earlier than many of Luke Christopher''s works, given Soundgarden''s
      established career by 2010.


      Therefore, based on the step-by-step analysis and the information provided (or
      not provided) in the question, the answer would likely be **YES**, considering

      to have released music around the 2010s, but the exact date of "Lot to Learn"

    70d830e1-4ba5-4b25-a663-a24f77196dda: 'To answer this question, let''s first identify
      the release years of the two songs:


      1. **Jo Dee Messina''s "Bring On the Rain"** - This song was released in 2001.
      It was a single from her album of the same name.


      2. **Robin Thicke''s "Wanna Love You Girl"** - This song was released in 2005
      (as a single featuring Pharrell Williams) from his album "The Evolution of Robin
      Thicke".


      Given these release years, we can see that "Bring On the Rain" by Jo Dee Messina

      "The Roller" by Beady Eye and "Girls" by Bebe Rexha.


      2. **Beady Eye - The Roller Release Date**: "The Roller" is a song by the English
      rock band Beady Eye, which was released in 2011 as part of their debut album
      "Different Gear, Still Speeding".


      3. **Bebe Rexha - Girls Release Date**: Bebe Rexha is known for her hit songs,
      but the specific release date of "Girls" needs clarification. Assuming "Girls"
      refers to a collaboration or a song featuring Bebe Rexha, without a specific
      date, it''s hard to pinpoint. However, Bebe Rexha rose to fame in the mid-2010s,
      so her songs would generally be expected to be released after 2011.


      4. **Comparison**: Since "The Roller" by Beady Eye was released in 2011, if
      "Girls" by Bebe Rexha was released after 2011, then "The Roller" was released
      before "Girls".


      Given the general information and assuming "Girls" by Bebe Rexha was released
      sometime after Beady Eye''s "The Roller" in 2011 (considering Bebe Rexha''s
      rise to fame and typical release timelines for her music), the answer to whether
      "The Roller" was released later than "Girls" would be:


      NO'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Release Years**: First, we need to identify the release years
      of both songs. Beady Eye''s "The Roller" and Bebe Rexha''s "Girls" (assuming
      "Girls" is the one featuring Rita Ora, Charli XCX, and Cardi B, as there are
      multiple songs with this title) need to be looked up for their release dates.


      2. **Beady Eye''s The Roller Release Date**: Beady Eye was a British rock band
      that was formed in 2009 by the former members of Oasis, after the departure
      of Noel Gallagher. "The Roller" was released in 2011 as a single from their
      debut album, "Different Gear, Still Speeding".


      3. **Bebe Rexha''s Girls Release Date**: Bebe Rexha collaborated on the song
      "Girls" with Rita Ora, Charli XCX, and Cardi B, which was released in 2018.


      4. **Comparison**: Comparing the release years, "The Roller" by Beady Eye was
      released in 2011, and "Girls" by Bebe Rexha (and collaborators) was released
      in 2018.


      Given these steps, since 2011 is before 2018, "The Roller" was released earlier
      than "Girls".


      Therefore, the answer to whether Beady Eye''s "The Roller" was released later
      than Bebe Rexha''s "Girls" is: **NO**.'
    28a141fd-1a99-4d62-bda7-5f1155e6f332: 'To answer this question, I need to determine
      the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Beady Eye''s The Roller**: Beady Eye was a British rock band that formed
      in 2009 after the breakup of Oasis. The Roller was the lead single from their
      debut album, "Different Gear, Still Speeding". It was released on January 21,
      2011.


      2. **Bebe Rexha''s Girls**: Bebe Rexha is an American singer and songwriter.
      To determine if "Girls" by Bebe Rexha was released before or after "The Roller"
      by Beady Eye, I need to consider the release date of "Girls". However, without
      the specific release date of "Girls" by Bebe Rexha in my initial knowledge,
      I would typically look it up. But, knowing that Bebe Rexha rose to fame in the
      mid to late 2010s, it''s plausible that her song "Girls" could have been released
      later than 2011.


      Given the known release date of "The Roller" (January 21, 2011) and assuming
      "Girls" by Bebe Rexha was indeed released after 2011 (as Bebe Rexha''s career
      gained momentum in the following years), we can infer the answer.

      Therefore, the answer to whether "Four Sticks" was released later than "Public
      Image" is: **NO**.'

      2. **Metric''s "Youth Without Youth" Release Year**: "Youth Without Youth" is
      a song by the Canadian indie rock band Metric, from their sixth studio album,

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Release Dates**: First, we need to identify the release dates
      of both songs: "Youth Without Youth" by Metric and "Used To" by Sandro Cavazza.


      2. **Metric''s "Youth Without Youth" Release Date**: Metric''s song "Youth Without
      Youth" was released in 2012 as part of their fifth studio album, "Synthetica".


      3. **Sandro Cavazza''s "Used To" Release Date**: Sandro Cavazza''s song "Used
      To" (a collaboration with Anne-Marie and NEIKED) was released in 2017.


      4. **Comparison**: Comparing the release dates, "Youth Without Youth" by Metric
      was released in 2012, while "Used To" by Sandro Cavazza was released in 2017.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since 2012 is earlier than 2017, "Youth Without Youth" was
      released before "Used To".


      Given the information and the steps outlined, the answer to whether Metric''s
      "Youth Without Youth" was released later than Sandro Cavazza''s "Used To" is:

      the release dates of both "Youth Without Youth" by Metric and "Used To" by Sandro
      Cavazza.


      1. **Identify the release date of "Youth Without Youth" by Metric**: "Youth
      Without Youth" is a song by the Canadian indie rock band Metric, from their
      sixth studio album, "Synthetica". The album "Synthetica" was released on June
      12, 2012. Therefore, "Youth Without Youth" was released in 2012.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Used To" by Sandro Cavazza**: Sandro Cavazza
      is known for his collaborations, particularly with Avicii. However, without
      specific information on a song titled "Used To" by Sandro Cavazza, we must consider
      the possibility that it might be a lesser-known track or a collaboration. Given
      the information available up to my last update, Sandro Cavazza gained significant
      recognition with his collaborations around 2017, such as "Without You" with
      Avicii. Without the exact release date of "Used To", we must consider if it''s
      possible for it to have been released before or after 2012 based on the artist''s
      general activity timeline.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Since "Youth Without Youth" by Metric was
      released in 2012, for "Used To" by Sandro Cavazza to have been released earlier,
      it would have had to be released before 2012. Given the general rise of Sandro
      Cavazza''s visibility around 2017 and later, it''s plausible that "Used To"
      (if it exists as described) could have been released after 2012.


      Without the exact release date of "Used To" by Sandro Cavazza, we can make an
      educated guess based on the typical career timeline of Sandro Cavazza. Given
      that Sandro Cavazza''s prominent works started gaining attention around 2017
      and later, it''s reasonable to assume that "Used To" would have been released
      after 2012, making "Youth Without Youth" by Metric released earlier than "Used
      To" by Sandro Cavazza.

    56a5ecdf-18a1-4832-8d90-1ae98a12533f: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify the Release Year of "Move That Body" by Nelly**: This song, "Move
      That Body", is a collaboration between Nelly, T-Pain, and Akon, released in
      2010.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of "Dhadkane Azad Hain" by Shreya Ghoshal**:
      This song seems to be less commonly referenced or possibly misnamed in the question,
      as "Dhadkane Azad Hain" is not widely recognized under Shreya Ghoshal''s popular
      discography. However, assuming the song exists and considering Shreya Ghoshal''s
      active career, we need to determine its release year. Without specific information,
      we cannot directly compare, but we know Shreya Ghoshal has been active since
      the late 1990s.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Nelly''s "Move That Body" was released in 2010,
      to determine if it was released later than Shreya Ghoshal''s "Dhadkane Azad
      Hain", we need the release year of the latter. If "Dhadkane Azad Hain" was released
      before 2010, then "Move That Body" was released later.


      Without the specific release year for "Dhadkane Azad Hain" and considering the
      possibility that the song might not be widely recognized or the name might be
      incorrect, we can''t directly compare. However, given the nature of the question
      and assuming "Dhadkane Azad Hain" is a real song by Shreya Ghoshal, if it was
      released before 2010, the answer would be YES, Nelly''s song was released later.


      Given the information available and typical release timelines for songs by these
      artists, and acknowledging the potential for "Dhadkane Azad Hain" being an obscure
      or incorrectly named song:


      The final answer is: YES'

      Body" was released later than Shreya Ghoshal''s "Dhadkane Azad Hain", let''s
      break down the information step by step.


      1. **Identify the Release Year of "Move That Body" by Nelly**: First, we need
      to find out when "Move That Body" by Nelly was released. "Move That Body" is
      a song by Nelly, featuring T-Pain and Akon, from Nelly''s sixth studio album,
      "5.0". The album was released on November 12, 2010.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of "Dhadkane Azad Hain" by Shreya Ghoshal**:
      Next, we need to determine the release year of "Dhadkane Azad Hain" by Shreya
      Ghoshal. This song is from the Bollywood movie "Zubaan" (2016), but it seems
      there might be some confusion because "Zubaan" actually features a song called
      "Dhadkane Azad Hain" but the details about its release might not be widely known
      or it might be confused with another song. For the sake of clarity, let''s consider
      "Dhadkane Azad Hain" is associated with the 2016 movie "Zubaan".


      3. **Compare the Release Years**: Now, we compare the release years of both
      songs. "Move That Body" by Nelly was released in 2010, and "Dhadkane Azad Hain"
      from the movie "Zubaan" would have been released in 2016, given the movie''s
      release year.


      Given these steps, since "Move That Body" was released in 2010 and "Dhadkane
      Azad Hain" (considering it was part of the movie "Zubaan") was released in 2016,
      we can conclude that "Move That Body" was indeed released before "Dhadkane Azad
      Hain".


      Therefore, the answer to whether Nelly''s "Move That Body" was released later
      than Shreya Ghoshal''s "Dhadkane Azad Hain" is: **NO**.'

      the release dates of both songs.


      1. First, let''s find the release date of Nelly''s "Move That Body". After researching,
      I found that "Move That Body" is a song by Nelly, featuring T-Pain and Akon,
      and it was released in 2010.


      2. Next, let''s find the release date of Shreya Ghoshal''s "Dhadkane Azad Hain"
      (also known as "Zoobi Doobi" in some versions, but specifically "Dhadkane Azad
      Hain" is from the 2010 Bollywood film ''Anjaana Anjaani'' in a duet with Vishal
      Dadlani, although another duet version exists). However ''Anjaana Anjaani''
      was released on 1 October 2010.


      Given the release dates, Nelly''s "Move That Body" was released in 2010, and
      Shreya Ghoshal''s "Dhadkane Azad Hain" was also released in 2010.


      Since both songs were released in the same year, to give a definitive answer,
      we need more specific release dates. However, given the information available,
      it seems "Move That Body" was released around October or November 2010, and
      "Dhadkane Azad Hain" (from ''Anjaana Anjaani'') was also released around the
      same time, in October 2010 (as part of the film''s soundtrack).


      So, considering the available information, it''s difficult to say with certainty
      which song was released later without the exact release dates. However, given
      that both were released in the same year and roughly the same time, it is likely
      that one was not significantly later than the other.


      But if we had to make an educated guess based on typical music release patterns
      and the fact that ''Anjaana Anjaani'' was released on 1 October 2010, and considering
      "Move That Body" was released to the US iTunes on October 12, 2010, we can make
      an educated guess.

      1. Identify the release dates of "Chip''s Champion" and "Is That for Me".

      2. Compare these release dates to determine which song was released later.


      After conducting research, here are the findings:

      - "Chip''s Champion" is a song by Chip (also known as Chipmunk), a British rapper.
      However, without more specific information, it''s challenging to pinpoint the
      exact release date of "Chip''s Champion" as there might be multiple songs or
      versions with this title.

      - "Is That for Me" is a song by Swedish DJ Alesso, featuring Anitta, a Brazilian
      singer. It was released in 2017.


      Given the lack of specific information about "Chip''s Champion," including its
      exact release date, and knowing that "Is That for Me" was released in 2017,
      we cannot accurately compare the release dates without more detailed information
      about "Chip''s Champion."


      However, since the question requires a YES or NO answer and given that I couldn''t
      find a well-known song by Chip specifically titled "Chip''s Champion" or its
      release date, I''ll have to make an assumption based on the information available.
      If "Chip''s Champion" were a well-known or recent release, I would expect to
      find more information about it. Given the absence of such information and knowing
      "Is That for Me" was released in 2017, if "Chip''s Champion" exists and was
      released before 2017, the answer would be NO. If it was released after 2017,
      the answer would be YES.


      But since I couldn''t verify the release date of "Chip''s Champion" and considering
      the nature of the question, I must provide an answer based on the most likely
      scenario given the information at hand. Assuming "Chip''s Champion" could potentially
      be a less well-known or older song due to the lack of information, the safest
      assumption might lean towards it being released before or around the same time
      as "Is That for Me," but without exact dates, this is speculative.


      Given these considerations and the speculative nature of my response, I would
      lean towards a cautious "NO" based on the assumption that without specific information
      on "Chip''s Champion," it''s challenging to assert it was released later than
      "Is That for Me" with certainty. However, please note this answer comes with
      the caveat that it''s based on incomplete information and assumptions.

      the release dates of both Sleeper''s "Statuesque" and Jane''s Addiction''s "Irresistible
      Force".


      1. **Identify the release date of Sleeper''s "Statuesque"**: Sleeper is a British
      band known for their work in the0s. "Statuesque" is one of their songs, but
      without specific details, we need to consider the general timeframe of Sleeper''s
      active period, which was primarily in the 1990s.


      2. **Identify the release date of Jane''s Addiction''s "Irresistible Force"**:
      Jane''s Addiction is an American rock band. The song "Irresistible Force" is
      part of their discography, but again, specific release dates are needed for
      comparison. Jane''s Addiction was also active in thes, among other periods.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Without exact release dates provided in the
      question, we must rely on general knowledge. Jane''s Addiction''s "Irresistible
      Force" is actually a track from their  album "Ritual de lo Habitual". Sleeper''s
      "Statuesque" is from their 199 album "The It Girl".


      Given these steps and the information about the release dates:

      - Jane''s Addiction''s "Irresistible Force" was released in 1990.

      - Sleeper''s "Statuesque" was released in 1996.

      - Jane''s Addiction''s "Irresistible Force" was released in 1990 (as part of
      the album "Ritual de lo Habitual").

      1. **Identify the Release Date of Jane''s Addiction''s "Irresistible Force"**:
      First, we need to establish when "Irresistible Force" by Jane''s Addiction was
      released. According to various music databases and sources, Jane''s Addiction
      does not have a song or album directly titled "Irresistible Force" that is widely
      recognized. However, there might be confusion with another band or the actual
      song title might be different. Assuming there might be a mix-up with song titles
      or the song is less known, let''s proceed under the assumption we are discussing
      a real song that could fit this description.


      2. **Identify the Release Date of Sleeper''s "Statuesque"**: Next, we look for
      the release date of "Statuesque" by Sleeper. Sleeper is a British band known
      for their work in the 1990s. "Statuesque" is indeed an album by Sleeper, released
      in 1996.


      3. **Compare Release Dates**: Without a precise release date for Jane''s Addiction''s
      "Irresistible Force" and assuming it might not be a well-documented or correctly
      identified song, it''s challenging to make a direct comparison. However, knowing
      that Sleeper''s "Statuesque" was released in 1996, if "Irresistible Force" by
      Jane''s Addiction was released before this, then "Statuesque" would be later.


      Given the steps and the information available:

      - Since Jane''s Addiction does have an album titled "The Great Escape Artist"
      released in 2011, and another album "The Irresistible Force" is not a recognized
      title for them, but they do have an album "The Great Escape Artist" with a song
      "Irresistible Force" released in 2011, which is after Sleeper''s "Statuesque".

      - Therefore, considering the likely mix-up and the actual song "Irresistible
      Force" by Jane''s Addiction being from 2011, which is after Sleeper''s "Statuesque"
      release in 1996, the answer to whether Sleeper''s "Statuesque" was released

      \ Divinyls and \"Run Like Hell\" seems to be a more known song by Pink Floyd\
      \ with a similar name, but it seems there's a slight mix-up in the song title.\
      \ Assuming \"Round and Around\" refers to a song by Pink Floyd, it's possible\
      \ there's confusion with \"Run Like Hell\" or another song. However, for the\
      \ sake of clarity, let's assume \"Round and Around\" is indeed a song by Pink\
      \ Floyd, but given the confusion, let's correct course and assume the question\
      \ might be referring to a different song or there's a mix-up in song titles.\
      \ \n\n   Given the confusion, let's focus on \"Science Fiction\" by Divinyls,\
      \ which is a real song, and try to find a Pink Floyd song for comparison. If\
      \ we consider \"Run Like Hell\" (from \"The Wall\" album, released in 1979)\
      \ as a basis for comparison due to the possible mix-up in song titles, we have\
      \ a starting point.\n\n2. **Compare Release Years**: \n   - \"Science Fiction\"\

      \   - Assuming \"Round and Around\" was meant to refer to a Pink Floyd song\

      2. Identify the release year of "That''s Life" by Sia.

      3. Compare the release years to determine which song was released later.


      Step 1: "Changing of the Seasons" is an EP by Two Door Cinema Club, released
      on September 30, 2013.


      Step 2: "That''s Life" is a song by Sia, but without more context, it might
      be hard to pinpoint. However, considering Sia''s discography, a song titled
      "That''s Life" could be part of a specific album or release. Given the lack
      of immediate information on a standalone single by this name, it''s possible
      that the reference is to her song from the album "Some People Have Real Problems"
      (2008) or it could be a misunderstanding since Sia has a song called "That''s
      Life" which was actually released as part of a deluxe edition of the album "Some
      People Have Real Problems" or more likely as part of the "Amor Vittae" EP in
      2008, but most notably as part of the "Colour the Small One" sessions, which
      were not officially released in that form but "That''s Life" itself saw a release
      in 2006 on an EP and in 2008 on the aforementioned "Some People Have Real Problems"
      deluxe. However, considering a more popular and recent release, Sia did release
      a song called "That''s Life" in 2021 as part of the "Music" album, which is
      a soundtrack to the movie of the same name.


      Step 3: Given the potential confusion around "That''s Life" by Sia, if we consider
      the 2008 (or 2006 for the EP) release, then "Changing of the Seasons" (2013)
      was released later. If we consider the 2021 release of "That''s Life", then
      "Changing of the Seasons" (2013) was released earlier.


      Since the most straightforward answer without overcomplicating with less known
      releases would consider the known and widely recognized release of "That''s
      Life" in 2008 (or acknowledging the 2021 release which would reverse the comparison),
      and given that "Changing of the Seasons" was released in 2013:

      2. **Compare Release Dates**: Once we have the release dates, we can compare
      them to determine which song was released later.


      Let''s proceed with what we know:


      - **Two Door Cinema Club''s "Changing of the Seasons"**: This song was released
      in 2013.

      - **Sia''s "That''s Life"**: This song, featuring Mac Miller (from the deluxe
      edition of her album "Some People Have Real Problems"), was not found in my
      initial search. However, considering Sia has released many songs, it''s possible
      this is a lesser-known track or a misremembered title. For the sake of this
      exercise, let''s assume "That''s Life" refers to a song that might have been
      released around or before 2013, given Sia''s discography up to that point.


      Given the potential confusion with Sia''s song title, let''s correct the approach
      with more accurate information:


      - Sia has released several albums and singles, but a specific song titled "That''s
      Life" isn''t widely recognized among her popular discography. However, she does
      have a song titled "That''s Life" which is part of the "Some People Have REAL
      Problems" album, released in 2008.


      Now, comparing the release dates:


      - "Changing of the Seasons" by Two Door Cinema Club was released in 2013.

      - "That''s Life" by Sia, if considering the one from "Some People Have REAL
      Problems," was released in 2008.


      Based on this information, since "Changing of the Seasons" was released in 2013
      and "That''s Life" (if the song in question) was released in 2008, "Changing
      of the Seasons" was indeed released later than "That''s Life."

      Cinema Club''s "Changing of the Seasons" was released later than Sia''s "That''s
      Life" is **NO**.'
    d752b1bf-1dbb-4829-9eaa-994ab9720528: "To answer this question, we need to determine\
      \ the release dates of both songs and compare them.\n\n1. **Identify the songs\
      \ and artists**: The songs in question are \"Changing of the Seasons\" by Two\
      \ Door Cinema Club and \"That's Life\" by Sia.\n\n2. **Find the release dates**:\n\
      \   - \"Changing of the Seasons\" by Two Door Cinema Club was released in 2013.\n\
      \   - \"That's Life\" by Sia is not a widely recognized single from her popular\
      \ discography, but considering Sia's popular releases, we can look at her overall\
      \ discography. However, \"That's Life\" could be confused with the classic song\
      \ by Frank Sinatra or be a lesser-known track. Assuming it's a lesser-known\
      \ or not widely released song by Sia, we'll consider her active years and notable\
      \ releases. Sia has been active since the late 1990s, with significant releases\
      \ in the 2010s, including \"1000 Forms of Fear\" in 2014, which includes hits\
      \ like \"Chandelier.\"\n\n3. **Comparison**: Without the exact release date\
      \ of Sia's \"That's Life,\" we can look at the broader context. Given that \"\
      Changing of the Seasons\" was released in 2013 and considering Sia's discography,\
      \ if \"That's Life\" was indeed a lesser-known or non-major release from before\
      \ 2013, then \"Changing of the Seasons\" would be released later. However, if\
      \ \"That's Life\" is considered from her more recent or less popular works without\
      \ specific release dates, we might not have a clear-cut answer without more\
      \ information.\n\nGiven the likely scenario and assuming \"That's Life\" by\
      \ Sia is not a major, well-documented release in the same timeframe as \"Changing\
      \ of the Seasons\" (or assuming it could be from an earlier period of her career),\
      \ the question's context implies \"Changing of the Seasons\" would be later\
      \ than a potentially earlier or less-documented Sia release.\n\nTherefore, based\
      \ on the information provided and general knowledge about these artists, the\
      \ answer would likely be **YES**, considering the release of \"Changing of the\
      \ Seasons\" in 2013 and the potential earlier release or lesser-known status\
      \ of \"That's Life\" by Sia. However, without a precise release date for \"\

    ed1afa1a-4ee6-4c7a-b2b5-d7b460d0b203: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the release dates of both "Changing of the Seasons" by Two Door Cinema Club
      and "That''s Life" by Sia.


      1. **Identify the release date of "Changing of the Seasons" by Two Door Cinema
      Club**: This song was released in 2013.


      2. **Identify the release date of "That''s Life" by Sia**: Sia''s song "That''s
      Life" was part of the album "Some People Have Real Problems" which was released
      in 2008, but it appears there might be some confusion. Sia did have a song titled
      "That''s Life" but it seems to be more commonly associated with her 2020 soundtrack
      for the movie "Music". However, without more specific details, assuming "That''s
      Life" refers to a general release by Sia, we have to consider her most well-known
      work with this title or similar.


      Given these considerations:

      - "Changing of the Seasons" by Two Door Cinema Club was released in 2013.

      - If we consider "That''s Life" by Sia as part of her general discography without
      a specific, well-known release date matching this title before 2013 (and acknowledging
      the potential for confusion with her 2020 work), we would generally consider
      her earlier work for comparison.


      However, since Sia does have a song titled "That''s Life" but it might not be
      as directly comparable due to potential release date discrepancies or the song
      not being as widely recognized under this title in her early work, the crucial
      point is the release year of "Changing of the Seasons" (2013) and whether Sia
      had a notable release of "That''s Life" before this.


      Given the potential confusion and assuming the most straightforward interpretation
      where "That''s Life" could refer to Sia''s work in a general sense, but without
      a clear, specific release date before 2013 that matches this query directly:

      - If Sia''s "That''s Life" (in any of its forms) was released before 2013, then
      "Changing of the Seasons" was released later.

      - If there''s no clear "That''s Life" by Sia before 2013, or if it was released
      in or after 2013, then "Changing of the Seasons" was not necessarily released
      later than Sia''s version.


      Considering the most likely scenario based on available data and the query''s
      nature:

      - Two Door Cinema Club''s "Changing of the Seasons" was released in 2013.

      - Without a clear, earlier release of Sia''s "That''s Life" that is widely recognized
      before 2013 (and noting the possibility of it being part of her 2020 work, which
      would be later), the direct comparison hinges on the exact release date of Sia''s
      song.


      However, considering Sia did release music before 2013, including "Some People
      Have Real Problems" in 2008, but not explicitly a well-documented song titled
      "That''s Life" that matches the query''s timeframe directly:

      - The song "That''s Life" as it pertains to Sia might not have a clear, direct
      release date that predates 2013, especially if we''re considering a song with
      this exact title.


      Given these considerations and the direct question:

      - If we accept that "That''s Life" by Sia could refer to any of her works but
      don''t have a clear release before 2013 that matches this title, then "Changing
      of the Seasons" by Two Door Cinema Club, released in 2013, would be later than
      any of Sia''s works before this date but not necessarily later than a non-specified
      or less recognized release of "That''s Life" by Sia.


      However, the question''s nature and available data suggest:

      - "Changing of the Seasons" was released in 2013.

      - Without a clear, earlier "That''s Life" release by Sia that matches the query,
      the comparison relies on the assumption of "That''s Life" being part of Sia''s
      pre-2013 discography, which isn''t directly clarified.


      Therefore, considering the release date of "Changing of the Seasons" and the
      potential for "That''s Life" by Sia to have been released in various forms but
      not clearly before 2013 under this title in a widely recognized manner:

      - The answer to whether "Changing of the Seasons" was released later than Sia''s
      "That''s Life" depends on the specific release date of Sia''s song, which isn''t
      clearly defined in the query.


      But, to provide a direct answer based on the most straightforward interpretation
      and available data:

      - Given the information and assuming "That''s Life" could refer to Sia''s work
      in a general sense without a clear, specific release date before 2013 that matches
      this query directly, the most likely scenario based on typical release patterns
      and the data provided would suggest "Changing of the Seasons" was indeed released
      later than any preceding work by Sia that could be considered under the title
      "That''s Life", especially if we''re comparing to her earlier, well-documented
      releases.


      Thus, the answer, considering the need for a clear YES or NO and the potential
      for "That''s Life" to be part of Sia''s earlier work or a less recognized release,
      would lean towards acknowledging the release of "Changing of the Seasons" in
      2013 as being later than any of Sia''s preceding work, given the lack of specific
      information to the contrary.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Release Year of Godsmack''s "Speak":** First, we need to find
      out when Godsmack''s song "Speak" was released. After checking, I found that
      "Speak" is a song by Godsmack, from their album "IV", which was released in
      2006.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of Lars Vaular''s "Kem Kan Eg Ringe":** Next,
      we need to determine the release year of Lars Vaular''s song "Kem kan eg ringe".
      Lars Vaular is a Norwegian rapper, and after looking up his discography, I found
      that "Kem kan eg ringe" is a song from his album "D''e glede", which was released
      in 2007, but more specifically, the song itself could have been released as
      a single in the same year or possibly later. However, given the context, it''s
      reasonable to consider the album release year as a benchmark.


      3. **Compare the Release Years:** Now, we compare the release years. Godsmack''s
      "Speak" was released in 2006, and Lars Vaular''s "Kem kan eg ringe" was associated
      with an album released in 2007.


      Given these steps, since "Kem kan eg ringe" was released in 2007, which is after
      the release of "Speak" in 2006, the answer to whether Godsmack''s "Speak" was
      released later than Lars Vaular''s "Kem kan eg ringe" is:

      2. **Identify the Release Date of "Kem kan eg ringe" by Lars Vaular**: Lars
      Vaular is a Norwegian rapper. To find the release date of "Kem kan eg ringe",
      we need specific information about this song. However, without direct access
      to databases or specific knowledge about Lars Vaular''s discography, we can
      consider that Lars Vaular''s music career started in the late 2000s. "Kem kan

      began.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Godsmack''s "Speak" was released in 1998, if "Kem

      released later than Lars Vaular''s "Kem kan eg ringe", let''s break down the
      steps:


      1. **Identify the Release Date of Godsmack''s "Speak"**: Godsmack is an American
      rock band, and "Speak" is one of their songs. To proceed, we need the release
      date of "Speak". Assuming "Speak" is part of an album, we need to identify which
      album it is from. Godsmack has several albums, but one of their most popular
      albums is "IV", released in 2006. Let''s assume "Speak" is from this album for
      the sake of this exercise, which would mean it was released in 2006 or around
      that time.


      2. **Identify the Release Date of Lars Vaular''s "Kem kan eg ringe"**: Lars
      Vaular is a Norwegian rapper. To compare release dates, we need to know when
      "Kem kan eg ringe" was released. Without specific information on this song,
      we''d ideally look for the release date of the album it''s from or any singles
      release information. However, for the sake of this exercise, let''s proceed
      with the understanding that we''re comparing the two based on available data.


      3. **Comparison**: Without exact release dates for both songs, we can''t directly
      compare them. However, if we had the release dates, we would simply compare
      them to determine which was released later.


      Given the lack of specific information on the release dates of both "Speak"
      by Godsmack and "Kem kan eg ringe" by Lars Vaular in the question, I''ll proceed
      with a general approach:


      - If "Speak" was released after "Kem kan eg ringe", the answer would be YES.

      - If "Speak" was released before or at the same time as "Kem kan eg ringe",
      the answer would be NO.


      Since I don''t have the exact release dates, I''ll make a general assumption
      based on the release of Godsmack''s album "IV" in 2006 and the fact that Lars
      Vaular has been active since the early 2000s, potentially releasing music around
      the same time or earlier.


      Given the steps and assumptions, without exact dates, it''s challenging to provide
      a definitive YES or NO. However, for the purpose of this exercise, I will provide
      an answer based on the assumption that Godsmack''s "IV" album ( potentially
      containing "Speak") was released in 2006, and considering Lars Vaular''s activity

      by the Scottish synth-pop band Chvrches, from their second studio album, "Every
      Open Eye". The album was released on September 25, 2015. Although the exact
      date of the single "Bury It" might be different, it was part of the promotional
      campaign for the album, which started in 2015.


      2. **Identify the Release Date of "All That''s Left Is Love" by Angels & Airwaves**:
      Angels & Airwaves released "All That''s Left Is Love" on April 16, 2020, as
      part of their promotional campaign for their sixth studio album, "Lifeforms",
      though the album itself was released later.

      , which was released on September 4, 2012. However, \"Tiptoe\" itself might\
      \ have been released as part of an EP or earlier, but considering the album\
      \ release, we have a reference point of 2012.\n\n3. **Becky G - Mang\xFA**:\
      \ Becky G released \"Mang\xFA\" in 2016. This is a later date than the 2012\
      \ reference point for Imagine Dragons' \"Tiptoe\".\n\n4. **Comparison**: Since\

      \ popular albums and singles, but without the exact details of \"Tiptoe,\" it's\
      \ challenging to proceed accurately.\n\n- **Becky G's \"Mang\xFA\"**: Becky\
      \ G is known for her song \"Mang\xFA,\" which is a popular track. However, without\

      \ Imagine Dragons.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information on \"Tiptoe\" by\
      \ Imagine Dragons and assuming \"Mang\xFA\" by Becky G was released as part\
      \ of her known discography, we can attempt to make an educated guess. However,\
      \ without exact release dates, any answer would be speculative.\n\nSince we\
      \ cannot accurately confirm the release dates of both songs due to the lack\
      \ of clear information on \"Tiptoe\" by Imagine Dragons, providing a definitive\
      \ YES or NO answer based on the required steps is challenging. \n\nHowever,\
      \ considering the constraints and the need to provide an answer based on the\
      \ information typically available:\n\nGiven the steps and the typical approach\
      \ to such questions, if we had to make an educated guess based on available\
      \ data (and acknowledging that \"Tiptoe\" does not appear to be a well-documented\
      \ song by Imagine Dragons), we might lean towards saying that without clear\
      \ evidence of \"Tiptoe\" being released, it's hard to compare. But since the\
      \ question demands a YES or NO answer and considering typical music release\

      these steps:


      1. **Identify the Release Date of David Bisbal''s "Silencio"**: First, we need
      to find out when "Silencio" by David Bisbal was released. David Bisbal is a
      Spanish singer, and his music often is released in Spanish-speaking countries.
      Without the exact date, we cannot proceed, but we can look it up. After a quick
      lookup, it appears that David Bisbal has released several songs and albums,
      but without more specific information, it''s challenging to pinpoint the exact
      release date of "Silencio" without knowing the album or context. However, for
      the sake of this exercise, let''s assume we found that "Silencio" is part of
      an album or release that can be dated.


      2. **Identify the Release Date of The Breeders''s "Wait in the Car"**: Next,
      we need to find out when "Wait in the Car" by The Breeders was released. The
      Breeders are an American alternative rock band. "Wait in the Car" is a known
      single from their 2018 album "All Nerve". Thus, "Wait in the Car" was released
      in 2018.


      3. **Compare the Release Dates**: Now, we compare the release dates of both
      songs to determine which one was released later. Without the specific release
      date of "Silencio", we cannot directly compare. However, knowing that "Wait
      in the Car" was released in 2018, if "Silencio" was released after 2018, then
      the answer would be YES. If "Silencio" was released before 2018, the answer
      would be NO.


      Given the information available and assuming we''re considering a general context
      where specific release dates for "Silencio" are not provided, we cannot accurately
      determine the release date of "Silencio" to make a direct comparison. However,
      for the purpose of this exercise and without specific details on "Silencio"''s
      release, let''s proceed with a hypothetical assumption based on typical music
      release patterns and the fact that we''re trying to solve this with given steps:


      If we assume "Silencio" by David Bisbal could have been released at any point,
      and considering The Breeders''s "Wait in the Car" was released in 2018, without
      the exact date of "Silencio", we cannot definitively say. But if we must choose
      based on the steps provided and the information typically available, the comparison
      hinges on the release date of "Silencio".


      Given the nature of the question and the need for a direct answer, and without
      specific information on "Silencio"''s release date, I must emphasize the importance
      of accurate data for a precise answer. However, since the question format demands
      a YES or NO answer and we''re proceeding with a logical deduction based on the
      information given (and the acknowledgment that we''re missing a specific release

      these steps:


      1. **Identify the Release Year of David Bisbal''s "Silencio"**: First, we need
      to determine when David Bisbal''s song "Silencio" was released. After researching,
      I found that David Bisbal is a Spanish singer, and while he has released many
      songs, I couldn''t find a specific release date for a song titled "Silencio"
      without more context. However, for the sake of this exercise, let''s assume
      we found that it was released after 2000, as David Bisbal''s career started
      in the early 2000s.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of The Breeders''s "Wait in the Car"**: Next,
      we need to find out when The Breeders released "Wait in the Car". The Breeders
      are an American alternative rock band. After checking, "Wait in the Car" is
      a song from their 2018 album "All Nerve". Therefore, "Wait in the Car" was released
      in 2018.


      3. **Compare the Release Years**: Now, we compare the release years of both
      songs to determine which one was released later. Assuming David Bisbal''s "Silencio"
      was released sometime after 2000 but before 2018 (since we don''t have an exact
      year for "Silencio"), and knowing The Breeders''s "Wait in the Car" was released
      in 2018, we can conclude that "Wait in the Car" was released later than "Silencio"
      if "Silencio" was indeed released before 2018.


      Given these steps and the assumption about the release year of "Silencio" (since
      the exact date wasn''t specified), the answer to whether David Bisbal''s "Silencio"
      was released later than The Breeders''s "Wait in the Car" is:

      \ find the release dates of both songs. \n   - Jessica Sutta's \"Show Me\" release\
      \ date needs to be identified.\n   - Kygo's \"The Truth\" release date needs\
      \ to be identified.\n\n2. **Compare Release Dates**: Once we have the release\
      \ dates, we compare them to determine which song was released later.\n\nGiven\
      \ the process, without the actual release dates provided in the question or\
      \ access to real-time data, I'll simulate the thought process based on hypothetical\
      \ dates for illustration:\n\n- Let's hypothetically say Jessica Sutta's \"Show\
      \ Me\" was released in 2011.\n- And let's say Kygo's \"The Truth\" was released\
      \ in 2020.\n\nBased on these hypothetical dates:\n- Since 2020 is later than\
      \ 2011, Kygo's \"The Truth\" would be the song released later.\n\nHowever, without\
      \ actual release dates or access to current data, I must rely on general knowledge\

      \nGiven the lack of specific information about the release dates of Jessica\

      \ need to look up the release dates to provide an accurate YES or NO answer.\
      \ Since I cannot access real-time data or databases directly and no specific\
      \ dates were provided, I'll proceed based on the assumption that the question\
      \ implies I should know or find a way to determine the answer based on general\
      \ knowledge or inference, which is not possible without more information.\n\n\

      Kygo has released many songs, but one of his earliest hits was "Firestone" in

      1. **Identify the Release Dates**: The first step is to identify the release
      dates of both songs: "Peachy" by Missy Higgins and "When the Bassline Drops"
      by Big Narstie.


      2. **Missy Higgins - Peachy**: After researching, I found that Missy Higgins
      released "Peachy" in 2007. It was part of her album "On a Clear Night".


      3. **Big Narstie - When the Bassline Drops**: Big Narstie''s song "When the
      Bassline Drops" (feat. Craig David) was released in 2015.


      4. **Compare Release Dates**: Now, comparing the release dates, "Peachy" by
      Missy Higgins was released in 2007, and "When the Bassline Drops" by Big Narstie
      was released in 2015.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since 2007 is earlier than 2015, "Peachy" was released before
      "When the Bassline Drops".


      Given this analysis, the answer to whether Missy Higgins''s "Peachy" was released
      later than Big Narstie''s "When the Bassline Drops" is: **NO**.'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Release Dates**: We need to find the release dates of both
      "Peachy" by Missy Higgins and "When the Bassline Drops" by Big Narstie.


      2. **Missy Higgins - Peachy**: Missy Higgins is an Australian singer-songwriter
      known for her folk-pop music. After researching, it appears that "Peachy" is
      indeed a song by Missy Higgins, but specific details like its release date as
      a single might not be readily available without more context. Missy Higgins
      has released several albums and singles over the years, so without a specific
      album or release context, pinpointing the exact release date of "Peachy" could
      be challenging. However, Missy Higgins has been active since the early 2000s.


      3. **Big Narstie - When the Bassline Drops**: Big Narstie is a British grime
      MC. "When the Bassline Drops" is a song by Big Narstie, featuring Craig David.
      It was released in 2015.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that "When the Bassline Drops" was released in 2015,
      to determine if "Peachy" was released later, we need a precise release date
      for "Peachy". Without this specific information, we can''t directly compare
      the two. However, knowing Missy Higgins'' career started earlier and has been
      ongoing, if "Peachy" was part of her earlier work (pre-2015), it would have
      been released before "When the Bassline Drops". If it was released after 2015,
      then it would be later.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific release date information for "Peachy"
      by Missy Higgins in the question and assuming "Peachy" could be part of her
      earlier discography (given her career spans back to the early 2000s), it''s
      reasonable to consider that "Peachy" might have been released before 2015. However,
      without the exact release date, this is speculative.


      Given the information typically available and the process of deduction, if we
      consider Missy Higgins'' general timeline and the fact that "When the Bassline
      Drops" was released in 2015, the most likely scenario based on available data
      would suggest "Peachy" was released earlier, assuming it''s part of her earlier
      work. Therefore, the answer to whether "Peachy" was released later than "When
      the Bassline Drops" would likely be "NO", based on the assumption that "Peachy"
      is part of Missy Higgins'' earlier discography. However, this conclusion is
      drawn with the caveat that the exact release date of "Peachy" is not specified.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      2. **Research "Ash''s Candy"**: "Ash''s Candy" is a song, but without specific
      context, it might be hard to pinpoint the exact artist or release date. However,
      assuming it refers to a known song, we would look up its release date.


      3. **Research "BTSTU" by Jai Paul**: "BTSTU" is a song by British songwriter
      and record producer Jai Paul. It was unofficially released in 2010 but gained
      popularity and was officially released in 2011.

      Given the lack of specific information on "Ash''s Candy" in the question, let''s

      - Assuming "Ash''s Candy" refers to a song that might not be as widely recognized
      or documented as "BTSTU," without a specific release date, it''s challenging
      to directly compare.

      - However, considering Jai Paul''s "BTSTU" had an unofficial release in 2010
      and an official one in 2011, for "Ash''s Candy" to be released later, it would
      need to be released after 2011.


      Without the exact release date of "Ash''s Candy," we cannot accurately determine
      the answer based solely on the information provided. However, since the question
      requires a YES or NO answer, and given that "BTSTU" has a well-documented release
      history, if "Ash''s Candy" is a song that was indeed released, and assuming
      it''s a known song released after 2011, the answer could potentially be YES.

      the information gap regarding "Ash''s Candy," the most informed response based
      on the step-by-step analysis and the requirement for a clear YES or NO would
      have to consider the typical context and available data on such songs. However,
      without explicit release dates for "Ash''s Candy," any answer would be speculative.

      or later.


      Given the lack of specific information about The Kinks''s song "Monica", it''s
      challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO answer. However, based on the

      by The Kinks was released. However, after conducting research, it appears that
      The Kinks did not have a well-known song called "Monica". It''s possible there
      might be some confusion with the song title or the artist. The Kinks did have
      many hits, but without a specific release date for a song named "Monica", it''s
      challenging to compare directly.


      Given the lack of information on a song by The Kinks titled "Monica", and assuming
      "Monica" might not be a recognized or released song by The Kinks, or it could

      does not exist or is not a recognized title, we can''t definitively say "Hitch
      Hike" was released later. Therefore, the answer would lean towards NO, primarily

      proceed with the assumption that "Monica" refers to a lesser-known track or
      possibly a misremembered title).


      1. **Identify Marvin Gaye''s "Hitch Hike" Release Date**: Marvin Gaye''s song
      "Hitch Hike" was released in 1962.


      2. **Identify The Kinks''s "Monica" Release Date**: After researching, it appears
      there might be confusion with the song title "Monica" by The Kinks, as they

      for hits like "You Really Got Me," "All Day and All of the Night," "Tired of
      Waiting for You," "Lola," and many others, but "Monica" does not appear to be
      a recognized title among their discography. However, for the sake of argument,

      3. **Comparison**: Without a clear release date for "Monica" by The Kinks due
      to the song not being widely recognized or possibly misnamed, we cannot directly
      compare the release dates. However, considering Marvin Gaye''s "Hitch Hike"
      was released in 1962, if "Monica" by The Kinks were released before 1962, the
      answer would be NO. If it were released after 1962, the answer would be YES.

      a lesser-known or misidentified song, the most straightforward approach is to
      consider the known release date of "Hitch Hike" and the lack of clear information
      on "Monica."

      by Pink Floyd was released in 1979. If we were to compare it with the actual
      release date of "Something There" from "Beauty and the Beast", which is 1991,
      it''s clear that "One of My Turns" was released before "Something There".


      4. **Conclusion**: Since "One of My Turns" was released in 1979 and "Something
      There" (from the correct context of "Beauty and the Beast") was released in
      1991, "One of My Turns" was indeed released earlier than "Something There".


      Given this analysis, the answer to whether "One of My Turns" was released later
      than "Something There" is **NO**.'

      the featuring artist as Bobby V), from the soundtrack of the movie "Get Rich
      or Die Tryin''". The soundtrack was released in 2005, and since "Thug Love"
      is not a track on 50 Cent''s major studio albums like "Get Rich or Die Tryin''"
      (2003) or "The Massacre" (2005), we consider its release in the context of the
      soundtrack or as a single, which aligns with 2005.


      2. **Identify the release year of "Without You" by Hinder**: "Without You" is
      a song by the American rock band Hinder, from their album "Extreme Behavior".
      This album was released in 2005.


      Given these steps, both songs were essentially released in the same year, 2005.
      However, to give a definitive answer to whether "Thug Love" was released later
      than "Without You", we need to consider the exact dates of release for each
      song or, more accurately, their respective albums since specific single release
      dates might not be as readily available or could vary by country.


      - **"Get Rich or Die Tryin''" soundtrack (featuring "Thug Love")**: Released
      on November 8, 2005.

      - **"Extreme Behavior" (featuring "Without You")**: Released on September 27,
      2005.


      Based on this information:


      "Thug Love" was released later than "Without You" because the soundtrack for
      "Get Rich or Die Tryin''" came out on November 8, 2005, and "Extreme Behavior"
      was released on September 27, 2005.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      \ - Without the specific release date for \"Thug Love\", we can't directly compare.\
      \ However, 50 Cent's debut album \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" was released in\
      \ 2003, which includes some of his most popular tracks. If \"Thug Love\" is\

      \ \"Thug Love\" if it's an early or lesser-known track, could have been released\

      the release dates of the two songs: "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington and "Summer
      Days" (assuming featuring Macklemore & Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, as part
      of the collaborative single) by Patrick Stump, among possibly other collaborations.


      1. **Identify the Songs**: First, we need to identify the exact songs. "Hey
      Girl" is a song by American country music artist Billy Currington. "Summer Days"
      is a song that could potentially involve Patrick Stump in a collaboration, though
      it''s less commonly associated directly with him as a solo artist; it''s more
      famously known as a collaboration between Macklemore, Ryan Lewis, and featuring
      Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, or in another version by DJ Jazzy Jeff and The
      Fresh Prince.


      2. **Release Date of "Hey Girl"**: Billy Currington''s "Hey Girl" was released
      in 2013.


      3. **Release Date of "Summer Days"**: There are multiple songs with the title
      "Summer Days", so it''s crucial to identify the one featuring Patrick Stump.
      However, assuming we''re talking about the most well-known version featuring
      Macklemore and Patrick Stump, the release date for Macklemore & Ryan Lewis''s
      "Summer Days" isn''t as clear without specifying the exact collaboration. But
      a notable song "Summer Days" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis featuring Patrick Stump
      doesn''t seem to directly match. Another song, "Summer Days" by DJ Jazzy Jeff
      & The Fresh Prince, was released much earlier. Without the exact match, it''s
      hard to proceed, but given the common association of "Summer Days" with Macklemore
      and considering other versions, we might be looking at different release windows.


      4. **Macklemore & Ryan Lewis''s Version**: Assuming the confusion and focusing
      on a well-known "Summer Days" song, if we consider the collaboration that might
      involve Patrick Stump, we''d look into songs around the 2010s. Macklemore &
      Ryan Lewis''s album "The Heist" (2012) doesn''t have a song titled "Summer Days"
      but features hits like "Thrift Shop". Without the exact song details, the precise
      release date for a Patrick Stump collaboration on "Summer Days" isn''t straightforward.
      However, given the context, it seems we might be dealing with a mix-up or less
      known tracks.


      5. **Decision**: Given the lack of clarity on the "Summer Days" song directly
      associated with Patrick Stump and considering Billy Currington''s "Hey Girl"
      was released in 2013, without a clear release date for the specific "Summer
      Days" song featuring Patrick Stump, it''s challenging to make a direct comparison.
      If we were to consider a hypothetical or less known "Summer Days" featuring
      Patrick Stump released before 2013, then "Hey Girl" would indeed be released
      later. But without the exact information on the "Summer Days" song in question,
      the most straightforward comparison suggests that if "Summer Days" was part
      of a known release before 2013, "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington would be later.


      **Given the ambiguity but focusing on the process of deduction**: If we had
      a clear "Summer Days" song featuring Patrick Stump before 2013, then the answer
      would lean towards YES, Billy Currington''s "Hey Girl" was released later than
      that specific version of "Summer Days". However, the confusion around the exact
      song makes this a challenging question without more specific details.


      **Final Answer**: YES'
    3ac35a1a-ac35-4baa-b362-a2f52aa4b720: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the release dates of both "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington and "Summer Days" by
      Patrick Stump.


      Step 1: Find the release date of "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington.

      After checking, I found that "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington was released in
      2013.


      Step 2: Find the release date of "Summer Days" (also known as "Summer Days (feat.
      Macklemore & Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy)")  by Patrick Stump (as part of
      a collaboration).

      I found that "Summer Days" was released in 2019 as part of a collaboration between
      Martin Garrix, Macklemore, and Patrick Stump.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      Since "Hey Girl" was released in 2013 and "Summer Days" was released in 2019,
      it means that "Hey Girl" was released earlier than "Summer Days".


      Based on the steps above, the answer is:

      NO'

      1. **Identify the Release Date of "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington**: "Hey Girl"

    a7a0c4ea-f294-4118-bf30-736f243adc41: 'To answer this question, I need to find
      out the release dates of the two songs: "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington and "Summer
      Days" (assuming it''s a song by Patrick Stump, the lead vocalist of Fall Out
      Boy, possibly as a solo or collaborative work).


      First, let''s look at "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington. Billy Currington is a
      country music artist, and "Hey Girl" is indeed one of his songs. According to
      various music sources, "Hey Girl" was released in 2013.


      Next, I need to find information on "Summer Days" by Patrick Stump. Patrick
      Stump, as mentioned, is known for being part of Fall Out Boy, but he has also
      worked on solo material. After checking, it appears that Patrick Stump did release
      a song or music that could be associated with the title "Summer Days," but specific
      details about a song with this exact title and its release date are not immediately
      clear without more context. However, considering Patrick Stump''s solo work,
      his debut solo album "Soul Punk" was released in 2011, which is before "Hey
      Girl" by Billy Currington.


      Given this information, if we consider the release of Patrick Stump''s solo
      work or any collaborative/project work that might include a song titled "Summer
      Days" around or before 2011, it suggests that "Summer Days" (if it was released
      in this context) would have been released before "Hey Girl."


      Therefore, based on the release dates and the assumption that "Summer Days"
      refers to a project or song by Patrick Stump released around the time of his
      solo work or earlier, the answer to whether "Hey Girl" was released later than
      "Summer Days" would be YES.'

      1. **Identify the Release Year of Billy Currington''s "Hey Girl":** First, we
      need to find out when "Hey Girl" by Billy Currington was released. After checking,
      we find that "Hey Girl" was released in 2009.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of Patrick Stump''s "Summer Days":** Next, we
      need to determine when "Summer Days" by Patrick Stump was released. Upon investigation,
      it appears that Patrick Stump, formerly of Fall Out Boy, released his solo album
      "Soul Punk" in 2011, which includes a song titled "Allie". However, specific
      information on a song titled "Summer Days" by Patrick Stump is not readily available,
      suggesting it might not be a well-known or released track under that exact title
      by Patrick Stump. For the sake of argument and without specific information,
      let''s consider the possibility that it might have been released, but we cannot
      confirm its release year due to lack of information.


      3. **Compare Release Years:** Given that we have confirmed "Hey Girl" by Billy
      Currington was released in 2009, and without a confirmed release for "Summer
      Days" by Patrick Stump, we cannot definitively compare their release years.
      However, if "Summer Days" by Patrick Stump does not have a confirmed release,
      especially considering Patrick Stump''s known solo work started being released
      around 2011, it''s plausible that if "Summer Days" exists, it could have been
      released later than 2009.


      4. **Conclusion:** Since we cannot confirm the release of "Summer Days" by Patrick
      Stump but know that Billy Currington''s "Hey Girl" was released in 2009, and
      considering the context that Patrick Stump''s known solo music career started
      after 2009, if "Summer Days" was indeed released, it would likely have been
      after 2009. Thus, based on available information and logical deduction, the
      answer to whether "Hey Girl" was released later than "Summer Days" is NO, because
      "Hey Girl" was released in 2009, and there''s no evidence to suggest "Summer
      Days" by Patrick Stump was released before that.

      \ was released on the \"Young, Fly & Flashy, Vol. 1\" compilation, on 3 July\
      \ 2001, but \"The Party Continues\" track itself, was actually part of \"Young,\

      s\xF3li\"**: Sigur R\xF3s's song \"Gl\xF3s\xF3li\" is from their album \"Takk...\"\
      , which was released on September 12, 2005. \"Gl\xF3s\xF3li\" itself was also\
      \ released as a single in 2005.\n\n4. **Compare the release dates**: Now we\

      \ Dupri's \"The Party Continues\":** First, we need to find out when Jermaine\
      \ Dupri released \"The Party Continues\". Jermaine Dupri is known for his work\
      \ with various artists, and \"The Party Continues\" could refer to a specific\
      \ song or album. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint\

      \ we look for the release date of Sigur R\xF3s's \"Gl\xF3s\xF3li\". Sigur R\xF3\
      s is an Icelandic post-rock band, and \"Gl\xF3s\xF3li\" is a track from their\
      \ 2005 album \"Takk...\". Therefore, \"Gl\xF3s\xF3li\" was released in 2005\
      \ as part of the \"Takk...\" album.\n\n3. **Compare the Release Dates:** Assuming\
      \ we found that Jermaine Dupri's \"The Party Continues\" has a specific release\
      \ year, we would compare this year to 2005, the release year of Sigur R\xF3\
      s's \"Gl\xF3s\xF3li\". If \"The Party Continues\" was released after 2005, then\
      \ the answer would be YES. If it was released in 2005 or before, the answer\
      \ would be NO.\n\nGiven the information and the process:\n- Sigur R\xF3s's \"\
      Gl\xF3s\xF3li\" was released in 2005.\n- Without the exact release date of Jermaine\
      \ Dupri's \"The Party Continues\", we cannot definitively compare. However,\
      \ for the purpose of this question and based on typical music release patterns,\
      \ if we were to find that \"The Party Continues\" was released after 2005, the\
      \ answer would be straightforward.\n\nSince the actual release date of Jermaine\
      \ Dupri's \"The Party Continues\" is not provided, let's resolve the question\
      \ based on a general assumption that might not align with the actual facts due\
      \ to missing information. If \"The Party Continues\" by Jermaine Dupri was indeed\
      \ released later than 2005, then the answer would be YES. However, without confirming\
      \ the release date of \"The Party Continues\", this answer involves an assumption.\n\
      \nGiven the constraints and the need for a definitive YES or NO answer without\
      \ the specific release date of \"The Party Continues\", and considering typical\
      \ release patterns and the fact that \"Gl\xF3s\xF3li\" is from 2005, a precise\
      \ answer cannot be provided without further information. However, to follow\
      \ the instruction for a YES or NO answer and assuming \"The Party Continues\"\

      First, let''s find the release date of Mike Oldfield''s "In High Places". After
      researching, I found that "In High Places" is a song by Mike Oldfield, featuring
      John Anderson on vocals, from the album "Crises" released in 1983.


      Next, let''s find the release date of Rick Astley''s "The Ones You Love". After

      compilations, and as a single in some countries, but I couldn''t find information
      that it was part of any of his first two albums.


      Since "In High Places" was released in 1983 and "The Ones You Love" in 1991
      or 1992, we can conclude that "In High Places" was released before "The Ones
      You Love".

      Astley is known for his hit "Never Gonna Give You Up", but "The Ones You Love"

      Astley released an album called "Free" in 1996, but specific details about a

      database. However, given the context, it''s likely referring to a song or project
      that occurred after Astley''s initial rise to fame in the late 1980s.


      3. **Compare Release Years**: If "In High Places" by Mike Oldfield was released
      in 1983 and assuming "The Ones You Love" by Rick Astley was released sometime
      after Astley''s rise to fame (which started in the late 1980s), then "In High
      Places" would indeed have been released earlier than "The Ones You Love".

      - **In High Places** was released in 1983.

      - Assuming **The Ones You Love** was part of Astley''s work after his rise to

    7a1a4ff4-7eb8-4f18-9fb6-bee5b427b00b: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of Mike Oldfield''s "In High Places":** This
      song is from Mike Oldfield''s album "Islands", which was released in 1987.


      2. **Identify the release date of Rick Astley''s "The Ones You Love":** Rick
      Astley is known for his hit "Never Gonna Give You Up", but "The Ones You Love"
      seems less common. After checking, it appears that "The Ones You Love" might
      not be a well-documented single by Rick Astley. However, considering Rick Astley''s
      active period and the release of his debut album "Whenever You Need Somebody"
      in 1987, and his follow-up album "Hold Me in Your Arms" in 1988, we can infer
      that if "The Ones You Love" is indeed a song by Rick Astley, it would likely
      have been released around this time frame.


      Given the information available:

      - Mike Oldfield''s "In High Places" was released in 1987 as part of the album
      "Islands".

      - If "The Ones You Love" is a song by Rick Astley from his early discography,
      it could have been released around 1987 or 1988, considering his album releases.


      Without the exact release date of "The Ones You Love" by Rick Astley, and assuming
      it falls within the 1987-1988 timeframe based on his known discography, we can
      make an educated guess:


      If "The Ones You Love" was released in 1988, then "In High Places" (1987) was
      released earlier. If "The Ones You Love" was released in 1987, without knowing
      the exact dates within the year, it''s harder to say for certain. However, given
      the general timeframe and assuming both songs could have been released in the
      same year or "The Ones You Love" slightly later, the most likely scenario based
      on available data is that "In High Places" was not released later than "The
      Ones You Love", especially if we consider the possibility of "The Ones You Love"
      being from 1988.


      Given this analysis and the lack of specific information on "The Ones You Love",
      the question''s answer leans towards "NO", indicating "In High Places" was likely
      not released later than "The Ones You Love", assuming the latter was indeed
      released around the same time or slightly after.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'
    9b391f2e-0eec-47df-9257-8b60c01e0605: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify Release Dates**: We need to know the release dates of both "In
      High Places" by Mike Oldfield and "The Ones You Love" by Rick Astley.


      2. **Mike Oldfield''s "In High Places"**: This song was released in 1987. It''s
      part of the album "Islands".


      3. **Rick Astley''s "The Ones You Love"**: This is a bit trickier since Rick
      Astley is more commonly known for his 1987 hit "Never Gonna Give You Up". However,
      after checking, it appears "The Ones You Love" might not be a widely recognized
      single by Rick Astley, which could indicate it''s not his most popular work
      or it might be a less known track. Assuming it exists and is correctly attributed
      to Rick Astley, without a specific release date, it''s hard to proceed directly.
      However, given Rick Astley''s rise to fame was around 1987-1988, if "The Ones
      You Love" is indeed one of his tracks, it likely falls within or around this
      period.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that "In High Places" by Mike Oldfield was released
      in 1987 and assuming "The Ones You Love" by Rick Astley, if it exists and is
      correctly attributed, would likely be around the same time or possibly later
      (considering Astley''s first album was in 1987), we can make an educated guess.


      5. **Conclusion**: Without the exact release date of "The Ones You Love" by
      Rick Astley but knowing the general timeframe of his popularity and the release
      of "In High Places", if "The Ones You Love" was indeed released after 1987 or
      even in the latter part of 1987, "In High Places" could be considered as released
      earlier or at the latest, around the same time.


      Given the lack of precise information on "The Ones You Love" by Rick Astley
      and assuming the question is based on verifiable data, the most direct comparison
      based on available information leans towards "In High Places" being released
      in 1987. If "The Ones You Love" was indeed released after this, the answer would
      be NO. However, without the exact release date for Astley''s song and considering
      the possibility it might have been released in the same year or slightly before,
      the question''s premise might be flawed or based on specific knowledge not widely
      available.


      Given the direct information available and typical release patterns, a definitive
      answer without more specific details on "The Ones You Love" is challenging.
      However, since the question asks for a YES or NO answer:


      **NO**'

      - Gwen Stefani''s "What U Workin'' With??", a collaboration with Calvin Harris,

      the release dates of both songs and compare them.


      First, let''s identify the artists and songs:

      - Billie Piper''s song is "Walk of Life".

      - Gwen Stefani''s song is "What U Workin'' With".


      Next, we need to find the release dates for these songs. After researching,
      I found:

      - Billie Piper released "Walk of Life" in 2000.

      - However, I couldn''t find any information on a song by Gwen Stefani titled
      "What U Workin'' With" that matches the context of being released around the
      same time or before Billie Piper''s "Walk of Life". Gwen Stefani did release
      music with No Doubt and as a solo artist, but this specific title doesn''t seem
      to match any of her well-known or lesser-known releases directly.


      Given the information available and the fact that I couldn''t confirm the existence
      or release date of Gwen Stefani''s "What U Workin'' With", it''s challenging
      to make a direct comparison. However, since the question asks for a YES or NO
      answer regarding whether Billie Piper''s "Walk of Life" was released later than
      Gwen Stefani''s "What U Workin'' With", and without a confirmed release date
      for the latter that predates 2000, we must consider the available data.


      Since I couldn''t find a release date for "What U Workin'' With" by Gwen Stefani,
      and assuming the question implies that both songs exist and are being compared,
      the most logical step would be to say that without evidence of "What U Workin''
      With" being released before "Walk of Life", we cannot conclusively say "Walk
      of Life" was released later. However, this line of reasoning may not directly
      lead to a simple YES or NO without making some assumptions about the intent
      of the question and the existence of Gwen Stefani''s song.


      Given the constraints and aiming to provide a clear YES or NO based on the information
      that Billie Piper''s "Walk of Life" has a known release date and Gwen Stefani''s
      "What U Workin'' With" does not have a confirmed release date that I could find,
      the answer would have to be based on the assumption that the comparison is valid
      and that "What U Workin'' With" exists in a context that makes the question
      relevant.


      Therefore, without a confirmed earlier release date for "What U Workin'' With",
      and considering the need for a YES or NO answer, the logical conclusion based
      on available information would lean towards "NO" because we cannot confirm that
      "Walk of Life" was released later than a song with no found release date. However,
      please note this answer comes with the caveat that the existence or release
      details of "What U Workin'' With" by Gwen Stefani could not be verified.

    94ed2a16-a77d-40d7-9fb1-f54e75d0d349: 'To answer this question, we need to follow
      a few steps:


      1. **Identify the Artists and Their Songs**: Billie Piper is known for her song
      "Walk of Life" (though it''s more commonly associated with Dire Straits, we''ll
      proceed under the assumption there might be a mix-up or a lesser-known version
      by Billie Piper), and Gwen Stefani is known for her work, including potentially
      "What U Workin'' With".


      2. **Correct Identification**: It seems there''s a mix-up in song titles and
      artists. "Walk of Life" is actually a song by Dire Straits, released in 1985.
      Billie Piper, on the other hand, is known for her acting and singing career,
      with hits like "Because We Want To" and "Honey to the Bee". Gwen Stefani has
      had numerous hits, but "What U Workin'' With" does not immediately ring a bell
      as one of her major solo works or with No Doubt.


      3. **Gwen Stefani''s Discography**: Gwen Stefani has released several albums,
      both solo and with No Doubt. A quick check does not reveal a prominent song
      titled "What U Workin'' With" among her well-known discography, suggesting it
      might be a lesser-known track, a collaboration, or possibly not a song by Gwen
      Stefani.


      4. **Billie Piper''s Music Career**: Billie Piper did release music, with her
      debut single "Because We Want To" coming out in 1998. She had a few more releases,
      but "Walk of Life" is not associated with her; it''s a well-known song by Dire
      Straits.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the confusion in song titles and the fact that "Walk
      of Life" is actually by Dire Straits (1985), and without clear evidence of Gwen
      Stefani releasing "What U Workin'' With" as a major or well-documented song,
      it''s challenging to provide a direct comparison. However, since the premise
      of the question seems to be based on incorrect information (Billie Piper''s
      association with "Walk of Life"), we must clarify that "Walk of Life" by Dire
      Straits predates any music releases by Billie Piper.


      Given the mix-up and the incorrect association of "Walk of Life" with Billie
      Piper, and without a clear release date for Gwen Stefani''s "What U Workin''
      With" (as it does not appear to be a well-known song by her), it''s not possible
      to accurately answer the question as intended. However, based on the typical
