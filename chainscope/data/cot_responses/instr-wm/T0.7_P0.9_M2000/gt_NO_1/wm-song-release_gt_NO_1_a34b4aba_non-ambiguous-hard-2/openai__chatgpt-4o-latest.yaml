      2. Identify the release date of Charli XCX''s "Girls."

      3. Compare the two dates to determine which song was released later.


      Step 1: "Elastic Heart" is a song by Sia, featuring The Weeknd and Diplo. It
      was originally released as part of the soundtrack for "The Hunger Games: Catching
      Fire" in 2013. A solo version by Sia was later released as a single in 2015.
      However, Diplo was involved in the original 2013 version.


      Step 2: Charli XCX does not have a well-known song titled "Girls" as the lead
      artist. However, there is a 2018 song titled "Girls" by Rita Ora featuring Cardi
      B, Bebe Rexha, and Charli XCX. Since Charli XCX is featured on that track, we
      can reasonably interpret the question to be referring to this 2018 song.


      Step 3: Compare the two:

      - "Elastic Heart" (Diplo version with The Weeknd and Sia): released in 2013.

      - "Girls" (Rita Ora feat. Charli XCX): released in 2018.

      the release dates of two songs:


      1. "Elastic Heart" by Diplo (note: "Elastic Heart" is primarily known as a song
      by Sia featuring The Weeknd and Diplo).

      2. "Girls" by Charli XCX.


      **Step 1: Determine the release date of "Elastic Heart"**

      - "Elastic Heart" was first released on the soundtrack for "The Hunger Games:
      Catching Fire" on November 15, 2013.

      - It was later included on Sia''s album "1000 Forms of Fear" and released as
      a single in 2015.

      - However, since we''re focusing on Diplo''s involvement, the original version
      in 2013 is what matters.


      **Step 2: Determine the release date of "Girls" by Charli XCX**

      - Charli XCX released a song titled "Girls Night Out" officially in 2018, though
      it had leaked earlier.

      - However, the song "Girls" is more commonly associated with Rita Ora featuring
      Cardi B, Bebe Rexha, and Charli XCX, released on May 11, 2018.

      - "Elastic Heart" (with Diplo) was released in 2013.

      **Step 1: Find the release date of "I''m Down" by The Beatles.**


      - "I''m Down" was released as the B-side to the single "Help!" by The Beatles.

      - The single "Help!" was released on July 19, 1965.


      **Step 2: Find the release date of "Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)"
      by Tanya Tucker.**


      - This song was released as a single in late 1973 and became a hit in 1974.

      - So it was released around December 1973 or early 1974.


      **Step 3: Compare the release dates.**


      - "I''m Down" by The Beatles: July 1965.

      - "Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)" by Tanya Tucker: late 1973/early
      1974.

      the release dates of both songs and compare them.


      **Step 1: Determine the release date of The Cure''s "Never Enough"**

      - "Never Enough" by The Cure was released as a single in 1990.

      - It was part of their remix album "Mixed Up," which also came out in 1990.


      **Step 2: Determine the release date of Marilyn Manson''s "Lunchbox"**

      - "Lunchbox" is a song by Marilyn Manson from their debut album "Portrait of
      an American Family."

      - That album was released in 1994.

      - "Lunchbox" was released as a single in 1995.
