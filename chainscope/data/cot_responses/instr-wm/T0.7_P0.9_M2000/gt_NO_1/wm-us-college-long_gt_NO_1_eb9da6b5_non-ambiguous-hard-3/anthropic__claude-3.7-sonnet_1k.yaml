      University of Central Arkansas is located in Conway, Arkansas. Arkansas is located
      in the south-central United States.


      St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina. North Carolina
      is on the east coast of the United States.


      Geographically speaking, when looking at a map of the United States:

      - Arkansas is to the west of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is to the east of Arkansas

      is in North Carolina, the University of Central Arkansas is located WEST of
      St. Andrews University, not east.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two universities based on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Central Arkansas is in Conway, Arkansas

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - University of Central Arkansas is in Conway, Arkansas (AR)

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative positions east/west.

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: In terms of east-west positioning, states in the US generally follow
      this pattern from west to east:

      - West Coast (CA, OR, WA)

      - Mountain states (NV, ID, MT, WY, UT, CO, AZ, NM)

      - Central states (ND, SD, NE, KS, OK, TX)

      - Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Louisiana, etc.

      - Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, etc.

      - East Coast states including North Carolina, etc.


      So North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas. Therefore, University of
      Central Arkansas is NOT east of St. Andrews University, but rather west of it.</think>To

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, Arkansas is west of North
      Carolina

      - North Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean and is significantly farther east
      than Arkansas

      Let me think about the US geography:

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States


      Generally speaking, states on the east coast (like North Carolina) are east
      of central states (like Arkansas). This means that North Carolina is east of
      Arkansas.


      If University of Central Arkansas is in Arkansas, and St. Andrews University
      is in North Carolina, then University of Central Arkansas would be WEST of St.
      Andrews University, not east.


      So the answer would be NO, University of Central Arkansas is NOT located east

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Arkansas and North Carolina.

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      - North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - States on the east coast (like North Carolina) are generally east of central
      states (like Arkansas)

      - North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas on the map


      Step 4: Make the conclusion based on these geographical facts.

      Since North Carolina is east of Arkansas, St. Andrews University is east of
      University of Central Arkansas, not the other way around.

      To answer this, I need to consider the relative geographical positions of Arkansas
      and North Carolina in the United States.


      Arkansas is located in the south-central part of the United States. It''s west
      of the Mississippi River.


      North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States, specifically
      in the southeastern region.


      Geographically, North Carolina is east of Arkansas. Since University of Central
      Arkansas is in Arkansas, and St. Andrews University is in North Carolina, the
      University of Central Arkansas would be west of St. Andrews University, not
      east.


      So the answer is NO, University of Central Arkansas, AR is not located east

      Step by Step


      To determine if University of Central Arkansas (UCA) in Arkansas is located
      east of St. Andrews University in North Carolina, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these two states.


      1) University of Central Arkansas is located in Conway, Arkansas

      2) St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina

      3) Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      4) North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      5) On a U.S. map, North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas


      Since North Carolina is located east of Arkansas, St. Andrews University must
      be east of the University of Central Arkansas (not the other way around).


      # Answer: NO


      University of Central Arkansas is NOT located east of St. Andrews University.
      It''s located west of it.'

      locations of two universities:

      1. University of Central Arkansas (UCA) in Arkansas (AR)

      2. St. Andrews University in North Carolina (NC)


      To determine if UCA is east of St. Andrews, I need to know their approximate
      longitudes. The more eastern location will have the lower longitude value.


      First, let''s establish the general locations:

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      - North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is east of Arkansas. States on the eastern
      seaboard (like NC) are east of interior states (like AR).


      To be more specific:

      - University of Central Arkansas is in Conway, Arkansas

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina


      Conway, AR is roughly in the central part of Arkansas, while Laurinburg, NC
      is in the southern part of North Carolina near the South Carolina border.


      Since North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas, it''s very likely that
      St. Andrews University is east of the University of Central Arkansas, not the
      other way around.


      Therefore, University of Central Arkansas is NOT east of St. Andrews University
      - it''s west of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the
      relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Central Arkansas is located in Conway, Arkansas (AR)

      - St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a west-to-east basis.

      - States on the eastern seaboard (like North Carolina) are generally east of
      interior states (like Arkansas)

      - North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas on the U.S. map


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since North Carolina is east of Arkansas, St. Andrews University in NC is east
      of the University of Central Arkansas in AR. This means that the University
      of Central Arkansas is WEST of St. Andrews University, not east of it.

      Generally speaking, North Carolina is east of Arkansas. Arkansas is west of
      the Mississippi River, while North Carolina is several states to the east.


      So if we''re comparing their positions on the east-west axis (longitude):

      - Arkansas is further west

      - North Carolina is further east


      The question asks if UCA is east of St. Andrews. Since Arkansas is west of North
      Carolina, UCA would be west (not east) of St. Andrews University.</think>I need

      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Arkansas is west of the Mississippi River

      - North Carolina is significantly further east, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - States between Arkansas and North Carolina include Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia,
      and Mississippi


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these relative positions.

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two universities on a west-east
      axis.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these universities are located.

      - St. Mary''s University is in Texas (TX)

      - University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Louisiana is located directly east of Texas

      - Texas is located west of Louisiana


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - St. Mary''s University is in San Antonio, which is in the central/southern
      part of Texas

      - University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Lafayette, in the southern part
      of Louisiana


      Step 4: Apply geographic reasoning.

      Since Texas is west of Louisiana, and San Antonio is not so far east in Texas
      that it would be east of Lafayette (which is in southern Louisiana), St. Mary''s
      University must be west of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.


      Therefore, St. Mary''s University is NOT east of University of Louisiana at
      Lafayette.

      To solve this, I need to know the relative east-west positioning of these two
      universities. This is a question about geography and the relative longitude
      of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - St. Mary''s University is in Texas (TX), specifically in San Antonio, Texas.

      - University of Louisiana at Lafayette is in Louisiana (LA), in the city of
      Lafayette.

      - Texas is west of Louisiana (Louisiana borders Texas on Texas''s eastern border).

      in Colorado is located east of Concordia University in Nebraska, I need to identify
      the locations of both universities and compare their geographical positions,
      specifically their longitudes.


      Naropa University is located in Boulder, Colorado.

      Concordia University Nebraska is located in Seward, Nebraska.


      Geographically in the United States:

      - States further east have lower longitude values (more negative if using western
      hemisphere notation)

      - States further west have higher longitude values (less negative if using western
      hemisphere notation)


      In general, Nebraska is east of Colorado. Colorado borders Nebraska to the west.


      So since Naropa is in Colorado (a western state) and Concordia is in Nebraska
      (a state to the east of Colorado), Naropa University would be WEST of Concordia
      University Nebraska, not east.


      Therefore, the answer should be NO.</think>I need to determine the relative

      - Concordia University is in Seward, Nebraska (NE)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Colorado and Nebraska.

      - When looking at a US map, Colorado is located directly west of Nebraska

      - Nebraska shares its western border with Colorado''s eastern border


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - Since Boulder, CO is in Colorado, and Seward, NE is in Nebraska, Naropa University
      must be west of Concordia University

      - Being west of something means it is NOT east of it


      NO, Naropa University in Colorado is not located east of Concordia University

      Let me think about the general geographic positions:

      - Colorado is west of Nebraska in the United States

      - Nebraska is directly east of Colorado


      Now, let''s think about the specific universities:

      - Naropa University is in Boulder, Colorado

      - Concordia University Nebraska is in Seward, Nebraska


      Since Colorado is west of Nebraska, and these universities are in their respective
      states, Naropa University (in Colorado) would be west of Concordia University
      (in Nebraska).


      So if we''re asking if Naropa is east of Concordia, the answer would be NO -
      it''s actually west of Concordia.</think># Determining if Naropa University
      is east of Concordia University


      I need to figure out the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Naropa University is located in Boulder, Colorado

      - Concordia University Nebraska is located in Seward, Nebraska


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Colorado and Nebraska

      Colorado lies directly west of Nebraska in the United States. This is a fundamental
      geographic relationship between these two states.


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the universities

      Since Naropa University is in Colorado, and Concordia University is in Nebraska,
      Naropa must be west of Concordia (not east).


      # Answer: NO


      Naropa University is not located east of Concordia University Nebraska. It is
      located west of it.'
    fb863184-589a-48d7-8cc3-7fba763d03f2: '<think>To determine if Naropa University
      in Colorado is located east of Concordia University in Nebraska, I need to figure
      out the relative positions of these two universities.


      First, let me think about the states:

      - Naropa University is in Colorado (CO)

      - Concordia University is in Nebraska (NE)


      Colorado is generally west of Nebraska in the United States. Nebraska borders
      Colorado on the east, meaning Colorado is to the west of Nebraska.


      Since Naropa University is in Colorado, and Colorado is west of Nebraska, Naropa
      University should be west of Concordia University in Nebraska, not east of it.


      Let me double-check by thinking about the specific locations of these universities:

      - Naropa University is in Boulder, Colorado, which is on the eastern side of
      Colorado

      - Concordia University Nebraska is in Seward, Nebraska, which is in the eastern
      part of Nebraska


      Even though Naropa is on the eastern side of Colorado, Colorado as a whole is
      still west of Nebraska. So Naropa University would still be west of Concordia
      University Nebraska.</think>I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two universities by analyzing their positions on a map.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Naropa University is located in Boulder, Colorado

      - Concordia University Nebraska is located in Seward, Nebraska


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of Colorado and Nebraska.

      Colorado is directly west of Nebraska on the US map. Nebraska shares its western
      border with Colorado.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Even though Boulder is in eastern Colorado, and Seward is in eastern Nebraska,
      the state positioning is the determining factor here. Since Colorado is entirely
      west of Nebraska, any location in Colorado (including Boulder) must be west
      of any location in Nebraska (including Seward).


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion based on cardinal directions.

      Since Naropa University is west of Concordia University Nebraska, it cannot
      be east of it.

      Let me consider the geographic positions of Washington and North Dakota within
      the United States:

      - Washington state is on the west coast of the US

      - North Dakota is in the upper Midwest region


      Looking at the general locations:

      - Washington state is significantly west of North Dakota

      - Even the eastern part of Washington would generally be west of most of North
      Dakota


      Specifically:

      - Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington, in the eastern part
      of Washington state

      - Williston State College is in Williston, North Dakota, in the western part
      of North Dakota


      Even though Eastern Washington University has "Eastern" in its name, this is
      relative to Washington state. Washington state as a whole is west of North Dakota.


      So Eastern Washington University (even though in eastern Washington) would be
      west of Williston State College in North Dakota.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - Eastern Washington University is located in Cheney, Washington (in the eastern
      part of Washington state)

      - Williston State College is located in Williston, North Dakota (in the western
      part of North Dakota)


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of Washington and North Dakota.

      - Washington state is on the west coast of the United States

      - North Dakota is in the upper Midwest region, significantly east of Washington


      Step 3: Consider their relative positions.

      - Even though Eastern Washington University has "Eastern" in its name, this
      is relative to Washington state itself

      - Washington state, even its eastern portions, lies west of North Dakota

      - Williston, despite being in western North Dakota, is still east of any point

      First, let''s consider their states:

      - Eastern Washington University is in Washington state (WA), which is on the
      west coast of the United States

      - Williston State College is in North Dakota (ND), which is in the northern
      central part of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - Washington state is on the west coast

      - North Dakota is significantly to the east of Washington


      Even though Eastern Washington University has "Eastern" in its name, that just
      means it''s in the eastern part of Washington state. But Washington state as
      a whole is west of North Dakota.


      So, Eastern Washington University (in WA) should be west of Williston State
      College (in ND), not east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      - Williston State College is in North Dakota (ND)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Washington state is located on the west coast of the United States

      - North Dakota is in the north-central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Despite having "Eastern" in its name (which refers to it being in eastern
      Washington), Eastern Washington University is still in Washington state, which
      is entirely west of North Dakota

      - North Dakota is significantly east of Washington state on a map of the United
      States


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania, near the Ohio border.

      Stony Brook is on Long Island, which is in eastern New York.


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Pennsylvania, and Stony Brook (being
      on Long Island) is quite far east in New York. Pittsburgh is in the western
      part of Pennsylvania.

      - Stony Brook is located on Long Island in eastern New York


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - Long Island extends into the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern side of New York
      State

      - Pittsburgh is much further inland and west of New York State


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      To solve this, I need to know the relative east-west positions of these two
      institutions.


      First, let me recall the rough geographical positions:

      - Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania

      - Stony Brook is on Long Island, in New York state


      In terms of east-west orientation in the US:

      - New York state, especially Long Island where Stony Brook is located, is much
      further east than western Pennsylvania where Pittsburgh is located

      - Pennsylvania is west of New York, though they do share a border in the northern
      parts


      Since Stony Brook is on Long Island (very eastern part of New York), and Pittsburgh
      is in western Pennsylvania, Stony Brook would be significantly east of Pittsburgh.


      Therefore, University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is NOT east of
      Stony Brook University School of Medicine. It is actually west of it.</think>To
      determine if University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine (in Pennsylvania)
      is located east of Stony Brook University School of Medicine (in New York),

      Step 1: Identify where Pittsburgh, PA is located.

      - Pittsburgh is located in western Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Identify where Stony Brook, NY is located.

      - Stony Brook is located on Long Island, which is in the eastern part of New
      York state.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, New York''s Long Island is significantly
      further east than western Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of New York state.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania, and Stony Brook is on Long Island
      (eastern New York), Pittsburgh must be west of Stony Brook, not east.

      To answer this, I need to think about the relative east-west positions of these
      two locations.


      Step 1: Recall the general locations

      - University of Pittsburgh is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

      - Stony Brook University is on Long Island, New York


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the eastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of New York State

      - However, Pennsylvania extends quite far east, and New York extends quite far
      west

      - Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania

      - Stony Brook is on Long Island, which is in the easternmost part of New York


      Step 3: Compare their specific locations

      - Pittsburgh is in the western part of Pennsylvania

      - Stony Brook is on Long Island, which is in the far eastern part of New York,
      extending into the Atlantic Ocean


      Given these facts, Pittsburgh is definitely west of Stony Brook. So the University
      of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine would be west of Stony Brook University
      School of Medicine, not east of it.</think># Is University of Pittsburgh School

      - University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

      - Stony Brook University School of Medicine is in Stony Brook, New York (on
      Long Island)


      Step 2: Consider their geographic positions

      - Pittsburgh is located in western Pennsylvania

      - Stony Brook is located on Long Island, which is in the easternmost part of
      New York State, extending into the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis

      - Pittsburgh, PA is significantly west of Long Island, NY

      - Western Pennsylvania is west of even the westernmost parts of New York State

      - Long Island represents one of the easternmost points in the continental United

      1. Arkansas State University in Paragould, AR (Arkansas)

      2. Hampton University in Hampton, VA (Virginia)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their relative positions
      on a map of the United States.


      Arkansas is located in the south-central part of the United States, west of
      the Mississippi River.

      Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, on the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Generally speaking, states on the eastern seaboard (like Virginia) are east
      of inland states (like Arkansas).


      So Hampton University in Virginia would be east of Arkansas State University
      in Paragould, Arkansas.


      Therefore, Arkansas State University is NOT east of Hampton University. Rather,
      Hampton University is east of Arkansas State University.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Arkansas State University Paragould is in Paragould, Arkansas (AR)

      - Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states in the US.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Virginia is significantly further east in the United States compared to Arkansas

      - The eastern seaboard (where Virginia is located) is east of the Mississippi
      River region (where Arkansas is located)


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Virginia is located on the eastern coast of the US, while Arkansas is
      in the central part of the country, Hampton University (VA) is east of Arkansas
      State University Paragould (AR), not the other way around.

      - Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia (VA)


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these states:

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States


      The United States generally runs from west (Pacific Ocean) to east (Atlantic
      Ocean). Virginia is on the Atlantic coast, which is the eastern edge of the
      continental US. Arkansas is inland, in the central-southern part of the country.


      Therefore, Virginia is east of Arkansas. Since Hampton University is in Virginia
      and Arkansas State University Paragould is in Arkansas, Hampton University is
      east of Arkansas State University Paragould.


      So, is Arkansas State University Paragould, AR located east of Hampton University,

      - Hampton University is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Virginia is significantly farther east than Arkansas

      - States on the Atlantic coast (like Virginia) are east of inland states (like
      Arkansas)

      - The United States generally progresses from east (Atlantic) to west (Pacific)


      Step 4: Make the final comparison of the universities based on their states''
      positions.

      - Since Hampton University is in Virginia (an eastern state) and Arkansas State
      University Paragould is in Arkansas (a more central state), Hampton University
      is east of Arkansas State University Paragould.

      2. I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities,

      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positions of these states.

      New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, while Arkansas is in
      the south-central United States. Looking at a map of the US, Arkansas is considerably
      east of New Mexico.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      While ENMU has "Eastern" in its name, this refers to its location within New
      Mexico, not its position relative to other states. Even the easternmost part
      of New Mexico is still west of Arkansas.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the geographical facts.

      1. First, I need to determine the locations of Eastern New Mexico University
      (ENMU) in New Mexico and Henderson State University (HSU) in Arkansas.


      2. Eastern New Mexico University is located in Portales, New Mexico, which is
      in the eastern part of New Mexico state.


      3. Henderson State University is located in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, which is
      in the southwestern part of Arkansas state.


      4. Now I need to determine if ENMU is east of HSU. This requires knowing the
      relative positions of these locations on a map of the United States.


      5. Geographically, Arkansas is located east of New Mexico. Arkansas is in the
      southern central part of the US, while New Mexico is in the southwestern part
      of the US.


      6. Even though ENMU is in "eastern" New Mexico, New Mexico as a whole is west
      of Arkansas. Therefore, ENMU would be west of HSU, not east of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Eastern New Mexico University is in Portales, New Mexico

      - Henderson State University is in Arkadelphia, Arkansas


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of New Mexico and Arkansas.

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern United States

      - Arkansas is in the southeastern/south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east basis.

      - New Mexico is significantly west of Arkansas on the US map

      - Even though ENMU is in the eastern part of New Mexico, the entire state of
      New Mexico is still west of Arkansas


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since New Mexico is west of Arkansas, Eastern New Mexico University must be
      west of Henderson State University, not east of it

      1) First, I need to locate these two universities geographically.


      Syracuse University School of Education is in Syracuse, New York (NY). Syracuse

      Middlesex University in Massachusetts (MA) - I need to be careful here. There''s
      a Middlesex University in London, UK, but the question specifies MA (Massachusetts).

      Massachusetts is east of New York state. Specifically:

      - Syracuse is in central New York

      - Middlesex Community College has campuses in Bedford and Lowell, Massachusetts,
      both of which are in eastern Massachusetts


      3) So if we''re comparing:

      Between Two Universities


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Locate Syracuse University School of Education

      Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, New York, which is in the central
      part of New York State.


      ## Step 2: Locate Middlesex University, MA

      Middlesex University (or Middlesex Community College) in Massachusetts would
      be located in Middlesex County, which is in the eastern part of Massachusetts.


      ## Step 3: Compare their geographical positions

      - New York State is west of Massachusetts

      - Syracuse is in central New York, which puts it even further west relative
      to eastern Massachusetts

      - Massachusetts, particularly Middlesex County, is clearly east of Syracuse,
      NY

      - Arizona is directly east of California


      Since California is west of Arizona, and University of Redlands is in California

      region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Michigan. But let me verify this more
      precisely by thinking about their approximate locations:


      - Michigan is around the Great Lakes region, specifically west of Lake Erie
      and Lake Huron.

      - New York is on the Atlantic coast, east of the Great Lakes.


      More specifically:

      - Grand Valley State University is in Allendale, Michigan, which is in the western
      part of Michigan.

      - D''Youville University is in Buffalo, New York, which is in the western part
      of New York state.


      Even though both are in the western parts of their respective states, New York
      as a whole is east of Michigan. Buffalo, NY is east of Allendale, MI.


      Therefore, Grand Valley State University in Michigan is located WEST of D''Youville
      University in New York, not east of it.</think>To determine if Grand Valley
      State University in Michigan is located east of D''Youville University in New
      York, I need to compare their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Grand Valley State University is located in Allendale, Michigan

      - D''Youville University is located in Buffalo, New York


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of Michigan and New York.

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, New York is clearly east of Michigan

      - Buffalo (in western New York) is still east of Allendale (in western Michigan)

      - The entire state of Michigan is west of New York state


      Therefore, Grand Valley State University in Michigan is located WEST of D''Youville
      University in New York, not east of it.

      - Grand Valley State University is in Michigan (MI)

      - D''Youville University is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Let me think about their specific locations within their states.

      - Grand Valley State University is likely in western Michigan (as many Michigan
      universities are in the western or central parts of the state)

      - D''Youville University is in New York state, which is east of Michigan


      Step 3: Let me be more precise. Let me recall the specific locations:

      part of Michigan

      - D''Youville University is in Buffalo, New York, which is in the western part
      of New York state


      Step 4: Looking at a mental map of the US, Michigan is west of New York. Even
      western Michigan is generally west of western New York. So Grand Valley State

      - Michigan is located west of New York state.

      - Even though both universities are in the western parts of their respective
      states, western Michigan is still west of western New York.

      - On a map, if you move eastward from Grand Valley State University, you would
      eventually reach New York state and Buffalo where D''Youville is located.

      Ball State University is located in Muncie, Indiana (IN).

      Kean University is located in Union, New Jersey (NJ).


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider the relative positions
      of Indiana and New Jersey.


      The United States generally has states arranged from west to east as you move
      from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic coast. Indiana is in the Midwest region,
      while New Jersey is on the East Coast.


      New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean and is one of the easternmost states in
      the continental US.

      Indiana is significantly more inland and west of New Jersey.


      Therefore, New Jersey is east of Indiana. Since Ball State is in Indiana and
      Kean University is in New Jersey, Kean University would be east of Ball State
      University.


      So Ball State University is NOT east of Kean University - it''s the opposite.
      Kean University is east of Ball State University.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities by looking at their

      - Kean University is located in Union, New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Indiana and New Jersey.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - New Jersey is significantly further east than Indiana

      - The East Coast states (including NJ) are east of the Midwest states (including
      IN)


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the universities'' relative positions.

      - Since Kean University is in NJ (an eastern state) and Ball State is in IN
      (a midwestern state), Kean University is east of Ball State University, not
      the other way around

      - New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east

      - Indiana is much further inland, west of states like Ohio and Pennsylvania,
      which themselves are west of New Jersey


      Therefore, New Jersey is east of Indiana. Since Ball State University is in

      - All of New Jersey is east of all of Indiana


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions of the universities.

      Now I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these states.


      In the US, states are generally arranged with eastern states on the right side

      Indiana is in the Midwest, significantly further inland from the Atlantic coast.


      Looking at the map of the US from west to east, Indiana is west of New Jersey.
      This means that Ball State University in Indiana would be west of Kean University

      The universities are:

      1. Northland International University in Wisconsin (WI)

      2. State University of New York at Canton in New York (NY)


      To determine which one is east of the other, I need to know their approximate
      geographic locations.


      First, I know that Wisconsin is in the Midwest of the United States, while New
      York is in the Northeast.


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Wisconsin. The entire state of New York
      is east of Wisconsin.


      Since Northland International University is in Wisconsin, and SUNY Canton is
      in New York, that would suggest that SUNY Canton is east of Northland International
      University.

      which would be the opposite of what I just determined.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two

      - Northland International University is in Wisconsin (WI)

      - State University of New York at Canton is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Wisconsin is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York
      is in the Northeast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      New York is significantly east of Wisconsin on the U.S. map. Wisconsin is closer
      to the center of the country, while New York borders the Atlantic Ocean on the
      eastern seaboard.


      Step 4: Apply this state-level knowledge to the universities.

      Since Northland International University is in Wisconsin and SUNY Canton is
      in New York, the New York institution would be east of the Wisconsin institution.

      WI) is located east of SUNY Canton (in NY).


      To solve this, I need to consider the general geographical positions of Wisconsin
      and New York states.


      Wisconsin is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York
      is located in the Northeast region.


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Wisconsin. The continental United States
      has states arranged roughly with the East Coast (including New York) on the
      eastern side, and the Midwest (including Wisconsin) more toward the center of
      the country.


      Since Northland International University is in Wisconsin, and SUNY Canton is
      in New York, it''s highly likely that the Wisconsin institution is WEST of the
      New York institution, not east.

      - Wisconsin is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - On a map of the United States, New York is significantly east of Wisconsin

      - Wisconsin is closer to the center of the country, while New York is on the
      East Coast


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Wisconsin is west of New York, any location in Wisconsin (including Northland

      state of Georgia is east of Texas.


      Since Dallas Baptist University is in Texas (specifically Dallas), and Georgia
      Military College is in Georgia, Dallas Baptist University would be west of Georgia
      Military College, not east of it.


      So the answer is NO, Dallas Baptist University is not located east of Georgia
      Military College.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      - Dallas Baptist University is in Texas (TX)

      - Georgia Military College is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Texas is in the southern United States, extending from the center of the country
      toward the west

      - Georgia is also in the southern United States, but is located in the southeastern
      part of the country


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Georgia is significantly east of Texas on a US map

      - All locations in Georgia are east of Dallas, Texas


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Dallas Baptist University is in Texas (west) and Georgia Military College
      is in Georgia (east), Dallas Baptist University must be west of Georgia Military
      College, not east of it.

      if Dallas Baptist University (DBU) in Texas is located east of Georgia Military
      College (GMC) in Georgia.


      To solve this, I need to think about the relative locations of Texas and Georgia
      in the United States.


      Texas is located in the southwestern/south-central part of the United States,
      while Georgia is located in the southeastern United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Georgia is on the eastern side of the US, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Texas is more central/western and does not border the Atlantic Ocean


      Specifically, Georgia is east of Texas. That means:

      - Georgia Military College (in Georgia) is east of Dallas Baptist University
      (in Texas)

      - Dallas Baptist University (in Texas) is west of Georgia Military College (in
      Georgia)


      So, is Dallas Baptist University east of Georgia Military College? No, it''s
      the opposite. Dallas Baptist University is west of Georgia Military College.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two institutions based on their locations in their respective states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Dallas Baptist University is in Dallas, Texas

      - Georgia Military College is in Georgia


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Georgia.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Georgia is significantly east of Texas on the US map

      - Texas is west of Georgia, not east of it


      Step 4: Draw conclusion based on these geographic positions.

      Since Dallas Baptist University is in Texas (west) and Georgia Military College
      is in Georgia (east), Dallas Baptist University cannot be east of Georgia Military
      College.

      First, let''s identify where both institutions are located:


      1. Lon Morris College is in Texas (TX)

      2. Air University is in Alabama (AL)


      Generally, Alabama is in the southeastern United States while Texas is in the
      south-central United States. Geographically, Alabama is east of Texas.


      To be more precise:

      - Alabama is typically around 85-88 degrees west longitude

      - Texas ranges from about 93-106 degrees west longitude


      Since points with smaller western longitude values are more eastern (closer
      to the prime meridian), and Alabama has smaller longitude values than Texas,
      Alabama is east of Texas.


      Therefore, Air University in Alabama would be east of Lon Morris College in
      Texas, not the other way around.</think># Is Lon Morris College, TX located

      2) Texas is located in the south-central United States.

      3) Alabama is located in the southeastern United States.

      4) When comparing these two states, Alabama is east of Texas.

      5) Therefore, institutions in Alabama would generally be east of institutions
      in Texas.

      6) Since Lon Morris College is in Texas and Air University is in Alabama, Lon
      Morris College would be west of Air University, not east.

      Texas is in the south-central/southwestern part of the country.


      4. However, since Lon Morris College is specifically in East Texas, I need to
      check if East Texas is east of Montgomery, Alabama.


      East Texas is still west of Alabama. Even the easternmost parts of Texas are

      - Even though Lon Morris College was in East Texas, all of Texas is still west

      First, let''s identify where these universities are located:


      1. Mount Vernon Nazarene University is in Mount Vernon, Ohio (OH)

      2. University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is in Baltimore, Maryland
      (MD)


      Now I need to think about the relative geographic positions of Ohio and Maryland
      in the United States.


      The United States is oriented such that west is toward the Pacific Ocean and
      east is toward the Atlantic Ocean. In general, when comparing states'' east-west
      positions:

      - Maryland is on the eastern seaboard, directly touching the Atlantic Ocean

      - Ohio is inland, in the Midwest region, west of Maryland


      So generally speaking, Maryland is east of Ohio. Since Mount Vernon Nazarene
      University is in Ohio, and UMBC is in Maryland, this means Mount Vernon Nazarene
      University is west of UMBC, not east of it.


      Therefore, Mount Vernon Nazarene University is NOT located east of University
      of Maryland, Baltimore County.</think># Is Mount Vernon Nazarene University,
      OH located east of University of Maryland, Baltimore County, MD?


      I''ll think about the geographic locations of these universities step by step:


      1) Mount Vernon Nazarene University is located in Mount Vernon, Ohio (OH)

      2) University of Maryland, Baltimore County is located in Baltimore, Maryland
      (MD)

      3) When looking at a US map, Maryland is on the East Coast, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      4) Ohio is located inland, in the Midwest region

      5) Maryland is positioned to the east of Ohio

      6) Therefore, Mount Vernon Nazarene University (in Ohio) would be to the west
      of University of Maryland, Baltimore County (in Maryland)


      NO - Mount Vernon Nazarene University is not located east of University of Maryland,
      Baltimore County. It is located to the west.'

      I need to determine which is further east. Let me think about the general locations:


      1. Mount Vernon Nazarene University is in Ohio (OH).

      2. University of Maryland, Baltimore County is in Maryland (MD).


      In the United States, Maryland is on the east coast, while Ohio is more inland
      and west of Maryland. Generally speaking, states along the eastern seaboard
      (like Maryland) are east of midwest states (like Ohio).


      So if I consider the general geography of US states:

      - Maryland is east of Ohio

      - Therefore, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (being in Maryland) would
      be east of Mount Vernon Nazarene University (being in Ohio)


      If a university in Ohio is east of a university in Maryland, that would be counter
      to the usual geography.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine

      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Mount Vernon Nazarene University is in Ohio (OH)

      - University of Maryland, Baltimore County is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Maryland is located on the east coast of the United States, while Ohio is more
      inland and west of Maryland. In terms of longitude, Maryland is generally east
      of Ohio.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions of the specific universities.

      Since Baltimore is on the eastern side of Maryland, and Mount Vernon (Ohio)
      is within a state that''s entirely west of Maryland, the University of Maryland,
      Baltimore County would be east of Mount Vernon Nazarene University.

      in the US:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest

      - Maryland is on the East Coast


      Generally speaking, Maryland is east of Ohio. Since these states don''t overlap

      would be east of any location in Ohio.


      More specifically:

      - Mount Vernon, Ohio is in central Ohio

      - Baltimore, Maryland is on the eastern side of Maryland, near the Chesapeake
      Bay


      Given these locations, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (in Baltimore,
      MD) would be east of Mount Vernon Nazarene University (in Mount Vernon, OH).

      - Mount Vernon Nazarene University is in Ohio (OH)

      - University of Maryland, Baltimore County is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and Maryland.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Maryland is located on the East Coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - Maryland is significantly east of Ohio

      - Baltimore, MD is on the eastern side of Maryland near the Chesapeake Bay

      - Mount Vernon, OH is in central Ohio

      First, let me figure out where each state is. Ohio is in the Midwest, and Maryland
      is on the East Coast.


      Geographically, Maryland is east of Ohio. So generally speaking, locations in

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Maryland is located on the East Coast of the United States


      ## Step 2: Determine the relative positions

      - Maryland is east of Ohio on a map of the United States

      - Baltimore, MD is in the eastern part of Maryland

      - Mount Vernon, OH is in central Ohio


      ## Step 3: Compare the locations

      Since Maryland is east of Ohio, and these specific cities maintain that same
      east-west relationship, University of Maryland, Baltimore County would be east
      of Mount Vernon Nazarene University.


      Therefore, Mount Vernon Nazarene University is NOT east of University of Maryland,

      To determine this, I need to know the relative locations of these two places.


      Dakota Wesleyan University is in South Dakota (SD), which is west of Wisconsin
      (WI).

      University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Wisconsin.


      Looking at a map of the United States:

      - Wisconsin is east of South Dakota

      - South Dakota is west of Wisconsin


      Since Dakota Wesleyan University is in South Dakota, which is west of Wisconsin,
      and University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Wisconsin, Dakota Wesleyan University

      So Dakota Wesleyan University is NOT east of University of Wisconsin-Waukesha.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Dakota Wesleyan University is in South Dakota (SD)

      - University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - On a U.S. map, South Dakota is located to the west of Wisconsin

      - Wisconsin borders Lake Michigan on the east, while South Dakota is in the
      Great Plains region


      Step 3: Since Dakota Wesleyan University is in South Dakota (a state west of
      Wisconsin), it must be west of any location in Wisconsin, including University
      of Wisconsin-Waukesha.


      NO, Dakota Wesleyan University is not located east of University of Wisconsin-Waukesha.
      It is located west of it.'

      Now I need to determine if Mitchell, SD is east of Waukesha, WI.


      In the United States, South Dakota is west of Wisconsin. Wisconsin borders Minnesota
      to its west, and South Dakota is west of Minnesota. So generally speaking, South
      Dakota is west of Wisconsin.


      To be more specific about these particular cities:

      - Mitchell, SD is in the eastern part of South Dakota

      - Waukesha, WI is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin


      Even though Mitchell is in eastern SD, the entire state of South Dakota lies
      west of Wisconsin. So Mitchell, SD must be west of Waukesha, WI - not east.


      Therefore, Dakota Wesleyan University is NOT located east of University of Wisconsin-Waukesha.</think>To

      entire state of South Dakota is positioned west of Wisconsin on the map.

      - Illinois is east of Iowa (Iowa borders Illinois on Illinois'' western border)

      - Des Moines is in central Iowa

      - Aurora is in northeastern Illinois (near Chicago)


      Since Illinois is east of Iowa, and Aurora is in the northeastern part of Illinois,

      - Aurora University is located in Aurora, Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Iowa and Illinois.

      - Illinois is located east of Iowa on the US map

      - Iowa borders Illinois on Illinois'' western side


      Step 3: Compare the specific cities.

      - Des Moines is in central Iowa

      - Aurora is in northeastern Illinois (western suburbs of Chicago)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on relative positions.

      Since Illinois is east of Iowa, and Aurora is in the northeastern part of Illinois
      while Des Moines is in central Iowa, Aurora University must be east of Drake

      Generally speaking, Missouri is east of Kansas. Kansas and Missouri are neighboring
      states, with Kansas to the west of Missouri.


      More specifically:

      - Wichita, Kansas is in south-central Kansas

      - St. Louis, Missouri is on the eastern edge of Missouri, on the Mississippi
      River bordering Illinois


      Given these locations, St. Louis is definitely east of Wichita. Therefore, Newman
      University (in Wichita, KS) is west of Saint Louis University (in St. Louis,

      6. That means Oklahoma Baptist University would be west of Shorter University,
      not east of it.</think># Is Oklahoma Baptist University, OK located east of
      Shorter University, GA?


      I''ll solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: Oklahoma Baptist University is in Oklahoma
      (OK), and Shorter University is in Georgia (GA).


      2) Looking at a US map, Oklahoma is located in the central/south-central part
      of the United States.


      3) Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast.


      4) When comparing their positions, Georgia is clearly east of Oklahoma.


      5) Since the universities are in their respective states, Shorter University
      (in GA) is east of Oklahoma Baptist University (in OK).


      6) The question asks if Oklahoma Baptist University is east of Shorter University,
      which is the opposite of their actual positions.

      in South Carolina, not east of it.</think>To answer whether Samford University,
      AL is located east of College of Charleston, SC, I need to consider the geographic
      positions of these two institutions.

      - Samford University is located in Birmingham, Alabama

      - College of Charleston is located in Charleston, South Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Alabama and South Carolina.

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States, but is inland

      - South Carolina is also in the southeastern United States, but is on the Atlantic
      coast


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - States along the Atlantic coast (like South Carolina) are generally east of
      inland southeastern states (like Alabama)

      - On a map of the United States, South Carolina is positioned to the east of
      Alabama


      Therefore, Samford University in Alabama is located WEST of College of Charleston
      in South Carolina, not east of it.

      First, let''s identify their locations:

      1. Graceland University is in Iowa (IA)

      2. Purdue University Fort Wayne is in Indiana (IN)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to know their approximate longitudes.
      Generally speaking, a location that is east of another has a longitude with
      a smaller absolute value (in North America, where longitudes are negative numbers).


      Iowa is generally west of Indiana in the United States. Indiana borders Lake
      Michigan to the north and Ohio to the east, while Iowa is further west, bordering
      Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota.


      Since Graceland University is in Iowa, and Purdue University Fort Wayne is in
      Indiana, it''s highly likely that Graceland University is west of Purdue University
      Fort Wayne, not east.


      So the answer would be NO, Graceland University is NOT located east of Purdue
      University Fort Wayne.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Iowa is located in the Midwest, while Indiana is also in the Midwest but further
      east. In the United States, Iowa is positioned to the west of Indiana.


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, Graceland University
      in Iowa would be west of Purdue University Fort Wayne in Indiana.


      NO, Graceland University, IA is not located east of Purdue University Fort Wayne,

      - Purdue University Fort Wayne is in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Iowa and Indiana.

      In the United States, Indiana is east of Iowa. Iowa is in the Midwest region,

      To do this, I need to know the approximate geographic locations of both places.


      Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is likely in southeastern
      Kentucky, as the name suggests.


      Old Dominion University is in Norfolk, Virginia (I''m assuming POD refers to
      a specific campus or building of Old Dominion).


      Now I need to think about the geographic relationship between southeastern Kentucky
      and Norfolk, Virginia:


      Kentucky is generally west of Virginia. Kentucky''s eastern border touches Virginia''s
      western border. So southeastern Kentucky would be close to western Virginia.


      Norfolk, Virginia is on the eastern coast of Virginia, near the Atlantic Ocean.

      answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both institutions
      and compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Locate Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College.

      This college is located in southeastern Kentucky, as its name suggests. Kentucky
      is a state in the eastern United States, but positioned in the central-eastern
      part of the country.


      Step 2: Locate Old Dominion University.

      Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia. Virginia is on the
      Atlantic coast, east of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Kentucky shares its eastern border with Virginia''s western border. However,
      Norfolk (where Old Dominion is located) is in the eastern part of Virginia,
      near the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Kentucky is west of Virginia, and specifically Norfolk is in eastern Virginia,
      Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College must be west (not east) of

      Then I need to determine if the Kentucky college is east of the Virginia university.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of Kentucky and Virginia:

      - Kentucky is generally west of Virginia (Virginia is on the Atlantic coast,
      while Kentucky is more inland)


      For the specific locations:

      - Old Dominion University is in Norfolk, Virginia, which is in the eastern part

      Given these locations, it''s unlikely that Southeast Kentucky Community and
      Technical College would be east of Old Dominion University. Even the eastern
      parts of Kentucky are generally west of the eastern parts of Virginia, especially
      Norfolk which is on the coast.


      So my conclusion is that Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College

      Reasoning


      1) First, I need to determine the locations of both institutions.


      2) Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is located in southeastern
      Kentucky, as the name suggests. Kentucky is a state that borders Virginia to
      its east.


      3) Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia, in the eastern part
      of Virginia near the Atlantic coast.


      4) Geographically, Virginia lies east of Kentucky. The eastern border of Kentucky
      connects with the western part of Virginia.


      5) Since Norfolk is on the eastern coast of Virginia, and Kentucky is entirely
      west of Virginia, any location in Kentucky (including Southeast Kentucky Community
      and Technical College) would be west of Old Dominion University.


      6) Therefore, Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is west of
      Old Dominion University, not east.

      relative locations of two colleges: Friends University in Kansas (KS) and St.
      Catharine College in Kentucky (KY).


      To determine if Friends University is east of St. Catharine College, I need
      to identify their locations and compare them.


      First, let''s establish the locations:

      - Friends University is in Kansas (KS)

      - St. Catharine College is in Kentucky (KY)


      Now, I need to think about the geographical positions of these states. In the
      United States:

      - Kansas is in the Midwest region

      - Kentucky is in the East South Central region


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Kansas is significantly west of Kentucky

      - Kentucky is much further east than Kansas


      Since Friends University is in Kansas (western) and St. Catharine College is
      in Kentucky (eastern), Friends University cannot be east of St. Catharine College.
      It would be west of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative locations of these two colleges by looking at which states they''re

      - St. Catharine College is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Kansas is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Kentucky is located in the East South Central region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a U.S. map, Kansas is significantly west of Kentucky

      - Kentucky is much further east than Kansas


      Step 4: Determine the answer.

      Since Friends University is in Kansas (a western state compared to Kentucky)
      and St. Catharine College is in Kentucky (an eastern state compared to Kansas),
      Friends University must be west of St. Catharine College, not east.

      determine the relative east-west positions of Friends University in Kansas (KS)
      and St. Catharine College in Kentucky (KY).


      First, I''ll consider the states:

      - Kansas (KS) is in the central part of the US

      - Kentucky (KY) is in the eastern part of the US, specifically in the east-central
      region


      Geographically, Kentucky is east of Kansas. So generally speaking, locations
      in Kentucky tend to be east of locations in Kansas.


      So without knowing the exact locations of these specific colleges within their
      states, the general geographic relationship between the states suggests that
      St. Catharine College in Kentucky would be east of Friends University in Kansas.


      Therefore, Friends University would NOT be east of St. Catharine College. Instead,
      it would be WEST of St. Catharine College.


      So to answer the specific question "Is Friends University, KS located east of
      St. Catharine College, KY?" - the answer would be NO.</think>I need to determine
      the east-west relationship between these two colleges based on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each college is located.

      - Friends University is in Kansas (KS)

      - St. Catharine College is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Kentucky is located in the eastern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Kentucky is significantly east of Kansas on the US map

      - Therefore, any college in Kentucky would generally be east of a college in
      Kansas


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion about the specific colleges.

      - Since St. Catharine College is in Kentucky (eastern state) and Friends University
      is in Kansas (central state), St. Catharine College would be east of Friends
      University, not the other way around.

      1. California State University, Bakersfield is located in Bakersfield, California.

      2. Roseman University of Health Sciences is located in Nevada (NV).


      To determine if CSU Bakersfield is east of Roseman University, I need to compare
      their relative positions on a map.


      California is generally west of Nevada on a map of the United States. Nevada
      borders California on California''s eastern border.


      Bakersfield is in the southern part of California''s Central Valley. It''s not
      near the eastern border of California that touches Nevada.


      Roseman University of Health Sciences has campuses in Henderson and Summerlin,
      Nevada, which are both near Las Vegas in southern Nevada.


      Since California is west of Nevada, and Bakersfield is not on the far eastern
      edge of California, CSU Bakersfield would be west of any location in Nevada,
      including Roseman University.


      Therefore, CSU Bakersfield is NOT east of Roseman University - it''s west of
      it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two
      universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - California State University, Bakersfield is in Bakersfield, California.

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (with campuses in Henderson
      and Summerlin near Las Vegas).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between California and Nevada.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - Nevada is directly east of California.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Bakersfield is in the southern Central Valley of California, not near the
      Nevada border.

      - The Roseman campuses are in southern Nevada.

      - Any location in Nevada would be east of Bakersfield, California.


      NO (CSU Bakersfield is west of Roseman University, not east of it)'

      relative east-west positions of two universities:

      1. California State University, Bakersfield (in California)

      2. Roseman University of Health Sciences (in Nevada)


      To determine which is more eastern, I need to think about the geographic locations
      of these universities.


      California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB) is located in Bakersfield, California,
      which is in the southern part of California''s Central Valley.


      Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV). I believe they have
      campuses in Henderson (near Las Vegas) and in South Jordan, Utah.


      In terms of U.S. geography, Nevada is generally east of California. California
      is on the West Coast, while Nevada is one state inland from California. So typically,
      locations in Nevada would be east of locations in California.


      However, I need to be careful about the specific locations because California
      extends quite far east in some areas, and Nevada has an irregular shape. Let
      me think about the specific cities:


      Bakersfield is in the southern Central Valley of California, not particularly
      close to the eastern border of California.

      Henderson/Las Vegas area is in the southern tip of Nevada, which is east of
      most of California.


      So based on general geographic knowledge, Roseman University in Nevada should
      be east of CSU Bakersfield.

      - California State University, Bakersfield is in Bakersfield, California

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (with campuses in Henderson,

      California State University, Bakersfield is in Bakersfield, California.

      Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV).


      To determine which is more easterly, I need to consider their approximate longitudes.
      In the United States:

      - Moving east means moving toward the Atlantic coast

      - Moving west means moving toward the Pacific coast

      the relative east-west positions of two universities:

      1. Western Kentucky University in Kentucky (KY)

      2. Radford University in Virginia (VA)


      First, I need to think about the general geography of these states. Virginia
      is on the east coast of the United States, while Kentucky is more inland and
      west of Virginia.


      Even though Western Kentucky University has "Western" in its name, that''s referring
      to its location within Kentucky (western part of Kentucky), not its location
      relative to other states.


      So generally speaking:

      - Virginia is east of Kentucky

      - Radford University is in Virginia

      - Western Kentucky University is in Kentucky


      Based on the general state locations, Western Kentucky University would be west
      of Radford University, not east of it.


      To be thorough, I should consider if there''s any unusual geography that might
      make this tricky (like if Western Kentucky University was in the far eastern
      part of Kentucky and Radford was in the far western part of Virginia), but even
      in that case, the state boundary positions would likely maintain the west-east
      relationship.</think># Is Western Kentucky University, KY located east of Radford
      University, VA?


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of these
      two universities and their states.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' locations.

      - Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - Kentucky (KY) is located to the west of Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider the specific universities.

      - Western Kentucky University is in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

      - Radford University is in Radford, Virginia.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Even though Western Kentucky University has "Western" in its name (referring
      to its location within Kentucky), the entire state of Kentucky lies to the west
      of Virginia.

      - Radford University, being in Virginia, is therefore east of Western Kentucky
      University.


      NO, Western Kentucky University is not located east of Radford University. It
      is located west of Radford University.'

      To answer this, I need to think about the relative positions of these two universities
      on a map of the United States.


      First, I need to determine the locations:

      - Western Kentucky University is in Bowling Green, Kentucky

      - Radford University is in Radford, Virginia


      Now I need to consider the geographic positions of these states:

      - Kentucky is generally west of Virginia (Virginia is on the east coast, while
      Kentucky is more inland)

      - The "Western" in Western Kentucky University suggests it''s in the western
      part of Kentucky, which would place it even further west relative to Virginia


      On a map of the US, if we move from west to east, we would generally go from
      Kentucky to Virginia, not the other way around. This means that Western Kentucky
      University would be west of Radford University, not east of it.

      Kentucky is located to the west of Virginia. Virginia is on the east coast of
      the United States, while Kentucky is more inland.


      Step 2: Consider the locations within their states.

      Western Kentucky University is in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in the western part

      Radford University is in Radford, Virginia, in the western portion of Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a map.

      Even though Radford is in western Virginia, Virginia as a whole is east of Kentucky.
      Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter Kentucky
      before Virginia.


      NO, Western Kentucky University is not located east of Radford University. It

      To determine if Anderson University (IN) is east of Delaware County Community
      College (PA), I''ll need to identify the geographic locations of both institutions.


      1. Anderson University is located in Anderson, Indiana (IN)

      2. Delaware County Community College is located in Delaware County, Pennsylvania
      (PA)


      Looking at the geographic orientation of these states:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast region of the United States


      When comparing the positions of these states, Pennsylvania is clearly east of
      Indiana on a map of the United States. This means that institutions in Indiana
      would generally be west of institutions in Pennsylvania.


      Even though Anderson University is in the eastern part of Indiana, it would
      still be west of Delaware County Community College, which is located in eastern
      Pennsylvania.


      NO, Anderson University in Indiana is not located east of Delaware County Community
      College in Pennsylvania.'

      in Indiana is located east of Delaware County Community College in Pennsylvania,
      I need to find the approximate locations of both institutions and compare their
      east-west positions.


      Anderson University, IN is located in Anderson, Indiana. Indiana is in the Midwest
      region of the United States.


      Delaware County Community College, PA is located in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.
      Pennsylvania is in the Northeast region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Indiana. The United States has its
      eastern coast on the Atlantic Ocean, and as you move west from the Atlantic,
      you encounter (among other states) Pennsylvania and then further west, Indiana.


      So Anderson University in Indiana would be west of Delaware County Community
      College in Pennsylvania, not east.</think>To answer whether Anderson University,
      IN is located east of Delaware County Community College, PA, I need to determine
      the relative geographic positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Anderson University is in Anderson, Indiana (IN)

      - Delaware County Community College is in Delaware County, Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Pennsylvania is significantly east of Indiana on the U.S. map

      - Moving from east to west across the United States, you would encounter Pennsylvania
      before Indiana


      Since Pennsylvania is east of Indiana, Delaware County Community College (PA)
      is east of Anderson University (IN). This means Anderson University is NOT east
      of Delaware County Community College, but rather west of it.

      Geographically:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Looking at a US map, Pennsylvania is clearly east of Indiana. Since Anderson
      University is in Indiana and Delaware County Community College is in Pennsylvania,
      Anderson University would be WEST of Delaware County Community College, not

      - Pennsylvania is clearly east of Indiana on the US map

      - Since the institutions are in these respective states, their relative positions
      follow the same pattern


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      - Since Pennsylvania is east of Indiana, Delaware County Community College (PA)
      is east of Anderson University (IN)

      Looking at a mental map of the US, Connecticut is on the east coast, while Ohio
      is more inland and to the west of Connecticut.

      Step 2: Looking at their relative positions on the U.S. map:

      Connecticut is positioned on the East Coast.

      Ohio is positioned inland, west of Connecticut.


      Step 3: When comparing east-west positioning, states closer to the Atlantic
      Ocean are further east than inland states.

      Connecticut borders the Atlantic Ocean.

      Ohio is several states away from the Atlantic, in the interior of the country.

      Let me think through the geographic locations of these universities:


      1) Otterbein University is located in Westerville, Ohio, which is in the central
      part of Ohio.


      2) Lincoln University is located in Chester County, Pennsylvania, which is in
      the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      3) Geographically, Ohio is west of Pennsylvania - Pennsylvania shares its western
      border with Ohio.


      4) Since Otterbein is in Ohio and Lincoln is in Pennsylvania, Otterbein must
      be west of Lincoln, not east.


      Therefore, NO, Otterbein University in Ohio is not located east of Lincoln University
      in Pennsylvania. It is located west of it.'

      Let me think about the geographic locations of Missouri and Ohio:


      Missouri (MO) is in the Midwest United States, generally west of Ohio.

      Ohio (OH) is also in the Midwest United States, but is further east than Missouri.


      Since Rockhurst University is in Missouri and Wittenberg University is in Ohio,

      - Wittenberg University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Missouri is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest, but is positioned further east


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Missouri borders Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma,
      Kansas, and Nebraska

      - Ohio is significantly further east than Missouri on the US map

      - Missouri is west of Ohio, not east of it


      Since Rockhurst University is in Missouri (a western state relative to Ohio),
      and Wittenberg University is in Ohio (an eastern state relative to Missouri),
      Rockhurst University cannot be east of Wittenberg University.

      To solve this, I need to know the locations of both universities and compare
      their east-west positions.


      Midwestern State University of Texas is in Texas (TX). Given the name, it''s
      likely in the mid-western part of Texas.


      Brenau University is in Georgia (GA).


      Geographically, Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while
      Texas is in the south-central/southwestern United States. Generally, Georgia
      is east of Texas on a US map.


      If we''re comparing east-west positions, we''re essentially comparing their
      longitudes. Places further east have lower longitude numbers in the western
      hemisphere.


      Since Georgia is east of Texas on a US map, Brenau University (in Georgia) would
      be east of Midwestern State University (in Texas).


      So, Midwestern State University of Texas is NOT located east of Brenau University.</think>To

      - Texas is located in the south-central/southwestern part of the United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Georgia is clearly east of Texas

      - Therefore, Brenau University (in Georgia) would be east of Midwestern State
      University (in Texas)


      Step 4: Determine if Midwestern State University is east of Brenau University.

      a state in the Midwest region of the United States. It''s located roughly in
      the central part of the country.

      - Western College for Women was located in Oxford, Ohio (it''s now part of Miami
      University)

      - Haverford College is located in Haverford, Pennsylvania (near Philadelphia)


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania on the U.S. map

      - Pennsylvania borders Ohio on Ohio''s eastern side


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Oxford, Ohio is in the southwestern part of Ohio

      - Haverford, Pennsylvania is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania (near
      Philadelphia)


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - A location in southwestern Ohio would be significantly west of a location
      in southeastern Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, Western College for Women would be west of Haverford College, not
      east of it

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia (VA) is on the East Coast of the United States


      Generally speaking, Virginia is east of Ohio. The entire state of Virginia lies
      to the east of Ohio.


      Now, let''s think about the specific universities:

      - Xavier University is in Cincinnati, Ohio, which is in the southwestern part
      of Ohio

      - Stratford University is in Virginia


      Since Virginia is east of Ohio, and Xavier University is in Ohio while Stratford

      - Xavier University is located in Cincinnati, Ohio (OH)

      - Stratford University is located in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and Virginia.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Virginia is located east of Ohio


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, their relative

      - Stratford University (in Virginia) is east of Xavier University (in Ohio)

      - Xavier University (in Ohio) is west of Stratford University (in Virginia)


      NO, Xavier University, OH is not located east of Stratford University, VA. It

      - Stratford University is in Virginia (I need to determine which city)


      Step 2: Determine their relative east-west positions.

      In the US, generally locations further east have higher longitude values (in

      coast while Ohio is more inland.


      Specifically, Cincinnati, Ohio (where Xavier University is located) is in the
      southwestern part of Ohio, while Virginia as a state is entirely east of Ohio.


      So, Stratford University in Virginia would be east of Xavier University in Ohio,

      - Xavier University is located in Cincinnati, Ohio

      - Stratford University was located in Virginia (with campuses in areas like

      ## Step 2: Compare their east-west positions

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast

      - Geographically, Virginia is east of Ohio on the map


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific cities

      - Cincinnati (where Xavier is located) is in the southwestern part of Ohio

      - Stratford''s Virginia locations were in the northern/eastern part of Virginia

      - All of Virginia, including any location where Stratford University operated,
      is east of Cincinnati, Ohio

      Xavier University is located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Cincinnati is in the southwestern

      Now I need to locate Stratford University in Virginia. Hmm, I need to be careful

      Actually, I need to check my knowledge about Stratford University in Virginia.
      I believe Stratford University was a for-profit institution with multiple campuses
      in Virginia, primarily in northern Virginia (near DC) and in the Richmond area.


      Given that Ohio is west of Virginia generally speaking, and Cincinnati (where

      Lee College is in Texas. Texas is generally west of Louisiana in the United
      States.

      New Orleans University (assuming this refers to the University of New Orleans)
      is in New Orleans, Louisiana.


      Given the general geography of the United States, Texas is to the west of Louisiana.
      However, I need to be more precise since we''re talking about specific locations
      within these states.


      Lee College is located in Baytown, Texas, which is in the eastern part of Texas,
      near Houston.

      New Orleans is in the southeastern part of Louisiana.


      Even though Lee College is in eastern Texas, Louisiana is still east of Texas.
      New Orleans is quite far east in Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast. Baytown, Texas
      (where Lee College is) is also near the Gulf Coast, but would still be west

      - Lee College is in Baytown, Texas

      - New Orleans University (assuming this refers to the University of New Orleans)

    771bf8b6-068f-4f2d-90dc-1ed1f75f76b4: '<think>I need to determine the locations
      of two colleges and compare them:

      1. Lee College in TX (Texas)

      2. New Orleans University in LA (Louisiana)


      First, let me check if these colleges exist and determine their exact locations.


      Lee College is a community college in Baytown, Texas, which is near Houston
      in the eastern part of Texas.


      For New Orleans University in LA, I need to check if this is a real institution.
      I''m not immediately certain there is a college with exactly this name. There
      is University of New Orleans, Tulane University in New Orleans, Loyola University
      New Orleans, and other institutions in New Orleans, but I''m not immediately
      recalling one called "New Orleans University."


      For this geographical comparison, I''ll assume the question is referring to
      a university in New Orleans, Louisiana.


      Now for the geographical comparison:

      - New Orleans, Louisiana is located in southeastern Louisiana

      - Baytown, Texas (where Lee College is) is east of Houston in eastern Texas


      Looking at a map of the United States, Louisiana is east of Texas. Within these
      states, New Orleans is in the eastern part of Louisiana, while Baytown is in
      the eastern part of Texas. Even though both are in the eastern parts of their
      respective states, Louisiana as a whole is east of Texas, which means New Orleans
      would be east of Baytown.


      So Lee College in Baytown, TX would be WEST of New Orleans, not east of it.</think>#
      Determining if Lee College, TX is east of New Orleans University, LA


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographical locations of both
      institutions and compare their positions on an east-west axis.


      ## Step 1: Locate both institutions

      - Lee College is located in Baytown, Texas, which is in the eastern part of
      Texas near Houston

      - While there isn''t precisely a "New Orleans University," there are several
      universities in New Orleans, Louisiana (like University of New Orleans, Tulane,
      etc.)


      ## Step 2: Compare the east-west positions

      - New Orleans, Louisiana is in the southeastern part of Louisiana

      - Louisiana is located east of Texas on the US map

      - Even though Lee College is in eastern Texas, it is still west of any institution
      in New Orleans, Louisiana


      ## Step 3: Make the determination

      Looking at their positions on a map, Lee College in Texas is clearly west of
      any university in New Orleans, not east of it.

      1. Lee College in TX (Texas)

      2. New Orleans University in LA (Louisiana)


      Then I need to compare their east-west positions to determine if Lee College
      is east of New Orleans University.


      First, let me identify Lee College in Texas. Lee College is in Baytown, Texas,
      which is near Houston in the eastern part of Texas.


      Now for New Orleans University in Louisiana. There''s a potential issue here
      - I don''t believe there is currently an institution called "New Orleans University"
      in Louisiana. There are several universities in New Orleans such as:

      - University of New Orleans

      - Tulane University

      - Loyola University New Orleans

      - Xavier University of Louisiana

      - Dillard University


      But not specifically "New Orleans University."


      For the sake of this question, I''ll assume they''re referring to an institution
      in New Orleans, Louisiana.


      Now to compare:

      - New Orleans, Louisiana is located in southeastern Louisiana

      - Baytown, Texas (home of Lee College) is located east of Houston in eastern
      Texas


      Looking at a map of the United States, Louisiana is east of Texas. New Orleans
      is in the southeastern part of Louisiana, while Baytown is in the eastern part
      of Texas.


      Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and New Orleans is in eastern Louisiana, while
      Baytown is in eastern Texas, New Orleans would be east of Baytown.


      Therefore, Lee College (in Baytown, TX) would be WEST of any university in New
      Orleans, LA - not east of it.</think># Is Lee College, TX located east of New
      Orleans University, LA?


      To solve this question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions
      of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Lee College is in Baytown, Texas, which is near Houston in the eastern part
      of Texas.

      - For New Orleans University in Louisiana (assuming this refers to a university
      in New Orleans), it would be located in New Orleans, which is in southeastern
      Louisiana.


      ## Step 2: Compare east-west positions

      - Looking at a US map, Louisiana is east of Texas.

      - New Orleans is located in the southeastern part of Louisiana.

      - Baytown (where Lee College is) is in the eastern part of Texas.


      ## Step 3: Determine relative position

      - Even though both are in the eastern parts of their respective states, New
      Orleans is still significantly east of Baytown.

      - Since Lee College is in Texas (west) and New Orleans is in Louisiana (east),
      Lee College cannot be east of New Orleans.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the southwestern/south-central United States

      - Georgia is positioned east of Texas on the U.S. map


      ## Step 3: Draw a conclusion

      Since Georgia is east of Texas, and the colleges are in their respective states,

      Now, I need to think about the geographical positions of Texas and Georgia in
      the United States:

      - Texas is in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United States


      Looking at a map of the US, Georgia is definitely east of Texas. The entire
      state of Georgia is east of the entire state of Texas.


      Since Jarvis Christian College is in Texas, and Altamaha Technical College is
      in Georgia, Jarvis Christian College would be west of Altamaha Technical College,
      not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Jarvis Christian College is not located east of
      Altamaha Technical College. It''s actually west of it.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two
      colleges.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each college is located.

      - Jarvis Christian College is in Texas (TX)

      - Altamaha Technical College is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the southwestern/south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Georgia is clearly east of Texas.
      The easternmost point of Texas is still west of the westernmost point of Georgia.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the colleges.

      Since Jarvis Christian College is in Texas and Altamaha Technical College is
      in Georgia, Jarvis Christian College must be west (not east) of Altamaha Technical
      College.

      Jarvis Christian College is in Texas (TX). It''s located in Hawkins, Texas,
      which is in the eastern part of Texas.


      Altamaha Technical College is in Georgia (GA). Georgia is located east of Texas

      of Mexico but further west.


      Now, to determine which one is further east, I need to compare their longitudes.
      Places further east have lower longitude numbers (in the western hemisphere).


      Even though Jarvis Christian College is in eastern Texas, Georgia as a state
      is entirely east of Texas. So Altamaha Technical College in Georgia would be
      east of Jarvis Christian College in Texas.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Georgia within the United
      States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Georgia is significantly east of Texas on the U.S. map

      - Even the easternmost parts of Texas are west of the westernmost parts of Georgia


      Step 4: Since Altamaha Technical College is in Georgia and Jarvis Christian

      University in Illinois is east of Walsh University in Ohio, I need to know the
      locations of both universities.


      National Louis University is in Illinois (IL), and Walsh University is in Ohio
      (OH).


      Let me think about the relative geographic positions of Illinois and Ohio. In
      the United States, Ohio is generally east of Illinois. Illinois borders Lake
      Michigan to the northeast, and is west of Indiana, which in turn is west of
      Ohio. So Ohio is east of Illinois.


      Since National Louis University is in Illinois and Walsh University is in Ohio,
      and Ohio is east of Illinois, then Walsh University would be east of National
      Louis University, not the other way around.


      Let me double-check this reasoning. Going from west to east in this region,
      we have:

      - Illinois

      - Indiana

      - Ohio


      So National Louis University (in Illinois) would be west of Walsh University
      (in Ohio), not east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative locations
      of these two universities by identifying which states they''re in and their
      geographic relationship.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - National Louis University is in Illinois (IL)

      - Walsh University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Illinois and Ohio.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Illinois is located west of Ohio. Ohio
      borders Lake Erie to the north and Pennsylvania to the east, while Illinois
      borders the Mississippi River to the west and Lake Michigan to the northeast.


      Step 3: Compare the positions.

      Since Illinois is west of Ohio, and National Louis University is in Illinois
      while Walsh University is in Ohio, National Louis University must be west of
      Walsh University, not east.

      2. George Wythe University in Utah (UT)


      First, let me think about where these places are located:


      Bay Area Medical Academy is in the Bay Area of California, which is on the west
      coast of the United States. The Bay Area generally refers to the San Francisco
      Bay Area, which is in the western part of California.


      George Wythe University is in Utah (UT). Utah is a state located east of California,
      in the mountain west region of the United States.


      When asking if one location is east of another in the US, we''re asking if it''s
      closer to the East Coast (or farther from the West Coast).


      Since California is on the west coast and Utah is further inland (to the east),
      locations in Utah would generally be east of locations in California.


      So George Wythe University in Utah would be east of Bay Area Medical Academy
      in California, not the other way around.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Bay Area Medical Academy is in California (CA), specifically in the San Francisco
      Bay Area.

      - George Wythe University is in Utah (UT).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Utah is inland, to the east of California.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - All of Utah is east of the San Francisco Bay Area in California.

      - Therefore, George Wythe University (in Utah) must be east of Bay Area Medical
      Academy (in California).


      Step 4: Determine if Bay Area Medical Academy is east of George Wythe University.

      - Since George Wythe University is east of Bay Area Medical Academy, the reverse
      cannot be true.

      the relative locations of two universities in the US: Texas Southern University
      in Texas (TX) and Xavier University of Louisiana in Louisiana (LA).


      I need to determine which one is further east.


      Let''s think about the geographic locations of Texas and Louisiana in the United
      States:

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US

      - Louisiana is to the east of Texas, along the Gulf Coast


      Since Louisiana is east of Texas geographically, and Xavier University is in
      Louisiana while Texas Southern University is in Texas, Xavier University of
      Louisiana would be east of Texas Southern University.


      So to answer the question "Is Texas Southern University, TX located east of

      Is Texas Southern University, TX located east of Xavier University of Louisiana,
      LA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.

      1) First, let me identify the states: Texas Southern University is in Texas
      (TX), and Xavier University of Louisiana is in Louisiana (LA).


      2) Geographically, Louisiana is located directly east of Texas on the US map.


      3) Texas Southern University is in Houston, Texas, while Xavier University of

      5) The question asks if Texas Southern University is east of Xavier University,
      which would be the opposite of their actual positions.

      1. Gateway Community and Technical College is located in Kentucky (KY).

      2. Thomas Jefferson University is located in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Now I need to determine the specific locations within those states and their
      relative east-west positions.


      Gateway Community and Technical College (in Kentucky) appears to be in the northern
      part of Kentucky, near Cincinnati, Ohio.


      Thomas Jefferson University is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which
      is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Looking at the map of the United States, Pennsylvania is significantly east
      of Kentucky. Philadelphia, PA is on the eastern edge of Pennsylvania, close
      to the Atlantic coast, while northern Kentucky is in the midwest region.


      So Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, PA would be located east of
      Gateway Community and Technical College in Kentucky.


      If Thomas Jefferson is east of Gateway, then Gateway is NOT east of Thomas Jefferson.</think>I

      Step 2: Determine their specific locations within these states.

      - Gateway Community and Technical College is located in northern Kentucky, near
      the Cincinnati area

      - Thomas Jefferson University is located in Philadelphia, in eastern Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Compare their longitude positions.

      - Pennsylvania is located east of Kentucky on the US map

      - Philadelphia is on the eastern side of Pennsylvania, relatively close to the
      Atlantic coast

      - Northern Kentucky is in the Midwest region, significantly west of Philadelphia


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Thomas Jefferson University (in Philadelphia, PA) is located east of Gateway
      Community and Technical College (in northern KY), Gateway is NOT east of Thomas
      Jefferson.

      First, let me establish the locations:

      - Concordia University Portland is in Portland, Oregon (OR)

      - Montana State University is in Bozeman, Montana (MT)


      Now I need to think about their relative locations. Oregon is on the West Coast
      of the United States, and Montana is in the northwestern US, but inland from
      the coast.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Oregon is west of Montana

      - Portland is in the northwestern part of Oregon

      - Bozeman (where Montana State University is located) is in the southern part

      - Concordia University Portland was in Portland, Oregon (OR)

      - Montana State University is in Bozeman, Montana (MT)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Oregon and Montana.

      - Oregon is on the West Coast of the United States

      - Montana is an inland state in the northwestern United States

      - Oregon is located entirely west of Montana on a map


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Portland is in the northwestern part of Oregon

      - Bozeman (where Montana State University is located) is in southern Montana

      - The entire state of Oregon is still west of Montana


      Since Concordia University Portland was located in Oregon, which is west of
      Montana, it cannot be east of Montana State University.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is
      in the Northeast.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      On a map of the United States, New York is positioned to the east of Ohio. Since

      Northeast.


      Ohio is west of New York State. New York is on the eastern seaboard of the United

      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - States along the Atlantic coast (like New York) are further east than Midwestern
      states (like Ohio)

      - New York is positioned east of Ohio on the map of the United States

      to figure out the relative locations of Lincoln College in Illinois and Urbana
      University in Ohio.


      First, let me think about the states:

      - Lincoln College is in Illinois (IL)

      - Urbana University is in Ohio (OH)


      In the United States, Ohio is east of Illinois. Illinois borders Lake Michigan
      on the east, and then moving eastward you''d encounter Indiana and then Ohio.


      Since Lincoln College is in Illinois, and Urbana University is in Ohio, and
      Ohio is east of Illinois, that means that Urbana University would be east of
      Lincoln College.


      The question asks if Lincoln College is east of Urbana University. Since Lincoln
      College is in Illinois (west) and Urbana University is in Ohio (east), Lincoln
      College is NOT east of Urbana University. It''s actually west of it.</think>#
      Is Lincoln College, IL located east of Urbana University, OH?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two colleges based on their
      states.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each college is located.

      - Lincoln College is in Illinois (IL)

      - Urbana University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Illinois and Ohio.

      - On a U.S. map, Ohio is located east of Illinois

      - Illinois and Ohio are not adjacent (Indiana lies between them)


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the colleges.

      - Since Lincoln College is in Illinois (western state)

      - And Urbana University is in Ohio (eastern state)

      - Lincoln College must be west of Urbana University, not east


      NO'

      - Illinois (IL) is a state in the Midwest, west of Ohio (OH)

      - Ohio (OH) is also in the Midwest, but east of Illinois


      Since Lincoln College is in Illinois, and Urbana University is in Ohio, and
      Illinois is west of Ohio, then Lincoln College would be west of Urbana University,
      not east.


      Therefore, Lincoln College, IL is NOT located east of Urbana University, OH.
      It is located west of it.</think>To determine if Lincoln College, IL is located
      east of Urbana University, OH, I need to examine the geographic positions of

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest, but is further east, bordering Pennsylvania

      - On a US map, Illinois is west of Ohio


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      Since Lincoln College is in Illinois, and Urbana University is in Ohio, and
      Illinois is west of Ohio, Lincoln College must be west of Urbana University,
      not east of it.

      - Pittsburgh/Moon Township is in the western part of Pennsylvania

      - Atlantic City/Galloway is in the eastern part of New Jersey, near the Atlantic
      coast


      Given that New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, and especially considering that
      Stockton is in eastern NJ while Robert Morris is in western PA, Stockton University
      would be considerably east of Robert Morris University.


      So the answer would be NO - Robert Morris University is NOT east of Stockton
      University. In fact, it''s the opposite - Stockton University is east of Robert
      Morris University.</think>To answer this question, I''ll determine the relative
      locations of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Robert Morris University is located in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, which
      is near Pittsburgh in the western part of Pennsylvania.

      - Stockton University is located in Galloway, New Jersey, which is near Atlantic
      City on the eastern coast of New Jersey.


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of New Jersey.

      - Pittsburgh/Moon Township is in the western portion of Pennsylvania.

      - Galloway/Atlantic City is on the eastern coast of New Jersey, directly adjacent
      to the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Determine which is further east.

      - Given that New Jersey is already east of Pennsylvania, and Stockton is on
      the eastern coast of New Jersey, Stockton University is significantly east of
      Robert Morris University.


      NO, Robert Morris University is not east of Stockton University. It is west
      of it.'

      of both universities and then figure out their relative positions east-west.


      Robert Morris University is in Pennsylvania (PA). Let me think about where in
      Pennsylvania it''s located. I believe it''s in the western part of Pennsylvania,
      near Pittsburgh.


      Stockton University is in New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania,
      along the Atlantic coast. Stockton University is in southern New Jersey, in
      or near Atlantic City.


      Given that Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, and Robert Morris is in western
      Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh), while Stockton is in New Jersey (which is entirely
      east of Pennsylvania), Robert Morris University is definitely west of Stockton
      University.


      So if Robert Morris is west of Stockton, then Stockton is east of Robert Morris.

      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of New Jersey.

      - Pittsburgh area (western PA) is significantly west of Atlantic City area (eastern
      NJ).

      - On a map, Robert Morris University would be to the west of Stockton University.


      Step 3: Determine if Robert Morris is east of Stockton.

      - Since Robert Morris is to the west of Stockton, it is not east of Stockton.

      Let me think about the geography of these states:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is west of New Jersey (NJ)

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast, while Pennsylvania is inland


      Since Robert Morris University is in Pennsylvania and Stockton University is
      in New Jersey, the general state locations would suggest that Robert Morris
      is west of Stockton.


      However, I should be more specific about the locations of these universities
      within their states:


      Robert Morris University is located in Moon Township, which is near Pittsburgh
      in western Pennsylvania.


      Stockton University is in Galloway, New Jersey, which is near Atlantic City
      in the southeastern part of New Jersey.


      Given these specific locations:

      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

      - Pennsylvania is located west of New Jersey.

      - New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side, while Pennsylvania
      is inland.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within each state.

      - Robert Morris being in western Pennsylvania puts it even further west relative
      to New Jersey.

      - Stockton being in eastern New Jersey puts it close to the Atlantic coast,
      on the eastern side of the state.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      - Moving from Robert Morris to Stockton would require traveling eastward, not
      westward.

      the Atlantic Ocean to the east. In this arrangement:

      - Nebraska is in the Midwest region

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest but positioned further east


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      Bellevue, Nebraska is positioned in eastern Nebraska, but even the easternmost
      part of Nebraska is still west of Ohio.

      Lima, Ohio is in the northwestern part of Ohio, but even this western portion
      of Ohio is still east of Nebraska.


      ## Conclusion

      Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, NE is NOT east of Ohio State University-Lima Campus,
      OH. It is west of it.

      Vermont and Maine are both in the northeastern United States, with Vermont being
      west of New Hampshire, and Maine being east of New Hampshire. Maine is the easternmost
      state in the continental US.


      Step 2: Locate the specific institutions.

      Community College of Vermont is in Vermont, while University of Maine at Machias
      is in Machias, Maine, which is located in eastern Maine near the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Since Vermont is west of Maine, and Machias is in the eastern part of Maine,
      the Community College of Vermont must be west of the University of Maine at
      Machias, not east of it.

      locations of these two institutions. Let me break it down:


      1. Community College of Vermont (VT) is in Vermont

      2. University of Maine at Machias (ME) is in Maine


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider the geographical positions
      of Vermont and Maine in the United States.


      Vermont is in New England, bordering New Hampshire to its east and New York
      to its west. Maine is also in New England, and is the easternmost state in the
      contiguous United States. Maine is located to the east of Vermont.


      Since Maine is east of Vermont, and the University of Maine at Machias is in
      Maine, while the Community College of Vermont is in Vermont, the University
      of Maine at Machias would be east of the Community College of Vermont (not the
      other way around).


      So the answer would be NO - Community College of Vermont is NOT located east
      of University of Maine at Machias. Rather, it''s located to the west of it.</think>To
      determine whether Community College of Vermont is east of University of Maine

      - Community College of Vermont is in Vermont (VT)

      - University of Maine at Machias is in Maine (ME)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Maine is the easternmost state in the contiguous United States

      - Vermont is located west of Maine (with New Hampshire in between)


      Step 3: Since Vermont is west of Maine, any location in Vermont would be west
      of a location in Maine.


      Step 4: Therefore, Community College of Vermont is located west (not east) of
      University of Maine at Machias.

      the relative east-west positioning of two colleges:

      1. Community College of Vermont (CCV) in Vermont

      2. University of Maine at Machias in Maine


      To determine which is more eastern, I need to know the approximate longitudes
      of these locations. Generally speaking:

      - Vermont is west of Maine in the US

      - Maine is the easternmost state in the continental US


      Let me be more specific:

      - Community College of Vermont (CCV) is located in Vermont, which borders New
      Hampshire to its east

      - University of Maine at Machias is in Maine, which is east of New Hampshire


      So the general geography would suggest that the University of Maine at Machias
      is east of Community College of Vermont.


      However, I should note that CCV has multiple locations across Vermont, so I
      should consider their main campus or administrative headquarters. But regardless
      of which CCV campus we''re talking about, Vermont as a state is entirely west
      of Maine, so any location in Vermont would be west of Machias, Maine.

      between them.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations.

      Community College of Vermont is located in Vermont, regardless of which campus
      we''re considering.

      University of Maine at Machias is located in Machias, which is in eastern Maine.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      Since all of Vermont is west of Maine, and Machias is in the eastern part of
      Maine, the Community College of Vermont must be west of the University of Maine
      at Machias.


      Since the question asks if CCV is east of UMaine-Machias, the answer is:

      - Vermont borders New Hampshire to its east and New York to its west

      - Maine is east of New Hampshire


      So generally speaking, Maine is east of Vermont. Specifically, Machias is in
      eastern Maine, near the coast. Community College of Vermont may have multiple

      Step 3: Consider the specific location of Machias within Maine.

      - Machias is located in eastern Maine, near the Atlantic coast, making it very
      far east.

      - Even the easternmost parts of Vermont would still be west of Machias, Maine.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion based on these geographic positions.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Reinhardt University is in Georgia (GA)

      - Wingate University is in North Carolina (NC)


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider the general geography
      of these states. Georgia and North Carolina are both on the east coast of the
      United States.


      North Carolina is generally north of Georgia. But the question is about east-west
      positioning, not north-south.


      North Carolina is typically considered to be northeast of Georgia. Looking at
      a mental map of the US:

      - Georgia''s eastern border touches the Atlantic Ocean

      - North Carolina''s eastern border also touches the Atlantic Ocean

      - Moving from Georgia to North Carolina, you typically move northeast


      However, these are large states and the specific locations of the universities
      within their states matter. Let me think about where these universities are
      located within their states:


      Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia, which is in the northern
      part of Georgia.

      Wingate University is located in Wingate, North Carolina, which is in the southern
      part of North Carolina.


      Specifically, Waleska, GA is northwest of Atlanta, so it''s in the northwest
      part of Georgia.

      Wingate, NC is east of Charlotte, NC, so it''s in the south-central part of
      North Carolina.


      Given these locations, Wingate University would likely be east of Reinhardt
      University, since:

      1. North Carolina extends further east than northern Georgia does

      2. Wingate is in the central part of NC, while Reinhardt is in the northwest

      ## Step 2: Consider their positions within their states

      - Waleska, GA is in the northwest part of Georgia, west of Atlanta

      - Wingate, NC is east of Charlotte, in the south-central part of North Carolina


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - Georgia is generally west of North Carolina when comparing equivalent regions

      - Reinhardt''s location in northwest Georgia puts it further west than Wingate''s
      location in south-central North Carolina

      - Looking at a map, Wingate University would be to the east of Reinhardt University


      NO - Reinhardt University is NOT east of Wingate University. Reinhardt is actually

      in Georgia is east of Wingate University in North Carolina, I need to find the
      relative positions of these two universities.


      First, let me identify where these universities are located:

      - Reinhardt University is in Georgia (GA)

      - Wingate University is in North Carolina (NC)


      Now, to be more specific:

      - Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia

      - Wingate University is in Wingate, North Carolina


      Looking at the geographic positions of these states and cities:

      - Georgia is generally south of North Carolina

      - But the question is about east/west positioning, not north/south


      Georgia is generally to the west of North Carolina. North Carolina''s western
      border touches Tennessee, while Georgia is west of that. However, I need to
      consider the specific locations of these universities within their states.


      Reinhardt University in Waleska, GA is in the northern part of Georgia.

      Wingate University in Wingate, NC is in the southern part of North Carolina,
      not far from the South Carolina border.


      Waleska, GA is in the northwest part of Georgia.

      Wingate, NC is in the south-central part of North Carolina, east of Charlotte.


      Based on these locations, Reinhardt University would be west of Wingate University,
      not east.</think># Is Reinhardt University, GA located east of Wingate University,
      NC?


      I''ll determine this by finding the geographic positions of both universities.


      Step 1: Locate both universities.

      - Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia

      - Wingate University is in Wingate, North Carolina


      Step 2: Determine their east-west positioning.

      - Waleska, GA is in the northwest part of Georgia

      - Wingate, NC is in the south-central part of North Carolina (east of Charlotte)


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Georgia is generally west of North Carolina on a map

      - More specifically, Waleska (in northwest GA) is west of Wingate (in south-central
      NC)


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Reinhardt University is located to the west of Wingate University, not
      to the east, the answer is:

      of two universities: Reinhardt University in Georgia (GA) and Wingate University
      in North Carolina (NC).


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their relative positions
      on a map, specifically their longitudes. In the US, lower (more negative) longitude
      values are further west, while higher (less negative) longitude values are further
      east.


      Let me consider the general geography of Georgia and North Carolina:

      - Georgia is generally south and slightly west of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast

      - Georgia also has some Atlantic coastline, but is overall more western than
      North Carolina


      Reinhardt University is in Georgia, which is generally southwest of North Carolina.
      Wingate University is in North Carolina.


      More specifically:

      - Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia, which is in the northern part
      of Georgia

      - Wingate University is in Wingate, North Carolina, which is in the southern
      part of North Carolina


      Without exact coordinates, my geographical knowledge suggests that Reinhardt
      University in northern Georgia would be west of Wingate University in southern
      North Carolina. This is because North Carolina is generally east of Georgia,
      especially when comparing northern Georgia to southern North Carolina.


      So, Reinhardt University is likely NOT east of Wingate University, but rather
      west of it.</think># Is Reinhardt University, GA located east of Wingate University,
      NC?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia (GA)

      - Wingate University is in Wingate, North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Georgia is generally positioned to the southwest of North Carolina. When we
      look at a map of the eastern United States, North Carolina is located east of
      Georgia.


      ## Step 3: Look at specific locations

      - Waleska, GA (where Reinhardt is located) is in northern Georgia

      - Wingate, NC is in southern North Carolina

      - Even though these are in the northern part of GA and southern part of NC respectively,
      the entire state of NC is still positioned eastward of northern GA


      ## Step 4: Determine relative position

      Since Georgia is west of North Carolina, and Reinhardt University is in Georgia
      while Wingate University is in North Carolina, Reinhardt University must be
      west (not east) of Wingate University.

      - Midwest states (including Kentucky)

      - Appalachian region

      - Eastern seaboard (including Virginia)


      Virginia is on the Atlantic coast, while Kentucky is inland and west of Virginia.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Generally, Virginia is east of Kentucky


      Step 3: More specifically, Owensboro is in western Kentucky, near the Indiana
      border

      - Virginia Beach (where Regent University is located) is on the Atlantic coast

      - This puts Regent University even further east


      Step 4: Looking at a US map, any location in Kentucky (including Owensboro)

      - Kentucky is an inland state west of Virginia

      - Virginia Beach is on the far eastern edge of Virginia

      - Owensboro is in western Kentucky

      Step 1: Locate Owensboro Community and Technical College, KY.

      Owensboro is a city in Kentucky, which is generally in the central-eastern part
      of the United States. Within Kentucky, Owensboro is in the western part of the
      state.

      Since Virginia is east of Kentucky, and specifically Virginia Beach is on the
      eastern coast, while Owensboro is in western Kentucky, Regent University would
      be east of Owensboro Community and Technical College.

      - Regent University is in Virginia Beach, Virginia


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - Kentucky is located in the central-eastern United States

      - Virginia is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      - More specifically, Owensboro is in the western part of Kentucky

      - Virginia Beach is on the eastern coast of Virginia


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Virginia is east of Kentucky on the US map

      - Virginia Beach (where Regent University is) is on the far eastern coast

      - Owensboro (in western Kentucky) is significantly west of Virginia Beach


      NO, Owensboro Community and Technical College in Kentucky is NOT located east

      Specifically, it''s asking if the first college is located east of the second

      To determine this, I need to know the general geographical locations of these

      Texas is located in the south-central United States, west of Georgia.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, east of Texas.


      Even without knowing the exact locations of these specific colleges within their

      So the question is asking if the Texas college is east of the Georgia university,
      which would be incorrect.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the geographic locations of both institutions and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each college is located.

      - The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas (TX)

      - Fort Valley State University is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of Texas and Georgia.

      On a map of the United States, Georgia is located on the southeastern part of
      the country, while Texas is in the south-central region. Georgia is significantly
      east of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare the positions.

      Since The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas, and Fort
      Valley State University is in Georgia, and Georgia is east of Texas, the Texas
      college cannot be east of the Georgia college.


      NO


      The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More in Texas is NOT located east
      of Fort Valley State University in Georgia. It is actually located west of it.'

      First, let me determine where each university is located:


      - The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas (TX). Texas is
      in the southwestern United States.

      - Fort Valley State University is in Georgia (GA). Georgia is in the southeastern
      United States.

      - Texas is located west of Georgia


      Since the College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas (west) and
      Fort Valley State University is in Georgia (east), the College is NOT east of
      Fort Valley State. Rather, it is west of it.


      The specific cities within these states wouldn''t change this conclusion because
      the entire state of Texas is west of the entire state of Georgia.</think>To

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the southwestern United States

      - Georgia is clearly east of Texas on the US map


      Step 3: Determine relative positioning.

      Since the College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas, and Fort
      Valley State University is in Georgia, the Texas institution must be west of
      the Georgia institution (not east of it).

      State University, KS located east of Indiana University Southeast, IN?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographical locations of both
      universities and compare their positions along an east-west axis.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Wichita State University is in Kansas (KS)

      - Indiana University Southeast is in Indiana (IN)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative positions of these states

      The United States is arranged with states generally becoming more eastern as
      you move right on a map. Kansas is located in the central United States, while
      Indiana is in the Midwest region but further east.


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Kansas is positioned to the west of Indiana on the map of the United States.
      Since Wichita State University is in Kansas and Indiana University Southeast
      is in Indiana, the Kansas institution must be west of the Indiana institution.


      NO, Wichita State University is not located east of Indiana University Southeast.
      It is located west of it.'

      to determine the relative east-west positioning of two universities:

      1. University of Northern Colorado in Colorado (CO)

      2. University of Nebraska-Lincoln in Nebraska (NE)


      Let me think about the general geographic positioning of these states:

      - Colorado is located directly west of Nebraska in the United States

      - Nebraska is east of Colorado


      Now for the specific cities:

      - University of Northern Colorado is in Greeley, CO

      - University of Nebraska-Lincoln is in Lincoln, NE


      Since Colorado is west of Nebraska, and these cities don''t have unusual positioning
      that would contradict their states'' relative positions (like if one were on
      the far eastern edge and one on the far western edge), the University of Northern
      Colorado would be west of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.


      Therefore, University of Northern Colorado is NOT east of University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
      It is west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Northern Colorado is in Greeley, Colorado

      - University of Nebraska-Lincoln is in Lincoln, Nebraska


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Colorado and Nebraska.

      - Colorado is located directly west of Nebraska

      - Nebraska is east of Colorado


      Step 3: Determine the specific positions of these cities within their states.

      - Greeley is in northern Colorado

      - Lincoln is in eastern Nebraska


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Colorado is west of Nebraska, and these cities follow their states'' general
      geographic relationship (neither is in an unusual position that would reverse
      this relationship), the University of Northern Colorado must be west of the
      University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

      Let me think about where these universities are located:


      1. University of Northern Colorado (UNC) is located in Greeley, Colorado

      2. University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) is located in Lincoln, Nebraska


      Now I need to determine which is further east. In the United States, Nebraska
      is east of Colorado. Colorado borders Nebraska on Nebraska''s western border.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Colorado is directly west of Nebraska

      - Nebraska is directly east of Colorado


      Therefore, any location in Nebraska would generally be east of a location in
      Colorado.


      To be more specific:

      - Greeley, CO (where UNC is located) is in northern Colorado

      - Lincoln, NE (where UNL is located) is in eastern Nebraska


      Since Nebraska is east of Colorado, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln must
      be east of the University of Northern Colorado.


      So the answer is NO - University of Northern Colorado is NOT located east of
      University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Rather, it''s the opposite: University of Nebraska-Lincoln

      - Colorado and Nebraska are neighboring states

      - Colorado is located directly west of Nebraska

      - Nebraska is located directly east of Colorado


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geography to the specific universities.

      - Since Greeley, CO is in Colorado, and Lincoln, NE is in Nebraska

      - And Colorado is west of Nebraska

      - Then University of Northern Colorado must be west of University of Nebraska-Lincoln

      - Louisiana is in the southeastern part of the US, but it''s west of Georgia

      - Georgia is on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern US

      - Georgia is east of Louisiana


      Since Georgia is east of Louisiana, Clayton State University (in Georgia) would

      - University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Monroe, Louisiana (LA)

      - Clayton State University is in Morrow, Georgia (GA)


      In the United States, Georgia is located east of Louisiana. Georgia is on the

      1. University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM) is located in Monroe, Louisiana (LA).

      2. Clayton State University is located in Morrow, Georgia (GA).


      I need to figure out which one is further east.


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Louisiana in the United States. Louisiana
      is in the southeastern part of the country, but Georgia is even further east
      along the Atlantic coast.


      To be more precise:

      - Monroe, LA is in the northeastern part of Louisiana

      - Morrow, GA (where Clayton State is located) is in the north-central part of
      Georgia, near Atlanta


      Even though Monroe is in the eastern part of Louisiana, Georgia as a state is
      entirely east of Louisiana. So Clayton State University in Georgia would be
      east of University of Louisiana at Monroe.

      ## Step 1: Identify locations

      - University of Louisiana at Monroe is in Monroe, Louisiana

      - Clayton State University is in Morrow, Georgia (near Atlanta)


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions

      - Louisiana is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - On a map of the US, Georgia is positioned to the east of Louisiana


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      2. Clayton State University is located in Morrow, Georgia (GA).


      Now I need to determine which one is further east. In the United States, states

      - East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located east of Illinois on the US map


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - While I don''t know the exact city for Robert Morris University Illinois,
      it would be somewhere in Illinois

      - East Stroudsburg University is in East Stroudsburg, which is in eastern Pennsylvania,
      near the New Jersey border

      Since Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, and East Stroudsburg is in the eastern
      part of Pennsylvania, East Stroudsburg University must be east of Robert Morris
      University Illinois.

      Robert Morris University Illinois (IL) is located east of East Stroudsburg University
      of Pennsylvania (PA). To answer this, I''ll need to determine the geographical
      locations of both universities.


      Let''s think about this in terms of states first:

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (IL)

      - East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      In terms of US geography:

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Illinois. On a west-to-east orientation
      of US states, Illinois is further west than Pennsylvania.


      So if we''re comparing the states, Robert Morris University Illinois (in Illinois)
      would be west of East Stroudsburg University (in Pennsylvania).


      But to be more precise, let''s consider the specific locations within these
      states:

      - Robert Morris University Illinois would likely be in or near Chicago

      - East Stroudsburg University would be in East Stroudsburg, PA, which is in
      eastern Pennsylvania (as the name suggests)


      East Stroudsburg, PA is likely very far east in Pennsylvania (possibly near

      Determining if Robert Morris University Illinois is east of East Stroudsburg
      University


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities
      by looking at their locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (IL)

      - East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region

      - On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is significantly east of Illinois


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within these states

      - Even if Robert Morris University is in the easternmost part of Illinois and
      East Stroudsburg University is in the westernmost part of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania
      as a whole is still east of Illinois

      - In fact, East Stroudsburg is in eastern Pennsylvania (as its name suggests),
      likely near the New Jersey border


      ## Conclusion

      Since Illinois is west of Pennsylvania, Robert Morris University Illinois must
      be west of (not east of) East Stroudsburg University.

      - Michigan is west of New Hampshire

      - Therefore, Spring Arbor University (in Michigan) would be west of the University

      If Spring Arbor University is west of University of New Hampshire at Manchester,
      then it is NOT east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two universities by considering their locations.


      Spring Arbor University is located in Spring Arbor, Michigan (MI). Michigan
      is in the Midwest region of the United States, in the Great Lakes area.


      The University of New Hampshire at Manchester is located in Manchester, New
      Hampshire (NH). New Hampshire is in the New England region, on the northeastern
      coast of the United States.


      Looking at the geographic positions of these states:

      - New Hampshire is positioned along the Atlantic coast in the Northeast

      - Michigan is positioned much further west in the Midwest region


      When comparing east-west positions in the United States, New Hampshire is significantly
      east of Michigan. Since Spring Arbor University is in Michigan and the University
      of New Hampshire at Manchester is in New Hampshire, Spring Arbor University
      must be west (not east) of the University of New Hampshire at Manchester.

      1. Adams State University in Colorado (CO)

      2. Oklahoma Panhandle State University in Oklahoma (OK)


      I need to determine if Adams State is east of Oklahoma Panhandle State.


      First, let me recall the general geography:

      - Colorado is directly west of Kansas

      - Oklahoma is south of Kansas

      - The Oklahoma panhandle is the narrow western strip of Oklahoma that extends
      westward


      Adams State University is in Colorado. Specifically, it''s in Alamosa, which
      is in southern Colorado.


      Oklahoma Panhandle State University would be in the panhandle region of Oklahoma,
      which is the narrow strip in the northwest of the state that borders Colorado,
      Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas.


      Looking at the relative positions, Colorado is generally west of Oklahoma. The
      Oklahoma panhandle extends westward along the southern border of Colorado. Since
      Adams State is in Colorado, and Oklahoma Panhandle State is in the western part
      of Oklahoma, Adams State would be west of Oklahoma Panhandle State, not east.</think>I''ll
      think about the locations of these universities step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado.

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, in the Oklahoma
      Panhandle.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of Colorado and Oklahoma.

      - Colorado is located west of Kansas and north of New Mexico.

      - The Oklahoma Panhandle is a narrow strip extending westward from Oklahoma,
      south of Kansas and east of New Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Colorado is generally west of Oklahoma.

      - Alamosa, Colorado (where Adams State is located) is in south-central Colorado.

      - Goodwell, Oklahoma (where Oklahoma Panhandle State is located) is in the western
      part of the Oklahoma Panhandle.

      - On a map, Alamosa is clearly west of Goodwell.


      NO, Adams State University is NOT located east of Oklahoma Panhandle State University.
      It is located west of it.'

      to determine the geographical locations of these two universities and compare
      them.


      Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado.

      Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma, which
      is in the Oklahoma Panhandle region.


      Now I need to determine if Adams State University is east of Oklahoma Panhandle
      State University.


      Colorado is generally west of Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Panhandle is the westernmost
      part of Oklahoma, bordering the eastern edge of Colorado.


      Alamosa, Colorado (where Adams State University is located) is in the south-central
      part of Colorado. The Oklahoma Panhandle extends westward along the southern
      border of Colorado.


      Given these geographical positions, Adams State University in Alamosa, CO would
      be west of Oklahoma Panhandle State University, not east of it.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in Goodwell, Oklahoma (in the Oklahoma
      Panhandle)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Colorado and Oklahoma.

      - Colorado is generally west of Oklahoma

      - The Oklahoma Panhandle is the westernmost portion of Oklahoma


      Step 3: Examine the specific locations within their states.

      - Alamosa is in south-central Colorado

      - Goodwell is in the Oklahoma Panhandle, which borders the eastern edge of Colorado


      Step 4: Compare their longitude positions.

      - Adams State University is located in Colorado, which is west of Oklahoma

      - Even though both are relatively close to their states'' borders, Adams State
      is still west of the Oklahoma Panhandle


      NO'

      to determine the locations of both universities and compare their positions
      along the east-west direction.


      1. Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado

      2. Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma, in
      the Oklahoma Panhandle


      Now I need to think about their relative positions. The Oklahoma Panhandle is
      the westernmost part of Oklahoma, extending west toward New Mexico. Colorado
      is west of Oklahoma.


      Let me think about this geographically:

      - Colorado is directly west of Kansas

      - The Oklahoma Panhandle is south of Colorado and west of the main part of Oklahoma

      - Adams State University is in southern Colorado


      Looking more specifically, Alamosa (where Adams State is) is in south-central
      Colorado, somewhat toward the western part of the state. The Oklahoma Panhandle
      extends westward along the southern border of Colorado.


      Since Colorado is west of Oklahoma, and Adams State is in Colorado while Oklahoma
      Panhandle State is in Oklahoma, Adams State would be west of Oklahoma Panhandle
      State, not east.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma (in the
      Oklahoma Panhandle)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Colorado and Oklahoma.

      - Colorado is located west of Oklahoma

      - The Oklahoma Panhandle is the westernmost portion of Oklahoma


      Step 3: Examine the specific locations within their states.

      - Alamosa, CO is in south-central Colorado

      - Goodwell, OK is in the western part of the Oklahoma Panhandle


      Step 4: Compare their longitudes.

      - Even though Adams State is in the central part of Colorado, Colorado as a
      whole is west of Oklahoma

      - The Oklahoma Panhandle, while being the westernmost part of Oklahoma, is still
      east of most of Colorado


      Therefore, Adams State University is west of Oklahoma Panhandle State University,
      not east of it.

      is on the southeastern coast of the US, while Texas is in the south-central
      part of the country.


      Since Texas is west of Florida, and the institutions are in their respective
      states, Texas A&M College of Geosciences (in Texas) must be west of Florida
      State University (in Florida), not east of it.

      Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies.</think># Is
      Texas A&M College of Geosciences, TX located east of Florida State University
      School of Library & Information Studies, FL?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Texas A&M College of Geosciences is located in College Station, Texas

      - Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies is located
      in Tallahassee, Florida


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Florida.

      - Texas is in the south-central United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States

      - On a map of the US, Florida is clearly east of Texas


      Step 3: Since these institutions are in their respective states, their relative
      positions follow the same relationship.


      NO - Texas A&M College of Geosciences is located west (not east) of Florida
      State University School of Library & Information Studies.'

      of Geosciences (in Texas) is located east of Florida State University School
      of Library & Information Studies (in Florida), I need to think about the geographic
      locations of Texas and Florida in the United States.


      Texas is located in the southwestern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico,
      while Florida is located in the southeastern United States, also bordering the
      Gulf of Mexico.


      If we consider the east-west orientation:

      - Texas is generally west of Florida

      - Florida is generally east of Texas


      Since Texas A&M is in Texas, and Florida State University is in Florida, that
      means:

      - Texas A&M College of Geosciences is west of Florida State University

      - Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies is east of
      Texas A&M

      - Texas is in the southwestern United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Florida is clearly east of Texas

      - Therefore, Florida State University (in Florida) is east of Texas A&M (in
      Texas)


      Step 4: Reverse the comparison to answer the specific question.

      - If Florida State is east of Texas A&M, then Texas A&M is west of Florida State

      - The question asks if Texas A&M is east of Florida State

      University; it''s located west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positioning of these two universities by looking at their states first.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Drury University is in Missouri (MO)

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN)


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship between these states.

      - Missouri is in the central United States

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern United States

      - On a map of the US, Tennessee is positioned to the east of Missouri


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the universities.

      - Since Drury University is in Missouri, and Bethel University is in Tennessee,
      Drury would be to the west of Bethel (not east).


      NO'

      locations of Drury University in Missouri (MO) and Bethel University in Tennessee
      (TN) to determine if Drury is east of Bethel.


      First, let me think about the general geographic locations of Missouri and Tennessee:

      - Missouri is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle of the United States

      - Tennessee is in the Southeast, east of Missouri


      Now, let''s think about the specific universities:

      - Drury University is in Missouri (MO)

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN)


      Since Tennessee is east of Missouri, and the universities are in their respective
      states, Bethel University (in TN) would generally be east of Drury University
      (in MO).


      So the answer to "Is Drury University, MO located east of Bethel University,
      TN?" would be NO - it''s the opposite. Drury is west of Bethel, not east of
      it.</think>To determine if Drury University in Missouri is located east of Bethel
      University in Tennessee, I need to consider the geographic locations of these
      states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both states.

      - Missouri (MO) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee (TN) is located in the Southeastern region of the United States


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship between these states.

      - Tennessee is located east of Missouri on a US map

      - Missouri''s eastern border is west of Tennessee''s western border


      Step 3: Apply this relationship to the universities.

      - Drury University is in Missouri (specifically in Springfield, MO)

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee (specifically in McKenzie, TN)

      - Since Tennessee is east of Missouri, Bethel University is east of Drury University


      Therefore, Drury University in Missouri is NOT located east of Bethel University
      in Tennessee. It''s actually the opposite - Drury is west of Bethel.

      2. Strayer University is in Virginia (VA)


      Now I need to determine their precise locations and check if Bellarmine is east
      of Strayer.


      Bellarmine University is located in Louisville, Kentucky, which is in the western
      part of Kentucky.


      Strayer University has multiple campuses in Virginia, but the main Virginia
      locations are around northern Virginia (like Arlington, Alexandria) which is
      in the eastern part of Virginia.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - Kentucky is west of Virginia

      - Louisville, KY is in the north-central part of Kentucky

      - Northern Virginia is in the easternmost part of Virginia


      So Bellarmine University (in Louisville, KY) would be west of Strayer University
      locations in Virginia.


      If Bellarmine is west of Strayer, then Bellarmine is NOT east of Strayer.</think>I

      in northern Virginia


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of Kentucky and Virginia.

      - On a U.S. map, Kentucky is positioned to the west of Virginia

      - Louisville (where Bellarmine is located) is in the northern part of Kentucky

      - The Virginia campuses of Strayer are primarily in the eastern part of Virginia


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Since Kentucky is west of Virginia, and Louisville is not far enough east
      in Kentucky to be east of western Virginia, Bellarmine University must be west
      of Strayer University''s Virginia locations.


      NO, Bellarmine University in Kentucky is not located east of Strayer University

      to determine the relative geographic locations of two institutions:

      1. South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center, SD

      2. University Center Rochester, MN


      First, let me identify where these places are:


      South Dakota (SD) is a state in the north-central United States. Minnesota (MN)
      is a state that borders South Dakota to the east. So generally speaking, Minnesota
      is east of South Dakota.


      Now for the specific locations:

      - University Center Rochester would be in Rochester, Minnesota

      - South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center would be somewhere in
      South Dakota


      Rochester, MN is located in the southeastern part of Minnesota, not far from
      the eastern border of the state.


      Since Minnesota is east of South Dakota, and Rochester is in the southeastern
      part of Minnesota, University Center Rochester would be east of any location
      in South Dakota, including the South Dakota Public Universities and Research
      Center.


      Therefore, South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is NOT east
      of University Center Rochester, MN. Rather, it would be west of it.</think>#

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is in South Dakota (SD)

      - University Center Rochester is in Minnesota (MN)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - Minnesota is located directly east of South Dakota

      - This is a fundamental geographic fact about the United States


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific locations

      - Rochester is in southeastern Minnesota

      - Any location in South Dakota would be west of Rochester, Minnesota


      ## Step 4: Draw a conclusion

      Since South Dakota is west of Minnesota, the South Dakota Public Universities
      and Research Center must be west of (not east of) University Center Rochester.

      3. Then I need to compare their locations to determine if the first is east
      of the second.


      First, let me think about South Dakota and Minnesota geographically. South Dakota
      is west of Minnesota. Minnesota shares its western border with South Dakota.
      So generally speaking, locations in South Dakota would be west of locations
      in Minnesota, not east.


      Rochester, MN is in the southeastern part of Minnesota, not far from the Wisconsin
      border. It''s not on the western edge of Minnesota near South Dakota.


      The "South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center" would be located
      in South Dakota based on its name. Without knowing its precise location in South
      Dakota, I can say that it would generally be west of Rochester, MN based on
      the relative positions of the two states.


      Therefore, South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center, SD would NOT

      - South Dakota Public Universities and Research Center is in South Dakota (SD)

      - University Center Rochester is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Minnesota is located directly east of South Dakota. The entire state of South
      Dakota lies to the west of Minnesota.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      Rochester, MN is located in the southeastern part of Minnesota.

      Regardless of where exactly in South Dakota the first institution is located,
      it must be west of Rochester, MN, because the entire state of South Dakota is
      west of Minnesota.


      Step 4: Make the east/west comparison.

      South Dakota is a state in the upper Midwest region of the United States. Minnesota

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New York


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - States further east have higher longitude values

      - New York is significantly east of Ohio on the map

      - Therefore, Fordham in NY is east of University of Findlay in OH

      - Conversely, University of Findlay is west of Fordham, not east


      NO, University of Findlay, OH is not located east of Fordham Graduate School

      North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States, while Arkansas is
      more inland and west of North Carolina.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      - North Carolina is on the east coast


      So Winston-Salem, NC would be east of Mountain Home, AR.

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - North Carolina is significantly further east than Arkansas

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Winston-Salem State University is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      The United States is generally organized with eastern states on the right side
      of the map and western states on the left. North Carolina is on the east coast
      of the United States, while Arkansas is inland and more to the west.


      If we consider the geographical positions:

      - North Carolina is an east coast state

      - Arkansas is in the south-central region of the US


      Step 3: Make the comparison

      Since North Carolina is much further east than Arkansas, any city in North Carolina
      (including Winston-Salem) would be east of any city in Arkansas (including Mountain
      Home).


      Therefore, Arkansas State University-Mountain Home would be WEST of Winston-Salem

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - North Carolina is significantly further east than Arkansas

      - In the US, states on the east coast (like NC) are east of inland states (like
      AR)


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      Since North Carolina is east of Arkansas, Winston-Salem State University (NC)
      would be east of Arkansas State University-Mountain Home (AR). This means Arkansas
      State University-Mountain Home is WEST of Winston-Salem State University, not

      to determine the geographic locations of Colorado State University Pueblo in
      Colorado (CO) and Ottawa University in Kansas (KS), and then determine which
      one is further east.


      First, let me think about the locations:

      - Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado

      - Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of Colorado and Kansas. In
      the US, states are generally arranged as follows (going from west to east):

      - Colorado is in the western/mountain region

      - Kansas is in the central/plains region


      Kansas is east of Colorado. So generally speaking, locations in Kansas tend
      to be east of locations in Colorado.


      To be more specific about these particular cities:

      - Pueblo is in southern Colorado

      - Ottawa is in eastern Kansas


      Even though Pueblo is in the eastern part of Colorado and Ottawa is in the eastern
      part of Kansas, Kansas as a whole is east of Colorado. The entire state of Colorado
      is west of Kansas.


      So Ottawa University in Kansas would be east of Colorado State University in
      Pueblo, Colorado.


      Therefore, Colorado State University Pueblo is NOT east of Ottawa University,
      KS. It''s the opposite - Ottawa University is east of Colorado State University
      Pueblo.</think># Is Colorado State University Pueblo, CO located east of Ottawa
      University, KS?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado (CO)

      - Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas (KS)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Colorado and Kansas

      Colorado is in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States, while
      Kansas is in the Great Plains region of the central United States. On a map
      of the US, Kansas is positioned to the east of Colorado.


      ## Step 3: Verify the specific locations

      - Pueblo is located in southern Colorado

      - Ottawa is in eastern Kansas


      Even though Pueblo is in eastern Colorado, it''s still in Colorado, which is
      entirely west of Kansas. Ottawa, being in Kansas, is therefore east of Pueblo.


      NO, Colorado State University Pueblo is not east of Ottawa University. It''s
      west of it.'

    92dec480-3ff7-400c-8688-113098db766f: '<think>Let me think through this step by
      step:


      1. First, I need to locate Colorado State University Pueblo in Colorado (CO)
      and Ottawa University in Kansas (KS).


      2. Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado. Pueblo is located
      in the south-central part of Colorado.


      3. Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas. Ottawa is located in the eastern
      part of Kansas.


      4. To determine which is further east, I need to consider the general geography
      of these states and cities.


      5. Colorado is west of Kansas in the United States. Kansas borders Colorado
      to the east.


      6. Pueblo, CO is in the eastern half of Colorado, but still west of the Kansas
      border.


      7. Ottawa, KS is in eastern Kansas.


      8. Therefore, Ottawa, KS is definitely east of Pueblo, CO.


      9. So if Ottawa University is east of Colorado State University Pueblo, then
      Colorado State University Pueblo is NOT east of Ottawa University.</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado

      - Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas


      Step 2: Consider the geography of these states.

      - Colorado is located west of Kansas in the United States

      - Kansas borders Colorado on the east


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Pueblo is in south-central Colorado

      - Ottawa is in eastern Kansas


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      Since Colorado is west of Kansas, and Pueblo is not on the far eastern edge
      of Colorado while Ottawa is in eastern Kansas, Ottawa University must be east
      of Colorado State University Pueblo.


      Therefore, Colorado State University Pueblo is NOT east of Ottawa University,
      Kansas.


      NO'
    94fd91ef-1935-4851-9e1e-1de639b8068a: '<think>Let me determine the answer by finding
      the locations of these two universities and comparing their east-west positions.


      1. Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado (CO)

      2. Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas (KS)


      To determine which is east of the other, I need to consider their longitudes
      (east-west position). In North America, lower longitude values indicate more
      western locations, while higher longitude values indicate more eastern locations.


      Generally speaking, Colorado is west of Kansas in the United States. Colorado
      borders Kansas on Kansas''s western border. So geographically, a location in
      Colorado would typically be west of a location in Kansas.


      Therefore, Colorado State University in Pueblo, CO would be west of Ottawa University
      in Ottawa, KS.


      If Colorado State is west of Ottawa University, then the answer to "Is Colorado
      State University Pueblo, CO located east of Ottawa University, KS?" would be
      NO.</think>To determine if Colorado State University Pueblo, CO is located east
      of Ottawa University, KS, I need to consider the geographic positions of Colorado
      and Kansas.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Colorado is located in the western United States, while Kansas is in the central
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions to each other.

      Kansas borders Colorado to the east. In other words, Colorado is to the west
      of Kansas.


      Step 3: Locate the specific cities.

      Pueblo is in Colorado, and Ottawa is in Kansas.


      Step 4: Determine their east-west relationship.

      Since Colorado is west of Kansas, Pueblo (in Colorado) would be west of Ottawa
      (in Kansas).


      Step 5: Answer the specific question about east-west positioning.

      If Pueblo is west of Ottawa, then Colorado State University Pueblo cannot be
      east of Ottawa University.


      NO'

      geographic positions of Colorado State University Pueblo in Colorado and Ottawa
      University in Kansas.


      Let me first locate these two cities on a mental map:

      - Pueblo, CO is in southern Colorado

      - Ottawa, KS is in eastern Kansas


      To determine which is further east, I need to think about their longitudes.


      The United States generally has longitudes that get smaller (more negative)
      as you move west. The eastern part of the US has longitudes closer to 0, while
      the western part has more negative longitudes.


      Colorado is west of Kansas in general. Colorado''s eastern border connects with
      Kansas''s western border. So generally speaking, locations in Colorado should
      be west of locations in Kansas.


      Pueblo is not on the eastern edge of Colorado - it''s more centrally located
      in the southern part of the state. Ottawa is likely in the eastern part of Kansas.


      Given this geographic understanding, Colorado State University Pueblo should
      be west of Ottawa University, not east of it.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado

      - Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Colorado and Kansas.

      - Colorado is directly west of Kansas in the United States

      - Kansas borders Colorado''s eastern edge


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Pueblo is in southern Colorado, not particularly close to the Kansas border

      - Ottawa, KS is in eastern Kansas


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Since Colorado is entirely west of Kansas on a US map, and Pueblo is not on
      Colorado''s eastern edge, Colorado State University Pueblo must be west of Ottawa
      University, not east.

      1. Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado

      2. Ottawa University is in Ottawa, Kansas


      I need to determine which one is further east. In the US, states that are further
