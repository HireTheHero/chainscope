      2. **Location of Stratford University**: Stratford University has campuses in
      Virginia, including one in Woodbridge.


      Next, we need to examine the relative positions of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Woodbridge,

      - Cincinnati, Ohio is located in the southwestern part of Ohio, while Woodbridge,
      Virginia is located to the south of Washington, D.C., which is on the eastern
      side of the U.S.


      Now, looking at a map, we can see that Cincinnati is to the northwest of Woodbridge.
