      - Mount Vernon, Ohio is west of Baltimore, Maryland


      4. Since Mount Vernon Nazarene University is in Ohio (west of Maryland), and
      University of Maryland, Baltimore County is in Maryland (east), this means Mount
      Vernon Nazarene University is WEST of University of Maryland, Baltimore County.


      5. The question asks if Mount Vernon Nazarene University is EAST of University
      of Maryland, Baltimore County.


      6. Since it is actually west, not east, the answer is:


      NO'

    93bb08cc-0396-4d90-b662-a884bf80ccca: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College

      - This is located in Cumberland, Kentucky, which is in the eastern part of Kentucky


      2. Next, locate Old Dominion University POD

      - This is located in Norfolk, Virginia, which is in the southeastern part of
      Virginia


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Kentucky is west of Virginia

      - So a location in eastern Kentucky would definitely be west of a location in
      southeastern Virginia


      4. Therefore, Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is located
      WEST of Old Dominion University POD, not east.


      The answer is: NO.'

      \u2022 A more positive (or larger) longitude is further west\n\n5. Compare:\n\
      \u2022 95.3011\xB0 W is WEST of 85.9680\xB0 W\n\u2022 This means University\
      \ of Texas at Tyler is WEST of Troy University\n\n6. Therefore, University of\
