      Now, let''s consider the geographical positions:


      *   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is located in the western part of Pennsylvania.

      *   Stony Brook, Long Island, New York is located on Long Island, which extends
      eastward from the main body of New York State.


      If you visualize a map, Pittsburgh is significantly to the west of New York
      City, and Long Island extends even further east from there. Therefore, Stony
      Brook is to the east of Pittsburgh.


      Since the question asks if Pittsburgh is *east* of Stony Brook, and we''ve determined
      Pittsburgh is *west* of Stony Brook, the answer is:


      NO'

      Stony Brook University is located in Stony Brook, Long Island, New York.


      **Step 2: Locate University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, PA.**

      The University of Pittsburgh is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes of the two locations.**

      *   Long Island, New York (Stony Brook) is further east on the US map.

      *   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is further west on the US map.


      **Step 4: Answer the question.**

      The question asks if University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, PA
      is located east of Stony Brook University School of Medicine, NY. Based on the
      comparison, Pittsburgh is west of Stony Brook.

      Since "Middlesex University, MA" does not exist as a university, the premise
      of comparing its location to Syracuse University''s School of Education is flawed.
      Therefore, the question cannot be answered definitively with a YES or NO based
      on the given information.


      However, if we assume the question *intended* to refer to **Middlesex Community
      College in Massachusetts**, let''s proceed with that assumption for the sake
      of demonstrating the geographical comparison:


      *   **Middlesex Community College, MA** has campuses in Bedford and Lowell,
      Massachusetts. Both of these are generally west of Boston.

      *   **Syracuse University, NY** is in central New York State.


      Geographically, Syracuse, NY, is **west** of Massachusetts.


      Therefore, if "Middlesex University, MA" was intended to be "Middlesex Community
      College, MA":


      Syracuse University School of Education, NY is **not** located east of Middlesex
      Community College, MA. It is located west.


      So, the answer based on the most likely intended interpretation of "Middlesex
      University, MA" (i.e., Middlesex Community College, MA) is:


      NO'

      The question asks: "Is California State University, Bakersfield, CA located
      east of Roseman University of Health Sciences, NV?"


      Since Bakersfield is west of Roseman University, the answer is:

      1.  **Locate Rockhurst University, MO:** Rockhurst University is in Kansas City,
      Missouri. Kansas City is on the western side of Missouri, very close to the
      Kansas border.


      2.  **Locate Wittenberg University, OH:** Wittenberg University is in Springfield,
      Ohio. Springfield, Ohio, is in the western/central part of Ohio.


      3.  **Compare East/West:** Missouri is located to the west of Ohio. Therefore,
      any point in Missouri will be west of any point in Ohio (assuming standard map
      orientation).


      Since Rockhurst University is in Missouri and Wittenberg University is in Ohio,
      Rockhurst University is **west** of Wittenberg University.

      2.  **Identify the location of Brenau University:** Brenau University is located
      in Gainesville, Georgia.


      3.  **Determine the relative positions of Texas and Georgia:** Texas is in the

      1.  **Locate National Louis University, IL:** It''s in Illinois. Illinois is
      in the Midwest, generally west of Ohio.

      2.  **Locate Walsh University, OH:** It''s in Ohio.

      3.  **Compare their longitudes:** Since Illinois is west of Ohio, any point
      in Illinois will have a longitude further west (a higher negative number if
      you''re using standard degrees west of the Prime Meridian, or a lower positive
      number if you''re counting degrees east from the International Date Line).

      4.  **Understand "east of":** For one location to be "east of" another, it must
      have a longitude value that is further to the east (closer to 0 or a higher
      positive number if using standard longitude).


      Since National Louis University is in Illinois and Walsh University is in Ohio,
      Illinois is geographically to the west of Ohio. Therefore, National Louis University
      is located **west** of Walsh University.


      So, the answer to "Is National Louis University, IL located east of Walsh University,
      OH?" is:


      NO'

      Now, let''s consider the general geography of the United States:


      *   Michigan (MI) is generally in the Midwest.

      *   Massachusetts (MA) is on the East Coast.


      If you travel from west to east across the US, you would typically pass through
      Michigan *before* reaching Massachusetts.


      Therefore, Massachusetts is **east** of Michigan.


      If Bentley University (MA) is east of Cornerstone University (MI), then Cornerstone
      University (MI) cannot be east of Bentley University (MA).


      The question is: "Is Cornerstone University, MI located east of Bentley University,
      MA?"


      Since Bentley University (MA) is located east of Cornerstone University (MI),
      then Cornerstone University (MI) is located west of Bentley University, MA.

      Since 96 degrees West is a larger number than 84 degrees West, it means that
      Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, NE is further *west* than Ohio State University,
      Lima Campus, OH.


      **Step 4: Answer the question.**

      The question asks: "Is Nebraska Medicine- Bellevue, NE located east of Ohio
      State University, Lima Campus, OH?"


      Based on our comparison, Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, NE is located *west* of
      Ohio State University, Lima Campus, OH.

      2.  **Locate Troy University, AL:** Troy, Alabama is in southeastern Alabama.

      3.  **Compare Longitudinal Positions:** Texas is to the west of Alabama. Therefore,
      any point in Texas will be west of any point in Alabama (assuming standard continental
      US mapping).


      Since Tyler, TX is in Texas and Troy, AL is in Alabama, Tyler, TX is to the
      **west** of Troy, AL.


      Therefore, University of Texas at Tyler, TX is **not** located east of Troy
      University, AL.
