      Community and Technical College (SKCTC) is located east of Old Dominion University
      (ODU) POD in Virginia, we need to compare their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of SKCTC.

      - SKCTC is located in Cumberland, Kentucky. This is in the southeastern part
      of Kentucky, near the border with Virginia.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Old Dominion University POD.

      - ODU is located in Norfolk, Virginia, which is in the southeastern portion
      of Virginia, near the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Understand how longitude works.

      - Longitude increases as you move west. So, if one place has a greater (more
      negative) longitude, it is farther west.


      Step 4: Compare longitudes.

      - Cumberland, KY (SKCTC) is approximately at longitude -82.9874.

      - Norfolk, VA (ODU) is approximately at longitude -76.2990.


      Step 5: Analyze the comparison.

      - Since -82.9874 < -76.2990, SKCTC is farther west than ODU.


      Conclusion:

      Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College is west of Old Dominion University.

      - Ohio lies generally west of Connecticut.\n- Longitudes in the U.S. increase\
      \ as you go west. So, a place in Ohio will have a higher (more negative) longitude\
      \ than a place in Connecticut.\n- For example, Bridgeport, CT is approximately\

      in Texas is located east of Altamaha Technical College in Georgia, we need to
      consider their geographical locations in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Jarvis Christian College.

      - Jarvis Christian College is located in Hawkins, Texas.

      - Hawkins, TX is in the eastern part of Texas.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Altamaha Technical College.

      - Altamaha Technical College was a college in Jesup, Georgia (it has since merged
      into Coastal Pines Technical College).

      - Jesup, GA is located in the southeastern part of Georgia.


      Step 3: Compare longitudes.

      - Texas is west of Georgia in the United States.

      - Even though Jarvis Christian College is in eastern Texas, Georgia is still
      farther east geographically.

      - Therefore, Jarvis Christian College is west of Altamaha Technical College.

      Findlay in Ohio is located east of the Fordham Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
      in New York, we need to evaluate their longitudinal coordinates, since longitude
      determines east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Fordham Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

      - It is located in New York City, New York.

      - New York City is approximately at a longitude of about 74 degrees West.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the University of Findlay.

      - It is located in Findlay, Ohio.

      - Findlay, Ohio is approximately at a longitude of about 83 degrees West.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - 83 degrees West (Findlay, OH) is further west than 74 degrees West (New York,
      NY).

      - Therefore, Findlay is located west of New York City.
