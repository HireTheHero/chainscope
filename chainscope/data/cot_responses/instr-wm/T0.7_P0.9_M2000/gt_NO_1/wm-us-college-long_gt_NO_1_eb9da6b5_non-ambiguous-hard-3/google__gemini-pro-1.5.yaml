      geographical locations of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY and University
      of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies, VA.


      2. **Determine Longitude:**  We''re interested in East vs. West, so we need
      the longitude of each location.  West Kentucky will have a more western longitude
      (higher number, since we''re dealing with negative numbers).  Virginia will
      have an eastern longitude (lower number).


      3. **Compare Longitude:**  If Owensboro, KY has a *higher* longitude than Richmond,
      VA, then it is further west, and the answer is NO. If Owensboro, KY has a *lower*
      longitude than Richmond, VA then it is further east and the answer is YES.


      Owensboro, KY is located at approximately -87.1 degrees longitude. Richmond,
      VA is located at approximately -77.5 degrees longitude.


      Since -87.1 is greater than -77.5, Owensboro is further west.

      Kentucky Community and Technical College (SKCTC) and Old Dominion University
      POD.

      3. **Compare Longitudes:** Once we have the longitude of each location, we can
      compare them.  If SKCTC''s longitude is greater than Old Dominion University
      POD''s longitude, then SKCTC is east of it.

      YES or NO.

      * **Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College:** Cumberland, KY -  Longitude:
      ~-83.0

      * **Old Dominion University POD:**  Virginia Beach, VA - Longitude: ~-76.0


      Since -83.0 is *less than* -76.0, SKCTC is *west* of Old Dominion University
      POD.

      Louis University is in Illinois. Walsh University is in Ohio.


      2. **Determine the general east-west relationship of the two states:** Illinois
      is generally west of Ohio.


      3. **Consider possible exceptions:** While most of Illinois is west of Ohio,
      a small portion of Illinois extends slightly further east than the western edge
      of Ohio.  We need to determine if National Louis University falls within this
      eastern sliver.  A quick map check reveals that National Louis University''s
      main campus is in Chicago, which is west of Ohio.


      4. **Conclusion:** National Louis University is west of Walsh University.
