      - Mount Vernon Nazarene University is in Mount Vernon, Ohio (OH)

      - University of Maryland, Baltimore County is in Baltimore, Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Ohio and Maryland.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Maryland is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Generally, Maryland is east of Ohio


      Step 3: More specifically, Mount Vernon, OH is in central/eastern Ohio, while
      Baltimore, MD is on the eastern side of Maryland near the Chesapeake Bay.


      Step 4: In terms of longitude (which measures east-west position), Maryland
      is clearly east of Ohio. Even the easternmost parts of Ohio are west of the
      westernmost parts of Maryland.


      Therefore, Mount Vernon Nazarene University in Ohio is located WEST of (not
      east of) the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in Maryland.

      - Even though Arlington is in eastern Texas, Alabama as a whole is still east
      of Texas


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      of Architecture, TX located east of University of West Alabama, AL?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) is located in Arlington, Texas,
      which is in the northern part of Texas.


      2) The University of West Alabama is located in Livingston, Alabama.


      3) In terms of U.S. geography, Alabama is located to the east of Texas. Texas
      borders the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast and extends westward, while Alabama
      is in the southeastern United States, also bordering the Gulf of Mexico but
      much further east.


      4) Specifically, Arlington, TX is in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area
      in North Texas, while Livingston, AL is in western Alabama.


      5) When comparing their longitudinal positions, any location in Alabama will
      be east of any location in Texas, as Alabama is entirely east of Texas on the
      map of the United States.


      Therefore, the University of Texas at Arlington School of Architecture is NOT
      located east of the University of West Alabama. It''s the opposite - UTA is
      west of the University of West Alabama.


      NO'

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both universities.

      - University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) School of Architecture is in Arlington,
      Texas

      - University of West Alabama is in Livingston, Alabama


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative east-west positioning.

      - Texas is located west of Alabama in the United States

      - Arlington, TX is in the eastern part of Texas

      - Livingston, AL is in the western part of Alabama


      Step 3: Despite Arlington being in eastern Texas and Livingston being in western
      Alabama, the states themselves determine the primary east-west relationship.

      - Alabama as a whole is east of Texas

      - Therefore, any location in Alabama (including western Alabama) would be east
      of any location in Texas (including eastern Texas)


      Step 4: Since University of West Alabama is in Alabama (east) and UTA School
      of Architecture is in Texas (west), UTA must be west of University of West Alabama,
      not east.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is in the Northeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west).

      - Illinois is west of New York

      - Therefore, Elgin, IL (where Judson University is) would be west of Oneonta,
      NY (where SUNY Oneonta is)


      Step 4: Confirm the specific locations.

      - Elgin, IL is in the northeastern part of Illinois

      - Oneonta, NY is in the eastern part of New York State

      - Even though Elgin is in the eastern part of Illinois, it is still significantly
      west of any location in New York

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, but further east than Nebraska


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - All of Indiana is east of Nebraska on a map of the United States

      - This means that any location in Indiana (including Indiana University Northwest)
      would be east of any location in Nebraska (including University of Nebraska
      at Kearney)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      - Since Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (east) and University of
      Nebraska at Kearney is in Nebraska (west), the University of Nebraska at Kearney
      cannot be east of Indiana University Northwest.


      NO, University of Nebraska at Kearney is not located east of Indiana University

      Step 1: Let me consider the geographical positions of Vermont and Maine. Vermont
      is in the northeastern United States, bordering New Hampshire to its east and
      New York to its west. Maine is also in the northeastern United States, located
      east of New Hampshire.


      Step 2: In terms of east-west positioning, Maine is generally east of Vermont
      since Vermont is west of New Hampshire, and Maine is east of New Hampshire.


      Step 3: Now, I need to be more specific about the locations of these institutions.
      Community College of Vermont has multiple locations throughout Vermont, but
      all Vermont locations would be west of Maine. The University of Maine at Machias
      is in Machias, which is in eastern Maine, quite close to the Atlantic coast.


      Step 4: Since all of Vermont is west of Maine, and Machias is in the eastern
      part of Maine, Community College of Vermont must be west of University of Maine
      at Machias, not east of it.

      - Community College of Vermont (CCV) is in Vermont (VT)

      - University of Maine at Machias is in Maine (ME)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Vermont and Maine in the United
      States.

      - Vermont is located in the northeastern United States

      - Maine is also in the northeastern United States, and is the easternmost state
      in the continental US

      - Maine lies to the east of Vermont

      - Specifically, Maine borders New Hampshire to its west, and Vermont is west
      of New Hampshire

      - This means Vermont is located west of Maine


      Step 4: Since Machias is in Maine and Community College of Vermont is in Vermont,
      the same east-west relationship applies to these specific locations.

      - Machias is in eastern Maine, near the Atlantic coast

      Step 2: I need to determine their relative east-west positions.\n- In the US,\
      \ states are positioned with Colorado to the west of Kansas\n- Colorado is in\
      \ the Mountain Time Zone, while Kansas is in the Central Time Zone\n- Moving\
      \ from west to east in the US: Pacific \u2192 Mountain \u2192 Central \u2192\
      \ Eastern\n\nStep 3: More specifically, Pueblo, CO is in the eastern part of\
      \ Colorado, but Ottawa, KS is in the eastern part of Kansas. However, even eastern\
      \ Colorado is still west of western Kansas.\n\nStep 4: To confirm, Pueblo, CO\
      \ is approximately at longitude 104.5\xB0 W, while Ottawa, KS is approximately\
      \ at longitude 95.3\xB0 W. Since a smaller western longitude number means further\
      \ east, Ottawa, KS is east of Pueblo, CO.\n\nTherefore, Colorado State University\
      \ Pueblo is NOT east of Ottawa University, KS. It's west of it.\n\nNO"
    f430dc8d-f85b-4680-9fd3-e6a98a447c5f: "# Is Colorado State University Pueblo,\
      \ CO located east of Ottawa University, KS?\n\nLet me think about this step\
      \ by step:\n\n1) First, I need to identify the locations of both universities:\n\
      \   - Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado\n   - Ottawa University\
      \ is in Ottawa, Kansas\n\n2) Now I need to determine their relative east-west\
      \ positions:\n   - Colorado is west of Kansas in the United States\n   - Specifically,\
      \ Colorado is directly west of Kansas on the US map\n\n3) Since Pueblo is in\
      \ Colorado and Ottawa is in Kansas, and Colorado is west of Kansas, Colorado\
      \ State University Pueblo must be west of Ottawa University.\n\n4) If Colorado\
      \ State University Pueblo is west of Ottawa University, then it cannot be east\
      \ of Ottawa University.\n\nNO"
