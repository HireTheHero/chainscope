      of India and the Philippines. The Philippines is located significantly east
      of India in Asia.

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since Mir Alam Tank is in India and San Andres Apostol Church

      1.  **Identify Location 1:** South Harrow tube station is located in the London
      Borough of Harrow, in West London, United Kingdom.

      1.  **Identify Location 1:** Greenford station. A quick search confirms this
      is a railway and Tube station in Greenford, London, UK.

      2.  **Identify Location 2:** Mikhail Bulgakov Museum. There are museums dedicated
      to the writer Mikhail Bulgakov, most notably one in Moscow, Russia, and one
      in Kyiv, Ukraine. Let''s consider the most famous one in Moscow.

      3.  **Determine the relative geographical positions:** London, UK is located
      significantly to the west of Moscow, Russia (and also west of Kyiv, Ukraine).

      4.  **Compare East/West:** Since London is west of Moscow, Greenford station

      1.  **Locate Sudbury Hill Harrow railway station:** This station is in the London
      Borough of Harrow, in the United Kingdom. Its approximate longitude is about
      0.3 degrees West.

      2.  **Locate Naghlu Dam:** This dam is located on the Kabul River in Afghanistan.
      Its approximate longitude is about 69.7 degrees East.

      3.  **Compare their longitudes:** Longitude measures position east or west of
      the Prime Meridian (0 degrees). Larger positive numbers are further east, while
      negative numbers (or degrees West) are further west.

      4.  **Determine relative position:** 69.7 degrees East (Naghlu Dam) is significantly
      further east than 0.3 degrees West (Sudbury Hill Harrow). This means Sudbury
      Hill Harrow railway station is located *west* of Naghlu Dam.

      5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Sudbury Hill Harrow railway
      station is *east* of Naghlu Dam. Since it is west of the dam, the answer is
      no.
