      Step 1: Let me identify the location of Church of the Immaculate Conception,
      Dublin.

      The Church of the Immaculate Conception is in Dublin, Ireland. Dublin is located
      on the eastern coast of Ireland.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Gustav Adolf Stave Church.

      Gustav Adolf Stave Church is located in Sweden. Sweden is east of Ireland across
      the North Sea and Baltic Sea.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      Ireland is west of Sweden in Europe. Dublin (in Ireland) is therefore west of
      any location in Sweden, including where Gustav Adolf Stave Church is located.


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on relative positions.

      Since Dublin is west of Sweden, the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Dublin
      must be west of Gustav Adolf Stave Church in Sweden, not east of it.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is in Sligo, Ireland.

      - Villa Saraceno is a Renaissance villa designed by Palladio located in the
      Veneto region of northern Italy.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - Ireland is located in Western Europe.

      - Northern Italy (Veneto region) is in Southern Europe.

      - On a map of Europe, Ireland is positioned to the west of Italy.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Since Sligo, Ireland is west of northern Italy, the Cathedral of the Immaculate
      Conception in Sligo must be west of Villa Saraceno.

      - Therefore, the Cathedral is NOT east of Villa Saraceno; it''s west of it.

      part of the city.

      - The Shrine of St. Therese, Doctor of the Church could be in multiple locations
      globally, as St. Therese of Lisieux has shrines dedicated to her in many countries.

      - There isn''t a major "Cathedral of the Holy Spirit" in Paris. The main cathedral
      in Paris is Notre-Dame.

      Step 1: Let me identify the location of Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in
      Lewiston, Maine.

      The Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul is located in Lewiston, Maine, in the
      northeastern United States.


      Step 2: I need to identify which New Wine Church is being referenced, as there
      may be multiple churches with this name.

      New Wine Church could refer to churches in various locations. The most prominent
      New Wine Church I''m aware of is in London, UK.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Lewiston, Maine is in the eastern United States, while London is in western
      Europe. When comparing locations on a global east-west basis, the United States
      is west of Europe.


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      If the New Wine Church in question is the one in London, then the Basilica in
      Lewiston, Maine would be WEST of New Wine Church, not east.

      - Calcot Manor is located in the United Kingdom, which is east of North America
      across the Atlantic Ocean.
