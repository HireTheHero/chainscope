      \ Hooghly district of West Bengal, India.\n   - **Laperal White House** is a\
      \ historic house located in Baguio City, which is in the northern part of Luzon\
      \ in the Philippines.\n\n2. **Determine their longitudes:**\n   - Bandel, West\
      \ Bengal, India has a longitude of approximately **88.4\xB0 East**.\n   - Baguio\
      \ City, Philippines has a longitude of approximately **120.6\xB0 East**.\n\n\
      3. **Compare the longitudes:**\n   - Since 120.6\xB0E (Baguio) is greater than\

      1. Identify the geographical locations of both Riverside Park Community and
      Grange Park railway station.

      2. Compare their longitudinal positions to determine their relative east-west
      orientation.


      Step 1: Locate Grange Park railway station.

      - Grange Park railway station is located in the London Borough of Enfield, in
      North London, UK.


      Step 2: Locate Riverside Park Community.

      - There are several communities with the name "Riverside Park" around the world,

      near Grange Park station, there isn''t a well-known "Riverside Park Community"
      commonly associated with that area.


      If you''re referring to a specific Riverside Park Community, such as one in
      a different city or country (e.g., Riverside Park in New York City, or a residential
      community elsewhere), we would need to know the specific one to make a comparison.


      Assuming that "Riverside Park Community" refers to a location outside of the

      1. Identify the location of Grange Park railway station.

      2. Identify the location of Riverside Park Community.

      3. Compare their relative positions to determine if Riverside Park Community
      lies to the east of Grange Park station.


      **Step 1: Locate Grange Park railway station**


      Grange Park railway station is in the London Borough of Enfield, in North London,
      United Kingdom. It lies on the Hertford Loop Line, between Enfield Chase and
      Winchmore Hill.


      **Step 2: Locate Riverside Park Community**


      There are multiple places with the name "Riverside Park Community," but assuming
      the context is within London or nearby areas (to match with Grange Park station),
      we need to find a Riverside Park Community that is geographically relevant.


      However, if the Riverside Park Community is referring to the one in Southampton
      or elsewhere far from London, it would not be located east in any meaningful
      local geographic sense. If it''s a local community near Enfield, precise mapping
      is necessary.


      But without a specific known Riverside Park Community near Grange Park station,
      the assumption might be invalid.


      **Step 3: Compare locations**


      If we assume a Riverside Park Community exists within proximity of Grange Park
      station, we would need to check on a map whether it''s located geographically
      east of the station.


      But if the Riverside Park Community in question is, for example, in Southampton
      or another city, then it is not east in local terms, and may even be southwest
      of Grange Park station.


      Given no known Riverside Park Community lies directly east of Grange Park railway
      station in a local context, and the most prominent communities with that name
      are not east of it:

      3. **Check Map**: According to geographic data and mapping services (e.g., Google
      Maps), Grange Park railway station is located in Enfield, North London.


      4. **Locate Riverside Park Community**: The name "Riverside Park Community"
      is somewhat generic and may refer to multiple places, but assuming we are referencing
      a known Riverside Park Community in the same general area or contextually relevant
      location near Grange Park station, we need to determine its position relative
      to the station.


      5. **Compare Coordinates**: If Riverside Park Community is west, south, or north
      of the station, the answer is NO. If it is east, the answer is YES.

      Step 1: Identify the location of St. Agnes Cathedral.

      - St. Agnes Cathedral is located in Rockville Centre, which is on Long Island
      in the state of New York, USA.

      - Rockville Centre is situated in the eastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Maze Hill railway station.

      - Maze Hill railway station is located in London, United Kingdom.

      - Specifically, it is in the southeast part of London, near Greenwich.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes of both locations.

      - Long Island, New York has a longitude of approximately 73 to 74 degrees West.

      - London, UK, where Maze Hill is located, has a longitude of approximately 0
      degrees (it''s near the Prime Meridian).

      1. Identify the location of Churston Court.

      2. Identify the location of Chaira Hydro Power Plant.

      3. Compare their longitudes to determine which one is farther east.


      Step 1: Churston Court is a historic building located in Churston Ferrers, near
      Brixham in Devon, England. This places it in the southwestern part of the United
      Kingdom.


      Step 2: Chaira Hydro Power Plant is located in Bulgaria, near the Rila Mountains.

      Step 3: Now we compare their longitudes:

      - Devon, England (Churston Court) is roughly at a longitude of about -3.5 degrees
      (west of the Prime Meridian).

      - The Chaira Hydro Power Plant in Bulgaria is roughly at a longitude of about

      is located east of Gary Junction Road, we need to consider the geographic locations
      of both.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Rampal Power Station.

      - Rampal Power Station, also known as the Maitree Super Thermal Power Project,
      is located in Rampal Upazila, Bagerhat District, in the Khulna Division of Bangladesh.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Gary Junction Road.

      - Gary Junction Road is a remote outback road in Western Australia. It runs
      from the town of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, westward through the
      Gibson Desert and connects to the Great Northern Highway in Western Australia.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Rampal Power Station is in Bangladesh, South Asia.

      - Gary Junction Road is in Western Australia.


      Step 4: Determine cardinal direction.

      - Bangladesh is geographically located far to the west of Australia, specifically
      west of Western Australia.

      - However, in this case, we are comparing Rampal Power Station to Gary Junction
      Road.

      - Since Bangladesh is located northwest of Western Australia, and Gary Junction
      Road lies in central to western Australia, Rampal Power Station is geographically
      west (not east) of Gary Junction Road.

      1. Identify the location of Lake Del Valle.

      2. Identify the location of Kensico Reservoir.

      3. Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west direction).


      Step 1: Lake Del Valle is located in Alameda County, California. It is a reservoir
      situated in the hills southeast of Livermore, in the San Francisco Bay Area.


      Step 2: Kensico Reservoir is located in Westchester County, New York. It lies
      north of White Plains and serves as part of the New York City water supply system.


      Step 3: California is on the west coast of the United States, while New York
      is on the east coast. In terms of longitude, California is much farther west
      than New York.


      Therefore, Lake Del Valle is located west of Kensico Reservoir.

      1. Identify the location of San Dimas Hotel.

      2. Identify the location of Barker Reservoir.

      3. Compare their positions to determine east/west orientation.


      Step 1: San Dimas is a city located in Los Angeles County, California. If there
      is a San Dimas Hotel, it is most likely located in or around this city.


      Step 2: Barker Reservoir is located in Houston, Texas. It is part of a flood

      Step 3: Now compare the locations:

      - San Dimas, California is in the western United States.

      - Houston, Texas is significantly farther east than San Dimas, California.


      Therefore, the San Dimas Hotel (presumably in San Dimas, CA) is located west
