    170dee22-6af1-46a8-9036-be2db4940d31: 'This question requires a bit of reasoning.
      It''s a yes / no question, but it''s not clear what is meant by "east."


      I''m going to assume that the question is asking whether Cathedral of St. Raymond
      Nonnatus (Joliet, Illinois) is located east of Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos.


      First, let''s look at the location of each of these places. Cathedral of St.
      Raymond Nonnatus (Joliet, Illinois) is located in Joliet, Illinois, which is
      in the northeastern part of the United States. Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos
      is located in Madrid, Spain, which is in the southwestern part of Europe.


      Now, we need to determine whether the distance between Joliet, Illinois and
      Madrid, Spain is greater than or less than the distance between Joliet, Illinois
      and Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos. We can use a ruler to measure the distance
      between Joliet, Illinois and Madrid, Spain, and then compare it to the distance
      between Joliet, Illinois and Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos.


      Once we know the distance between Joliet, Illinois and Madrid, Spain, we can
      compare it to the distance between Joliet, Illinois and Plaza de toros Real
      de San Carlos. If the distance between Joliet, Illinois and Madrid, Spain is
      greater than the distance between Joliet, Illinois and Plaza de toros Real de
      San Carlos, then the answer is yes, Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus (Joliet,
      Illinois) is located east of Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos. If the distance
      between Joliet, Illinois and Madrid, Spain is less than the distance between
      Joliet, Illinois and Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos, then the answer is no,
      Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus (Joliet, Illinois) is not located east of
      Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos.


      So, in conclusion, we can say that Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus (Joliet,
      Illinois) is located east of Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos if the distance
      between Joliet, Illinois and Madrid, Spain is greater than the distance between
      Joliet, Illinois and Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos.'

    6a87a314-14f0-4a16-aae5-4b22b090b290: 'This question requires a bit of reasoning.


      First, we need to know that Blyderivierpoort Dam is located in South Africa,
      and Upper Seletar Reservoir is located in Singapore. So, the answer is "no".


      Next, we need to know that the location of a structure is typically indicated
      by its coordinates (latitude and longitude). So, we can use a map to find the
      coordinates of Blyderivierpoort Dam and Upper Seletar Reservoir.


      Finally, we can use a map to find the distance between the two structures. If
      the distance is less than 100 km, then the answer is "yes". If the distance
      is greater than 100 km, then the answer is "no".


      So, using this reasoning, we can answer this question as follows:


      - Blyderivierpoort Dam is located in South Africa, and Upper Seletar Reservoir
      is located in Singapore.

      - The distance between the two structures is greater than 100 km, so the answer
      is "no".
