      - Sheboygan, Wisconsin is in the midwest United States

      - When comparing these locations, Victoria is clearly WEST of Sheboygan


      Therefore: NO, Victoria General Hospital is not east of Sheboygan Municipal
      Auditorium and Armory - it is west of it.

      1. Buckhurst Hill tube station is in London, UK (specifically in Essex, on the
      Central line)

      2. The Slovak National Theatre is in Bratislava, Slovakia

      3. London is located in Western Europe
