      Lexington Reservoir is located east of Chickamauga Lake. To answer this, I need
      to know the geographical locations of both bodies of water. Let''s break this
      down step by step.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Locations of Lexington Reservoir and Chickamauga Lake


      **Lexington Reservoir:**

      I recall that Lexington Reservoir is in California. Specifically, it''s located
      in Santa Clara County, near the city of Los Gatos. It''s a man-made reservoir
      that provides water to the surrounding area.


      **Chickamauga Lake:**

      Chickamauga Lake is in Tennessee. It''s a reservoir along the Tennessee River,
      created by the Chickamauga Dam. It''s part of the Tennessee Valley Authority
      (TVA) system and is located near Chattanooga.


      ### Step 2: Determine the Relative Positions of California and Tennessee


      Now, I need to figure out the relative east-west positions of California and
      Tennessee.


      - **California** is on the west coast of the United States.

      - **Tennessee** is in the southeastern part of the country.


      Given this, California is to the west of Tennessee.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Locations of Lexington Reservoir and Chickamauga Lake


      Since Lexington Reservoir is in California (west) and Chickamauga Lake is in
      Tennessee (southeast), I need to determine if Lexington Reservoir is east of
      Chickamauga Lake.


      Given that California is west of Tennessee, Lexington Reservoir (in California)
      would actually be **west** of Chickamauga Lake (in Tennessee).


      ### Step 4: Conclusion


      Based on this reasoning, Lexington Reservoir is not located east of Chickamauga
      Lake; it''s located west of it.

    f43ed176-87e8-45dc-bffa-7921ed5f1676: 'To determine whether the Tipaimukh Dam
      is located east of the Yallourn Power Station, we need to identify the locations
      of both structures:


      1. **Tipaimukh Dam**: This dam is located in the Indian state of Manipur, near
      the border with Bangladesh. It is situated in the northeastern part of India.


      2. **Yallourn Power Station**: This power station is located in Victoria, Australia.
      It is in the southeastern part of Australia.


      Now, let''s analyze their relative positions:

      - India (where Tipaimukh Dam is located) is in the Northern Hemisphere, while
      Australia (where Yallourn Power Station is located) is in the Southern Hemisphere.

      - India is located to the north and east of Australia.


      Therefore, **Tipaimukh Dam is indeed located east of Yallourn Power Station**.

      2. **Imus Cathedral**: This is a religious structure located in Imus, Cavite,\
      \ Philippines.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Geographical Coordinates\n\nTo compare\
      \ their positions, we'll look at their geographical coordinates (latitude and\
      \ longitude).\n\n- **National Theatre, Singapore**:\n  - Latitude: 1.3000\xB0\

      The key to answering whether the National Theatre is east of Imus Cathedral\

      \ 103.8500\xB0 E\n- **Imus Cathedral**: 120.9378\xB0 E\n\n### Step 4: Compare\
      \ the Longitudes\n\nIn geographical terms:\n\n- Places with higher longitude\
      \ values are further east.\n- Places with lower longitude values are further\
      \ west.\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- 103.8500\xB0 E (National Theatre) vs. 120.9378\xB0\
      \ E (Imus Cathedral)\n\nSince 103.8500\xB0 E is less than 120.9378\xB0 E, the\

      \n### Step 5: Conclusion Based on Longitudes\n\nGiven that the National Theatre\

    da3ba0a8-134c-4686-84fd-70b032d848eb: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of both the Chotiari Dam and the Busan Exhibition and Convention
      Center, and then assess their relative positions.


      ### Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. **Chotiari Dam**: This dam is located in **Sindh, Pakistan**, near the town
      of Sanghar. It is situated in the **eastern** part of Pakistan.

      2. **Busan Exhibition and Convention Center (BEXCO)**: This center is located
      in **Busan, South Korea**, which is in the **southeastern** part of the Korean
      Peninsula.


      ### Relative positions:

      - Pakistan is **west** of South Korea. Specifically, Sindh, Pakistan (where
      Chotiari Dam is located), is **west** of Busan, South Korea (where BEXCO is
      located).

      - Therefore, Chotiari Dam is **west** of Busan Exhibition and Convention Center,

      St. Saviour Church is located in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Dubrovnik is situated on
      the Adriatic Sea in the southern part of Croatia, which is in southeastern Europe.


      ### Step 2: Locate Khaplu Palace

      Khaplu Palace is located in Khaplu, a town in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of
      Pakistan. This region is in South Asia, east of Europe.


      ### Step 3: Determine the Relative Positions

      - Dubrovnik, Croatia, is in southeastern Europe.

      ### Step 3: Determine the relative positions of Anaheim, California, and Santa
      Clara, Cuba

      Anaheim, California, is in the western part of the United States, while Santa
      Clara, Cuba, is in the Caribbean. In terms of longitude, Anaheim is west of
      Santa Clara, Cuba.


      ### Step 4: Assess whether Sarang Community Church is east of El Mejunje

      Since Anaheim, California, is west of Santa Clara, Cuba, Sarang Community Church
      of Southern California is **not** east of El Mejunje.


      ### Final Answer: **NO**'

    3f3189b3-1970-433d-890c-4c5d26bc7fef: "Alright, let's tackle this question step\
      \ by step. The question is: **Is Washington Avenue Immigration Station located\
      \ east of Calcot Manor?**\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Locations\n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to identify where both Washington Avenue Immigration Station and Calcot\
      \ Manor are located. Since the question doesn't specify a city or country, I'll\
      \ assume they are in the United States, given the name \"Washington Avenue\"\
      \ is common there.\n\n### Step 2: Researching Washington Avenue Immigration\
      \ Station\n\nI'll start by looking up \"Washington Avenue Immigration Station.\"\
      \ A quick search reveals that there is a Washington Avenue Immigration Station\
      \ in **Ellis Island, New York**. Ellis Island is historically known as the primary\
      \ immigration station in the United States from 1892 to 1954.\n\n### Step 3:\
      \ Researching Calcot Manor\n\nNext, I'll search for \"Calcot Manor.\" It appears\
      \ that Calcot Manor is a **luxury hotel located in Gloucestershire, England**.\
      \ It's a historic manor house that has been converted into a hotel.\n\n### Step\
      \ 4: Determining the Relative Locations\n\nNow, I need to determine the relative\
      \ positions of these two places. Ellis Island is in New York, USA, and Calcot\
      \ Manor is in Gloucestershire, England.\n\n### Step 5: Understanding East and\
      \ West Directions\n\nTo determine if one location is east of the other, I need\
      \ to consider their longitudinal positions. Generally, locations with higher\
      \ longitude values are further east.\n\n### Step 6: Comparing Longitudes\n\n\
      - **Ellis Island, New York**: Approximately at a longitude of -74.0445\xB0 W.\n\
      - **Calcot Manor, Gloucestershire**: Approximately at a longitude of -2.1500\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nIn terms of longitude, a more negative number indicates a location further\
      \ west. Therefore, Ellis Island (-74.0445\xB0 W) is further west than Calcot\
      \ Manor (-2.1500\xB0 W).\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\n\nSince Ellis Island (where\
      \ Washington Avenue Immigration Station is located) has a more negative longitude\
      \ than Calcot Manor, it is situated to the west of Calcot Manor. Therefore,\
      \ Washington Avenue Immigration Station is **not** located east of Calcot Manor.\n\
