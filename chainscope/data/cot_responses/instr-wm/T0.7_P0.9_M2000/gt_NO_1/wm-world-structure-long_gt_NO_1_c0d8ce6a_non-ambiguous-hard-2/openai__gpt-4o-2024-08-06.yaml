    fac7c4da-6797-4d26-9e92-380d269f5f7c: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Location of Thorntonbank Wind Farm**: Thorntonbank Wind Farm is located
      in the North Sea, off the coast of Belgium.


      2. **Location of Ou Raadsaal**: Ou Raadsaal is a historic government building

      3. **Relative Positions**: Belgium is located in Europe, while South Africa
      is located in the southern part of the African continent.


      4. **East or West**: To determine if Thorntonbank Wind Farm is east of Ou Raadsaal,
      consider the longitudinal positions. Belgium (where Thorntonbank is located)
      is west of South Africa (where Ou Raadsaal is located).


      Based on these considerations, the Thorntonbank Wind Farm is located west of
      Ou Raadsaal.

      - **Khartoum, Sudan** is situated in northeastern Africa.

      - **Somerset/Wiltshire, England** is in the southwest of the United Kingdom,
      which is in northwestern Europe.


      Given these geographic positions, England (where King Alfred''s Tower is located)

      2. **Matimba Power Station**: This is a coal-fired power station located in

      Now, considering their locations:


      - London is in the Northern Hemisphere and is located in the western part of
      Europe.

      - Lephalale, where Matimba Power Station is located, is in the Southern Hemisphere
      and lies in the northeastern part of South Africa.


      Given the global positioning, Europe (where London is) is generally east of
      South Africa (where Lephalale is). Therefore, West Hampstead tube station, located
      in London, is east of Matimba Power Station, located in South Africa.
