      However, the question requires a YES or NO answer. In this case, without precise
      coordinates, I cannot confidently say YES or NO.

      2. Belvedere on the Pfingstberg is located in Potsdam, Germany. It is a historic
      building situated on Pfingstberg hill.


      3. Tafila Wind Farm is located in Jordan, specifically in the Tafila Governorate
      in southern Jordan.


      4. These two locations are in completely different countries and continents
      - Germany and Jordan respectively.


      5. Since they are so far apart, their relative east-west positioning becomes
      a matter of global geography.


      6. Looking at a world map, Jordan is east of Germany.


      7. Therefore, if Tafila Wind Farm is in Jordan (east), and Belvedere on the
      Pfingstberg is in Germany (west), the Belvedere is NOT located east of the Tafila
      Wind Farm.


      Answer: NO'
    f7403e47-9b09-448c-b092-a9db4306870e: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate Belvedere on the Pfingstberg

      - This appears to be a building/structure in Germany, likely in Potsdam


      2. Next, I need to locate Tafila Wind Farm

      - This seems to be located in Jordan


      3. Since these are in completely different countries (Germany and Jordan), they
      cannot be directly compared in terms of east/west positioning


      4. Without precise geographic coordinates, I cannot definitively determine their
      relative east/west positioning


      5. Given the vast distance between these locations, the question cannot be answered
      with a simple east/west comparison


      Therefore, I cannot confidently say YES or NO.


      If I must choose, I would say NO, but I want to emphasize that this is not based
      on precise geographic verification.


      Answer: NO'
