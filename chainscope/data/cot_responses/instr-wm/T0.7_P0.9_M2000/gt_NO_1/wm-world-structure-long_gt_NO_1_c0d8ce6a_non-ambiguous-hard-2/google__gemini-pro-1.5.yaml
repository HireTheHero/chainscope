      Luxembourg is west of Romania, anything in Luxembourg is west of anything in
      Romania. Therefore, Vianden Pumped Storage Plant is west of the Palace of the
      Patriarchate.


      * **Step 4: Answer the question.** The question asks if the plant is *east*
      of the palace.  Since it''s west, the answer is NO.


      NO
