      refers to the band originally known as "The Boys Next Door," and they released
      an album called "Hee Haw" in 1979. However, if you''re referring to a specific
      song titled "Happy Birthday" by The Birthday Party, there is no well-known song
      by that name. The band did release an album called "Birthday Party" in November
      1980, but it''s important to note that the band changed its name and thus might
      be associated with different releases.


      Given these details, assuming there''s no confusion over the specific song name
      "Happy Birthday" by The Birthday Party, here''s the conclusion:


      - If we consider the release of Christopher Cross''s "Ride Like the Wind" in
      February 1980 and the album "Birthday Party" by The Birthday Party in November
      1980, "Ride Like the Wind" was released earlier.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**; Christopher Cross''s "Ride Like the Wind" was
      not released later than The Birthday Party''s "Happy Birthday" (assuming such
      a song isn''t an error).'

    f6846fc6-ba9e-4d8e-8bc4-a1be29bc3827: 'To determine if Mike Oldfield''s "Let There
      Be Light" was released later than Brandy''s "Brokenhearted," we need to check
      the release dates for both songs.


      1. **Brandy''s "Brokenhearted"**: This song was released as a single in 1995.
      It was part of her debut album, "Brandy," which was released in September 1994,
      but the single itself was released later in 1995.


      2. **Mike Oldfield''s "Let There Be Light"**: This track is from his album "The
      Songs of Distant Earth," which was released in November 1994.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - "Let There Be Light" was released in November 1994.

      - "Brokenhearted" was released as a single in 1995.


      Given this information, Mike Oldfield''s "Let There Be Light" was released before
      Brandy''s "Brokenhearted."

      Given these details:


      - "Ribbon in the Sky" was released in 1982.

      - "Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)" was also released in 1982.


      Since both songs were released in the same year, we need more specific dates
      to determine which one came later. However, without exact release months for
      both initial releases, based on the general information, both were initially
      released in 1982.

      NO.'

      Both songs were released in January 1967, but "The End" was released on January
      4, 1967, while "I Think We''re Alone Now" was released later in January 1967.

      2. **Identify the release year of "I Think We''re Alone Now" by Tommy James

      "The End" was part of The Doors'' debut album released in January 1967, while
      "I Think We''re Alone Now" was released as a single in January 1967.


      Since both songs were released around the same time, the specific months are

      - U2''s "Seconds" was released on February 28, 1983.

      - New Order''s "Blue Monday" was released on March 7, 1983.


      Since February 28 comes before March 7, U2''s "Seconds" was released earlier
      than New Order''s "Blue Monday."


      Therefore, the answer to the question is **NO**.'
