      3. However, the more famous version of "What a Fool Believes" was recorded by

      Now, comparing the release dates:

      - "Last Dance" (1978)

      - "What a Fool Believes" (Kenny Loggins version - July 1978)


      Since "Last Dance" was released in 1978, and *Nightwatch* (with Kenny Loggins''s
      version of "What a Fool Believes") was also released in 1978, we need to be
      precise about which was earlier.


      - "Last Dance" was released in *May 1978* (as part of the movie soundtrack).

      - "Nightwatch" (with Kenny Loggins''s version of "What a Fool Believes") was
      released in *July 1978*.


      Since May 1978 is earlier than July 1978, the answer is:
