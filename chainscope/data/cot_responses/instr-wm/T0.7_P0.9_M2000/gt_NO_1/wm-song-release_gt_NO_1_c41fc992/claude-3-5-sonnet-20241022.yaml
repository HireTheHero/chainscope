      1. First, let me note that there appears to be a mistake in the question - Wet
      Wet Wet did not release a song called "Hold Back the River". That song is by
      James Bay (released in 2014). Wet Wet Wet is known for songs like "Love Is All
      Around."


      2. Janet Jackson''s "Alright" was released in 1990 as the fourth single from
      her album "Rhythm Nation 1814."


      3. Since the question appears to be mixing up artists, and Wet Wet Wet never
      released this song, we should consider James Bay''s "Hold Back the River" (2014)
      for the comparison.


      4. Comparing the dates:

      - Janet Jackson''s "Alright": 1990

      - "Hold Back the River" (by James Bay): 2014


      5. 2014 is later than 1990


      YES (if we consider the James Bay song, which appears to be the one referenced
      in the question)'

      - "Alright" was released in 1990

      2. Now, let me check Wet Wet Wet''s "Hold Back the River"

      - It was released in 2009 (March 23, 2009)


      2. Let me find the release date for Billy Ray Cyrus''s "Butterfly Fly Away"

      - It was released in 2009 (from Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack)

      - More specifically, it was released in March 2009


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Both songs were released in March 2009

      - "Farewell to the Fairground" was released on March 23

      - "Butterfly Fly Away" was released earlier in March


      4. Therefore, White Lies''s song came later in the month


      Answer: YES'

      - "Farewell to the Fairground" was released in March 2009

      - "Butterfly Fly Away" was released in April 2009


      4. Comparing the dates:

      March 2009 comes before April 2009

      NO (Farewell to the Fairground was released earlier, not later than Butterfly
      Fly Away)'

      were released in the same month, I cannot definitively say one came later than
      the other without the exact dates

      in March 2009 to make a definitive comparison, I cannot provide a clear YES

      - Specifically, the album was released in February 1983


      2. Now, let me find the release date of New Order''s "Blue Monday"

      - "Blue Monday" was released as a single in March 1983


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - U2''s "Seconds": February 1983

      - New Order''s "Blue Monday": March 1983

      - March comes after February


      Therefore: NO, U2''s "Seconds" was not released later than New Order''s "Blue
      Monday" - it was released about a month earlier.


      The answer is NO.'
