      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of Vander, NC and Noank, CT.

      - Vander is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - Noank is in Connecticut (CT), which is also on the east coast, but further
      north.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Connecticut is in the New England region in the northeastern United States.

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States, south of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positions.

      - The east coast of the United States generally runs in a northeast-southwest
      direction.

      - This means that locations further north on the east coast (like Connecticut)
      tend to be further east than locations further south (like North Carolina).

      - Connecticut is positioned east of North Carolina on the map.


      Step 4: Specifically for these cities:

      - Noank, CT is located on the eastern coast of Connecticut, near the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - Vander, NC is in North Carolina, which is west of Connecticut''s longitude.

      - U.S. states on the eastern coast are generally arranged with the northeastern
      states (like Connecticut) being further east than the southeastern states (like
      North Carolina).

      - Connecticut is positioned to the northeast of North Carolina.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Fairmead is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Clancy is in Montana (MT), which is in the northwestern United States, east
      of California.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - California is located along the Pacific coast, forming part of the western
      border of the contiguous United States.

      - Montana is located inland, east of California, sharing a border with Canada
      to the north.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Places that are "east" of others have a more easterly longitude.

      - Since Montana is located east of California in the United States, cities in
      Montana (including Clancy) would generally be east of cities in California (including
      Fairmead).


      Therefore, Fairmead, CA is NOT east of Clancy, MT. Rather, Fairmead would be

      if Lago Vista, TX is east of Grain Valley, MO.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both cities.

      - Lago Vista, TX is in Texas, which is in the south-central United States.

      - Grain Valley, MO is in Missouri, which is in the central United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map.

      - Texas is generally west and south of Missouri.

      - Specifically, Missouri is positioned to the northeast of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare the longitude of these locations.

      - Places that are east have a lower longitude number (in the Western Hemisphere).

      - Missouri is east of Texas, meaning Grain Valley, MO would be east of most
      Texas cities.

      - Lago Vista is in central Texas (near Austin), while Grain Valley is in western
      Missouri (near Kansas City).

      Pennsylvania is in the northeast, while Florida is in the southeast. However,
      Pennsylvania extends quite far east, while Florida, though it has an Atlantic
      coastline, also extends westward into the Gulf Coast region.


      The Meadows, FL is likely in central or western Florida, while Montandon, PA
      is in central/eastern Pennsylvania. Based on the typical longitudes of these

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of The Meadows, FL and Montandon,
      PA.

      - The Meadows is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.

      - Montandon is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Florida is located along the Atlantic coast in the southeast.

      - Pennsylvania is also on the eastern side of the US, but further north.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Florida generally extends further east than Pennsylvania, as Florida''s eastern
      coast juts out into the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Specifically, most of Florida is east of Pennsylvania''s longitude.


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - The Meadows, being in Florida, is likely to follow the state''s general positioning.

      - Montandon, PA is in central Pennsylvania, not on its easternmost edge.

      a definitive answer. However, most of Florida is indeed east of Pennsylvania.


      Based on general geography, if "The Meadows" is in central or eastern Florida,
      the answer is YES. If it''s in the western panhandle, it could be NO.

      TN?


      To solve this problem, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two cities.


      Step 1: Identify the approximate locations of both cities.

      - Zavalla, TX is in Texas, which is in the south-central part of the United
      States.

      - New Tazewell, TN is in Tennessee, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west relationship between Texas and Tennessee.

      - Texas is located to the west of Tennessee in the United States.

      - Tennessee is significantly east of Texas.


      Step 3: Since these are smaller cities, let me think about their specific locations
      within their states.

      - Zavalla is in East Texas (likely in the eastern portion of the state)

      - New Tazewell is in northeastern Tennessee


      Step 4: Even though Zavalla is in East Texas, Texas as a whole is significantly
      west of Tennessee. The easternmost parts of Texas are still generally west of
      Tennessee.

      TN?


      To determine this, I need to identify the approximate locations of both cities
      and compare their positions along the east-west axis.


      Step 1: Locate Zavalla, TX.

      Zavalla is a city in East Texas, in Angelina County. Texas is in the south-central
      United States.


      Step 2: Locate New Tazewell, TN.

      New Tazewell is a city in Claiborne County in northeastern Tennessee. Tennessee
      is in the southeastern United States, east of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Texas is west of Tennessee in the United States

      - Since Zavalla is in East Texas and New Tazewell is in northeastern Tennessee,
      their relative positions follow the same pattern as their states

      - Tennessee is significantly east of Texas on the map


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the east-west positioning.

      Since Tennessee is east of Texas, and these cities maintain that same relative
      positioning, Zavalla (TX) must be west of New Tazewell (TN), not east of it.


      NO, Zavalla, TX is not located east of New Tazewell, TN. It is located to the
      west.'

      Step 1: Determine the location of Montura, FL.

      Montura (or Montura Ranch Estates) is located in southern Florida, in Hendry
      County. Florida is on the southeastern coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Canaan, CT.

      Canaan is located in northwestern Connecticut. Connecticut is in the northeastern
      United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      To determine which is further east, I need to consider their relative positions.
      Florida extends further east than Connecticut overall, but I need to check these
      specific locations.


      Connecticut is entirely east of Florida on the map. While Florida is southeast
      of Connecticut, when comparing strictly east-west positioning (longitude), all
      of Connecticut, including Canaan in its northwest corner, lies east of all of
      Florida, including Montura.


      Therefore, Montura, FL is NOT east of Canaan, CT. Montura is west of Canaan

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Texas and Florida.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern corner of the United States, also bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico but much further east than Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - All of Florida, including Belle Isle, lies significantly east of Texas.

      - Therefore, Spring Valley Village in Texas must be west of Belle Isle in Florida.


      Step 4: Determine if Spring Valley Village, TX is east of Belle Isle, FL.

      - Since Spring Valley Village is in Texas (west) and Belle Isle is in Florida
      (east), Spring Valley Village cannot be east of Belle Isle.

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - States along the East Coast (like Virginia) are generally further east than
      Midwestern states (like Michigan)

      - The eastern parts of Michigan might be at similar longitudes to western parts
      of Virginia, but Brown City is not at Michigan''s easternmost edge

      - Fairfax Station is in northern Virginia, relatively close to Washington DC,
      putting it firmly in the eastern part of the US


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Fairfax Station, VA is significantly further east than Brown City, MI

      - Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their approximate longitudes.

      - States on the East Coast (like Virginia) are generally further east than Midwestern
      states (like Michigan)

      - Virginia is positioned significantly east of Michigan on the US map


      Step 4: Verify the specific cities.

      - While specific cities might deviate from the general state positions, Grand
      Blanc is located in eastern Michigan, but Virginia as a whole state is still
      further east than eastern Michigan

      - Hurt, VA would follow Virginia''s eastern positioning relative to Michigan


      Based on this geographic analysis, Grand Blanc, MI is located WEST of Hurt,
      VA (not east).

      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      - Even though Grand Blanc is in eastern Michigan, Michigan as a whole is west

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Folly Beach, SC is located on the Atlantic coast of South Carolina.

      - Lake Hiawatha, NJ is in New Jersey, which is also on the Atlantic coast but
      further north.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      - Both South Carolina and New Jersey are on the eastern seaboard of the United
      States.

      - New Jersey is significantly north of South Carolina.

      - When comparing east-west positioning, I need to consider their longitudes.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - The Atlantic coastline of the United States generally runs from northeast
      to southwest.

      - This means that locations further north (like New Jersey) tend to be further
      east than locations further south (like South Carolina).

      - Lake Hiawatha, NJ is slightly inland from the coast, while Folly Beach is
      directly on the coast.

      - New Jersey''s position is generally east of South Carolina''s position on
      the map.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Based on the geography of the eastern United States, Lake Hiawatha, NJ would
      be east of Folly Beach, SC.


      NO, Folly Beach, SC is not located east of Lake Hiawatha, NJ. It''s the opposite

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Folly Beach, SC is located on the Atlantic coast of South Carolina.

      - Lake Hiawatha, NJ is located in northern New Jersey.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to the U.S. East Coast.

      - Folly Beach is directly on the Atlantic Ocean in South Carolina, which is
      on the southeastern coast.

      - Lake Hiawatha is in New Jersey, which is also on the East Coast but further
      north.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - In the United States, coastal locations along the Atlantic generally follow
      a northeast to southwest orientation.

      - This means locations further north on the East Coast (like in New Jersey)
      tend to be further east than locations further south (like in South Carolina).

      - New Jersey''s eastern shore extends further east than South Carolina''s coast.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Lake Hiawatha, NJ, being in northern New Jersey, is positioned further east
      than Folly Beach, SC.

      positions of Folly Beach, SC and Lake Hiawatha, NJ.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Folly Beach is in South Carolina (SC), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - Lake Hiawatha is in New Jersey (NJ), which is also on the east coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is in the northeastern part of the U.S. east coast.

      - South Carolina is further south along the east coast.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning.

      - The U.S. east coast generally runs in a northeast to southwest direction.

      - This means locations further north on the east coast (like New Jersey) tend
      to be further east than locations further south (like South Carolina).

      - New Jersey is generally east of South Carolina.


      Step 4: Specifically for these locations:

      - Folly Beach is on the Atlantic Ocean in South Carolina.

      - Lake Hiawatha is inland in New Jersey.

      - Even though Folly Beach is on the coast, the eastward curve of the coastline
