      Ridge is a neighborhood/community in the Denver metropolitan area, thus in the
      state of Colorado. Colorado is in the western US.


      2. **Locate Gruver, TX:** Gruver is a city in the Texas Panhandle. The Texas
      Panhandle is in the northernmost part of Texas, but still in the central US.


      3. **Relative Position:** Colorado is west of Texas. Therefore, a location in
      Colorado is generally west of a location in Texas.


      4. **Specific Case:** While the Texas Panhandle extends somewhat westward, it''s
      still significantly east of the Denver metropolitan area.

      2. **Locate Gruver, TX:** Gruver is a city in Hansford County, Texas in the
      Texas Panhandle.


      3. **Compare their longitudinal positions:** Colorado is west of Texas.  Therefore,
      a location in Colorado is generally going to be west of a location in Texas.


      4. **Consider exceptions:** While the westernmost part of Texas might be west
      of the easternmost part of Colorado, this is a very narrow sliver and unlikely
      in this case given the locations described.

      Dakota (ND) and Iowa (IA).** North Dakota is in the northern Great Plains, west
      of Minnesota. Iowa is south of Minnesota.


      2. **Consider the relative positions.** Since North Dakota is west of Minnesota,
      and Iowa is east of Minnesota (and south), North Dakota is generally west of
      Iowa.


      3. **Specific cities don''t change the general east-west relationship of the
      states.**  Lakota being in ND and Rockwell City being in IA means Lakota is
      likely west of Rockwell City.

      (ND) is a northern midwestern state.

      2. **Locate Rockwell City, IA:** Iowa (IA) is directly south of ND, in the midwest.

      3. **East/West Relationship:**  Since North Dakota is directly north of Iowa,
      and not angled, any city in ND will be roughly north, not east or west, of any
      city in IA.  For a city in ND to be east of a city in IA, there would need to
      be a significant longitudinal difference.

      4. **Conclusion:** Lakota, ND cannot be significantly east of Rockwell City,
      IA.
