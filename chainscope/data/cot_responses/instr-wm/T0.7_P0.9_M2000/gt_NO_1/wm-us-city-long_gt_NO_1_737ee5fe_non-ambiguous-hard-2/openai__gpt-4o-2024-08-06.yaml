      1. **Identify the location of Dakota Ridge, CO:** Dakota Ridge is an area located
      near Littleton, Colorado, which is in the western part of the state. Colorado
      is generally situated in the Mountain Time Zone, which means it is west of the
      central part of the United States.

      Texas Panhandle, which is in the northwestern part of Texas. Texas is mostly
      in the Central Time Zone, but the Panhandle is further west than the central
      part of the state.


      3. **Compare the longitudes:** Since Dakota Ridge, CO, is near Littleton, it
      is west of the center of the U.S. Gruver, TX, being in the Panhandle, is also
      west of the central United States, but Colorado is generally further west than
