      1. **Locate Cayuga, IN**: Cayuga is in the western part of Indiana, near the
      border with Illinois.

      2. **Locate Dortches, NC**: Dortches is located in North Carolina, specifically
      in the eastern part of the state near Rocky Mount.

      3. **Compare Longitudes**: Indiana generally lies to the west of North Carolina.
      Given that Cayuga is in Indiana and Dortches is in North Carolina, we can infer
      that Cayuga''s longitude is likely west of Dortches.


      Since Cayuga is located in Indiana, which is to the west of North Carolina,
      it follows that Cayuga, IN is not east of Dortches, NC.

      east of Crown Heights, NY, we need to consider the geographical locations of
      both places.


      1. **Identify the location of South Lyon, MI**: South Lyon is a city located
      in the southeastern part of Michigan, near the western suburbs of Detroit.


      2. **Identify the location of Crown Heights, NY**: Crown Heights is a neighborhood

      3. **Compare their longitudes**: Generally, when comparing east and west locations
      in the United States, we look at their longitudes. Michigan is to the west of
      New York, so we can conclude that South Lyon, MI, being in Michigan, has a longitude
      that is west of New York.


      4. **Determine the east-west relationship**: Since South Lyon is in Michigan
      and Crown Heights is in New York, South Lyon is west of Crown Heights.

      1. **Locate Boyes Hot Springs, CA**: Boyes Hot Springs is situated in Sonoma
      County, California, which is in the northern part of the state.


      2. **Locate Murray, UT**: Murray is located in the Salt Lake Valley in Utah,
      which is east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range and generally further east
      than Boyes Hot Springs.


      3. **Compare the Longitudes**: Boyes Hot Springs has a longitude of approximately
      -122.5, while Murray, UT has a longitude of about -111.9. Since negative values
      indicate west of the Prime Meridian, a smaller negative number (more to the
      right) means it is further east.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that the longitude of Murray, UT is significantly less
      than that of Boyes Hot Springs, we can conclude that Boyes Hot Springs is west
      of Murray.

      2. **Bellview, FL** is located in the northwestern part of Florida, near the

      Next, we need to consider their longitudes:


      - Missouri is generally to the north of Florida, but since Grant City is in
      the northwestern part of Missouri, it is also west of many locations in Florida.

      - Florida extends further east than Missouri, meaning that any city in Florida,
