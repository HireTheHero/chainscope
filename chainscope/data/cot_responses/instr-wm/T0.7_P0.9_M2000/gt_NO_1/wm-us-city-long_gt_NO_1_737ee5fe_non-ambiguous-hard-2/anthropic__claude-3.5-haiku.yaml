      1. First, let''s locate Anacortes, WA on a map:

      - Anacortes is located in Washington state

      - It is in the northwestern part of Washington

      - Specifically, it is on Fidalgo Island in Skagit County

      - Its location is west of the Cascade Mountains


      2. Next, let''s locate Council, ID on a map:

      - Council is located in Adams County, Idaho

      - It is in the western part of Idaho

      - Its location is much further east compared to Anacortes, WA


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Anacortes is west of the Cascade Mountains

      - Council is in western Idaho, which is east of Washington state

      - This means Council is significantly east of Anacortes
