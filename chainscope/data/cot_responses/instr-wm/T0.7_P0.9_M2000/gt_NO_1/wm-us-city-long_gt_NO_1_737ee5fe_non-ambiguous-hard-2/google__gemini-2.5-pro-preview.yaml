      of North Carolina on a map of the United States.

      4.  **Determine the relative position of the cities based on their states:**
      Since Pickensville is in Alabama and Ellenboro is in North Carolina, Pickensville
      must be located west of Ellenboro.

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Pickensville, AL
      is located *east* of Ellenboro, NC. Based on the reasoning above, it is located
      *west*.

      1.  **Identify the first location:** Crystal Lake, IL (Illinois).

      2.  **Identify the second location:** Adelphi, MD (Maryland).

      3.  **Determine the state locations:** Illinois is a state in the Midwestern
      United States. Maryland is a state on the East Coast of the United States.

      4.  **Compare the states'' relative east-west positions:** The Midwest is west
      of the East Coast. Therefore, Illinois is west of Maryland.

      5.  **Apply to the cities:** Since Crystal Lake is in Illinois and Adelphi is
      in Maryland, Crystal Lake, IL must be located west of Adelphi, MD.

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to compare Biwabik, Minnesota (MN) and
      Fowlerville, Michigan (MI).

      2.  **Determine relative positions:** The question asks about east/west positioning,
      which relates to longitude. Locations further west have a more negative longitude
      (or a larger number if just considering degrees West). Locations further east
      have a less negative longitude (or a smaller number if just considering degrees
      West).

      3.  **Find the longitude of Biwabik, MN:** Biwabik, MN is located at approximately
      92.3 degrees West longitude.

      4.  **Find the longitude of Fowlerville, MI:** Fowlerville, MI is located at
      approximately 84.1 degrees West longitude.

      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** 92.3 W is further west than 84.1 W. Or, looking
      at the numbers, -92.3 is less than -84.1.

      6.  **Conclusion:** Since Biwabik''s longitude (92.3 W) represents a position
      further west than Fowlerville''s longitude (84.1 W), Biwabik is west of Fowlerville.
      Therefore, Biwabik is *not* east of Fowlerville.

      1.  **Identify Location 1:** Pocola, OK (Oklahoma)

      2.  **Identify Location 2:** Candlewood Lake, OH (Ohio)

      3.  **Determine the state locations:** Oklahoma is a state located west of the
      Mississippi River, in the South Central US. Ohio is a state located east of
      the Mississippi River, in the Midwest/Northeast US.

      4.  **Compare the states:** Geographically, Ohio is located significantly east
      of Oklahoma.

      5.  **Compare the specific locations:** Since the entire state of Ohio is east
      of the entire state of Oklahoma, any location within Ohio (like Candlewood Lake)
      will be east of any location within Oklahoma (like Pocola).

      6.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Pocola, OK is *east* of Candlewood
      Lake, OH. Based on the reasoning above, Pocola, OK is *west* of Candlewood Lake,

      \ Old Miakka, Florida (FL).\n2.  **Determine their relative positions:** We\
      \ need to figure out which one is further east or west. This is determined by\
      \ their longitude.\n3.  **Find the approximate longitude of Turley, OK:** Turley\
      \ is near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Its longitude is approximately 95.9\xB0 West.\n4.\
      \  **Find the approximate longitude of Old Miakka, FL:** Old Miakka is in Sarasota\
