      is in Pennsylvania.


      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Florida is generally considered to be
      in the southeastern United States, while Pennsylvania is in the northeastern
      United States.


      3. **Relative positions**: The Southeast is generally east of the Northeast
      in the United States.


      4. **Specific city locations**: Pomona Park, FL, is specifically located in
      the northeastern part of Florida. Lorane, PA, is in the southeastern part of
      Pennsylvania.


      5. **East-West comparison**: Since Florida is generally east of Pennsylvania,
      a city in Florida (even in its northeastern part) would typically be east of
      a city in Pennsylvania (even in its southeastern part).


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Pomona Park, FL is located east of
      Lorane, PA is: YES

      is in Pennsylvania (PA).

      2. **General geographical knowledge**: North Carolina is located in the southeastern
      United States, while Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States.

      3. **Relative positions**: The southeastern United States is generally south
      and east of the northeastern United States.

      4. **Specific city locations**: Cove Creek is in the western part of North Carolina,
      and Allenport is in the western part of Pennsylvania.

      5. **East-West comparison**: Since North Carolina is generally east of Pennsylvania,
      a city in North Carolina (even in its western part) would typically be east
      of a city in Pennsylvania (even in its western part).

      the geographical locations of both cities and their relative positions. Here
      are the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX, is in Texas, and
      Epworth, IA, is in Iowa.

      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Texas is located in the southern part
      of the United States, while Iowa is in the central part.

      3. **Relative positions**: Generally, the southern part of the U.S. is considered
      west of the central part. Therefore, Texas is west of Iowa.

      4. **Specific city locations**: Las Quintas Fronterizas is in the western part

      east of East Rockaway, NY, we need to consider the geographical locations of
      both cities.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Cuthbert, GA, is a city in Randolph County, Georgia.
      East Rockaway, NY, is a village in Nassau County, New York.

      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Georgia is generally located in the southeastern
      United States, while New York is in the northeastern United States.

      3. **Relative positions**: The southeastern U.S. is generally west of the northeastern
      U.S. Therefore, cities in Georgia would typically be west of cities in New York.

      4. **Specific city locations**: Cuthbert, GA, is located in the southwestern
      part of Georgia. East Rockaway, NY, is located in the southeastern part of New
      York.

      5. **East-West comparison**: Since Cuthbert, GA, is in the southwestern part
      of Georgia and East Rockaway, NY, is in the southeastern part of New York, Cuthbert
      would be west of East Rockaway.


      Based on these steps, the answer is: NO. Cuthbert, GA, is located west of East
      Rockaway, NY, not east of it.

    09673ddc-238a-4b7c-a95d-786f2e129405: 'To determine if Grand Blanc, MI is located
      east of Hurt, VA, we need to consider their relative positions in the United
      States. Here are the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Grand Blanc, MI is a city in Michigan, and Hurt,
      VA is a town in Virginia.

      2. **Consider the general east-west alignment of states**: Michigan is located
      in the Midwest, while Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic region. The Midwest
      is generally considered to be west of the Mid-Atlantic.

      3. **Consider the specific locations within the states**: Grand Blanc is in
      southeastern Michigan, and Hurt is in southern Virginia. However, their specific
      positions within the states do not change the fact that Michigan is generally
      west of Virginia.

      4. **Conclusion**: Since Michigan is west of Virginia, any city in Michigan,
      including Grand Blanc, is west of any city in Virginia, including Hurt. Therefore,
      Grand Blanc, MI is not located east of Hurt, VA.
