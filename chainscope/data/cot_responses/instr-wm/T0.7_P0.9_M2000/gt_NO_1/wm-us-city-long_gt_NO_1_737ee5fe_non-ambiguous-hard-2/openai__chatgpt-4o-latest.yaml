      located east of Quentin, PA, we need to consider their geographical locations,
      specifically their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Portageville, Missouri.

      - Portageville is a city in southeastern Missouri, in the Bootheel region of
      the state.

      - Missouri is located in the central United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Quentin, Pennsylvania.

      - Quentin is a small community in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - Longitudes increase as you move westward in the Western Hemisphere.

      - Pennsylvania is generally east of Missouri.


      Therefore, since Pennsylvania is east of Missouri, Quentin, PA is east of Portageville,
      MO.


      So, the question is asking whether Portageville, MO is located east of Quentin,
      PA.

      located east of Bantam, CT, we need to consider the geographic locations (specifically,
      the longitudes) of both places.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Knightsville is a community in Indiana (IN), which is in the Midwest region
      of the United States.

      - Bantam is a village in Connecticut (CT), which is in the northeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Understand US geography.

      - Connecticut is located on the eastern seaboard of the US.

      - Indiana is located to the west of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Use longitude to compare east-west positions.

      - The more negative the longitude, the further west the location is.

      - Connecticut''s longitudes are generally around -73 to -72 degrees.

      - Indiana''s longitudes are generally around -88 to -84 degrees.


      This means that Indiana is significantly west of Connecticut.


      Conclusion: Knightsville, IN is located west of Bantam, CT.

      **Step 1: Identify the location of Florissant, MO**

      - Florissant is a city in the state of Missouri.

      - It is located in the central part of the United States, near St. Louis.

      - The approximate longitude of Florissant, MO is around **-90.3 degrees**.

      - Schall Circle is a census-designated place in Palm Beach County, Florida.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern part of the United States.

      - The approximate longitude of Schall Circle, FL is around **-80.1 degrees**.


      **Step 3: Compare longitudes**

      - Florissant, MO: ~ -90.3 (further west)

      - Schall Circle, FL: ~ -80.1 (further east)


      Since -90.3 is west of -80.1 (more negative means further west), Florissant
