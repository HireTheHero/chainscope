      1. First, I''ll locate Rancho Santiago Community College District:

      - This is located in Orange County, California

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate Cincinnati Christian University:

      - This is located in Cincinnati, Ohio

      - Ohio is in the Midwestern United States


      3. Comparing their geographic locations:

      - California is west of Ohio

      - California is also significantly south of Ohio


      4. Specifically for the north/south question:

      - Since California is south of Ohio, Rancho Santiago Community College District
      is NOT north of Cincinnati Christian University


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
