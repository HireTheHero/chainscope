      1. First, I''ll locate Rowan County, NC:

      - Rowan County is in North Carolina, which is in the southeastern United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate Itasca County, MN:

      - Itasca County is in Minnesota, which is in the north-central United States


      3. Compare their latitudes:

      - North Carolina is at a lower latitude (further south) than Minnesota

      - This means counties in NC are generally south of counties in MN


      4. Therefore, Rowan County, NC is located SOUTH of Itasca County, MN.


      Since the question asks if Rowan County is NORTH of Itasca County, and we''ve
      determined it is actually south, the answer is:


      NO'
