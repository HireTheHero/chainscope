    b35c1879-6d6c-47f3-b833-f212a2ff228f: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Ko Kret is an island located in the Chao Phraya River in central Thailand,
      specifically in Nonthaburi Province, near Bangkok.


      2. Tawang district is located in the northeastern part of Arunachal Pradesh,
      India, which is a mountainous region bordering China.


      3. Geographically, Thailand is located in Southeast Asia, while Arunachal Pradesh
      is in northeastern India.


      4. When comparing their locations, Ko Kret is significantly south of the Tawang
      district.


      5. Therefore, Ko Kret is NOT located north of Tawang district.

      6. Therefore, Uruma (being in Japan) would be located north of Bereket (being
      in Turkmenistan).


      The answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I need to locate Vijapur

      - Vijapur is a town located in Gujarat, India

      - It is in the western part of India


      2. Next, I need to locate Churchill, Somerset

      - Churchill is a village in Somerset, England, United Kingdom

      - Somerset is in the southwest of England


      3. Comparing their geographical locations

      - Vijapur is in India, which is in the southern hemisphere and much further
      east

      - Churchill, Somerset is in England, which is in the northern hemisphere of
      Europe


      4. Determining their relative north/south position

      - Since Vijapur is located in India (south of the UK) and Churchill is in England,
      Vijapur is NOT north of Churchill, Somerset

      1. First, let''s locate Urupukapuka Island:

      - Urupukapuka Island is located in New Zealand

      - Specifically, it is in the Bay of Islands, in the Northland Region of New
      Zealand''s North Island


      2. Next, let''s locate Mombasa Island:

      - Mombasa is a city in Kenya, located on the coast of East Africa

      - It is situated on an island off the coast of Kenya


      3. Now, let''s compare their geographical positions:

      - Urupukapuka Island is in the Southern Hemisphere, in the South Pacific

      - Mombasa Island is in the Southern Hemisphere, in East Africa

      - New Zealand is much further south and east compared to Kenya


      4. Determining the relative north-south position:

      - Urupukapuka Island is located significantly south of the equator

      - Mombasa Island is located just south of the equator

      - This means Urupukapuka Island is further south than Mombasa Island


      5. Conclusion:

      Since Urupukapuka Island is further south than Mombasa Island, it is NOT located
      north of Mombasa Island.
