      1. First, locate Diamond Valley Lake, CA:

      - Diamond Valley Lake is located in Riverside County, California

      - It is in Southern California, specifically near the city of Hemet


      2. Next, locate Kettle River Range, WA:

      - The Kettle River Range is located in northeastern Washington state

      - It is part of the Colville National Forest in Stevens County


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Diamond Valley Lake is in Southern California

      - Kettle River Range is in Northeastern Washington

      - These locations are quite far apart, in different states and different regions
      of the western United States


      4. Determine relative north/south positioning:

      - Washington state is north of California

      - Therefore, the Kettle River Range is north of Diamond Valley Lake


      5. Answer the specific question:

      - Is Diamond Valley Lake, CA located north of Kettle River Range, WA?

      - No, it is located south of the Kettle River Range
