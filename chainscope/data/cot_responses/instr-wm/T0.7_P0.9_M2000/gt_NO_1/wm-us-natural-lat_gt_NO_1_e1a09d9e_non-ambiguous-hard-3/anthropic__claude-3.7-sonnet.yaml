      Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Lake Washington is in Florida (FL), specifically in Brevard County in east-central
      Florida.

      - Lake Tonawanda is in New York (NY), in the western part of New York state.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship between Florida and New
      York.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Generally, New York is north of Florida.


      Step 3: Make the final comparison.

      - Since Lake Washington is in Florida and Lake Tonawanda is in New York, and
      New York is north of Florida, Lake Washington must be south of Lake Tonawanda.

      - Therefore, Lake Washington (FL) is NOT located north of Lake Tonawanda (NY).

    aacac2f7-b080-449f-aa40-5721a00447a1: '# Is Hueco Mountains, TX located north
      of Bighorn Mountains, WY?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) Hueco Mountains are located in Texas (TX), specifically in west Texas near
      El Paso.


      2) Bighorn Mountains are located in Wyoming (WY), in the northern part of the
      state.


      3) Geographically, Wyoming is located north of Texas in the United States. Wyoming
      borders Montana to the north and Colorado to the south, while Texas is much
      further south, bordering Mexico.


      4) Since Wyoming is entirely north of Texas, any mountain range in Wyoming (including
      the Bighorn Mountains) would be north of any mountain range in Texas (including
      the Hueco Mountains).


      Therefore, the Hueco Mountains in TX are NOT located north of the Bighorn Mountains
      in WY. Rather, they are south of the Bighorn Mountains.


      NO'

      of Hueco Mountains, TX and Bighorn Mountains, WY.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Hueco Mountains are in Texas (TX)

      - Bighorn Mountains are in Wyoming (WY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - Wyoming is located in the northwestern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Texas is generally south of Wyoming

      - Wyoming borders Montana to the north and Colorado to the south

      - Texas borders Mexico to the south


      Step 4: More specifically, the Hueco Mountains are in western Texas near El
      Paso, close to the Mexico border, which is in the far southern part of the United
      States.

      - The Bighorn Mountains are in northern Wyoming, which is much further north.


      Since Wyoming is entirely north of Texas, and the Hueco Mountains are in Texas
      while the Bighorn Mountains are in Wyoming, the Hueco Mountains must be south
      of the Bighorn Mountains.


      NO, Hueco Mountains, TX is not located north of Bighorn Mountains, WY.'

      - MN stands for Minnesota, which is located in the northern United States, bordering

      - Even if the Ouachita Mountains are in northern Arkansas and Woman Lake is
      in southern Minnesota, Minnesota is still significantly north of Arkansas.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Vulture Mountains is in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern United
      States.

      - Swan Lake is in Montana (MT), which is in the northwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map.

      - Montana is located along the northern border of the United States (bordering
      Canada).

      - Arizona is located in the southwest, bordering Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Montana is significantly north of Arizona on a map of the United States.

      - Any location in Montana would be north of most locations in Arizona.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      - Since Swan Lake is in Montana and Vulture Mountains is in Arizona, Swan Lake
      must be north of Vulture Mountains.

      - Therefore, Vulture Mountains cannot be north of Swan Lake.

      - South Dakota is in the northern United States

      - South Dakota is clearly north of Texas on a map


      Step 3: Since the lakes are in their respective states:

      - Medina Lake, being in Texas, must be south of South Dakota

      - Lake Thompson, being in South Dakota, must be north of Texas

      position) than a lake in Texas.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Step 2: Determine the location of Lake Thompson, SD.

      Lake Thompson is located in South Dakota, in the eastern part of the state.

      d''Alene, Idaho.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes.

      - Southern California (where San Jacinto Mountains are) is at a much lower latitude
      than northern Idaho/eastern Washington (where the aquifer is).

      - California extends north to south, with southern California being at a lower
      latitude than northern Idaho.

      - The San Jacinto Mountains are in the southern portion of California, while
      the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer is near the Washington-Idaho border
      in the northern part of those states.


      Step 3: Determine the north-south relationship.

      - Northern Idaho and eastern Washington are significantly north of southern
      California.

      - Therefore, the San Jacinto Mountains are south of the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum
      Prairie Aquifer, not north of it.
