      Hospitality Under the Influence" by Amy Sedaris:** This book has 272 pages according
      to Goodreads.  Amy Sedaris''s Ada Wigfield series is a series for young readers,
      and the books within that series would assumedly have less pages than her adult
      titles.

      not part of the Ada Wigfield series) < 375


      4. **Determine if Ada Wigfield (any book in the series) has MORE pages than
      A Knight of the Word:**  Since even Amy Sedaris''s adult title has fewer pages
      and her children''s books would likely have even fewer pages, it is highly unlikely
      any book in the Ada Wigfield series has more pages.

      as a whole, it''s likely referring to the entire series.  Even a single book
