      - Suzanne Collins''s "Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods" is a middle-grade
      fantasy novel, the third book in the Underland Chronicles. It typically has
      around 358 pages in its standard edition.

      Upon reflection, I should note that Amy Sedaris doesn''t have a book titled
      "Ada Wigfield." Amy Sedaris has written books like "I Like You: Hospitality

      Step 1: Let me identify J.M. Coetzee''s "Diary of a Bad Year."

      This is a novel published in 2007 by Nobel Prize winner J.M. Coetzee. According
      to standard references, it has approximately 231 pages (though editions may
      vary slightly).


      Step 2: Let me identify C.J. Cherryh''s "Devil to the Belt."

      "Devil to the Belt" is actually an omnibus volume that combines two of Cherryh''s
      earlier novels: "Heavy Time" and "Hellburner." As an omnibus, it contains both
      books in one volume, which would make it substantially longer than a single
      novel. The combined page count is approximately 704 pages.


      Step 3: Compare the page counts.

      Diary of a Bad Year: ~231 pages

      Devil to the Belt: ~704 pages


      Since 231 is less than 704, J.M. Coetzee''s "Diary of a Bad Year" does not have

      - J. M. Coetzee''s "Diary of a Bad Year" typically has around 178-231 pages,
      depending on the edition.

      - C. J. Cherryh''s "Devil to the Belt" is actually an omnibus volume containing
      two novels: "Heavy Time" and "Hellburner." As an omnibus, it typically contains

      - "Diary of a Bad Year" has approximately 178-231 pages.

      - "Devil to the Belt" has approximately 700-800 pages.

      Since "Devil to the Belt" has significantly more pages (700-800) than "Diary
      of a Bad Year" (178-231), Coetzee''s book does not have more pages than Cherryh''s

      - "League of Dragons" by Naomi Novik (part of the Temeraire series)


      Step 2: Research the page counts of each book.

      - "The Initiation" by L. J. Smith typically has around 287-320 pages, depending
      on the edition.

      - "League of Dragons" by Naomi Novik is approximately 380-400 pages, depending

      First, let me clarify something important: "If I Did It: Confessions of the

      with commentary by the Goldman family and Dominick Dunne was involved in covering
      the case as a journalist. The book is about 208-227 pages depending on the edition.


      However, there''s a confusion here - Dominick Dunne didn''t write "If I Did
      It." He wrote other books like "Another City, Not My Own" about the O.J. Simpson
      trial.


      As for "Tales from Jabba''s Palace," this Star Wars anthology was edited by
      Kevin J. Anderson, not M. Shayne Bell (though Bell may have contributed a story).

      - "Tales from Jabba''s Palace" by M. Shayne Bell


      Step 2: Clarify a factual error in the question.

      "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" was actually written by O.J. Simpson
      (as a hypothetical account), though the Goldman family was awarded rights to
      the book in a civil judgment. The book was published with commentary by Dominick

      - "If I Did It" is typically around 208-252 pages depending on the edition.

      - "Tales from Jabba''s Palace" (which was edited by Kevin J. Anderson, not written
      by M. Shayne Bell - Bell was just one contributor) is approximately 368 pages.

      typically has around 288-320 pages, depending on the edition.

      - Minette Walters''s "The Sculptress" typically has around 300-352 pages, depending

      300 pages, while "Bid Time Return" is often closer to 288 pages.

      Step 2: Compare the page counts.

      226 pages (The Abortion) vs. 448 pages (The Skies of Pern)

      Since 226 is less than 448, "The Abortion" has fewer pages than "The Skies of
      Pern."
