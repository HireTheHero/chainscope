      1. **Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods**: This is the third book in the
      "Underland Chronicles" series by Suzanne Collins. It is a middle-grade fantasy
      novel. Typically, books in this genre and series have a page count in the range
      of about 300-400 pages. Specifically, this book has approximately 358 pages.


      2. **The Trouble with Physics**: This is a non-fiction science book by Lee Smolin.
      Non-fiction books, especially those dealing with complex subjects like physics,
      can vary in length, but this book is known to be quite comprehensive. It has
      around 392 pages.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - "Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods": ~358 pages
