      1.  **Identify Book 1:** *Scarecrow and the Army of Thieves* by Matthew Reilly.

      2.  **Find Page Count for Book 1:** Search for the page count of this book.
      Different editions exist, but common ones (like the Simon & Schuster mass market
      paperback) list around **560 pages**. Other editions might be slightly different
      (e.g., hardcover around 464 pages), but generally in the 450-600 page range.

      3.  **Identify Book 2:** *The Reality Dysfunction* by Peter F. Hamilton.

      4.  **Find Page Count for Book 2:** Search for the page count of this book.
      This book is famously very long. Common editions (like the Tor Books or Pan
      Macmillan paperbacks) list page counts significantly higher, often around **1160
      to 1230 pages**, depending on the specific edition and formatting.

      5.  **Compare Page Counts:** Compare the page count of *Scarecrow and the Army
      of Thieves* (~460-560 pages) with the page count of *The Reality Dysfunction*
      (~1160-1230 pages).

      6.  **Determine the Answer:** Is the page count of *Scarecrow and the Army of
      Thieves* *more* than the page count of *The Reality Dysfunction*? No, ~460-560
      is considerably *less* than ~1160-1230.

      3.  **Identify Book 2:** *Aurora Rising* by Alastair Reynolds. It''s important
      to note this is a specific science fiction *novella* by Alastair Reynolds, often
      published as part of his collection *Galactic North* or in anthologies. It is
      *not* the much longer YA novel of the same name by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff.

      4.  **Find Page Count/Length for Book 2:** As a novella published within a collection,
      *Aurora Rising* by Alastair Reynolds does not typically have its own standalone
      page count in the same way a full novel does. However, novellas are significantly
      shorter than typical novels. Estimating its length within the *Galactic North*
      collection (which is 416 pages total for multiple stories), *Aurora Rising*
      itself would likely occupy somewhere in the range of **50-80 standard pages**
      if printed alone.

      5.  **Compare Page Counts:** Compare the page count of *Atheist Delusions* (272
      pages) with the estimated length of the novella *Aurora Rising* (~50-80 pages).

      6.  **Conclusion:** 272 pages is significantly more than 50-80 pages.


      Therefore:

      1.  **Identify Book 1:** *Make Room! Make Room!* by Harry Harrison.

      2.  **Find its page count:** Page counts can vary by edition. A common paperback
      edition (e.g., Berkley Medallion) has around 224 pages. The original hardcover
      might be slightly different but in the same ballpark (around 215-220 pages).
      Let''s use ~220 pages as a representative number.

      3.  **Identify Book 2:** *Full Circle* by Danielle Steel.

      4.  **Find its page count:** Again, page counts vary. A common paperback edition
      (e.g., Dell) has around 384 pages. The original hardcover (Delacorte Press)
      has 371 pages. Let''s use ~370-380 pages as a representative number.

      5.  **Compare the page counts:** Compare ~220 pages (*Make Room! Make Room!*)
      with ~370-380 pages (*Full Circle*).

      6.  **Conclusion:** ~220 is less than ~370-380. Therefore, *Make Room! Make
