      - Gulf of Hammamet is located in northeastern Tunisia

      - It is part of the Mediterranean Sea

      - It is situated on the eastern coast of Tunisia


      2. Next, let''s locate Sarez Lake:

      - Sarez Lake is located in Tajikistan

      - It is in the Pamir Mountains in the eastern part of the country


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Gulf of Hammamet is in North Africa (Tunisia)

      - Sarez Lake is in Central Asia (Tajikistan)

      - These locations are very far apart, on different continents


      4. To determine east/west relationship:

      - If we look at a world map, Sarez Lake is much further east than the Gulf of
      Hammamet

      - So the Gulf of Hammamet is actually west of Sarez Lake, not east


      5. Therefore, the answer to "Is Gulf of Hammamet located east of Sarez Lake?"

    a93f9579-4ec7-4ef3-ab22-13331a2ee9c2: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate the Rwenzori Mountains:

      - The Rwenzori Mountains are located in Uganda, in East Africa

      - Specifically, they are on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic
      of the Congo


      2. Next, let''s locate Mount Apo:

      - Mount Apo is located in the Philippines

      - It is situated on the island of Mindanao, in the southern part of the Philippines


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Rwenzori Mountains are in East Africa

      - Mount Apo is in Southeast Asia

      - These locations are on completely different continents


      4. Determining east/west relationship:

      - If we look at a world map, Mount Apo is much further east compared to the
      Rwenzori Mountains

      - Therefore, the Rwenzori Mountains are NOT east of Mount Apo


      5. Conclusion:

      The answer is NO, the Rwenzori Mountains are not located east of Mount Apo.
