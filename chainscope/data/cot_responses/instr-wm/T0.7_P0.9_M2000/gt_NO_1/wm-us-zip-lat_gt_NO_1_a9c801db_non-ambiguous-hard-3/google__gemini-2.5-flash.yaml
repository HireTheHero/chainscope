    6b6d0687-0f79-49ac-9714-d53374735999: 'Let''s break this down step-by-step to
      determine if 22134, VA is located north of 07852, NJ.


      **Step 1: Determine the general location of each zip code.**


      *   **22134, VA:** This zip code is in Annandale, Fairfax County, Virginia.
      Virginia is a Mid-Atlantic state.

      *   **07852, NJ:** This zip code is in Rockaway, Morris County, New Jersey.
      New Jersey is also a Mid-Atlantic state, located to the north of Virginia.


      **Step 2: Compare the latitudes.**


      While a precise latitude lookup would be ideal, we can infer based on the general
      geography of Virginia and New Jersey.


      *   Virginia generally lies at lower latitudes than New Jersey.

      *   New Jersey is geographically positioned to the north of Virginia.


      **Step 3: Conclude based on north/south positioning.**


      Since New Jersey is north of Virginia, any specific point within New Jersey
      will generally be north of any specific point within Virginia, assuming standard
      geographic positioning. Rockaway, NJ, is clearly within the borders of New Jersey,
      and Annandale, VA, is clearly within the borders of Virginia.


      **Step 4: Formulate the YES/NO answer.**


      Based on the geographical relationship between Virginia and New Jersey, a location
      in Virginia (Annandale) will be south of a location in New Jersey (Rockaway).
      Therefore, 22134, VA is *not* located north of 07852, NJ.

      22134, VA is located north of 07852, NJ.


      **Step 1: Determine the general location of 22134, VA.**

      22134 is a zip code for Fairfax Station, Virginia. Virginia is a state on the
      Atlantic coast, south of Maryland and north of North Carolina. Its northern
      border is roughly aligned with the southern border of Pennsylvania.


      **Step 2: Determine the general location of 07852, NJ.**

      07852 is a zip code for Ledgewood, New Jersey. New Jersey is a state on the
      Atlantic coast, north of Delaware and south of New York.


      **Step 3: Compare the relative latitudes.**

      Virginia is generally considered a Southern or Mid-Atlantic state, while New
      Jersey is generally considered a Mid-Atlantic or Northeastern state. Geographically,
      New Jersey is situated to the north of Virginia.


      **Step 4: Conclude based on relative positions.**

      Since New Jersey is geographically north of Virginia, any location within Virginia
      will be south of any location within New Jersey (assuming typical north-south
      alignment).


      Therefore, 22134, VA is located south of 07852, NJ.

      **Step 3: Compare their latitudes.**

      While we don''t need exact latitude coordinates, we can infer the general relationship
      from their state locations. New Jersey is south of New York. Therefore, cities
      in northern New Jersey will generally be south of cities in central New York.


      **Step 4: Formulate the answer to the question.**

      The question is: "Is 07114, NJ located north of 13502, NY?"

      Since Newark, NJ is south of Utica, NY, the answer to the question is the opposite.

      answer.


      **Step 1: Determine the general location of each ZIP code.**


      *   **60651, IL:** This ZIP code is in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is in the
      northeastern part of Illinois.

      *   **54180, WI:** This ZIP code is for Wrightstown, Wisconsin. Wrightstown
      is in northeastern Wisconsin, near Green Bay.


      **Step 2: Compare the latitudes.**


      While just knowing the state isn''t enough for a precise north/south comparison,
      we can infer some general information. Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois.


      To be more precise, let''s look up approximate latitude for a point within each
      ZIP code:


      *   **60651 (Chicago, IL):** Roughly 41.9 degrees North latitude.

      *   **54180 (Wrightstown, WI):** Roughly 44.3 degrees North latitude.


      **Step 3: Compare the latitudes to determine north/south.**


      A higher latitude number indicates a more northern location.


      Since 44.3 (Wrightstown, WI) is greater than 41.9 (Chicago, IL), 54180, WI is
      located north of 60651, IL.


      **Step 4: Answer the question.**


      The question asks: "Is 60651, IL located north of 54180, WI?"


      Based on our analysis, 60651, IL is located **south** of 54180, WI.

      27896, NC is located north of 24482, VA.


      1.  **Identify the states:** We are comparing a location in North Carolina (NC)
      with a location in Virginia (VA).


      2.  **Understand the relative geographical positions of the NC and VA:** Virginia
      is located directly to the north of North Carolina. This means that *any* point
      in Virginia will be generally north of *any* point in North Carolina, assuming
      standard map orientation.


      3.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While zip codes can cover areas and
      vary in size and shape, the fundamental geographical relationship between the
      states overrides the specific numerical values of the zip codes for a general
      "north of" comparison. The numerical value of a zip code does not directly indicate
      its latitude or longitude in a way that allows for easy comparison across state
      lines without external data. However, the state itself is the primary determinant
      here.


      Since Virginia is geographically north of North Carolina, any location within
      Virginia will be north of any location within North Carolina.


      Therefore, 27896, NC is *not* located north of 24482, VA.

      *   **07640, NJ (Oradell, NJ):** This is in Northern New Jersey.

      *   **03303, NH (Concord, NH):** This is in Southern New Hampshire, which is

      *   New Hampshire is north of Massachusetts, and significantly north of New
      Jersey.


      **Step 3: Compare the latitudinal positions.**


      While we don''t need exact coordinates, we know the general north-south order

      *   22406 is in VA (Virginia).

      *   18210 is in PA (Pennsylvania).

      Pennsylvania is generally located *north* of Virginia in the United States.

      While generally true, could specific points within these states defy the general

      *   Pennsylvania''s southernmost points are near the Maryland border.

      *   18210 is Albrightsville, PA. This is in the eastern-central part of Pennsylvania,
      and well within Pennsylvania''s borders, north of Maryland.


      **Step 6: Conclude the relative position.**

      answer.


      **Step 1: Understand the meaning of the first two digits of a US ZIP code.**

      The first digit of a US ZIP code generally represents a group of US states.
      The first two digits narrow it down further to a specific region or state. Lower
      numbers typically indicate states further east or north, while higher numbers
      indicate states further west or south.


      **Step 2: Analyze the ZIP codes provided.**

      *   77360, TX: The first two digits are 77.

      *   72601, AR: The first two digits are 72.


      **Step 3: Determine the general geographical position based on the first two
      digits.**

      *   The 72XXX ZIP codes are primarily assigned to Arkansas (AR) and parts of
      Missouri (MO).

      *   The 77XXX ZIP codes are primarily assigned to Texas (TX).


      **Step 4: Compare the relative locations of Arkansas and Texas.**

      Looking at a map of the United States:

      *   Arkansas is located to the northeast of Texas.

      *   Texas is located to the southwest of Arkansas.


      **Step 5: Apply the comparison to the question.**

      Since Arkansas (72XXX) is generally north of Texas (77XXX), a specific location
      in Texas (77360) would be south of a specific location in Arkansas (72601),
      assuming typical ZIP code distribution.

      * 38655 is in Mississippi.

      * Zip codes starting with 386 are generally in northern Mississippi.

      * A quick search confirms 38655 is Olive Branch, MS, which is very close to
      the Tennessee border.


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate location of 61610, IL.**

      * 61610 is in Illinois.

      * Zip codes starting with 616 are generally in central Illinois.

      * A quick search confirms 61610 is Peoria, IL, which is in central Illinois.


      **Step 3: Compare the relative latitudes.**

      * Olive Branch, MS is in northern Mississippi.

      * Peoria, IL is in central Illinois.


      Illinois is entirely north of Mississippi. Therefore, any location in Illinois
      will be north of any location in Mississippi.

      **Step 1: Determine the approximate location of each zip code.**


      *   **38655, MS:** This zip code is for Olive Branch, Mississippi. Olive Branch
      is in northern Mississippi, very close to the Tennessee border and Memphis.

      *   **61610, IL:** This zip code is for Peoria, Illinois. Peoria is in central
      Illinois.


      **Step 2: Compare the latitudes of the two locations.**


      *   Mississippi is a southern state. Even its northernmost point will be at
      a relatively low latitude compared to many northern states.

      *   Illinois is a Midwestern state. Its central region will be at a significantly
      higher latitude than northern Mississippi.


      **Step 3: Conclude the relative north/south position.**


      Peoria, Illinois (61610) is located significantly further north than Olive Branch,
      Mississippi (38655).

      \    *   68506 is in Nebraska (NE).\n    *   58401 is in North Dakota (ND).\n\
      \n2.  **Recall the general geographic relationship of these states:**\n    *\
      \   Nebraska is generally south of South Dakota, which is generally south of\
      \ North Dakota.\n    *   Therefore, North Dakota is generally *north* of Nebraska.\n\
      \n3.  **Consider potential edge cases/exceptions:** While generally ND is north\
      \ of NE, could a specific ZIP code in southern ND be south of a specific ZIP\
      \ code in northern NE?\n    *   68506 is Lincoln, NE. Lincoln is in the southeastern\
      \ part of Nebraska.\n    *   58401 is Jamestown, ND. Jamestown is in the southeastern\
      \ part of North Dakota.\n\n4.  **Visualize or verify positions:**\n    *   Lincoln,\
      \ NE: Approximately 40.8\xB0 N latitude.\n    *   Jamestown, ND: Approximately\
      \ 46.9\xB0 N latitude.\n\n5.  **Compare latitudes:**\n    *   46.9\xB0 N (Jamestown,\
      \ ND) is a higher latitude than 40.8\xB0 N (Lincoln, NE).\n    *   A higher\
      \ North latitude means the location is further north on the globe.\n\n6.  **Formulate\
      \ the conclusion:** Since Jamestown, ND (58401) is at a higher North latitude\
      \ than Lincoln, NE (68506), Jamestown is north of Lincoln. The question asks\
      \ if Lincoln, NE is north of Jamestown, ND.\n\nTherefore, Lincoln, NE is *not*\
      \ north of Jamestown, ND.\n\n**NO**"

      1.  **Identify the core question:** We need to determine if the location corresponding\
      \ to zip code 68506 (in Nebraska) is geographically north of the location corresponding\
      \ to zip code 58401 (in North Dakota).\n\n2.  **Understand Zip Codes and Geography:**\
      \ Zip codes are assigned to geographic areas. While generally increasing as\
      \ you go east, their north-south relationship is not directly encoded in the\
      \ number itself. We need to know the *actual locations* of these zip codes.\n\
      \n3.  **Find the location for 68506, NE:** A quick search reveals that 68506\
      \ is a zip code for Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\n4.  **Find the location for 58401,\
      \ ND:** A quick search reveals that 58401 is a zip code for Jamestown, North\
      \ Dakota.\n\n5.  **Compare the geographic locations:**\n    *   Lincoln, Nebraska\
      \ (NE) is in the central part of the United States.\n    *   Jamestown, North\
      \ Dakota (ND) is significantly further north than Nebraska, as North Dakota\
      \ is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.\n\n6.  **Determine\
      \ relative north/south position:** North Dakota is geographically north of Nebraska.\
      \ Therefore, any location in North Dakota will be north of any location in Nebraska\

      \ Since Jamestown, ND is north of Lincoln, NE, the statement \"68506, NE located\
      \ north of 58401, ND\" is false.\n\nNO"

      \ of zip codes on precise location:** While zip codes can cover a fairly large\
      \ area, they are geographically bounded. The first few digits often indicate\
      \ a larger region within a state or a multi-state region, but for specific comparisons,\
      \ we need to consider the actual location.\n\n4.  **Determine the specific locations\
      \ of the zip codes:**\n    *   68506 is a zip code for **Lincoln, Nebraska**.\n\
      \    *   58401 is a zip code for **Jamestown, North Dakota**.\n\n5.  **Compare\
      \ the latitudes of these cities:**\n    *   Lincoln, NE: Approximately 40.8137\xB0\
      \ N latitude.\n    *   Jamestown, ND: Approximately 46.9016\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \n6.  **Analyze the latitude comparison:** A higher latitude number indicates\
      \ a location further north. Since Jamestown's latitude (46.9016\xB0 N) is higher\
      \ than Lincoln's latitude (40.8137\xB0 N), Jamestown is located north of Lincoln.\n\
