      is generally south of New Jersey (NJ).

      2. **Consider general latitude:**  Zip codes increase as you move from south
      to north within a state. However, comparing zip codes across state lines is
      not a reliable way to determine which is further north.

      3. **Use a map or online tool:** To be certain, one would need to use a map
      or online zip code lookup tool to determine the exact latitudes of each zip
      code.


      Since VA is south of NJ, it''s highly likely that 22134, VA is south of 07852,
      NJ.

      with the general south-to-north increasing zip code pattern. Since VA is already
      south of NJ, the lower zip code further supports this.

      and south than higher zip codes. While this can help within a state, it isn''t
      as helpful comparing across states.
