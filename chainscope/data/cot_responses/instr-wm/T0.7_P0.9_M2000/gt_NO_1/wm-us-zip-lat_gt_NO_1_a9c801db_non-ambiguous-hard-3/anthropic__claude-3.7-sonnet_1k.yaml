      if zip code 22134 in Virginia (VA) is located north of zip code 07852 in New
      Jersey (NJ).


      To solve this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the general geographic relationship between Virginia
      and New Jersey. New Jersey is a northeastern state, while Virginia is a mid-Atlantic
      state that is south of New Jersey. Generally speaking, locations in New Jersey
      are north of locations in Virginia.


      Zip code 22134 is in Virginia (VA).

      Zip code 07852 is in New Jersey (NJ).


      Given the general geographic arrangement of these states, a zip code in Virginia
      would typically be south of a zip code in New Jersey, not north of it.


      Therefore, it''s highly unlikely that 22134, VA is north of 07852, NJ. In fact,
      it''s almost certainly south of it.</think>To determine if one zip code is north
      of another, I need to compare their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 22134 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 07852 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the relative geographic positions of these states.

      New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States, while Virginia is located
      in the mid-Atlantic region, south of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Apply this general north-south relationship to the specific zip codes.

      Since Virginia is entirely south of New Jersey geographically, any zip code
      in Virginia (including 22134) would be south of any zip code in New Jersey (including
      07852).

      To determine whether 22134, VA is north of 07852, NJ, I need to think about

      Let me break this down:

      - 22134 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA)

      - 07852 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)


      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to think about their approximate

      Looking at a map, Corvallis, Oregon is definitely north of Solano County, California.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographical relationship between

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 94585 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in the Suisun City area
      in Solano County.

      - 97330 is a zip code in Oregon (OR), specifically in the Corvallis area.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between California and Oregon.

      Oregon is located directly north of California on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Verify the specific locations of these zip codes.

      Even though zip codes don''t always follow a perfect north-to-south pattern,
      in this case the general state relationship applies. Corvallis, Oregon (97330)
      is indeed located north of Suisun City, California (94585).


      NO - 94585, CA is NOT located north of 97330, OR. It''s the opposite: the Oregon
      zip code is north of the California one.'

      94585 is a zip code in California (CA).

      97330 is a zip code in Oregon (OR).


      Generally speaking, Oregon is north of California on the US west coast. This
      would suggest that 97330, OR is likely north of 94585, CA.


      Let me be more specific:

      - 94585 appears to be a zip code for Suisun City, California, which is in the
      northern part of California (in the San Francisco Bay Area)

      - 97330 appears to be a zip code for Corvallis, Oregon, which is in the western/central
      part of Oregon

      County.

      - 97330 is a zip code in Oregon (OR), specifically for Corvallis in Benton County.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between California and
      Oregon.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California on the West Coast of the United

      - Suisun City (94585) is in northern California, in the San Francisco Bay Area.

      - Corvallis (97330) is in western Oregon, roughly in the middle of the state.

      - Since Oregon is north of California, Corvallis (97330, OR) is north of Suisun

      To answer this, I need to think about the geographic positions of these zip
      codes:


      1. First, I need to consider the general geographic relationship between Kentucky

      1) First, I need to consider the general geographic relationship between Kentucky

      2) Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky. The Ohio River forms much
      of the border between these two states, with Kentucky on the south side and
      Indiana on the north side.


      3) Zip code 42141 is in Kentucky, while zip code 46565 is in Indiana.

      To solve this, I need to find the approximate geographic locations of these
      zip codes and compare their latitudes. A location with a higher latitude is
      further north.


      First, let''s consider what we know about these states generally:

      - West Virginia is generally south of Ohio, as Ohio borders Lake Erie to the
      north

      - However, zip code locations don''t always follow state boundaries perfectly


      For zip code 25601, WV:

      This is in West Virginia, likely in the southern part of the state.


      For zip code 44094, OH:

      This is in Ohio, and the "44" prefix suggests it''s in the northeastern part
      of Ohio.


      Since Ohio is generally north of West Virginia, and 44094 seems to be in northern
      Ohio (close to Lake Erie), it''s very likely that 44094, OH is north of 25601,
      WV.</think># Is 25601, WV located north of 44094, OH?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by examining

      ## Step 1: Locate the zip codes

      - 25601 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 44094 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider state geography

      - Ohio is generally located north of West Virginia

      - West Virginia borders Ohio''s southern boundary


      ## Step 3: Analyze zip code patterns

      - Ohio zip codes beginning with "44" are typically in the northeastern part
      of Ohio, often near Lake Erie

      - West Virginia zip codes starting with "256" are generally in the southern
      portion of West Virginia


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      - Being in northeastern Ohio, 44094 is positioned quite far north

      - Being in southern West Virginia, 25601 is positioned significantly south


      NO - 25601, WV is not located north of 44094, OH. The West Virginia zip code

      25601 in West Virginia (WV) is located north of the zip code 44094 in Ohio (OH).


      To solve this, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      First, let''s think about the states. West Virginia (WV) is generally located
      south of Ohio (OH). Ohio is directly north of West Virginia. This gives us a
      general orientation, but we need to be more specific about these particular
      zip codes.


      Let''s look at the zip codes:

      - 25601 is in West Virginia

      - 44094 is in Ohio


      In the US zip code system:

      - First digit generally indicates a geographical region (0-9 from east to west)

      - The first three digits typically narrow down to a sectional center facility


      For zip code 25601 (WV):

      - The "2" prefix typically covers parts of the mid-Atlantic region

      - The "256" likely refers to a specific area in West Virginia


      For zip code 44094 (OH):

      - The "4" prefix typically covers parts of the Great Lakes region

      - The "440" likely refers to a specific area in northeastern Ohio


      Based on the zip code structure, 44094 in Ohio is likely in the northern part
      of Ohio (close to Lake Erie), while 25601 in West Virginia is in the southern
      part of the Appalachian region.


      Given that Ohio is north of West Virginia, and 44094 is likely in northern Ohio,
      while 25601 is in West Virginia, I can conclude that 25601, WV is south of 44094,
      OH - not north of it.</think>To determine if 25601, WV is located north of 44094,
      OH, I need to find the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 25601 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 44094 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states

      Ohio is generally located north of West Virginia. The entire state of Ohio borders
      West Virginia''s northern edge.


      Step 3: Look at the specific zip codes

      - 44094 is in Willoughby, Ohio, which is in the northeastern part of Ohio near
      Lake Erie

      - 25601 is in Logan County, West Virginia, which is in the southwestern part
      of West Virginia


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes

      Since 44094 is in northeastern Ohio (one of the northernmost parts of the state),
      and 25601 is in southern West Virginia, the Ohio zip code is significantly further
      north than the West Virginia zip code.

      25601, WV is likely in southern West Virginia. West Virginia is generally south
      of Ohio.


      44094, OH appears to be in northern Ohio, possibly near Lake Erie.

      - 44094 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Ohio is positioned north of West Virginia

      - Zip codes in the 256xx range are typically in southern West Virginia

      - Zip codes in the 440xx range are typically in northern Ohio, often near Lake
      Erie


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      ZIP code 25601 is in West Virginia, which is generally south of Ohio.

      ZIP code 44094 is in Ohio, which is generally north of West Virginia.


      Based on the general geography of these states, it''s likely that the ZIP code
      in West Virginia (25601) is south of the ZIP code in Ohio (44094), not north.


      However, we need to be careful because zip codes don''t perfectly follow state
      boundaries, and there could be exceptions depending on the specific locations
      within each state. But given that these appear to be standard zip codes for

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Ohio is generally located north of West Virginia

      - West Virginia is positioned south of Ohio


      Step 3: Consider zip code numbering patterns.

      - Lower zip codes in the eastern US tend to be further south

      - Higher zip codes tend to be further north

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south positions)


      77807 is a zip code in Texas. Texas is generally south of Oklahoma on a map

      77807 appears to be a zip code in Texas (TX).

      more northerly than a location with a lower latitude.


      77807 is a zip code in Texas (TX).

      74104 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK).


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is north of Texas in the United States. However,
      I should verify the specific locations of these zip codes rather than rely on
      the general state positions.


      Zip code 77807 appears to be in the Bryan area of Texas, which is in the eastern
      central part of Texas.

      Zip code 74104 appears to be in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which is in the northeastern

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by examining

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 77807 is a zip code in Texas (TX), specifically in the Bryan/College Station
      area

      - 74104 is a zip code in Tulsa, Oklahoma (OK)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Texas and Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma generally lies directly north of Texas in the United States

      - Texas is the southern neighboring state to Oklahoma


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      - Bryan/College Station (77807) is located in east-central Texas

      - Tulsa (74104) is located in northeastern Oklahoma

      - Even though these are specific areas within their states, the general north-south
      relationship between Oklahoma and Texas holds true for these locations


      ## Step 4: Draw a conclusion

      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and Tulsa (74104) is in Oklahoma while Bryan
      (77807) is in Texas, the Oklahoma zip code is north of the Texas zip code.

      Carolina on a map of the United States. Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north,
      while North Carolina is positioned along the Atlantic coast further south.


      Step 3: Since these zip codes are in their respective states (28216 in NC and

      north of 73644, OK, I need to identify the geographic locations of these zip
      codes and then compare their latitudes.


      Let me break this down:

      1. 75149 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      2. 73644 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK)


      First, I''ll recall the general geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.
      Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas along most of their shared border.


      However, zip codes don''t necessarily follow a perfect north-south pattern,
      and we need to be precise about these specific zip codes.


      Let me reason about the zip code patterns:

      - Oklahoma zip codes generally start with 73-74

      - Texas zip codes often start with 75-79 for the northern and central regions


      Based on the zip code numbers alone (73644 vs 75149), the Oklahoma zip code
      has a lower number than the Texas zip code. In the US postal system, generally
      (though not always perfectly), lower zip code numbers tend to be in the northeastern
      parts of the country, with numbers increasing as you go south and west.


      Since 73644 (OK) has a lower number than 75149 (TX), and Oklahoma is generally
      north of Texas, it seems likely that 73644 is north of 75149.</think># Is 75149,
      TX located north of 73644, OK?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 75149 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 73644 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship

      Oklahoma is generally located directly north of Texas along their shared border.


      ## Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns

      - Oklahoma zip codes typically begin with 73-74

      - Texas zip codes often begin with 75-79 (especially in northern and central
      regions)


      ## Step 4: Compare specific locations

      75149 is in Mesquite, Texas (in the Dallas area, northern Texas)

      73644 is in Hobart, Oklahoma (southwestern Oklahoma)


      While Oklahoma is generally north of Texas, Hobart (73644) is in southwestern
      Oklahoma, which puts it northwest of the Dallas area where 75149 is located.
      When comparing their exact latitudes, Mesquite, TX is actually south of Hobart,
      OK.


      Therefore: NO'

      1. The question is asking whether zip code 75149 in Texas is located north of
      zip code 73644 in Oklahoma.


      2. To determine this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these
      zip codes.


      3. First, let''s consider the general geography of Texas and Oklahoma. Oklahoma
      is generally north of Texas, as it borders Texas on its southern border.


      4. However, the specific zip codes could be located in such a way that a Texas
      zip code could be north of an Oklahoma zip code, especially if we''re comparing
      a northern part of Texas to a southern part of Oklahoma.


      5. Let me think about the zip codes themselves. In the US postal system, zip
      codes are generally (though not perfectly) organized geographically, with lower
      numbers in the northeast and higher numbers in the southwest.


      6. 75149 is in Texas, and 73644 is in Oklahoma.


      7. Since 75149 > 73644, and higher zip codes tend to be more southern or western,
      this suggests that 75149 (TX) is likely south of 73644 (OK).


      8. Additionally, given that Oklahoma is generally north of Texas, it''s even
      more likely that 73644 in Oklahoma is north of 75149 in Texas.</think># Is 75149,
      TX located north of 73644, OK?


      Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to determine the general geographic relationship between Texas
      and Oklahoma. Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas along their shared
      border.


      2) Next, I''ll analyze the zip codes. In the US postal system, zip codes generally
      follow geographic patterns, with the first three digits (the sectional center
      facility or SCF) indicating a region.


      3) The zip code 75149 is in Texas, specifically in the Dallas area in the northeastern
      part of the state.


      4) The zip code 73644 is in Oklahoma, located in the western part of the state.


      5) Even though 75149 is in northeastern Texas, which is closer to Oklahoma than
      many other parts of Texas, Oklahoma''s position means that virtually all Oklahoma
      locations (including 73644) are north of locations in Texas.


      6) Therefore, 75149 in Texas cannot be north of 73644 in Oklahoma based on the
      states'' geographic positions relative to each other.

      Step 2: Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 75149 is in Texas (TX)

      - 73644 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 3: Oklahoma is generally north of Texas, since Texas is on the Gulf Coast
      and Oklahoma borders Texas on its northern side.


      Step 4: Looking at the zip codes themselves, the 7 at the beginning of both
      suggests they''re in the same general region. The 73xxx format for Oklahoma
      and 75xxx for Texas follows the pattern where Oklahoma zip codes would be slightly
      north of similar Texas zip codes.


      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and the zip code in Oklahoma (73644) would
      likely follow this pattern, the location 73644, OK would be north of 75149,
      TX.</think># Is 75149, TX located north of 73644, OK?


      Let me work through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the geographical relationship between Texas (TX)
      and Oklahoma (OK). Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas along their shared
      border.


      2) Looking at the zip codes, 75149 is in Texas, and 73644 is in Oklahoma.


      3) To be more specific, zip code 75149 corresponds to Mesquite, Texas, which
      is in the northeastern part of Texas near Dallas.


      4) Zip code 73644 corresponds to Hollis, Oklahoma, which is in the southwestern
      part of Oklahoma.


      5) When comparing their positions: Hollis, OK is in southwestern Oklahoma, while
      Mesquite, TX is in northeastern Texas. Even though Oklahoma is generally north
      of Texas, the southwestern part of Oklahoma is actually westward and slightly
      north of northeastern Texas.


      6) Checking their specific coordinates, Mesquite, TX (75149) is actually slightly
      north of Hollis, OK (73644).


      NO - 75149, TX is not located north of 73644, OK. In fact, it''s the opposite:
      73644, OK is located northwest of 75149, TX.'
    abd69a00-66b1-4df6-9c2b-fcdac4dcf61e: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      whether 75149, TX is north of 73644, OK.


      To answer this, I need to determine the locations of these zip codes and then
      compare their north-south positions.


      75149 is a zip code in Texas (TX).

      73644 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK).


      First, I need to understand the general geography of Texas and Oklahoma. Oklahoma
      is located directly north of Texas on a map of the United States.


      Given that information, most locations in Oklahoma would be north of locations
      in Texas. However, I need to be more precise since I''m looking at specific
      zip codes, and both states have irregular shapes.


      For zip codes:

      - First digits generally indicate geographic regions from east to west

      - Oklahoma zip codes typically start with 73-74

      - Texas zip codes typically start with 75-79 for eastern/central parts and 88-89
      for western parts


      Since 73644 is in Oklahoma and starts with 73, it''s likely in the southern
      part of Oklahoma.

      Since 75149 is in Texas and starts with 75, it''s likely in the northern part
      of Texas.


      But even a location in northern Texas would typically be south of a location
      in southern Oklahoma, because Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas.


      Therefore, 75149, TX is likely south of 73644, OK, not north of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 75149 is in Texas (TX)

      - 73644 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas on the US map. The entire state
      of Oklahoma sits above Texas geographically.


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      While zip codes don''t follow a perfect north-south progression, the fundamental
      geography of these states is the determining factor here. Even the northernmost
      parts of Texas are south of the southernmost parts of Oklahoma.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since 75149 is in Texas and 73644 is in Oklahoma, and Oklahoma is north of Texas,
      the zip code in Texas cannot be north of the zip code in Oklahoma.

      - 07114 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 13502 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      To determine if one location is north of another, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A higher latitude means further north.


      Let me try to recall the geographical locations:

      - 07114 is likely in northern New Jersey, possibly in the Newark/Elizabeth area

      - 13502 is in upstate New York, possibly in the Utica area


      Generally speaking, most of New Jersey is south of upstate New York. New Jersey
      is at the mid-Atlantic region, while upstate New York extends quite far north.


      Let me think more specifically about these locations:

      - NJ zip codes starting with 07 are typically in the northeastern part of New
      Jersey

      - NY zip codes starting with 13 are typically in central/northern New York state


      Based on my geographical knowledge, Utica (which I believe is in the 13502 area)

      area).</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the locations of

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 07114 is a zip code in Newark/Elizabeth area of New Jersey

      - 13502 is a zip code in Utica, New York


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these locations.

      - New Jersey is generally located along the mid-Atlantic coast

      - Utica is in central/upstate New York, which extends much further north


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Upstate New York (including Utica) is positioned significantly north of northern
      New Jersey

      - While northern NJ is indeed in the northern part of that state, it''s still
      south of central New York


      Step 4: Make the determination based on latitude.

      - Utica, NY (13502) has a higher latitude than Newark, NJ (07114)

      - Therefore, 07114 in NJ is NOT north of 13502 in NY, but rather south of it

      Let me think about US geography. Kentucky is generally south of Indiana, since

      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 40475 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 46013 is in Indiana (IN)


      To determine if one location is north of another, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A higher latitude means further north.


      Since I don''t have the exact coordinates of these zip codes in my knowledge,
      I''ll reason through this using geographical knowledge:


      1. Indiana (IN) is generally located north of Kentucky (KY). Indiana''s southern
      border connects with Kentucky''s northern border along the Ohio River.


      2. The first digits of ZIP codes in the US are assigned roughly geographically,
      with lower numbers generally in the northeast and higher numbers as you move
      south and west. However, both 40xxx and 46xxx are in the same general region.


      3. Kentucky zip codes typically start with 40-42, while Indiana zip codes typically
      start with 46-47.


      4. Since Indiana is north of Kentucky, and these zip codes follow the standard
      pattern for their respective states, it''s very likely that 46013 (IN) is north
      of 40475 (KY).


      Therefore, 40475 (KY) is NOT north of 46013 (IN). Rather, it''s the other way
      around - 46013 (IN) is north of 40475 (KY).</think># Determining if 40475, KY
      is north of 46013, IN


      I need to think about the geographical locations of these zip codes to determine
      their north-south relationship.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 40475 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 46013 is in Indiana (IN)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between KY and IN

      Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky. The two states share a border,
      with Indiana being the northern neighbor and Kentucky the southern neighbor.


      ## Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns

      The U.S. postal service generally assigns zip codes geographically. In this
      region:

      - Kentucky zip codes typically begin with 40-42

      - Indiana zip codes typically begin with 46-47


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Since Indiana is north of Kentucky, and these zip codes follow the standard
      numbering pattern for their respective states, 46013 (IN) would be north of
      40475 (KY), not the other way around.


      ## Conclusion

      NO, 40475, KY is not located north of 46013, IN. Rather, 46013, IN is north
      of 40475, KY.'

      to determine the geographical locations of these two zip codes and compare their
      positions.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 60651 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 54180 is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Generally speaking, Wisconsin is north of Illinois since Wisconsin is a northern
      state that borders Illinois to the north. However, I need to be more specific
      about these particular zip codes.


      60651 is a zip code in Chicago, Illinois, which is in the northeastern part
      of Illinois, close to the border with Wisconsin.


      54180 is a zip code in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is north of Illinois, but I need
      to check the specific location of 54180 within Wisconsin.


      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois (except for some parts where they
      meet at Lake Michigan), and Wisconsin''s southern border meets Illinois'' northern
      border, generally any location in Wisconsin would be north of any location in
      Illinois.


      So logically, 54180 in Wisconsin should be north of 60651 in Illinois.


      However, I should note that zip code 54180 is not a commonly referenced zip
      code for major Wisconsin cities, so I need to be cautious about my answer.</think>#
      Is 60651, IL located north of 54180, WI?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 60651 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 54180 is in Wisconsin (WI)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois. The entire state of Wisconsin
      is north of the state of Illinois on a map.


      ## Step 3: Consider zip code numbering patterns

      US zip codes generally follow patterns where lower numbers are in the eastern
      US and higher numbers in the western US. The first digit also roughly corresponds
      to regions from east (0) to west (9).

      - 60651 starts with "6" (Illinois)

      - 54180 starts with "5" (Wisconsin)


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois geographically, any location in
      Wisconsin (including 54180) would be north of any location in Illinois (including
      60651).


      NO - 60651 in Illinois is NOT north of 54180 in Wisconsin. It''s the opposite
      - the Wisconsin zip code is north of the Illinois zip code.'

      to determine the geographic locations of two zip codes and compare them:

      1. 60651 in Illinois (IL)

      2. 54180 in Wisconsin (WI)


      First, let me think about the general geography. Wisconsin (WI) is located north
      of Illinois (IL). This means that in general, Wisconsin zip codes would be north
      of Illinois zip codes.


      However, I need to be more specific since the question is asking about particular
      zip codes, and the states have irregular shapes. It''s possible that some parts
      of Illinois could be further north than some parts of Wisconsin.


      Let me consider the zip codes:

      - 60651 is in Illinois. Chicago area zip codes are generally in the 606xx range,
      so this is likely in or near Chicago, which is in the northeastern part of Illinois.

      - 54180 is in Wisconsin. Wisconsin zip codes generally start with 53xxx or 54xxx,
      with higher numbers typically being further north.


      Given that Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and that 54180 is in Wisconsin while
      60651 is in Illinois, it''s very likely that 54180 is north of 60651.


      So my answer would be: NO, 60651 (IL) is NOT located north of 54180 (WI). Instead,
      54180 (WI) would be north of 60651 (IL).</think># Is 60651, IL located north
      of 54180, WI?


      I need to analyze the locations of these zip codes to determine their north-south
      relationship.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 60651 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 54180 is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois on the US map.


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes

      - 60651 is in the Chicago area of Illinois (606xx is the Chicago prefix)

      - 54180 is in northern Wisconsin


      Step 4: Compare locations

      Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois geographically, and these specific
      zip codes follow the standard regional patterns, zip code 54180 in Wisconsin
      would be north of zip code 60651 in Illinois.


      NO, 60651 (IL) is not located north of 54180 (WI). The reverse is true - the
      Wisconsin zip code is north of the Illinois zip code.'

      2. I need to determine if 29418, SC is north of 22124, VA


      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located.

      - 29418 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 22124 is in Virginia (VA)


      Geographically, Virginia is north of South Carolina. The entire state of South

      Let me first identify the states:

      - 29418 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 22124 is in Virginia (VA)


      In terms of general geography in the United States:

      - Virginia is located on the east coast, roughly in the middle of the Atlantic
      seaboard

      - South Carolina is also on the east coast, but south of Virginia


      In terms of latitude (which determines north/south positioning):

      - Virginia is north of South Carolina

      - So generally speaking, locations in Virginia would be north of locations in
      South Carolina


      Since 29418 is in South Carolina and 22124 is in Virginia, and Virginia is north
      of South Carolina, 29418 in SC would be SOUTH of 22124 in VA, not north.

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic coast, while South Carolina is further
      south along the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Consider the general latitude of these states.

      Virginia is positioned at a higher latitude (more northerly) than South Carolina.


      Step 4: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific ZIP codes.

      Since 29418 is in South Carolina, which is south of Virginia, and 22124 is in
      Virginia, which is north of South Carolina, the South Carolina ZIP code must

      longitude) of both zip codes and compare their latitudes.


      70047 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA).

      39350 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS).


      For a location to be "north of" another location, it needs to have a higher
      latitude.


      Let me think about what I know about these states geographically:

      - Louisiana is generally south of Mississippi

      - Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast

      - Mississippi is north of Louisiana


      Based on the general geography, it seems unlikely that a Louisiana zip code
      would be north of a Mississippi zip code, but I should verify with the specific
      zip codes.


      70047 is in LA, which appears to be LaPlace, Louisiana in the southern part
      of the state.

      39350 is in MS, which is somewhere in Mississippi.


      Given that Louisiana is generally south of Mississippi, and zip code 70047 is

      - 70047 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA), specifically in the LaPlace area.

      - 39350 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS).


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Louisiana and Mississippi.

      - Louisiana is positioned south of Mississippi on the map.

      - Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico at its southern end.

      - Mississippi is situated north of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - ZIP codes in Louisiana (7xxxx) typically start with 7.

      - ZIP codes in Mississippi (39xxx) typically start with 3.

      - Louisiana zip codes are generally lower on the map (more southern) than Mississippi
      zip codes.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since 70047 is in Louisiana and 39350 is in Mississippi, and Louisiana is south
      of Mississippi, the Louisiana zip code is almost certainly south of the Mississippi
      zip code, not north.

      - 70047 is in the southeastern part of Louisiana (in the greater New Orleans
      area)

      - 39350 is in central/east Mississippi


      Step 4: Compare positions.

      - Louisiana zip codes starting with "700" are in the southern portion of the
      state

      - Mississippi zip codes starting with "393" are in the central region of Mississippi

      - When comparing latitudes, 39350, MS would be significantly further north than

      To figure this out, I need to find the geographical locations of these zip codes
      and compare their latitudes. A location with a higher latitude is further north.


      70047 is a zip code in Louisiana. Let me recall where this is located. Louisiana
      is a state in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico. It''s
      generally south of Mississippi.


      39350 is a zip code in Mississippi. Mississippi is also a southern state, but

      Just based on the states, we would expect that a zip code in Mississippi would
      be north of a zip code in Louisiana. But I need to be careful because zip codes
      near the border could have different relationships.

      - 70047 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA), which appears to be in St. Charles
      Parish, in the southeastern part of the state.

      - 39350 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS), likely in the central part of that

      - Louisiana is located south of Mississippi in the United States.

      - Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico and is one of the southernmost states.

      - Mississippi lies directly north of eastern Louisiana.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Even though specific zip codes can sometimes cross expected geographical patterns,
      in this case the zip code numbering follows the general north-south relationship
      between these states.

      - 70047 is in southern Louisiana, while 39350 is in Mississippi, which would

      1. 23832 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      2. 15061 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      3. I need to determine if 23832, VA is north of 15061, PA


      To determine this, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia in the United States. Pennsylvania
      borders Virginia''s northern neighbor, Maryland. So generally speaking, locations
      in Pennsylvania tend to be north of locations in Virginia.


      However, I should verify the specific locations of these zip codes to be certain.


      23832 appears to be in Chesterfield County, which is in central/eastern Virginia.


      15061 appears to be in Beaver County, which is in western Pennsylvania, near
      the Ohio border.


      Given the general geography of the US, a location in Pennsylvania (even western
      PA) would be north of a location in central Virginia.


      So 23832, VA would NOT be north of 15061, PA. Instead, 15061, PA would be north
      of 23832, VA.</think># Is 23832, VA located north of 15061, PA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 23832 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 15061 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia in the United States. Pennsylvania
      doesn''t even share a border with Virginia - Maryland sits between them.


      ## Step 3: Look at specific locations

      - 23832 is in Chesterfield County, in central/eastern Virginia

      - 15061 is in Beaver County, in western Pennsylvania


      ## Step 4: Determine relative position

      Even though 15061 is in western Pennsylvania, the entirety of Pennsylvania lies
      north of Virginia geographically.


      Therefore, 23832, VA is NOT north of 15061, PA. It''s the opposite - the Pennsylvania
      zip code is north of the Virginia zip code.

    986dfb3d-e040-49c7-84af-f4a013e1f1f8: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to find where 07092, NJ and 05201, VT are located, and determine if one is north
      of the other.


      First, let me identify what these ZIP codes correspond to:

      - 07092 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 05201 is a ZIP code in Vermont (VT)


      Next, I need to think about the geographic locations of these states:

      - Vermont (VT) is in the northeastern United States, near the Canadian border

      - New Jersey (NJ) is in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States


      Generally speaking, Vermont is north of New Jersey. The northernmost parts of
      Vermont are near the Canadian border, while New Jersey is significantly further
      south.


      To be more precise, I should consider the latitude of these specific ZIP codes:

      - Vermont ZIP codes (05xxx) are generally in the northern part of the United
      States

      - New Jersey ZIP codes (07xxx) are in the mid-Atlantic region


      Since Vermont is a northern state and New Jersey is south of Vermont, the ZIP
      code 05201 in Vermont should be north of the ZIP code 07092 in New Jersey.</think>I
      need to determine the geographic relationship between these two ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 07092 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 05201 is a ZIP code in Vermont (VT)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Vermont is located in the northeastern United States, bordering Canada. New
      Jersey is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Vermont is generally positioned significantly north of New Jersey on the map.
      The entire state of Vermont is north of New Jersey.


      Step 4: Verify specific ZIP codes.

      While specific ZIP codes within states can sometimes create exceptions, in this
      case, even the southernmost point of Vermont is still north of the northernmost
      point of New Jersey. ZIP code 05201 (in Vermont) must therefore be north of
      ZIP code 07092 (in New Jersey).


      NO, 07092, NJ is NOT located north of 05201, VT. It''s the opposite - the Vermont
      ZIP code is north of the New Jersey ZIP code.'

      the geographic locations of two US zip codes and determine if one is north of

      Let me identify the locations:

      - 07092 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 05201 is in Vermont (VT)


      To determine which is further north, I need to think about the geographic positions
      of these states. Vermont is in the northeastern United States, bordering Canada.
      New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard, but further south than Vermont.


      In general, Vermont is located north of New Jersey. Vermont is one of the northernmost
      states in the continental US, while New Jersey is in the mid-Atlantic region.


      Given the general geographic knowledge that Vermont is north of New Jersey,
      we can reasonably conclude that a zip code in Vermont (05201) would be north
      of a zip code in New Jersey (07092).


      So the answer should be NO - 07092, NJ is NOT located north of 05201, VT. Instead,
      05201, VT is north of 07092, NJ.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Vermont is located in the northeastern United States, bordering Canada. It''s
      one of the northernmost states in the continental US.


      New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard in the mid-Atlantic region, significantly
      south of Vermont.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Vermont as a state is entirely north of New Jersey, any location in Vermont
      would be north of any location in New Jersey.


      Therefore, 05201 in Vermont is north of 07092 in New Jersey, not the other way

      Let me think about the general geographic positions of these states:

      - Vermont (VT) is in the northeastern United States, bordering Canada

      - New Jersey (NJ) is on the eastern seaboard, south of New York


      In terms of north-south positioning, Vermont is generally considered to be north

      while New Jersey is in the Mid-Atlantic region.


      So generally speaking, locations in Vermont would be north of locations in New
      Jersey. This means that 05201, VT would likely be north of 07092, NJ.


      To answer the question: "Is 07092, NJ located north of 05201, VT?" - the answer
      would be NO, because Vermont is north of New Jersey.</think>I need to determine

      New Jersey (NJ) is on the eastern seaboard, south of New York.


      Step 2: Compare the north-south positioning of these states.

      Vermont is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.

      New Jersey is in the Mid-Atlantic region, significantly south of Vermont.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      Since Vermont is geographically north of New Jersey, a zip code in Vermont (05201)
      would be north of a zip code in New Jersey (07092).

      - 32601 is a zip code in Gainesville, Florida (FL)

      32601 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      29205 is a zip code in South Carolina (SC)


      In the United States, generally:

      - South Carolina is north of Florida


      Based on this general knowledge, it would be unlikely that a Florida zip code

      1. Florida extends quite far north in its panhandle

      2. South Carolina extends south along the coast

      3. The specific zip codes might be in unusual locations within their states


      The first digits of zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      are in the northeast and higher numbers are in the southeast and west. So 29XXX
      (SC) being a lower number than 32XXX (FL) is consistent with SC being north
      of FL.


      Given this information, my best conclusion is that 32601, FL is NOT north of

      - 32601 is in Gainesville, Florida

      - 29205 is in Columbia, South Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Florida and South
      Carolina.

      - South Carolina is positioned north of Florida on the US east coast

      - Florida is below (south of) South Carolina


      Step 3: Check if this specific case might be an exception.

      - While Florida''s panhandle extends westward, even the northernmost parts of
      Florida are still south of South Carolina

      to determine if 32601, FL (Florida) is located north of 29205, SC (South Carolina).


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 32601 is a ZIP code in Florida (FL)

      - 29205 is a ZIP code in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Florida and South Carolina.

      South Carolina is generally north of Florida. Florida is at the southeastern
      tip of the United States, while South Carolina is further up the east coast.


      Step 3: To be more precise, I should think about the specific ZIP codes.

      - 32601 appears to be in the Gainesville area of Florida (based on the first
      digits 326)

      - 29205 appears to be in the Columbia area of South Carolina (based on the first
      digits 292)


      Step 4: Consider the relative positions.

      Gainesville, FL is in north-central Florida, but South Carolina as a whole is
      north of Florida. Columbia, SC is in the central part of South Carolina.


      Given that Florida is south of South Carolina, and these ZIP codes are in their
      respective states (Gainesville in FL and Columbia in SC), it''s very unlikely
      that the Florida ZIP code would be north of the South Carolina ZIP code.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these ZIP codes.

      - 32601 is in Gainesville, Florida (FL)

      - 29205 is in Columbia, South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Florida and South Carolina.

      South Carolina is located entirely north of Florida on the US east coast.


      Step 3: Even though 32601 is in northern Florida (Gainesville area), and 29205
      is in central South Carolina (Columbia area), the entire state of Florida lies
      south of South Carolina.


      Step 4: Since all points in Florida are south of South Carolina, 32601 in Florida
      must be south of 29205 in South Carolina.


      NO, 32601, FL is not located north of 29205, SC.'
    a04946de-4220-41c3-a269-c28ea340efab: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine whether zip code 32601 in Florida is located north of zip code
      29205 in South Carolina.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 32601 is in Florida (FL)

      - 29205 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Generally speaking, South Carolina is north of Florida in the United States.
      Florida is at the southeastern tip of the US mainland, while South Carolina
      is further north along the Atlantic coast.


      Let me consider the specific zip codes. U.S. zip codes are not perfectly aligned
      with latitude, but there are some general patterns:

      - ZIP codes in the eastern United States tend to start with lower numbers in
      the north and higher numbers in the south

      - 292xx would be in South Carolina

      - 326xx would be in Florida


      The fact that the Florida zip code (32601) has a higher first digit (3) than
      the South Carolina zip code (29205, starting with 2) is consistent with Florida
      being south of South Carolina.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, South Carolina is north
      of Florida, so 29205 in SC would be north of 32601 in FL.</think>I need to determine
      if the Florida zip code is north of the South Carolina zip code.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 32601 is in Florida (FL)

      - 29205 is in South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geography of these states.

      Florida is located in the southeastern United States, while South Carolina is
      further north along the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Verify with zip code patterns.

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with latitude, the general pattern
      in the eastern US is that lower first digits tend to be assigned to more northern
      regions. The South Carolina zip code starts with 2, while the Florida zip code
      starts with 3, which is consistent with Florida being south of South Carolina.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Florida is south of South Carolina geographically, zip code 32601 in Florida
      would be south of zip code 29205 in South Carolina, not north of it.

      code 32601 in Florida is located north of the zip code 29205 in South Carolina.


      First, let''s establish the general geographical relationship between Florida
      and South Carolina. Florida is generally south of South Carolina, as South Carolina
      is several states north of Florida on the US east coast.


      However, I need to check the specific locations of these zip codes, as states
      have irregular shapes and border areas might not follow the general north-south
      relationship.


      32601 is a zip code in Florida. It''s likely in northern Florida since Florida
      zip codes generally start with 32-34.


      29205 is a zip code in South Carolina. South Carolina zip codes generally start
      with 29.


      To truly answer this accurately, I would need to know the exact locations and
      latitudes of these specific zip codes.


      Based on general knowledge:

      - 32601 appears to be in Gainesville, Florida, which is in north-central Florida

      - 29205 appears to be in Columbia, South Carolina, which is in central South
      Carolina


      Columbia, SC is definitely north of Gainesville, FL on a map. So the zip code
      32601 in FL would be south of the zip code 29205 in SC, not north of it.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of these
      zip codes and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 32601 is a zip code in Gainesville, Florida

      - 29205 is a zip code in Columbia, South Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Florida and South
      Carolina.

      Florida is located south of South Carolina on the US east coast.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      Gainesville (32601) is in north-central Florida, while Columbia (29205) is in
      central South Carolina. Even though Gainesville is in the northern part of Florida,
      the entire state of Florida is still south of South Carolina.

      To answer this, I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip
      codes and compare their latitudes. A location with a higher latitude is further
      north.


      Let me think about the general locations of New Jersey and New Hampshire within
      the United States:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is in the northeastern US, but is south of New York

      - New Hampshire (NH) is in New England, north of Massachusetts and south of
      Maine


      Generally speaking, New Hampshire is north of New Jersey. New Hampshire is one
      of the northernmost states in the contiguous US, while New Jersey is more mid-Atlantic.


      So my initial intuition is that 03303, NH would be north of 07640, NJ simply
      based on the states they''re in. Let me confirm this with what I know about
      US geography.


      New Hampshire is definitely north of New Jersey. Therefore, 03303, NH should
      be north of 07640, NJ, making the answer "NO" - 07640, NJ is NOT located north
      of 03303, NH.</think># Is 07640, NJ located north of 03303, NH?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by considering
      their states'' locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 07640 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the northeastern United
      States

      - New Hampshire is located in the New England region, further north than New
      Jersey


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      New Hampshire is positioned significantly north of New Jersey on the map of
      the United States. All of New Hampshire is north of the northernmost point of
      New Jersey.


      Therefore, any location in New Hampshire (including 03303) would be north of
      any location in New Jersey (including 07640).


      ## Answer: NO


      07640, NJ is NOT located north of 03303, NH. It''s the opposite - the New Hampshire
      zip code is north of the New Jersey zip code.'

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)


      I know that New Hampshire is in the northeast of the US, while New Jersey is
      in the mid-Atlantic region. Generally speaking, New Hampshire is north of New
      Jersey.


      To be more precise, I need to know the specific locations of these zip codes:

      - 07640 corresponds to Harrington Park, NJ

      - 03303 corresponds to Bow, NH


      New Hampshire is definitely north of New Jersey on a map of the United States.
      So a zip code in NH should be north of a zip code in NJ.


      Therefore, 07640 in NJ is NOT north of 03303 in NH. Rather, it''s the opposite

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States, specifically in

      New Jersey is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      New Hampshire is positioned significantly further north than New Jersey on the
      US map. New Hampshire borders Canada to its north, while New Jersey is several
      states south of the Canadian border.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      ZIP code 07640 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      ZIP code 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)


      In the United States, New Hampshire is located in the Northeast region, specifically

      precise locations:


      07640 appears to be in northern New Jersey, but New Jersey as a whole is south
      of New Hampshire.

      03303 is somewhere in New Hampshire, which is generally north of any location
      in New Jersey.

      ## Step 2: Consider the general geographical positions of these states

      New Hampshire is located in the northeastern United States (New England region),
      while New Jersey is in the Mid-Atlantic region. Geographically, New Hampshire
      is positioned north of New Jersey.


      ## Step 3: Check the specific locations

      - 07640 corresponds to Haworth, NJ, which is in the northern part of New Jersey

      - 03303 corresponds to Bow, NH, which is in central New Hampshire


      ## Step 4: Compare latitudes

      Even though 07640 is in northern New Jersey, the entirety of New Jersey lies
      south of most of New Hampshire. Central New Hampshire (where 03303 is located)
      is significantly further north than any point in New Jersey.

      (New Jersey) is located north of 03303, NH (New Hampshire).


      First, let me recall the general geographic positions of New Jersey and New
      Hampshire in the United States:


      New Hampshire (NH) is in the northeastern United States, specifically in the
      New England region. It''s north of Massachusetts and south of Maine.


      New Jersey (NJ) is in the mid-Atlantic region, east of Pennsylvania and south
      of New York.


      Generally speaking, New Hampshire is located north of New Jersey. The entire
      state of New Hampshire is at a higher latitude than New Jersey.


      Since 07640 is a zip code in New Jersey and 03303 is a zip code in New Hampshire,
      and New Hampshire is generally north of New Jersey, 07640, NJ would be south
      of 03303, NH - not north of it.


      To be thorough, I should note that zip codes don''t perfectly align with latitude,
      but the states are distant enough that this general relationship holds true
      for all points in these states.</think>I need to determine if 07640, NJ is located
      north of 03303, NH by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 07640 is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      New Hampshire is located in New England, in the northeastern United States.

      New Jersey is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, south of New York.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      New Hampshire is significantly north of New Jersey in terms of latitude. New
      Hampshire borders Canada to its north, while New Jersey is much further south.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      While zip codes within states can vary in their exact north-south positioning,
      the entire state of New Hampshire is north of the entire state of New Jersey.
      Therefore, any zip code in NH would be north of any zip code in NJ.


      NO (07640, NJ is not located north of 03303, NH - it''s south of it)'

      First, let me consider the geographic locations of these states:

      - New Hampshire (NH) is in New England, in the northeastern United States

      - New Jersey (NJ) is a Mid-Atlantic state, south of New York


      Geographically, New Hampshire is generally north of New Jersey. The entirety
      of New Jersey is south of New Hampshire.


      Since 07640 is a zip code in New Jersey, and 03303 is a zip code in New Hampshire,
      based on the general geographic positions of these states, 07640, NJ would be
      south of 03303, NH (not north).


      Therefore, the answer is NO, 07640, NJ is not located north of 03303, NH.</think>To

      New Hampshire is located in New England in the northeastern United States, while
      New Jersey is in the Mid-Atlantic region.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      New Hampshire is positioned significantly north of New Jersey in the United
      States. All of New Jersey lies south of New Hampshire.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes

      Since 07640 is in New Jersey and 03303 is in New Hampshire, the New Jersey zip
      code must be south of the New Hampshire zip code, not north of it.

      In the US postal code system:

      1. ZIP codes generally follow geographic patterns

      2. However, ZIP codes don''t strictly follow latitude, so we can''t simply compare
      the numbers directly


      Let me think about the geography of Arizona and New Mexico:

      - Arizona is west of New Mexico

      - Generally, northern New Mexico borders northern Arizona, and southern New
      Mexico borders southern Arizona


      The most reliable way to determine this would be to look up the specific locations.
      But from my knowledge:


      85614 appears to be in southern Arizona. ZIP codes in Arizona typically start
      with 85 or 86, with lower numbers generally being in the southern part of the
      state.


      87301 appears to be in northwestern New Mexico. ZIP codes in New Mexico typically
      start with 87 or 88, with 87 generally covering the northern part of the state.

      - 87301 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the zip code patterns in these states.

      - Arizona zip codes generally start with 85 and 86

      - New Mexico zip codes generally start with 87 and 88


      Step 3: Analyze the geographic distribution.

      - In Arizona, 85xxx zip codes tend to cover the southern part of the state (including
      Tucson area)

      - In New Mexico, 87xxx codes tend to cover the northern and western parts of
      the state


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      - 85614 is in southern Arizona (specifically in the Green Valley area)

      - 87301 is in northwestern New Mexico (in the Gallup area)

      - Northwestern New Mexico is generally north of southern Arizona

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 37127 is a ZIP code in Tennessee (TN)

      - 61104 is a ZIP code in Illinois (IL)


      To determine which is further north, I need to consider their geographical positions.


      Generally speaking, in the United States:

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern part of the country

      - Illinois is located in the midwestern part of the country, and is typically
      north of Tennessee


      US ZIP codes roughly correlate with geography - lower ZIP codes tend to be in
      the eastern and southern parts of the country, while higher ZIP codes tend to
      be in the western and northern parts.


      The fact that the Illinois ZIP code (61104) has a higher number than the Tennessee
      ZIP code (37127) is consistent with Illinois being north of Tennessee.


      Based on general geographic knowledge, Illinois is north of Tennessee on a map
      of the United States. The southern border of Illinois is still north of the
      northern border of Tennessee.</think>To determine if 37127, TN is located north

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 37127 is in Tennessee (TN)

      - 61104 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states

      Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Tennessee
      is located in the Southeast region.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning

      On a US map, Illinois is positioned entirely north of Tennessee. Even the southernmost
      part of Illinois lies north of the northernmost part of Tennessee.


      Step 4: Consider zip code patterns

      While zip codes don''t perfectly correlate with latitude, the higher number
      for the Illinois zip code (61104 vs 37127) is consistent with the general pattern
      of higher zip codes being assigned to more northern locations within the eastern

      north of 30566, GA, I need to find the geographical locations of these zip codes

      First, let''s consider the general locations:

      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)

      - 30566 is in Georgia (GA)


      Generally speaking, Georgia is north of Florida, since Florida is the southernmost
      state in the continental US, with Georgia bordering it to the north. This gives
      us an initial hint that 32818, FL might be south of 30566, GA.


      To be more precise, I should consider the specific latitudes:


      The zip code 32818 appears to be in the Orlando area of Florida. Orlando is
      in central Florida.

      The zip code 30566 appears to be in northeast Georgia.


      Given that Georgia is north of Florida, and 30566 is in Georgia while 32818
      is in Florida, it''s very likely that 30566, GA is north of 32818, FL.


      Therefore, 32818, FL is NOT located north of 30566, GA. Instead, 32818, FL is
      south of 30566, GA.</think># Is 32818, FL located north of 30566, GA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)

      - 30566 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between the states

      - Georgia is located directly north of Florida on the US map

      - Generally, Georgia locations have a higher latitude than Florida locations


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns

      - US zip codes are generally organized so that lower numbers are in the northeast,
      and higher numbers are in the southwest

      - The 305xx series in Georgia would be in the northern part of the state

      - The 328xx series in Florida would be in the central part of Florida (Orlando
      area)


      Step 4: Make the determination

      - Since 32818 is in Florida, which is south of Georgia, and 30566 is in Georgia,
      the Florida zip code must be south of the Georgia zip code.


      NO - 32818, FL is not located north of 30566, GA. It is located south of it.'

      1) 32818 is in Florida (FL)

      2) 30566 is in Georgia (GA)


      Generally, Georgia is north of Florida since Florida is the southernmost state
      in the continental US. But I need to check the specific locations of these zip
      codes.


      Let me think about the numbering system of zip codes. The first digit of a zip
      code usually indicates a general region, with lower numbers generally being
      in the northeast and higher numbers in the southwest and west. The first three
      digits typically indicate a sectional center facility.


      32818 starts with 3, which typically covers the southeastern states.

      30566 also starts with 3, which means it''s also in the southeastern region.


      Since both start with 3, I need to look at the next digits. 32xxx is typically
      central/northern Florida, while 30xxx is typically Georgia.


      However, I should also consider that the northern part of Florida could be further
      north than the southern part of Georgia. But given that 32818 is in Florida
      and 30566 is in Georgia, and Georgia is generally north of Florida, it''s likely

      Actually, I should be more precise. The zip code 32818 is in Orlando, which
      is in central Florida. The zip code 30566 is likely in northern Georgia. Given
      the geography of the southeastern United States, it''s highly probable that

      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 32818 is in Florida (FL)

      - 30566 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Georgia is generally located north of Florida on the map of the United States.


      Step 3: Look at the specific zip codes.

      - 32818 is in the Orlando area of central Florida

      - 30566 is in northern Georgia


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Since Georgia is north of Florida, and 30566 is in northern Georgia while 32818
      is in central Florida, the Georgia zip code is definitely further north than
      the Florida zip code.

      Generally speaking, Florida is south of Georgia, so my initial guess would be

      ZIP code 32818 is in Orlando, Florida. Orlando is in central Florida.

      ZIP code 30566 appears to be in northeast Georgia.


      Florida''s northern border is around 31 degrees north latitude, while Georgia

      32818 is in central Florida (likely around 28-29 degrees north), and 30566 is

      First, let''s think about the geography of these two states. In general, Georgia
      is located north of Florida. Florida is the southernmost state in the continental
      US, while Georgia borders Florida on its northern border.


      Now let''s consider the zip codes:

      - 32818 is in Florida

      - 30566 is in Georgia


      US zip codes are somewhat organized geographically, but they don''t perfectly
      correlate with latitude. However, we can make some general observations:

      - ZIP codes in Georgia typically start with 30, 31, or 39

      - ZIP codes in Florida typically start with 32, 33, or 34


      Given that Georgia is generally north of Florida, and that these zip codes are

      First, let me consider the states:

      - 33187 is in Florida (FL)

      - 31632 is in Georgia (GA)


      Geographically speaking, Georgia is generally north of Florida, as Florida is

      - 33187 (FL) - This appears to be a zip code in southern Florida

      - 31632 (GA) - This appears to be a zip code in southern Georgia


      Since Georgia is north of Florida, and these zip codes don''t suggest any unusual
      geographic anomalies (like a northern Florida panhandle area that might extend
      above southern Georgia), the most reasonable conclusion is that 33187, FL is

      Step 2: Look at the zip codes. The first three digits of US zip codes generally

      - 31632 is in Georgia (GA)


      Generally, Georgia is north of Florida since Florida is the southernmost state

      First, let''s think about the geography of Florida and Georgia. Generally speaking,
      Georgia is located north of Florida, since Florida is the southernmost state
      in the continental US, with Georgia bordering it to the north.


      Given this general geography, we would expect that locations in Georgia would
      typically be north of locations in Florida. However, I need to check the specific
      zip codes to be sure.


      Let''s think about what the zip codes tell us:

      - 33187 is in Florida (FL)

      - 31632 is in Georgia (GA)


      In the US zip code system, the first digit generally indicates a broad geographic
      region, with lower numbers typically being in the northeastern part of the country
      and higher numbers in the southern and western parts.


      The first digits here are:

      - 33187: First digit is 3

      - 31632: First digit is 3


      So they''re in the same broad region. The second digit further narrows down
      the location:

      - 33187: Second digit is 3

      - 31632: Second digit is 1


      Typically, within the same first-digit region, lower second digits indicate
      more northern locations. So based on just the zip code patterns, it appears
      that 31632 (with second digit 1) would be north of 33187 (with second digit
      3).


      This also aligns with the general geography - Georgia (31632) is north of Florida
      (33187).</think># Is 33187, FL located north of 31632, GA?

      2) Geographically, Georgia is located directly north of Florida. Florida is
      the southernmost state in the continental US, with Georgia bordering it along
      Florida''s northern border.


      3) Looking at the zip codes themselves: US zip codes generally follow patterns
      where lower numbers in the first three digits often (though not always) indicate
      more northern locations within a region.


      4) The zip code 31632 (in GA) has a lower first three digits (316) than 33187
      (in FL), which has first three digits of 331.


      5) Combined with the fact that Georgia is north of Florida, this confirms that
      the Georgia zip code (31632) would be north of the Florida zip code (33187).


      Therefore, 33187, FL is NOT located north of 31632, GA. Rather, it''s the opposite

      - 31632 is in GA. Georgia zip codes typically start with 30 or 31.


      Since the zip code for the Florida location (33187) starts with 33, it''s likely
      in the southern part of Florida, far from the Georgia border. The Georgia zip
      code (31632) starts with 31, which suggests it might be in southern Georgia,
      potentially close to the Florida border.


      Given this information, it''s very unlikely that 33187, FL would be north of
      31632, GA. Florida is south of Georgia, and the zip code patterns suggest that
      33187 is in southern Florida, making it even more southerly compared to a location
      in southern Georgia.</think>I need to determine if a zip code in Florida is
      north of a zip code in Georgia.


      Step 1: Consider the general geography of the states.

      Georgia is located directly north of Florida. Florida is the southernmost state
      in the continental US (excluding the Florida Keys), with Georgia bordering it
      on the north.


      Step 2: Look at the specific zip codes.

      - 33187 is in Florida (FL)

      - 31632 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 3: Determine their specific locations.

      Zip code 33187 is in Miami-Dade County in southern Florida.

      Zip code 31632 is in Berrien County in southern Georgia.


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Even the northernmost part of Florida is generally south of the southernmost
      part of Georgia. Since 33187 is in southern Florida and 31632 is in southern
      Georgia, the Florida zip code must be south of the Georgia zip code.

      the relative north-south positions of two US zip codes. Let me work through
      this step by step.


      The zip codes in question are:

      1. 33187, FL (Florida)

      2. 31632, GA (Georgia)


      First, I need to think about the general geography of Florida and Georgia. Georgia
      is located directly north of Florida in the United States. So generally speaking,
      locations in Georgia tend to be north of locations in Florida.


      However, I need to be more precise since we''re dealing with specific zip codes,
      and Florida extends quite far north while Georgia extends quite far south, so
      there could be some Florida zip codes that are north of some Georgia zip codes
      in the border regions.


      Let me think about zip code numbering in the US. Generally, the first three
      digits of a zip code represent a sectional center facility (SCF) or a large
      geographical region. Lower numbers tend to be in the eastern US, and within
      states, there can be some north-south patterns, but it''s not a perfect correlation.


      For these specific zip codes:

      - 33187 is in Florida (FL)

      - 31632 is in Georgia (GA)


      The fact that the Florida zip code (33xxx) has a higher first three digits than
      the Georgia zip code (31xxx) doesn''t necessarily tell us about north-south
      positioning within the standard zip code system.


      Without looking up the exact locations, I can''t give a definitive answer based
      just on the zip codes. But given that Georgia is north of Florida, and these
      appear to be standard zip codes for their respective states (not unusual border
      exceptions), I would reason that 31632, GA is likely north of 33187, FL.


      So my answer would be NO - 33187, FL is NOT located north of 31632, GA.</think>#
      Step-by-Step Analysis


      To determine if 33187, FL is north of 31632, GA, I need to examine the geographic
      relationship between these locations.


      Step 1: Consider the general geography of Florida and Georgia.

      - Georgia (GA) is located directly north of Florida (FL) in the United States.

      - Generally, locations in Georgia are north of locations in Florida.


      Step 2: Consider these specific zip codes.

      - 33187 is a zip code in Florida, specifically in the Miami-Dade County area
      in southern Florida.

      - 31632 is a zip code in Georgia, located in the southern part of Georgia.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - Even though 31632 is in southern Georgia, Georgia''s southernmost points are
      still north of Miami-Dade County in southern Florida.

      - Florida''s northern regions might be close to Georgia''s southern regions,
      but 33187 is far south in Florida.


      # Answer: NO


      33187, FL is not located north of 31632, GA. Instead, 31632, GA is north of
      33187, FL, following the general geographic relationship between these two states.'

      to determine the relative geographic positions of these two ZIP codes.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 35951, AL is a ZIP code in Alabama (AL)

      - 40108, KY is a ZIP code in Kentucky (KY)


      Now, I need to think about the general geographic position of these states.
      Kentucky is generally north of Alabama in the United States. Alabama is in the
      Deep South, while Kentucky is more northerly and borders Ohio, Indiana, and
      Illinois to its north.


      Let''s also consider the ZIP code numbers. In the US postal system, ZIP codes
      generally (though not perfectly) follow a pattern where lower numbers are in
      the east/northeast and higher numbers as you move west/southwest. The first
      digit of ZIP codes roughly divides the country into regions:

      - 0-1: Northeast

      - 2-3: South Atlantic and parts of the South

      - 4: Midwest (including Kentucky)

      - 5-6: Central

      - 7: Central South

      - 8-9: West


      So, 35951 (starting with 3) is in the southern region, while 40108 (starting
      with 4) is in the midwestern region, which is generally north of the southern
      region.


      Given that:

      1. Alabama is south of Kentucky

      2. The ZIP code patterns generally confirm this relationship


      I can conclude that 35951, AL is likely south of 40108, KY, not north of it.</think>#
      Is 35951, AL located north of 40108, KY?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 40108 is in Kentucky (KY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Alabama is located in the Deep South of the United States, while Kentucky is
      positioned further north. Kentucky borders Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to its
      north, while Alabama is situated much further south, bordering the Gulf Coast
      at its southern end.


      ## Step 3: Look at a mental map of the US

      On a map of the United States, Kentucky is clearly positioned north of Alabama.
      There''s no portion of Alabama that extends north of Kentucky''s southern border.


      ## Step 4: Consider ZIP code numbering patterns

      While not definitive for small areas, ZIP code prefixes generally correspond
      to regions (3xxxx for much of the Southeast including Alabama, 4xxxx for parts
      of the Midwest including Kentucky), which supports the standard geographic relationship.

      First, I need to think about the general geographic relationship between Alabama
      and Kentucky. Alabama is generally located south of Kentucky in the United States.
      Kentucky is a border state between the Midwest and the South, while Alabama
      is firmly in the Deep South.


      Now, let''s consider the specific zip codes:

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 40108 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Since Alabama is south of Kentucky, it''s likely that 35951, AL is south of
      40108, KY. However, I should be careful about making assumptions based solely
      on state locations, as specific locations near state borders could have different
      relationships.


      But given that the zip code for Alabama starts with 359xx and the Kentucky zip
      code starts with 401xx, this also suggests that the Alabama location is south
      of the Kentucky location, as US zip codes tend to increase as you move from
      south to north and from east to west.


      So based on both the state locations and the zip code patterns, 35951, AL is
      likely south of 40108, KY, not north of it.</think># Is 35951, AL located north

      First, let''s consider the states:

      - 35951 is in Alabama (AL)

      - 40108 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Geographically, Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, while
      Kentucky is located north of Alabama. In terms of latitude, Kentucky is generally
      north of Alabama.


      Additionally, US zip codes follow some geographical patterns. The first three
      digits of zip codes generally increase as you move from east to west and from
      south to north. Since 359xx (Alabama) has a lower number than 401xx (Kentucky),
      this further suggests the Alabama location is south of the Kentucky location.

      (Alabama) is located north of 40108, KY (Kentucky).


      Let me first think about the general geography of these states. Kentucky is
      generally north of Alabama in the United States. Alabama is in the deep south,
      while Kentucky is more of a border state between the north and south.


      But I should verify this by thinking about the zip codes specifically. In the
      US zip code system:

      - The first digit of a zip code generally indicates a geographic region, with
      lower numbers typically being in the eastern/northeastern US and higher numbers
      in the western US

      - The first three digits together generally represent a sectional center facility

      - The full five-digit codes represent specific areas


      The zip code 35951 is in Alabama (AL), and the zip code 40108 is in Kentucky
      (KY).


      Since Kentucky is generally north of Alabama, it''s likely that 35951, AL is
      south of 40108, KY. But I need to be careful because zip codes aren''t perfectly
      aligned with latitude.


      Let me reason through this more carefully. The first digits:

      - 3 (for 35951) typically covers parts of the southeastern US including Alabama

      - 4 (for 40108) typically covers parts of the southern Midwest including Kentucky


      Based on the first digits and the states, it''s very likely that 35951, AL is
      south of 40108, KY, which would mean the answer is NO.</think># Is 35951, AL
      located north of 40108, KY?


      To determine this, I need to analyze the geographical relationship between these
      zip codes in Alabama and Kentucky.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions

      Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States, while Kentucky (KY)
      is positioned north of Alabama. Generally, Kentucky sits above Alabama on a
      map.


      ## Step 2: Analyze the zip code patterns

      In the US zip code system, the first digit often correlates with geographic
      regions:

      - Zip codes starting with 3 (like 35951) typically cover southeastern states
      including Alabama

      - Zip codes starting with 4 (like 40108) typically cover states slightly further

      is located north of 40108, KY (Kentucky), I need to understand the geographical
      relationship between these locations.


      First, let me think about the general geography of Alabama and Kentucky:

      - Alabama is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located north of Alabama


      Now, to be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 35951 is a zip code in Alabama

      - 40108 is a zip code in Kentucky


      Since Kentucky is generally north of Alabama, it would be expected that locations
      in Kentucky would be north of locations in Alabama. However, I should be careful
      because states have irregular shapes, and there could be exceptions depending
      on the exact locations.


      Given that 35951 is in Alabama and 40108 is in Kentucky, and Kentucky is generally
      north of Alabama, it''s most likely that 35951, AL is south of 40108, KY, not
      north of it.


      So 35951, AL is NOT located north of 40108, KY. Instead, it would be located

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states

      - Kentucky is located north of Alabama in the United States

      - Alabama is in the southeastern US, while Kentucky is more northern


      Step 3: Consider ZIP code patterns

      - US ZIP codes generally (though not perfectly) follow a pattern where lower
      numbers tend to be in the eastern and southern parts of the country

      - The first digit "3" in 35951 indicates a southeastern location

      - The first digit "4" in 40108 indicates a more northern location


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these facts

      - Since Kentucky is north of Alabama, and these ZIP codes follow the expected
      numbering pattern for their respective states, 35951 in Alabama must be south
      of 40108 in Kentucky

      Illinois is in the Midwest, while Tennessee is in the Southeast of the United
      States.


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Illinois is generally north of Tennessee

      - Illinois borders Wisconsin to the north and Kentucky to the south

      - Tennessee is south of Kentucky


      Since Illinois is north of Tennessee, and these zip codes are within their respective
      states, it''s very likely that 60625, IL is north of 37128, TN.


      Therefore, 37128, TN is NOT north of 60625, IL. Instead, 37128, TN is south
      of 60625, IL.</think>I need to determine if 37128, TN is located north of 60625,
      IL by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 37128 is in Tennessee (TN)

      - 60625 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the Southeastern region of the United States

      - Illinois is positioned north of Tennessee on the map


      Step 3: Even without knowing the exact cities these zip codes represent, I can
      determine their relative position based on their states.

      - All of Illinois is generally north of all of Tennessee

      - The specific zip codes would follow this same north-south relationship


      Since Illinois is north of Tennessee geographically, zip code 60625 in Illinois
      must be north of zip code 37128 in Tennessee.

      north of 60625, IL, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes (north-south position)


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 37128 is a zip code in Tennessee (TN)

      - 60625 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)


      In general, US zip codes follow some geographical patterns. The first digit
      often indicates a broad region of the US. Lower numbers typically correspond
      to the northeast and east, while higher numbers generally indicate western locations.


      37128 starts with "3", which typically corresponds to southeastern states.

      60625 starts with "6", which typically corresponds to midwestern states including
      Illinois.


      However, this doesn''t directly tell us which is further north. I need to think
      about the geography of these states.


      Tennessee (TN) is located in the southeastern United States.

      Illinois (IL) is located in the midwestern United States, generally north of
      Tennessee.


      Generally speaking, Illinois is north of Tennessee. So a zip code in Illinois
      would typically be north of a zip code in Tennessee.


      Therefore, 37128, TN is likely south of 60625, IL, not north of it.</think>To
      determine if 37128, TN is located north of 60625, IL, I need to analyze the
      geographical locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 37128 is in Tennessee (TN)

      - 60625 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States

      - Illinois is located in the midwestern United States

      - Illinois is positioned significantly north of Tennessee on the map


      Step 3: While specific zip codes within states can vary in their exact positions,
      the north-south relationship between these two states is substantial enough
      that a zip code in Tennessee would almost certainly be south of a zip code in
      Illinois.

      First, let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Kentucky (KY) is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan (MI) is a state in the northern part of the Midwest


      Generally, Michigan is located north of Kentucky. Michigan borders Canada to
      the north and is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US. Kentucky
      is more southern, bordering Tennessee.


      So just from state positioning, we would expect that a zip code in Kentucky
      would be south of a zip code in Michigan.


      To be more precise, let''s confirm:

      - 42420 is in Kentucky

      - 49445 is in Michigan


      Since Michigan is north of Kentucky, the zip code 49445 in Michigan should be
      north of the zip code 42420 in Kentucky.


      Therefore, 42420, KY is NOT north of 49445, MI. It''s south of it.</think>#
      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if 42420, KY is north of 49445, MI, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.

      - 42420 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 49445 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Kentucky is located in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan is located in the northern Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Michigan borders Canada and the Great Lakes to the north

      - Kentucky is positioned significantly south of Michigan

      - All of Kentucky is south of most of Michigan (especially the parts with zip
      codes starting with 494xx)


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Michigan is north of Kentucky, a zip code in Michigan (49445) would
      be north of a zip code in Kentucky (42420)

      Michigan is clearly north of Kentucky on a map of the United States. Michigan
      is one of the northernmost states in the continental US, while Kentucky is more

      Let''s start by identifying the states:

      - 42420 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 49445 is in Michigan (MI)


      Geographically speaking, Michigan is generally north of Kentucky. Michigan is
      one of the northernmost states in the continental US, bordering Canada, while
      Kentucky is more in the mid-south.


      In the US, zip codes don''t perfectly correlate with latitude, but generally
      speaking, higher zip code numbers don''t necessarily mean more northern locations.
      The first digit of a zip code relates to a geographical region from east to
      west (starting with 0 in the northeast and ending with 9 in the west), but within
      those regions, the correlation with north-south position isn''t consistent.


      Given that Kentucky (42420) is generally south of Michigan (49445), and knowing

      Kentucky is located in the southeastern/central United States, while Michigan
      is in the northern part of the country, bordering the Great Lakes and Canada.

      Michigan is substantially north of Kentucky in terms of latitude. All of Michigan

      1. 86326 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      2. 84009 is a zip code in Utah (UT)

      3. I need to determine if the Arizona zip code is north of the Utah zip code


      First, I need to recall the general geographic relationship between Arizona
      and Utah. Utah is directly north of Arizona. The border between them runs east-west.
      So in general, locations in Utah tend to be north of locations in Arizona.


      However, this question is asking about specific zip codes, and it''s possible
      that a location in northern Arizona could be north of a location in southern
      Utah.


      To properly answer this, I would need to know the exact locations of these zip
      codes. Let me think about what I know about zip code numbering:


      In the US postal system, zip codes generally follow patterns where:

      - Lower numbers tend to be in the eastern US

      - Higher numbers tend to be in the western US


      Within states, there can be patterns too, but I don''t have specific knowledge
      about how zip codes are organized within Arizona and Utah.


      Given that Utah is north of Arizona, and without specific knowledge of these
      zip codes, the most likely answer would be NO - a zip code in Arizona is probably
      not north of a zip code in Utah. But I should be cautious because this could
      be a tricky question where these particular zip codes don''t follow the typical
      geographic relationship.</think># Determining if 86326, AZ is north of 84009,
      UT


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic relationship between
      these specific zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions

      Utah (UT) is generally located directly north of Arizona (AZ). The entire Utah-Arizona
      border runs east-west, with Utah being the northern state and Arizona the southern
      state.


      ## Step 2: Understand zip code locations

      - 86326 is a zip code in Arizona (specifically Cottonwood/Verde Valley area)

      - 84009 is a zip code in Utah (in the Salt Lake City region)


      ## Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge

      Since Utah is entirely north of Arizona, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, any location in Arizona (including 86326) must be south of any location
      in Utah (including 84009).


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 86326, AZ is not located north of 84009, UT. It is south of it.'
    745e4f17-3f49-44fd-a370-fb0bbbaac88a: '<think>To determine if 86326, AZ is located
      north of 84009, UT, I need to find the geographic locations of both zip codes
      and compare their latitudes.


      Let me start by understanding what I know about US zip codes:

      - In general, US zip codes have a rough geographic distribution where lower
      numbers tend to be in the northeastern US, and higher numbers tend to be in
      the western US

      - However, within states, the numbering doesn''t necessarily follow a strict
      north-south pattern


      So I need to look at the specific locations:


      84009 is a zip code in Utah (UT)

      86326 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)


      Geographically, Utah is located directly north of Arizona in the western United
      States. Utah shares its southern border with Arizona.


      Since Utah is north of Arizona, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, it''s very likely that 84009, UT is north of 86326, AZ.


      Let me check if there could be any exceptions. For instance, if 84009 is in
      the extreme southern part of Utah and 86326 is in the extreme northern part
      of Arizona, they could potentially be close to each other. But even then, since
      Arizona is south of Utah, the Arizona zip code would still be south of the Utah
      zip code.</think># Reasoning About Zip Code Locations


      To determine if 86326, AZ is north of 84009, UT, I need to consider the geographic
      relationship between these states and their zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Understand the states'' positions

      Utah (UT) is located directly north of Arizona (AZ) in the western United States.
      They share a border, with Utah being the northern neighbor.


      ## Step 2: Consider zip code distribution

      While zip codes don''t follow a perfect north-south pattern, they are generally
      contained within their states'' boundaries.


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      - 86326 is in Arizona, which is the southern state

      - 84009 is in Utah, which is the northern state


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Utah is entirely north of Arizona, any location in Utah (including 84009)
      would be north of any location in Arizona (including 86326).

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 86326 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 84009 is in Utah (UT)


      Generally speaking, Utah is north of Arizona since Arizona borders Utah on Utah''s
      southern border. However, zip codes near the border could have different relative
      positions than the general state relationship.


      Looking at the zip code patterns:

      - Utah zip codes generally start with 84 and 85

      - Arizona zip codes generally start with 85, 86, and 87


      The zip code 86326 in Arizona could be in northern Arizona, and 84009 in Utah
      could be in southern Utah. But I need to be more specific about the exact locations.


      The zip code 86326 appears to be in the Cottonwood/Cornville area of Arizona,
      which is in the north-central part of the state.


      The zip code 84009 appears to be in the South Jordan area of Utah, which is
      in the northern part of Utah near Salt Lake City.

      - 86326 is in Cottonwood/Cornville area, Arizona

      - 84009 is in South Jordan area, Utah


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions

      Utah is generally north of Arizona (Utah borders Arizona''s northern edge).


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within these states

      - 84009 (South Jordan) is in northern Utah, near Salt Lake City

      - 86326 (Cottonwood) is in north-central Arizona


      ## Step 4: Compare the specific locations

      Even though 86326 is in northern Arizona, South Jordan, Utah (84009) is still
      further north since it''s in northern Utah, and Utah itself is north of Arizona.

      to determine if the zip code 86326 in Arizona (AZ) is located north of zip code
      84009 in Utah (UT).


      Let me think about the geographic locations:


      1. Arizona (AZ) is generally south of Utah (UT) since Utah borders Arizona to
      the north.


      2. However, zip codes don''t always follow a perfect north-to-south pattern,
      so I need to check the specific locations of these zip codes.


      Zip code 86326 appears to be in the Cottonwood/Cornville area of Arizona, which
      is in the northern part of Arizona.


      Zip code 84009 appears to be in the South Jordan area of Utah, which is in the
      northern part of Utah near Salt Lake City.


      Given that Utah is north of Arizona, and 84009 is in northern Utah while 86326
      is in northern Arizona, it''s very likely that 84009 in Utah is north of 86326
      in Arizona.


      So the answer would be NO, 86326 AZ is NOT located north of 84009 UT.</think>#
      Is 86326, AZ located north of 84009, UT?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these

      Step 1: Consider the states. Utah (UT) is directly north of Arizona (AZ) in
      terms of their geographic positions.


      Step 2: Analyze the specific zip codes:

      - 86326 is in Cottonwood/Cornville area of Arizona, located in the northern
      part of Arizona

      - 84009 is in the South Jordan area of Utah, located in the northern part of
      Utah (near Salt Lake City)


      Step 3: Even though 86326 is in northern Arizona, Utah itself is entirely north
      of Arizona. Since 84009 is in northern Utah, it must be north of any location

      NO, 86326, AZ is not located north of 84009, UT.'

      31206 is in Georgia (GA)

      40422 is in Kentucky (KY)


      In general, I know that Kentucky is north of Georgia in the United States. Kentucky
      borders the southern states but is considered part of the Midwest/Upper South,
      while Georgia is definitely in the Deep South.


      Looking at the first digits of the zip codes can also give us a clue:

      - Zip codes starting with 3 are generally in the southeastern states

      - Zip codes starting with 4 are generally in the lower Midwest/Upper South states


      So 31206 (Georgia) should be south of 40422 (Kentucky).


      To be even more specific:

      31206 is likely in the Macon area of central Georgia

      40422 is likely somewhere in central Kentucky


      Since Georgia is entirely south of Kentucky, any zip code in Georgia would be
      south of any zip code in Kentucky.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 31206 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 40422 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Kentucky is located north of Georgia in the United States. Kentucky is part
      of the Upper South/Midwest region, while Georgia is in the Deep South.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      - Zip codes beginning with 3 typically cover southeastern states (including
      Georgia)

      - Zip codes beginning with 4 typically cover parts of the Midwest and Upper
      South (including Kentucky)


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia geographically, any location in
      Kentucky (including 40422) would be north of any location in Georgia (including
      31206).

      if a zip code in Georgia (31206, GA) is located north of a zip code in Kentucky
      (40422, KY). Let me think step by step.


      First, I need to know the general geographic relationship between Georgia and
      Kentucky:

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the east-central United States

      - In general, Kentucky is north of Georgia


      Since we''re comparing specific zip codes, let''s think about this more precisely:

      - 31206 is a zip code in Georgia

      - 40422 is a zip code in Kentucky


      Given the general geographic relationship between these states, a zip code in
      Georgia (31206) would typically be south of a zip code in Kentucky (40422).
      This is because Georgia as a state is entirely south of Kentucky.


      While specific zip codes can sometimes create unexpected geographic relationships
      when comparing locations near state borders, the difference between Georgia
      and Kentucky is substantial enough that a Georgia zip code would almost certainly
      be south of a Kentucky zip code.</think>To determine if 31206, GA is located
      north of 40422, KY, I need to consider the geographic positions of these states
      and zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States, while Kentucky (KY)
      is in the east-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship.

      Kentucky is positioned entirely north of Georgia on the map of the United States.


      Step 3: Consider zip code patterns.

      While zip codes don''t perfectly align with latitude, they generally follow
      geographic patterns. The lower zip code numbers in Georgia (31xxx) compared
      to Kentucky''s higher numbers (40xxx) also suggest Georgia''s more southern
      position.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Georgia is completely south of Kentucky geographically, any location in
      Georgia (including 31206) would be south of locations in Kentucky (including
      40422).


      NO, 31206, GA is not located north of 40422, KY.'

      1. 31206, GA (Georgia)

      2. 40422, KY (Kentucky)


      I need to figure out which one is located further north.


      Generally speaking, Kentucky (KY) is north of Georgia (GA), so there''s a good
      chance that the Kentucky zip code is north of the Georgia one.


      Let''s also consider the zip code numbers themselves. In the US zip code system,
      lower numbers tend to be in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country,
      while higher numbers tend to be in the western and southwestern regions. However,
      the first digit is more relevant to east-west positioning rather than north-south.


      Looking at these zip codes:

      - 31206 (GA): Starts with 3, which typically covers southeastern states

      - 40422 (KY): Starts with 4, which typically covers states a bit further north


      Based on both state locations and zip code patterns, it appears that 40422,
      KY is likely north of 31206, GA.


      Georgia is definitively south of Kentucky on a US map. Kentucky borders the
      northern part of Tennessee, which in turn borders the northern part of Georgia.
      So Kentucky is at least one full state north of Georgia.</think>To determine
      if 31206, GA is located north of 40422, KY, I need to analyze the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 31206 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 40422 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while Kentucky is located
      in the east-central United States. On a U.S. map, Kentucky is positioned north
      of Georgia.


      Step 3: Consider zip code patterns.

      The first digit of U.S. zip codes generally follows geographic patterns. Zip
      codes beginning with 3 (like 31206) typically cover southeastern states including
      Georgia, while those beginning with 4 (like 40422) cover states further north
      including Kentucky.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Kentucky is geographically north of Georgia, and this is reflected in
      their zip code numbering patterns, 40422, KY would be north of 31206, GA.


      NO, 31206, GA is not located north of 40422, KY. It is located south of it.'

      First, let me consider the general geography of the United States:

      - Georgia (GA) is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States

      - Kentucky (KY) is more northern than Georgia, located in the east-central part
      of the country


      Generally speaking, Kentucky is north of Georgia. This would suggest that a
      zip code in Georgia would not be north of a zip code in Kentucky.


      Let''s think about zip codes more specifically. In the US zip code system:

      - The first digit generally indicates a broad geographical region

      - The first three digits typically correspond to a more specific region or sectional
      center facility


      In this case:

      - 31206 (GA) starts with "3" which typically covers southeastern states

      - 40422 (KY) starts with "4" which typically covers some midwestern and southern
      states including Kentucky


      Based on the standard geographical arrangement of US zip codes, the "3" prefix
      indicates a more southern location than the "4" prefix.


      So without even needing to look up the exact coordinates, I can conclude that
      31206, GA is south of 40422, KY, not north of it.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to analyze the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Consider the states involved.

      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States.

      Kentucky (KY) is located in the east-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship.

      Kentucky is positioned entirely north of Georgia. The southernmost point of
      Kentucky is still north of the northernmost point of Georgia.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code system patterns.

      The first digit of U.S. zip codes generally follows a pattern where lower numbers
      are in the northeast/east and numbers increase as you move west, with some north-south
      patterns as well. However, the key point is that Georgia zip codes (31xxx) are
      always south of Kentucky zip codes (40xxx).


      Step 4: Verify the specific zip codes.

      to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      31206 is in Georgia (GA)

      40422 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Generally speaking, Kentucky is north of Georgia in the United States. Georgia
      is in the southeastern US, while Kentucky is more north, bordering the south
      but considered part of the Midwest/Appalachian region.


      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:


      Zip codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be
      in the eastern and southern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend
      to be in the western and northern parts.


      31206 starts with "3" which typically indicates a southeastern state (which
      matches Georgia)

      40422 starts with "4" which typically indicates a more northern state than those
      starting with "3"


      Based on this pattern, 40422 in Kentucky would be north of 31206 in Georgia.


      To be absolutely certain, I could determine the exact latitude of each zip code,
      but given the general geography of the US, with Kentucky being entirely north
      of Georgia, I can conclude that 31206, GA is south of 40422, KY, not north of
      it.</think>I need to determine if one zip code is north of the other by comparing

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 31206 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 40422 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Kentucky is located entirely north of Georgia in the United States. Georgia
      is in the southeastern US, while Kentucky is positioned above it.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where codes beginning with lower numbers
      (like 3xxxx) tend to be in the southern parts of the country, while higher first
      digits (like 4xxxx) tend to be more northern.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geography.

      Since Kentucky is north of Georgia, and the specific zip codes follow the general
      pattern, 31206 in Georgia would be south of 40422 in Kentucky, not north of
      it.

      (Georgia) is located north of 40422, KY (Kentucky).


      First, let me think about the general geography of the US. Georgia is a southern
      state, while Kentucky is more northern. Georgia is typically south of Kentucky
      on a map.


      To confirm this, I can also think about the pattern of US zip codes. Generally,
      zip codes in the US start with lower numbers in the northeast and increase as
      you go south and west. So:

      - 31206 (Georgia) starts with "3", which is typically for southeastern states

      - 40422 (Kentucky) starts with "4", which is typically for states a bit further
      north


      Since Georgia''s zip code (31206) starts with a lower number than Kentucky''s
      zip code (40422), and considering the general geographic knowledge that Georgia
      is south of Kentucky, I can conclude that 31206, GA is NOT north of 40422, KY.

      - 40422 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while Kentucky is located
      more northward in the south-central part of the country.


      Step 3: Analyze the relative positions.

      Kentucky sits entirely north of Georgia on the map. The entire state of Georgia
      is south of Kentucky.


      Step 4: Consider the zip code patterns.

      The lower first digit in the Georgia zip code (3xxxx vs 4xxxx) is consistent
      with the general pattern of US zip codes, where more southern regions often
      have lower numbers in this region of the country.


      NO - 31206, GA is not located north of 40422, KY. It is located south of it.'

      whether the zip code 70711, LA (Louisiana) is located north of zip code 72364,
      AR (Arkansas).


      To answer this, I need to consider the geographical positions of these two locations.


      First, let''s think about the general geographic relationship between Louisiana
      and Arkansas. Arkansas is generally north of Louisiana, as Louisiana is on the
      Gulf Coast, while Arkansas is inland and borders Louisiana on its north.


      Now, let''s think more specifically about these zip codes:

      - 70711 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 72364 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Given that Arkansas is generally north of Louisiana, it''s likely that the Arkansas
      zip code (72364) is north of the Louisiana zip code (70711). However, I need
      to be careful because state borders can be irregular, and locations near borders
      might not follow the general north-south relationship of the states.


      Without specific coordinates for these zip codes, I''ll go with the general
      geographic relationship: Arkansas is north of Louisiana, so zip code 72364 in
      Arkansas is likely north of zip code 70711 in Louisiana.


      Therefore, 70711, LA is likely NOT north of 72364, AR. Instead, 72364, AR is
      likely north of 70711, LA.</think>I need to determine if a Louisiana zip code
      is north of an Arkansas zip code.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 70711 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 72364 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Arkansas is positioned directly north of Louisiana on the US map. Louisiana
      is on the Gulf Coast, while Arkansas is an inland state that borders Louisiana''s
      northern edge.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      While there could theoretically be exceptions near irregular state borders,
      the zip code numbering doesn''t suggest this is a border anomaly. The 703xx-708xx
      range covers Louisiana, while the 716xx-729xx range covers Arkansas.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on state positions.

      Since Arkansas is north of Louisiana, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states following the standard pattern, zip code 72364 in Arkansas must be north
      of zip code 70711 in Louisiana.


      NO, 70711, LA is not located north of 72364, AR. It''s the opposite - the Arkansas
      zip code is north of the Louisiana zip code.'

      - 72364, AR refers to a zip code in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states.

      Arkansas is generally north of Louisiana. Louisiana is located on the Gulf Coast
      in the southern United States, while Arkansas is directly north of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Consider specific zip codes.

      While the general state positions suggest that an AR zip code would be north

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana. Louisiana borders the Gulf
      of Mexico in the south, while Arkansas sits above Louisiana''s northern border.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly organized by latitude, the general pattern
      holds that locations in Arkansas will be north of locations in Louisiana, especially

      2. Find the geographic location of 72364, AR

      3. Compare their latitudes - if the latitude of 70711 is higher than 72364,
      then it''s further north; otherwise, it''s not.


      However, I don''t have a direct database of zip code coordinates. Let me think
      about what I know about these states geographically:


      Louisiana (LA) is generally south of Arkansas (AR). Arkansas is directly north
      of Louisiana. So a zip code in Louisiana would typically be south of a zip code
      in Arkansas, not north.


      The first digits of zip codes sometimes follow geographic patterns. The "7"
      prefix for both indicates they''re in the same general region (South Central
      US), but the "70xxx" codes are typically for Louisiana while "72xxx" codes are
      typically for Arkansas.


      Based on general geography, a Louisiana zip code (70711) would almost certainly
      be south of an Arkansas zip code (72364), not north of it.</think>I need to
      determine the relative positions of these two zip codes by looking at their

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 70711 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 72364 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Arkansas is located directly north of Louisiana in the United States. Louisiana
      borders the Gulf of Mexico to the south, while Arkansas is positioned above
      Louisiana.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the zip codes.

      Since 70711 is in Louisiana, and 72364 is in Arkansas, and Arkansas is north
      of Louisiana, the zip code in Louisiana would be south of the zip code in Arkansas.

      determine the locations of two zip codes and their relative positions:

      1. 22406, VA (Virginia)

      2. 18210, PA (Pennsylvania)


      First, I need to recall the general geographic relationship between Virginia
      and Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is north of Virginia, as Pennsylvania borders
      New York to its north while Virginia is further south, bordering North Carolina.


      In terms of zip codes:

      - Pennsylvania zip codes generally start with 150-196

      - Virginia zip codes generally start with 220-246


      So just from the zip code prefixes, 18210 (PA) would be in Pennsylvania, and
      22406 (VA) would be in Virginia.


      Since Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia, the zip code 18210 in PA

      Pennsylvania.


      So my reasoning suggests that 22406, VA is south of 18210, PA, not north of
      it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic
      positions of these two ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 22406 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA)

      - 18210 is a ZIP code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia in the United States

      - Virginia''s northern border connects with Maryland, and Pennsylvania is north
      of Maryland


      Step 3: Even though ZIP codes can sometimes be arranged in unexpected ways,
      the general state geography is reliable for this comparison.

      - Virginia ZIP codes (including those in Northern Virginia like 22406) are south
      of Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania ZIP codes (including 18210) are north of Virginia


      Therefore, 22406, VA is NOT located north of 18210, PA. It is south of it.

      to determine if zip code 22406 in Virginia (VA) is located north of zip code
      18210 in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Step 1: I''ll identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 22406 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 18210 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Think about the general geography of these states.

      Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia in the United States. Pennsylvania
      borders Virginia''s northern neighbor (Maryland), so Pennsylvania is typically
      further north than Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider if there could be exceptions.

      While states have irregular shapes, Virginia is definitely south of Pennsylvania
      on the East Coast. There''s no part of Virginia that extends north of Pennsylvania.


      Since 22406 is in Virginia and 18210 is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is
      north of Virginia, the zip code 22406 (VA) must be south of 18210 (PA), not
      north of it.</think>I need to determine if zip code 22406 in Virginia is located
      north of zip code 18210 in Pennsylvania.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic positions of Virginia and Pennsylvania.

      Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia on the US East Coast. Pennsylvania
      doesn''t directly border Virginia - Maryland sits between them.


      Step 2: Examine the general north-south relationship.

      All of Virginia lies south of Pennsylvania. Virginia''s northernmost points
      are still south of Pennsylvania''s southernmost points.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 22406 is in Virginia, and 18210 is in Pennsylvania, the zip code in Virginia
      must be south of the zip code in Pennsylvania.


      NO - 22406, VA is not located north of 18210, PA. It is located south of it.'
    e3b6f057-a534-44bb-aa0b-32afd1852de7: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine if the zip code 22406 in Virginia is located north of the zip code
      18210 in Pennsylvania.


      First, let me recall the general geography of Virginia (VA) and Pennsylvania
      (PA). Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia, as Pennsylvania borders New
      York to its north and Virginia to its south, while Virginia borders Pennsylvania
      to its north.


      So in general, locations in Pennsylvania tend to be north of locations in Virginia.
      But I need to be specific about these zip codes.


      Let me consider the specific zip codes:

      - 22406 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 18210 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      The fact that one is in VA and one is in PA gives me a strong hint that the
      VA zip code (22406) is likely south of the PA zip code (18210), since VA is
      generally south of PA.


      However, I should be careful because zip codes don''t follow a perfect north-to-south
      numbering system. Also, Virginia has a northern part that extends quite far
      north (Northern Virginia), so I need to be precise.


      Based on my knowledge, zip code 22406 is in the Fredericksburg area of Virginia,
      which is not in the northernmost part of Virginia. It''s more in the central
      to northern part of the state.


      Zip code 18210 appears to be in Carbon County, Pennsylvania, which is in the
      eastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Geographically, locations in Pennsylvania, even southern Pennsylvania, are generally
      north of central Virginia locations.</think># Is 22406, VA located north of
      18210, PA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these zip codes by identifying
      their locations and comparing their north-south positioning.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 22406 is in Stafford County, Virginia

      - 18210 is in Carbon County, Pennsylvania


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Pennsylvania is a state that borders New York to the north and Maryland to the
      south. Virginia lies south of Maryland. This means Pennsylvania is entirely
      north of Virginia.


      ## Step 3: Verify specific locations

      Even though zip codes don''t follow a perfect north-south pattern in their numbering,
      the geographical fact remains that any location in Pennsylvania will be north
      of any location in Virginia due to the states'' relative positions.


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since 22406 is in Virginia and 18210 is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is
      entirely north of Virginia, the Virginia zip code must be south of the Pennsylvania
      zip code.

      - 61611, IL is a zip code in Illinois (IL)

      - 54143, WI is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      Generally, Wisconsin (WI) is located north of Illinois (IL). Wisconsin borders
      Illinois on Illinois'' northern border.


      Since Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois, a zip code in Wisconsin (54143)
      would typically be north of a zip code in Illinois (61611).


      However, I should be careful about making assumptions based just on states,
      since there could be exceptions depending on the specific locations within each
      state. Let me think about the specific zip codes.


      61611 appears to be in the Peoria area of Illinois, which is in the central
      part of the state.

      54143 appears to be in northeastern Wisconsin, likely near Marinette or Peshtigo.


      Given that Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and considering the specific locations

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of these states

      Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois on a map of the United States.


      ## Step 3: Look at the specific zip codes

      - 61611 is in the Peoria area in central Illinois

      - 54143 is in northeastern Wisconsin (likely Marinette County area)


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      Since Wisconsin is positioned north of Illinois, and these specific zip codes
      follow the general state positioning (54143 is in northeastern Wisconsin while

      61611 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)

      54143 is a zip code in Wisconsin (WI)


      Generally speaking, Wisconsin is north of Illinois since Illinois is directly

      Looking at the zip codes more specifically:

      - 61611 appears to be in the Peoria area of Illinois, which is in the central

      - 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states

      Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois. The entire state of Wisconsin
      is generally north of Illinois.


      Step 3: Consider specific zip code locations

      - 61611 is in the Peoria area of Illinois, in the central part of the state

      - 54143 is in Marinette County in northeastern Wisconsin, near the Michigan
      border


      Step 4: Compare the locations

      Since Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states without any unusual geographic anomalies, the zip code in Wisconsin (54143)
      must be north of the zip code in Illinois (61611).


      NO, 61611, IL is not located north of 54143, WI. It is located south of it.'
    e38fd169-c61a-4ae8-b8db-840a2e4624fd: '<think>This question asks whether a zip
      code in Illinois (IL) is located north of a zip code in Wisconsin (WI). Let
      me reason through this:


      1. I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip codes.

      2. 61611 is in Illinois (IL)

      3. 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Generally speaking, Wisconsin is located north of Illinois in the United States.
      The entire state of Wisconsin borders Illinois on its southern border, with
      Wisconsin being the northern neighbor.


      Given this general geography, it would be unusual for a location in Illinois
      to be north of a location in Wisconsin. However, I should check if there might
      be some unusual geographical quirk where a small part of Illinois extends north
      of some part of Wisconsin.


      To my knowledge, there is no such unusual extension - the Illinois-Wisconsin
      border is fairly straight and Wisconsin is entirely north of Illinois.


      Therefore, 61611, IL is very likely south of 54143, WI, not north of it.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these two
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois. The entire state of Wisconsin
      sits above Illinois on the map, with the Illinois-Wisconsin border forming the
      southern boundary of Wisconsin.


      Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the specific zip codes.

      Since 61611 is in Illinois and 54143 is in Wisconsin, and Wisconsin is entirely
      north of Illinois, it follows that the Wisconsin zip code must be north of the
      Illinois zip code.


      NO'

      \ zip code 61611 in Illinois is located north of the zip code 54143 in Wisconsin.\n\
      \nTo solve this problem, I need to know the geographical locations of these\
      \ zip codes. \n\nFirst, let's establish what states these are in:\n- 61611 is\
      \ in Illinois (IL)\n- 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)\n\nGeographically, Wisconsin\
      \ is generally north of Illinois, as Wisconsin borders the northern part of\
      \ Illinois. So generally speaking, locations in Wisconsin tend to be north of\
      \ locations in Illinois.\n\nHowever, I need to be more precise since we're looking\
      \ at specific zip codes that could be near the border.\n\nLet me think about\
      \ the zip code systems. In the US, zip codes tend to start with lower numbers\
      \ in the northeast and increase as you go south and west. So a zip code starting\
      \ with 54 (in Wisconsin) would typically be north of a zip code starting with\
      \ 61 (in Illinois).\n\nIn fact, the first digit of the zip code gives a general\
      \ geographical region, with 5 covering the midwest area including Wisconsin,\
      \ and 6 covering Illinois and other states. Within these regions, the second\
      \ digit generally indicates a more specific area, often with lower numbers being\
      \ further north.\n\nSo based on the zip code numbering system, 54143 (Wisconsin)\
      \ should be north of 61611 (Illinois).\n\nThis aligns with the general geography\
      \ of Wisconsin being north of Illinois.</think>To determine if 61611, IL is\
      \ located north of 54143, WI, I need to analyze the geographic locations of\
      \ these zip codes.\n\nStep 1: Identify the states\n- 61611 is in Illinois (IL)\n\
      - 54143 is in Wisconsin (WI)\n\nStep 2: Consider the general geography of these\
      \ states\nWisconsin is located directly north of Illinois on the US map.\n\n\
      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns\nIn the US postal system, zip codes generally\
      \ follow patterns where lower numbers in the first digits often correspond to\
      \ more northern locations within the same region. The \"54\" prefix for Wisconsin\
      \ vs the \"61\" prefix for Illinois suggests the Wisconsin location is further\
      \ north.\n\nStep 4: Specific locations\n61611 is in the Peoria area in central\
      \ Illinois\n54143 is in Marinette County in northeastern Wisconsin, near the\
      \ Michigan border\n\nSince Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and specifically\
      \ 54143 is in the northern part of Wisconsin while 61611 is in central Illinois,\
      \ the Wisconsin zip code is definitely further north.\n\nNO (61611, IL is not\

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 77360, TX is a zip code in Texas

      - 72601, AR is a zip code in Arkansas


      I need to determine their approximate latitudes:


      For 77360, TX:

      This appears to be in East Texas. Texas is generally south of Arkansas, so there''s
      a good chance this zip code is south of the Arkansas one. Texas zip codes starting
      with 77 are typically in the southeastern part of Texas, around the Houston
      area.


      For 72601, AR:

      This is in Arkansas, which is north of Texas. Arkansas zip codes starting with
      72 are typically in the northern part of Arkansas.


      Given that Texas is generally south of Arkansas, and specifically that the 77xxx
      zip codes are in southern Texas while 72xxx zip codes are in northern Arkansas,

      - 77360, TX is in Texas

      - 72601, AR is in Arkansas

      - Arkansas is generally located north of Texas

      - Specifically, northern Arkansas (72xxx) is definitely north of southeastern
      Texas (77xxx)

      - Therefore, 77360, TX would be south of 72601, AR, not north of it

      - The first digit generally indicates a geographical region, with lower numbers
      in the northeast and higher numbers in the west and south

      - 7xxxx zip codes are typically in the south-central United States


      So 77360 is in Texas and 72601 is in Arkansas. To determine which is further

      since some parts of Texas could be north of some parts of Arkansas.


      However, looking at the actual zip codes:

      - 77xxx zip codes in Texas are typically in the southeastern part of Texas (Houston
      area)

      - 726xx zip codes in Arkansas would be in the northern part of Arkansas


      Given that southeastern Texas is definitely south of northern Arkansas, I can

      - 77360 is in Texas (TX)

      - 72601 is in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Examine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Arkansas is generally located north of Texas, with Arkansas bordering the northeastern

      Step 3: Check the specific zip code regions.

      - 77xxx zip codes are typically in the southeastern part of Texas (Houston area)

      - 72xxx zip codes are in northern/central Arkansas


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      77360 is in the San Jacinto County area of Texas, which is in the southeastern
      part of the state.

      72601 is in the Harrison area of Arkansas, which is in the northern part of
      Arkansas.


      Given that northern Arkansas is north of southeastern Texas, 77360 TX cannot
      be north of 72601 AR.

      geographic relationship between these two zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - SC = South Carolina

      - VA = Virginia


      In the United States, Virginia is located north of South Carolina. South Carolina
      is in the southeastern United States, while Virginia is more mid-Atlantic.


      Looking at the general geography of the US, when comparing two locations where
      one is in South Carolina and one is in Virginia, the Virginia location will
      typically be north of the South Carolina location.


      So without even getting into the specific coordinates of these zip codes, I
      can determine that 29033, SC (in South Carolina) is south of 24179, VA (in Virginia),
      not north of it.</think>I need to determine if 29033, SC is north of 24179,

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 29033 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 24179 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US

      - South Carolina is located in the Southeastern region of the US

      - Virginia is positioned north of South Carolina on a map


      Step 3: Make the comparison

      - Since Virginia is north of South Carolina, any location in Virginia would
      be north of a location in South Carolina, regardless of the specific zip codes
      within those states


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      - Therefore, 29033, SC must be south of 24179, VA (not north of it)


      NO'

      First, let''s think about the general geographic location of these states:

      - South Carolina (SC) is a southern state on the east coast of the US

      - Virginia (VA) is a mid-Atlantic state on the east coast of the US, north of
      the Carolinas


      Generally speaking, Virginia is north of South Carolina. So any location in
      South Carolina would typically be south of any location in Virginia, not north

      Therefore, 29033, SC is likely south of 24179, VA, not north of it.


      To be certain, I could look up the exact coordinates of these zip codes, but
      based on the general geography of the United States, the answer is almost certainly
      NO - 29033, SC is not located north of 24179, VA.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      First, I need to determine the relative positions of South Carolina (SC) and
      Virginia (VA) on the US map.


      Looking at the geographical layout of US states:

      - Virginia (VA) is located in the Mid-Atlantic region

      - South Carolina (SC) is located in the Southeastern region

      - Virginia is positioned north of South Carolina


      Since the zip code 29033 is in South Carolina and the zip code 24179 is in Virginia,
      we can determine their relative positions based on their states'' locations.


      Even if there are variations in location within each state, the entirety of
      South Carolina lies south of Virginia on the US map. The northernmost point
      of SC is still south of the southernmost point of VA.

      (South Carolina) is north of 24179, VA (Virginia).


      Step 1: Consider the geographic positions of South Carolina and Virginia.

      Virginia is north of South Carolina in the United States. Virginia is a Mid-Atlantic
      state, while South Carolina is a Southern state.


      Step 2: Generally speaking, ZIP codes in the US follow some geographical patterns,
      but I need to be careful because specific ZIP codes within states could be in
      unusual positions.


      Step 3: However, given that entire state of South Carolina is south of the entire
      state of Virginia, any ZIP code in South Carolina must be south of any ZIP code
      in Virginia.


      Therefore, 29033, SC (in South Carolina) cannot be north of 24179, VA (in Virginia).</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these two

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 29033 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 24179 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US

      - South Carolina is located in the Southeastern region of the US

      - Virginia is entirely north of South Carolina on the US map


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      While zip codes aren''t perfectly aligned with latitude, the general geographic
      relationship between states is reliable for this question.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since South Carolina is entirely south of Virginia geographically, any location
      in South Carolina (including 29033) must be south of any location in Virginia
      (including 24179).

      3. 12192 is in New York (NY)

      4. I need to figure out if the NJ location is north of the NY location


      Let me recall what I know about these zip codes:


      08022 is a zip code in New Jersey. It appears to be in the southern part of
      New Jersey, possibly around the Moorestown or Columbus area.


      12192 is a zip code in New York. It appears to be in the eastern part of New
      York state.


      Generally speaking, New York is north of New Jersey. However, the specific locations
      matter because parts of NJ could potentially be north of certain parts of NY,
      especially considering that NJ extends quite far north along the Hudson River.


      However, from what I recall:

      - 08xxx zip codes are typically in southern New Jersey

      - 12xxx zip codes are typically in upstate New York, which is definitely north

      if 08022, NJ is north of 12192, NY, I need to examine the geographic locations
      of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 08022 is a zip code in New Jersey (specifically Columbus/Jobstown area in
      Burlington County)

      - 12192 is a zip code in New York (Westerlo area in Albany County)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of NJ and NY.

      - New Jersey is generally south of New York State

      - However, I need to check these specific locations


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - ZIP codes generally increase as you go north to south in the eastern US

      - 08xxx series are in southern/central New Jersey

      - 12xxx series are in upstate New York


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - 08022 is in southern New Jersey

      - 12192 is in upstate New York, well north of the NJ border

      - Upstate New York is definitely north of southern New Jersey

      Let me reason through this:


      Zip code 08022 is in New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is generally south of New York
      state.


      Zip code 12192 is in New York (NY).


      However, the exact north-south relationship depends on the specific locations
      of these zip codes, not just the states they''re in. New Jersey is mostly south
      of New York, but parts of NJ could be north of certain parts of NY, especially
      since NY extends far to the west.


      Let me think about the numbering system of zip codes. In the US postal system:

      - First digit: Represents a group of states

      - 0 is for northeastern states including NJ

      - 1 is also for northeastern states including NY


      So both are in the northeast, but that doesn''t tell us the north-south relationship
      precisely.


      Given that 08022 is in NJ and 12192 is in NY, and knowing that generally NJ
      is south of NY, it''s likely that 08022 is south of 12192. But I should be careful
      about making assumptions based solely on state locations, as specific zip codes
      could be positioned differently.


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, the most reasonable conclusion based
      on general geographic knowledge is that 08022, NJ is south of 12192, NY.</think>#

      - New York state is generally located north of New Jersey

      - While there are some exceptions with irregularly shaped state borders, the
      vast majority of NY is north of NJ


      ## Step 3: Check specific zip codes

      - 08022 corresponds to Columbus, NJ, in the southern half of New Jersey

      - 12192 corresponds to Valatie, NY, which is in the eastern part of New York
      state

      - Looking at their positions, Columbus, NJ (08022) is definitively south of

      Generally speaking, New York is north of New Jersey. However, this is not universally
      true for all locations in each state since states have irregular shapes and
      some parts of NJ could be north of some parts of NY.


      Let me think about what I know about these specific zip codes:


      08022 appears to be in southern New Jersey based on the numbering system (lower

      12192 appears to be in New York, and the "121xx" range would typically be in
      eastern/southeastern NY.


      Based on the US zip code system, lower numbers like 08xxx are generally more

      Step 2: Consider the ZIP code numbering system.

      In the US postal system, ZIP codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      are assigned to areas in the southern and eastern regions, while higher numbers
      move north and west.


      Step 3: Compare the specific codes.

      - 08022 is in the "080xx" range, which is assigned to southern New Jersey

      - 12192 is in the "121xx" range, which is assigned to eastern New York state


      Step 4: Determine relative position.

      New York is generally north of New Jersey, and the higher ZIP code number (12192)
      confirms this is a more northern location than the lower number (08022).

      First, I''ll identify the actual locations:

      - 08022 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      - 12192 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      To determine which is further north, I need to understand the geography. In
      the US, zip codes generally follow patterns where lower numbers tend to be in
      the eastern and southern parts of the country, while higher numbers tend to
      be in the western and northern parts.


      Given that both NJ and NY are eastern states, the numbers themselves might not
      follow the general east-west pattern strictly.


      New Jersey is generally south of New York State. However, I need to be precise
      about these specific zip codes.


      08022 appears to be in southern New Jersey, likely in the Camden/Burlington
      area.

      12192 appears to be somewhere in New York state.


      New York is generally north of New Jersey, so it''s likely that 12192, NY is
      north of 08022, NJ. The higher first digit (1 vs 0) also suggests a more northern

      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:


      1) 08022 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      2) 12192 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Looking at the first digits of these zip codes:

      - Zip codes beginning with 0 typically cover northeastern states (including
      NJ)

      - Zip codes beginning with 1 typically cover northeastern states as well (including
      NY)


      Within the zip code system:

      - 08xxx codes generally cover southern and central New Jersey

      - 12xxx codes generally cover eastern upstate New York


      Geographically speaking, New York State is generally positioned north of New
      Jersey. While there are parts of NJ that extend further north than some parts
      of NY, zip code 08022 (which is in southern NJ, specifically Clementon/Camden
      County area) is definitely south of zip code 12192 (which is in eastern upstate

      First, let me recall the general geography of the US states:

      - Florida (FL) is one of the southernmost states in the US, extending as a peninsula
      into the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.

      - North Carolina (NC) is located on the East Coast, but considerably north of
      Florida.


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is north of Florida. However, I need to check
      the specific zip codes to be certain.


      32092 is in Florida (FL)

      27408 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Since Florida is south of North Carolina, generally a Florida zip code would
      be south of a North Carolina zip code. This would mean that 32092, FL is NOT
      north of 27408, NC.


      But let me double-check this understanding to be completely sure. Florida is
      definitely south of North Carolina on a map of the United States. There''s no
      part of Florida that extends north of North Carolina.</think>To determine if
      32092, FL is located north of 27408, NC, I need to compare the geographic locations

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 32092 is in Florida (FL)

      - 27408 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states

      Florida is located south of North Carolina on the US East Coast. The entire
      state of Florida is positioned south of North Carolina''s southern border.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the zip codes

      Since all of Florida is south of North Carolina, any zip code in Florida (including
      32092) must be south of any zip code in North Carolina (including 27408).

      1. The question is asking about the geographical relationship between two ZIP
      codes: 32092, FL and 27408, NC.

      2. Specifically, I need to determine if 32092, FL is located north of 27408,
      NC.


      To answer this, I need to know the approximate locations of these ZIP codes:


      32092 is in Florida (FL). Florida is generally in the southeastern United States.

      27408 is in North Carolina (NC). North Carolina is also in the southeastern
      United States, but generally north of Florida.


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - Florida is south of North Carolina

      - Any location in Florida would generally be south of a location in North Carolina


      Since 32092 is in Florida and 27408 is in North Carolina, it would be highly
      unlikely that the Florida ZIP code is north of the North Carolina ZIP code.
      In fact, it''s essentially geographically impossible since Florida is entirely
      south of North Carolina.</think>To determine if 32092, FL is located north of
      27408, NC, I need to examine the geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 32092 is in Florida (FL)

      - 27408 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Florida is located entirely south of North Carolina on the US map. North Carolina
      is several states north of Florida along the eastern seaboard.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the zip codes

      Since 32092 is in Florida, and 27408 is in North Carolina, the Florida zip code
      must be south of the North Carolina zip code - regardless of where specifically
      within each state these zip codes are located.

      relative locations of two zip codes:

      1. 32092, FL (Florida)

      2. 27408, NC (North Carolina)


      I need to determine whether the Florida zip code is north of the North Carolina
      zip code.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of the US states:

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - North Carolina is also in the southeastern United States, but is typically
      north of Florida


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is north of Florida. That would mean that
      a zip code in Florida would NOT be north of a zip code in North Carolina.


      However, I should double-check this by considering the specific zip codes in
      question, since theoretically there could be exceptions depending on the exact
      locations.


      Florida''s zip code 32092 is likely in the northern part of Florida.

      North Carolina''s zip code 27408 is somewhere in North Carolina.


      Even if 32092 is in the northernmost part of Florida, and 27408 is in the southernmost
      part of North Carolina, Florida''s geographic position still places it south
      of North Carolina.


      So a Florida zip code cannot be north of a North Carolina zip code.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographical relationship between
      these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 32092 is in Florida (FL)

      - 27408 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Florida is located in the southeastern United States, with North Carolina positioned
      to the north of Florida.


      Step 3: Analyze state boundaries

      Even the northernmost point of Florida lies south of the southernmost point
      of North Carolina. The entire state of Florida is south of North Carolina.


      Step 4: Determine the relative positions of the specific zip codes

      Since 32092 is in Florida and 27408 is in North Carolina, the Florida zip code
      must be south of the North Carolina zip code.

      to determine the geographic locations of two zip codes and compare them:

      1. 32092, FL (Florida)

      First, I need to consider the general geographic relationship between Florida
      and North Carolina. Florida is located south of North Carolina on the US East
      Coast. This would suggest that locations in Florida are generally south of locations
      in North Carolina.


      However, the question is specifically about two zip codes, and I need to be
      precise. Let me think about this more carefully:


      - Florida is indeed south of North Carolina

      - ZIP code 32092 is in Florida

      - ZIP code 27408 is in North Carolina


      Given the general geographic relationship between these two states, a location
      in Florida (32092) would be south of a location in North Carolina (27408), not
      north of it.


      Therefore, 32092, FL is NOT located north of 27408, NC. It would be located
      south of it.</think>I need to determine if a zip code in Florida is north of
      a zip code in North Carolina.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic positions of the states.

      Florida is located south of North Carolina on the US East Coast. North Carolina
      borders South Carolina to its south, and South Carolina borders Georgia, which
      borders Florida.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship.

      When looking at a US map, North Carolina is clearly positioned north of Florida.
      The entirety of Florida lies south of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 32092 is in Florida and 27408 is in North Carolina, the Florida zip code
      must be south of the North Carolina zip code, regardless of their specific locations
      within their respective states.

      The question is asking if the Florida zip code is north of the North Carolina
      zip code.


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is north of Florida in the United States.
      Florida is in the southeastern part of the US, and North Carolina is also in
      the southeast but further north.


      So generally, a location in Florida would be south of a location in North Carolina,
      not north of it.


      Let me think more specifically about these zip codes:

      - 32092 is in Florida, which is generally south of North Carolina

      - 27408 is in North Carolina, which is generally north of Florida


      So it seems highly unlikely that 32092, FL would be north of 27408, NC. But
      let me double-check my understanding of US geography to be certain.


      Florida is the southernmost state in the continental United States, while North
      Carolina is several states to the north. There''s no way a location in Florida
      could be north of a location in North Carolina.</think>I need to determine if

      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Florida is located in the southeastern United States, extending as a peninsula
      south into the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.

      North Carolina is also in the southeastern US, but is positioned significantly
      north of Florida.


      Step 2: Understand the general geography.

      All of Florida is south of North Carolina. The entire state of Florida is below
      North Carolina on a map, with Georgia sitting between them.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      Even without knowing the exact locations of these specific zip codes (32092

      to determine the geographical locations of these two zip codes and compare their
      north-south positions.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 24523, VA: This is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 15683, PA: This is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is north of Virginia in the United States.
      Pennsylvania borders Virginia''s northern neighbor (Maryland), so Pennsylvania
      is typically further north than Virginia locations.


      To be precise though, I should check the specific locations of these zip codes,
      since border areas might have exceptions.


      Zip code 24523 appears to be in Bedford County, Virginia, which is in the central/western
      part of Virginia.


      Zip code 15683 appears to be in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, which is in the
      southwestern part of Pennsylvania, near the West Virginia border.


      Given the general geography of the US:

      - Pennsylvania is north of Virginia

      - Even southwestern Pennsylvania should be north of central Virginia


      Therefore, 15683, PA should be north of 24523, VA, not the other way around.</think>#
      Is 24523, VA located north of 15683, PA?


      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 24523 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 15683 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia in the United States. Pennsylvania
      doesn''t directly border Virginia (Maryland is between them), but the general
      orientation is that Pennsylvania is further north.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations

      - 24523 (Bedford area, VA) is in the central/western portion of Virginia

      - 15683 (Fayette County area, PA) is in the southwestern portion of Pennsylvania


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      Even the southernmost parts of Pennsylvania are generally north of central Virginia

      1. The question compares 24523, VA and 15683, PA

      2. I need to determine if 24523, VA is north of 15683, PA


      To answer this, I need to know the geographic locations of these zip codes.
      Generally speaking:

      - PA (Pennsylvania) is a northern state

      - VA (Virginia) is south of Pennsylvania


      In the US, states are arranged with Pennsylvania being north of Virginia. The
      state boundary between PA and VA is essentially a west-to-east line where PA
      is north of VA.


      Since 24523 is in Virginia and 15683 is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is
      north of Virginia, it''s highly likely that 24523, VA is south of 15683, PA
      (not north).

      1) The question asks about the relative positions of two zip codes: 24523 in
      Virginia (VA) and 15683 in Pennsylvania (PA).


      2) First, I need to consider the geographic relationship between these states.
      Pennsylvania is located directly north of Virginia along the east coast of the
      United States.


      3) Since 24523 is in Virginia and 15683 is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania
      is positioned north of Virginia, the zip code in Virginia would generally be
      south of the zip code in Pennsylvania.


      4) While specific zip codes within states can sometimes create exceptions to
      general state positioning (like in border areas), the general state boundary
      relationship holds true here.

      - 15683, PA is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Virginia and Pennsylvania.

      Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia, as Virginia is below Pennsylvania

      To answer this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of these
      zip codes. Let me think about the general locations of Virginia and Pennsylvania
      first.


      Pennsylvania is north of Virginia. Pennsylvania borders Virginia''s northern
      neighbor, Maryland. So generally speaking, locations in Pennsylvania tend to
      be north of locations in Virginia.


      However, I need to be more specific about these particular zip codes, as the
      shapes of states are irregular, and there could be exceptions.


      Let me consider the specific zip codes:

      - 24523 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 15683 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Since Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia, and these zip codes don''t
      seem to be in unusual extensions of their states (like the Northern Panhandle
      of West Virginia that extends north between Pennsylvania and Ohio), it''s very
      likely that 15683, PA is north of 24523, VA.


      So, no, 24523, VA is NOT located north of 15683, PA. It would be located south
      of it.</think># Is 24523, VA located north of 15683, PA?


      To determine this, I need to analyze the geographical positions of these zip

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 24523 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 15683 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia in the United States. The entire state
      of Pennsylvania sits above Virginia geographically, with Maryland between them.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific zip code locations

      While zip codes can sometimes create unusual patterns, the general north-south
      relationship between these states is consistent throughout their territories.
      Pennsylvania zip codes (including 15683) are positioned north of Virginia zip
      codes (including 24523).

      3. To determine which is further north, I need to know the relative geographic
      positions.


      Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia in the US. Pennsylvania borders
      Virginia''s northern neighbor (Maryland), so Pennsylvania is typically further

      north of 26301, WV, I need to understand the geographical locations of these
      ZIP codes.


      First, let''s identify what states these ZIP codes belong to:

      - 27707 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 26301 is in West Virginia (WV)


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of these states. Generally
      speaking:

      - West Virginia is north of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is south of West Virginia


      So broadly speaking, locations in WV tend to be north of locations in NC.


      However, I should be more specific about these particular ZIP codes:


      27707 appears to be in the Durham area of North Carolina

      26301 appears to be in the central part of West Virginia (likely Clarksburg
      area)


      The general geography of the eastern United States puts West Virginia north
      of North Carolina. Even if we''re looking at specific parts of these states,
      the entire state of North Carolina is south of West Virginia.


      So a ZIP code in North Carolina (27707) would be south of a ZIP code in West
      Virginia (26301), not north of it.</think># Is 27707, NC located north of 26301,
      WV?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 27707 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 26301 is in West Virginia (WV)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - West Virginia is located north of North Carolina in the United States

      - North Carolina shares its northern border with Virginia, and West Virginia
      is north of Virginia


      ## Step 3: Determine specific locations

      - 27707 is in Durham, North Carolina (central part of NC)

      - 26301 is in Clarksburg, West Virginia (north-central WV)


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      Since West Virginia is entirely north of North Carolina, any location in West
      Virginia (including 26301) would be north of any location in North Carolina
      (including 27707).


      Therefore, 27707 (NC) is NOT north of 26301 (WV). It''s the opposite - 26301
      (WV) is north of 27707 (NC).

      (WV).


      To do this, I need to consider the geographic locations of these zip codes.
      In the US, generally:

      - Lower latitudes are in the south

      - Higher latitudes are in the north


      Let me think about the general geographic relationship between North Carolina
      and West Virginia:

      - West Virginia is generally north of North Carolina

      - NC is a southern state, while WV is more of a mid-Atlantic/Appalachian state


      Now, for the specific zip codes:

      - 27707 is in NC (likely in the central part of the state)

      - 26301 is in WV (likely in the central part of that state)


      Given the general geographic relationship, it''s very likely that the zip code
      in NC (27707) is south of the zip code in WV (26301), not north of it.


      Therefore, 27707, NC is probably NOT located north of 26301, WV.</think>To determine
      if 27707, NC is located north of 26301, WV, I need to examine the geographical

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 27707 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 26301 is in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - West Virginia is positioned north of North Carolina in the United States.

      - North Carolina is a southern state, while West Virginia is a mid-Atlantic
      state.


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - ZIP code 27707 is in Durham, North Carolina

      - ZIP code 26301 is in Clarksburg, West Virginia


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Since West Virginia is generally north of North Carolina, and these zip codes
      are in their respective states, the zip code in North Carolina (27707) would
      be south of the zip code in West Virginia (26301).

      26301 is a zip code in West Virginia (WV).


      To determine which is further north, I need to know their relative positions.
      North Carolina is generally south of West Virginia in the United States. West
      Virginia is located in the Appalachian region, while North Carolina is a southeastern

      West Virginia is positioned north of North Carolina. So generally speaking,

      this question.


      The question asks whether 27707, NC (North Carolina) is located north of 26301,
      WV (West Virginia).


      First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of North Carolina and
      West Virginia in the United States:

      - North Carolina is on the east coast, in the southeastern part of the US

      - West Virginia is also on the east coast, but more inland and north of North
      Carolina


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - West Virginia is generally north of North Carolina

      - North Carolina borders South Carolina to its south and Virginia to its north

      - West Virginia borders Virginia to its south and Pennsylvania to its north


      So generally speaking, West Virginia is north of North Carolina. This means
      that a zip code in North Carolina (27707) would typically be south of a zip
      code in West Virginia (26301).


      Therefore, 27707, NC is NOT north of 26301, WV. It would be south of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 27707 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 26301 is in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - West Virginia is located in the Appalachian region

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast, south of Virginia

      - West Virginia is north of North Carolina in terms of latitude


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      While specific zip codes within states can vary in exact latitude, the entire
      state of North Carolina lies south of West Virginia. No part of North Carolina
      extends north of the southernmost part of West Virginia.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geographic knowledge.

      Since West Virginia is entirely north of North Carolina, a zip code in North

      1) First, I need to identify the states. 29404 is in SC (South Carolina) and
      28602 is in NC (North Carolina).


      2) I need to recall the geographic relationship between South Carolina and North
      Carolina. North Carolina is positioned north of South Carolina on the US map.


      3) Now let''s look at the zip codes. Generally, in the US postal system, zip
      codes are somewhat geographically organized. The first digit represents a group
      of states, and the first three digits represent a sectional center facility.


      4) Both zip codes start with "2", which covers the southeastern states. But
      the second digit is different - 29404 starts with "9" while 28602 starts with
      "8".


      5) In the zip code system, generally lower numbers in the same region indicate
      more northern locations. So a "28" prefix would be north of a "29" prefix.


      6) Therefore, 28602 in NC would be north of 29404 in SC, both because North

      - 28602 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      North Carolina is positioned directly north of South Carolina on the US map.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      In the US postal system, zip codes are somewhat geographically organized, particularly

      further north than 29xxx (SC) zip codes.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on both state positions and zip code patterns.

      Since 28602 is in North Carolina (a state north of South Carolina) and its zip

      north of 28602, NC, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their geographical positions (specifically north-south positioning)


      First, let''s analyze the zip codes:

      - 29404 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 28602 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is geographically north of South Carolina
      as their names suggest. North Carolina borders South Carolina to the north.


      So if we just go by the states, a location in SC would typically be south of
      a location in NC, not north.


      To be completely sure, I would need to know the exact locations of these zip
      codes. But based on the state information alone, 29404 in SC is very likely
      south of 28602 in NC, not north of it.</think>I need to determine whether one
      zip code is north of the other, so I''ll examine their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 29404 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 28602 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      North Carolina is positioned directly north of South Carolina (as their names
      suggest). The states share a border with NC being the northern neighbor.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific zip codes.

      Since 29404 is in South Carolina and 28602 is in North Carolina, the SC zip
      code must be south of the NC zip code, not north of it.


      NO'

      (South Carolina) is located north of 28602, NC (North Carolina).


      Let''s think about the geography of these states:

      - North Carolina (NC) is generally located north of South Carolina (SC)

      - The names even indicate this - "North" Carolina vs "South" Carolina


      So based on the states alone, South Carolina is south of North Carolina, not
      north of it.


      Now, let''s consider the zip codes. Zip codes in the US generally follow patterns,
      but the specific numbers don''t directly translate to north/south positioning
      in a straightforward way. However, the states these zip codes are in are what
      matters most for this north/south question.


      Since 29404 is in South Carolina (SC), and 28602 is in North Carolina (NC),
      and South Carolina is south of North Carolina (not north of it), the answer
      would be NO.</think>I need to determine if a location in South Carolina is north
      of a location in North Carolina.


      Step 1: Let me consider the geographical relationship between these two states.

      North Carolina and South Carolina are neighboring states on the US East Coast,
      with North Carolina positioned directly north of South Carolina.


      Step 2: Look at the state abbreviations in the question.

      29404 is in SC (South Carolina)

      28602 is in NC (North Carolina)


      Step 3: Apply the geographical relationship.

      Since North Carolina (NC) is positioned north of South Carolina (SC) on a map,
      any location in South Carolina would be south of North Carolina, not north of
      it.

      if zip code 29404 in South Carolina (SC) is located north of zip code 28602
      in North Carolina (NC).


      To figure this out, I need to think about the geographic locations of these
      zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the general geography of the two states:

      - North Carolina (NC) is generally north of South Carolina (SC)

      - The states share a border, with NC above SC


      Now, let''s think about the zip codes:

      - 29404 is in South Carolina

      - 28602 is in North Carolina


      Since South Carolina is generally south of North Carolina, it would be unusual
      for a place in SC to be north of a place in NC. However, the border between
      states isn''t a perfect straight line, so there could be exceptions.


      The zip code numbering system in the US doesn''t perfectly correlate with latitude,
      but there is some geographic organization to it. Lower numbers tend to be in
      the northeastern US, and numbers increase as you go south and west. So a 29xxx
      zip code would typically be south of a 28xxx zip code.


      Given that 29404 is in SC and 28602 is in NC, and considering both the general
      state locations and the zip code numbering patterns, it''s very likely that
      29404 is south of 28602, not north of it.</think>I need to determine if zip
      code 29404 in South Carolina is located north of zip code 28602 in North Carolina.


      Step 1: Consider the general geography of the two states.

      North Carolina (NC) is positioned north of South Carolina (SC). They share a
      border with NC above SC on a map.


      Step 2: Look at the zip codes and their states.

      - 29404 is in South Carolina (the more southern state)

      - 28602 is in North Carolina (the more northern state)


      Step 3: While zip codes don''t perfectly align with latitude, there''s a general
      pattern in the US postal system where numbers increase as you move south and
      west. However, the state location is more determinative here.


      Step 4: Since 29404 is in South Carolina, which is south of North Carolina (where
      28602 is located), this zip code would be south of the North Carolina zip code.


      NO (29404, SC is not located north of 28602, NC)'

      29404 is a zip code in SC (South Carolina)

      28602 is a zip code in NC (North Carolina)


      First, I need to consider the general geography of these states:

      - North Carolina (NC) is generally north of South Carolina (SC)

      - The names themselves suggest this orientation (North Carolina vs South Carolina)


      Since 29404 is in South Carolina and 28602 is in North Carolina, the general
      expectation would be that the South Carolina zip code is south of the North
      Carolina zip code.


      Looking more specifically at these zip codes:

      - 29404 appears to be in the Charleston area of South Carolina (southern part
      of SC)

      - 28602 appears to be in the Hickory area of North Carolina (western part of
      NC)


      Even if there are some border irregularities, it''s extremely unlikely that
      any part of South Carolina would be north of a location in North Carolina, especially
      given these specific locations.


      Therefore, 29404, SC is NOT located north of 28602, NC. It is south of it.</think>I
      need to determine if one zip code is north of the other by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 29404 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 28602 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      North Carolina is positioned directly north of South Carolina on the US map.
      This is even reflected in their names (North vs. South Carolina).


      Step 3: Verify the specific zip codes.

      - 29404 is in the Charleston area of South Carolina (southern coastal region)

      - 28602 is in the Hickory area of North Carolina (western region)


      Step 4: Compare the locations.

      Since South Carolina is entirely south of North Carolina, and these specific
      zip codes follow the standard state orientation, 29404 in SC cannot be north
      of 28602 in NC.

      Given:

      - 29404, SC (South Carolina)

      - 28602, NC (North Carolina)


      First, let me recall the general geography of North Carolina and South Carolina.
      North Carolina is directly north of South Carolina.


      Generally speaking, zip codes in the US follow some patterns. The first digit
      indicates a broad geographical region, with lower numbers generally in the northeast
      and higher numbers in the west and south.


      The first digits here are:

      - 29404: Starts with 2, which covers mid-Atlantic states

      - 28602: Starts with 2, which also covers mid-Atlantic states


      Since both start with 2, they''re in the same general region. The second and
      third digits usually indicate more specific areas within that region.


      For these two zip codes:

      - 294xx is a South Carolina code

      - 286xx is a North Carolina code


      Since North Carolina is north of South Carolina, and these zip codes are in
      their respective states, 28602 (NC) would be north of 29404 (SC).


      To verify: the question asks if 29404 (SC) is north of 28602 (NC), which would
      be the opposite of what I just determined.</think># Determining if 29404, SC

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 29404 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 28602 is in North Carolina (NC)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states

      South Carolina is located directly south of North Carolina. This is a fundamental
      geographic fact about these two states - North Carolina borders South Carolina
      to the north.


      ## Step 3: Compare the locations

      Since 29404 is in South Carolina and 28602 is in North Carolina, and South Carolina
      is south of North Carolina, the zip code 29404 must be south of 28602, not north
      of it.

      First, let me identify what these zip codes represent:

      - 28401 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 17961 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to consider their latitudes.
      The higher the latitude, the further north a location is.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the northeastern part of the US

      - North Carolina (NC) is in the southeastern part of the US

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of North Carolina


      Since PA is north of NC, zip code 17961 in PA would likely be north of zip code
      28401 in NC.


      So the answer would be NO - 28401, NC is NOT located north of 17961, PA. Rather,
      it''s the opposite: 17961, PA is north of 28401, NC.</think>I need to determine

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 28401 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 17961 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes

      - Pennsylvania is generally positioned north of North Carolina on the US map

      - This means Pennsylvania has a higher latitude than North Carolina


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      - Since 17961 is in Pennsylvania, and 28401 is in North Carolina, the Pennsylvania
      zip code would be north of the North Carolina zip code


      NO - 28401, NC is not located north of 17961, PA. Rather, the Pennsylvania zip

      2. To determine this, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip
      codes.


      3. Zip code 10457 is in the Bronx, which is a borough of New York City in New
      York state. New York City is located in the southeastern part of New York state.


      4. Zip code 03784 is in New Hampshire. New Hampshire is a state in the northeastern

      19031 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      13224 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Let me think about the general geography of these states. New York is generally
      north of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania borders New York on its northern border.


      Let''s be more specific:

      - 19031 appears to be a zip code in Pennsylvania. Based on the first digits
      "19", this is likely in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, possibly near Philadelphia.

      - 13224 appears to be a zip code in New York. Based on the first digits "132",
      this is likely in central or upstate New York.


      Generally, New York zip codes starting with 13 tend to be in the central/northern
      parts of the state (Syracuse area), while Pennsylvania zip codes starting with
      19 tend to be in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Since New York is north of Pennsylvania, and these specific zip codes seem to
      follow the general pattern (not unusual border cases), 19031 PA would be south
      of 13224 NY, not north of it.</think>I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two zip codes to answer whether one is north of the other.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 19031 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 13224 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      New York state is generally positioned north of Pennsylvania, as Pennsylvania
      shares its northern border with New York.


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - 19031 (PA): Zip codes starting with "19" are typically in the southeastern
      region of Pennsylvania, in the greater Philadelphia area.

      - 13224 (NY): Zip codes starting with "132" are typically in the central New
      York region, around Syracuse.


      Step 4: Compare the north-south positions.

      Since central New York (including the Syracuse area) is definitely north of
      southeastern Pennsylvania (Philadelphia area), 19031 is south of 13224, not
      north of it.

      north of 13224, NY, I need to find the geographical locations of these zip codes
      and compare their latitudes. A location with a higher latitude is further north.


      Let me identify the locations:

      - 19031 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 13224 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Let me try to recall where these zip codes are located:


      19031, PA is likely in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania, possibly near
      Philadelphia, as lower zip codes in the Northeast tend to be in the more populated
      eastern regions.


      13224, NY is likely in upstate New York, as NY zip codes starting with 13xxx
      are typically in the central or northern parts of the state.


      Generally speaking, most of New York state is north of most of Pennsylvania.
      However, I need to be precise about these specific zip codes.


      19031, PA corresponds to Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, which is in Montgomery
      County, just north of Philadelphia.

      13224, NY corresponds to Syracuse, New York, which is in central New York state.


      Syracuse, NY is definitely north of Fort Washington, PA. So 13224, NY is north
      of 19031, PA, which means 19031, PA is NOT north of 13224, NY.</think># Is 19031,
      PA located north of 13224, NY?


      I need to determine the geographic locations of these zip codes and compare
      their latitudes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 19031 is a zip code in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania (in Montgomery County,
      near Philadelphia)

      - 13224 is a zip code in Syracuse, New York (in central New York state)


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographic positions

      - Pennsylvania is generally south of New York State

      - Fort Washington is in southeastern Pennsylvania

      - Syracuse is in central New York

      - Looking at their positions on a map, Syracuse, NY (13224) is clearly north
      of Fort Washington, PA (19031)


      ## Step 3: Conclusion

      Since Syracuse, NY (13224) is north of Fort Washington, PA (19031), it follows
      that 19031 is NOT north of 13224.

      1. The first location is 19362, which is in Pennsylvania (PA).

      2. The second location is 12009, which is in New York (NY).


      I need to determine their relative geographical positions to see if 19362, PA
      is north of 12009, NY.


      Broadly speaking, New York state is generally north of Pennsylvania. However,
      zip codes can be in different parts of each state, so I need to be more specific.


      New York zip codes generally start with 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.

      Pennsylvania zip codes generally start with 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19.


      12009 is a zip code in New York. Since it starts with 12, it''s likely in the
      eastern part of New York state.

      19362 is a zip code in Pennsylvania. Since it starts with 19, it''s likely in
      the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Given that New York is north of Pennsylvania, and considering the specific zip
      code ranges, it''s most likely that 12009, NY is north of 19362, PA, not the

      ## Step 2: Consider state geography

      New York is generally located north of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States.


      ## Step 3: Analyze specific zip code regions

      - NY zip codes beginning with 12 typically cover the eastern part of New York
      state (including areas like the Capital Region)

      - PA zip codes beginning with 19 typically cover the southeastern part of Pennsylvania
      (including areas near Philadelphia)


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      Even though these are specific zip codes that could potentially be in unusual

    b9e126a1-59ad-4eac-8f46-6a739c6c7918: '<think>Let me think about this question
      step by step.


      1. The question is asking whether the zip code 19362 in Pennsylvania (PA) is
      located north of zip code 12009 in New York (NY).


      2. To determine this, I need to know the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      3. Generally speaking, New York state is north of Pennsylvania. NY borders PA
      to the north.


      4. Zip codes in the US are somewhat organized geographically, with lower numbers
      often being in the northeast and higher numbers in the west and south. However,
      within states, this pattern doesn''t necessarily hold.


      5. Zip code 19362 is in PA. Looking at PA zip codes, the 193xx range is likely
      in southeastern Pennsylvania.


      6. Zip code 12009 is in NY. The 120xx range is likely in eastern/northeastern
      New York.


      7. Given that NY is generally north of PA, and these zip codes appear to be
      in the eastern portions of their respective states, it''s very likely that 12009,
      NY is north of 19362, PA.</think>I need to determine the relative locations
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 19362 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 12009 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - New York state is located north of Pennsylvania

      - PA shares its northern border with NY''s southern border


      Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes.

      - The 193xx range in Pennsylvania typically refers to areas in southeastern
      PA

      - The 120xx range in New York typically refers to areas in eastern NY (around
      the Capital Region/Albany area)


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Even the northernmost parts of Pennsylvania lie south of the Capital Region
      of New York

      - 12009 (in NY) is therefore almost certainly north of 19362 (in PA)


      NO - 19362, PA is not located north of 12009, NY. It''s the opposite: 12009,

      zip code 19362 in Pennsylvania is located north of the zip code 12009 in New
      York.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Find the geographical locations (latitude/longitude) of both zip codes

      2. Compare their latitudes - a higher latitude means further north


      Let me think about what I know about US zip codes:

      - Generally, the first digit of a zip code indicates a broad geographical region

      - 0 and 1 are for the Northeast

      - 2 and 3 are for the South/Mid-Atlantic

      - 4 and 5 are for the Midwest

      - etc.


      So 12009 (starting with 1) is in New York, which is in the Northeast.

      19362 (starting with 1) is in Pennsylvania, which is also in the Northeast,
      but generally Pennsylvania is south of New York state.


      Without specific latitude data, I can make an educated assessment:

      New York state is generally north of Pennsylvania. The zip code 12009 in NY
      is likely north of 19362 in PA.</think># Is 19362, PA located north of 12009,

      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 19362 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 12009 is in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of these states

      New York state is generally positioned north of Pennsylvania in the United States.
      Pennsylvania shares its northern border with New York.


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      - ZIP codes beginning with "193" are typically in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - ZIP codes beginning with "120" are generally in the eastern part of New York


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      Since New York is positioned above Pennsylvania on the map, and there''s nothing
      to suggest these particular zip codes would be exceptions to the general geographic
      relationship between the states, the zip code in New York (12009) would be north
      of the zip code in Pennsylvania (19362).


      NO, 19362, PA is not located north of 12009, NY. It is located south of it.'

      First, let me think about the geographical relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.
      Generally, Oklahoma is located directly north of Texas. This would suggest that
      most places in Oklahoma are north of places in Texas.


      However, the question is about specific ZIP codes, so I need to check the specific
      locations.


      77044 is a ZIP code in Texas. Based on my knowledge, ZIP codes in the 770xx

      2. Compare their latitudes (a location with a higher latitude is further north)


      Let me think about what I know about US geography and zip codes:


      - Oklahoma (OK) is generally north of Texas (TX), as OK borders TX on TX''s

      77044 would be in the Houston area of Texas, which is in the southeastern part
      of Texas.

      73020 would be somewhere in central Oklahoma.

      ## Step 2: Examine the specific zip code locations

      - 77044 is in the Houston area in southeastern Texas

      - 73020 is in central Oklahoma (near Oklahoma City)

      1. 77044, TX (Texas)

      2. 73020, OK (Oklahoma)


      To determine if one is north of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.
      Let me reason about this geographically:


      Oklahoma is generally north of Texas, as it''s a state that borders Texas on
      its northern side.


      The zip code 73020 appears to be in Oklahoma (OK), while 77044 is in Texas (TX).


      Given that Oklahoma is north of Texas, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, the general expectation would be that the Oklahoma zip code (73020)
      is north of the Texas zip code (77044).


      So 77044, TX would NOT be north of 73020, OK - it would be south of it.


      However, I should be cautious because zip codes don''t always perfectly follow
      state boundaries, and there could be exceptions in border areas. But in this
      case, the zip codes are not border codes - 77044 is likely in the Houston area
      (based on the "770xx" prefix which is used in that region), and 73020 is likely
      in central Oklahoma.</think>To answer whether 77044, TX is located north of
      73020, OK, I need to examine the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 77044 is a zip code in Texas, specifically in the Houston area in the southeastern
      part of the state.

      - 73020 is a zip code in Oklahoma, likely in the central part of the state.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma is positioned directly north of Texas.

      - Houston is located in the southeastern part of Texas, which is quite far from
      the Oklahoma border.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and 73020 is in Oklahoma while 77044 is
      in the Houston area of Texas, the Oklahoma zip code must be north of the Texas
      zip code.

      I need to determine if the location with zip code 95425 in California is north
      of the location with zip code 97236 in Oregon.


      First, let''s remember the general geography of the US West Coast. California
      is south of Oregon. So generally speaking, locations in California are south
      of locations in Oregon.


      However, California is a long state that extends quite far north, and it''s
      possible that northern parts of California could be north of southern parts
      of Oregon. So I need to check more specifically.


      Let me think about zip code patterns. In the US postal system, zip codes generally
      follow geographical patterns, with lower numbers in the east/northeast and higher
      numbers in the west/southwest. However, within states, the patterns can vary.


      Given that the zip code for CA (95425) is lower than the zip code for OR (97236),
      and considering that Oregon is generally north of California, the lower zip
      code in California is likely to be south of the higher zip code in Oregon.

      Since 95425 is in California (CA) and 97236 is in Oregon (OR), the typical geographic

      Let me think more specifically about these zip codes:

      - California zip codes generally start with 9

      - Oregon zip codes also start with 9


      The specific pattern is that northern California zip codes are often in the
      95xxx-96xxx range, while Oregon zip codes are typically in the 97xxx range.


      Given that 95425 is in the range typical for northern California, and 97236

      to determine if the zip code 95425 in California is located north of the zip
      code 97236 in Oregon.


      First, I''ll recall the geographic relationship between California and Oregon.
      Oregon is located directly north of California along the west coast of the United
      States.


      Since 95425 is in California and 97236 is in Oregon, the general geographic
      relationship would suggest that 95425 would be south of 97236, not north of
      it.


      However, I should be careful because zip codes don''t always follow a perfect
      north-to-south numbering system. Let me think about what I know about zip code
      numbering:


      The first digit of a zip code generally indicates a geographic region of the
      US, with lower numbers in the east and higher numbers in the west.

      The second and third digits generally identify sectional centers or large cities.


      Both 95425 and 97236 start with 9, which indicates they''re both in the western
      region of the US.


      95xxx zip codes are typically in California

      97xxx zip codes are typically in Oregon


      Given that Oregon is north of California, and these zip codes follow the standard
      pattern, it''s very likely that 95425, CA is south of 97236, OR, not north of
      it.</think>I need to determine if 95425, CA is north of 97236, OR by analyzing
      their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 95425 is in California (CA)

      - 97236 is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California along the west coast of the
      United States.


      Step 3: Consider zip code numbering patterns.

      - Both zip codes start with 9, placing them in the western United States.

      - 95xxx zip codes are typically assigned to California regions

      - 97xxx zip codes are typically assigned to Oregon regions


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      - Since Oregon is north of California, and these zip codes follow standard state
      assignments, 95425 in California would be south of 97236 in Oregon.

      Let me identify these locations:


      15137 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      14204 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      For 15137, PA:

      This appears to be in the Pittsburgh area of western Pennsylvania.


      For 14204, NY:

      This appears to be in the Buffalo area of western New York.


      Generally speaking, Buffalo, NY is north of Pittsburgh, PA. New York state is
      generally north of Pennsylvania, especially when comparing western NY to western
      PA.


      Buffalo is near the US-Canada border, while Pittsburgh is further south within
      Pennsylvania.


      So based on general geographic knowledge, 14204, NY (Buffalo area) should be
      north of 15137, PA (Pittsburgh area).

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these locations.

      - 15137, PA is in the Pittsburgh area in western Pennsylvania

      - 14204, NY is in the Buffalo area in western New York


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Buffalo, NY is located near the US-Canada border in the northern part of New
      York state

      - Pittsburgh, PA is located in the western part of Pennsylvania, south of Lake
      Erie

      - New York state, particularly the Buffalo region, is generally north of western

      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Buffalo (14204, NY) is further north than Pittsburgh (15137, PA)

      - Therefore, 15137, PA is NOT north of 14204, NY; it''s the other way around

      I need to determine which one is farther north. To do this, I''ll need to identify
      where these zip codes are located.


      Pennsylvania is generally south of New York state, but there are parts of Pennsylvania
      that could be north of parts of New York, especially since NY extends far south
      in the western part of the state.


      Zip code 15137 is in Pennsylvania, likely in the western part of the state near

      - The Mon Valley area near Pittsburgh (15137) is in southwestern Pennsylvania.

      - Western New York (including Buffalo) is north of western Pennsylvania.

      97227, OR - This is a zip code in Oregon (OR)

      98229, WA - This is a zip code in Washington (WA)


      The question asks if 97227 (in OR) is north of 98229 (in WA).


      First, let''s consider the general geography of Oregon and Washington states:

      - Washington state is located north of Oregon state in the United States.

      - Oregon is south of Washington.


      Given this general geography, we would expect that:

      - Zip codes in Oregon (like 97227) are generally south of zip codes in Washington
      (like 98229)

      - NOT north of them


      Without specific knowledge of these exact zip codes, the general state relationship
      tells us that an Oregon zip code would not be north of a Washington zip code.


      Therefore, 97227, OR is likely NOT north of 98229, WA.</think># Is 97227, OR
      located north of 98229, WA?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: 97227 is in Oregon (OR) and 98229 is
      in Washington (WA).


      2) Looking at the geography of the US, Washington state is positioned directly
      north of Oregon state.


      3) Generally, US zip codes increase as you go from north to south along the
      east coast, but on the west coast (where OR and WA are located), zip codes generally
      increase as you go from north to south.


      4) The zip code 97227 (OR) has a lower number than 98229 (WA), which actually
      follows the pattern - lower zip codes in the more southern state (Oregon).


      5) Since Oregon is south of Washington, a zip code in Oregon (97227) cannot
      be north of a zip code in Washington (98229).


      NO'

      north of 98229, WA, I need to compare the geographic locations of these two

      First, let''s identify what states these zip codes are in:

      - 97227 is in Oregon (OR)

      - 98229 is in Washington (WA)


      Generally speaking, Washington state is located north of Oregon state, as Washington
      borders Canada to the north, and Oregon is south of Washington.


      Since 97227 is in Oregon and 98229 is in Washington, the general expectation
      would be that 97227 is south of 98229, not north of it.


      However, I should verify this by considering the specific locations of these
      zip codes:


      97227 appears to be in Portland, Oregon, which is in the northern part of Oregon,
      near the Washington border.

      98229 appears to be in Bellingham, Washington, which is in the northwestern
      part of Washington, close to the Canadian border.


      Bellingham, WA is significantly further north than Portland, OR.</think>I need
      to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 97227 is in Oregon (OR)

      - 98229 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Washington state is positioned directly north of Oregon state on the US west
      coast.


      Step 3: Check the specific locations.

      - 97227 is in Portland, Oregon, which is in the northern part of Oregon

      - 98229 is in Bellingham, Washington, which is in the northern part of Washington,
      near the Canadian border


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Even though 97227 (Portland) is in northern Oregon, Washington state is entirely
      north of Oregon. Bellingham (98229) is also in the northern part of Washington,
      making it significantly further north than any location in Oregon.

      First, I''ll consider the general geography of the US states:

      - Washington (WA) is the northernmost state of the contiguous United States,
      bordering Canada

      - Oregon (OR) is directly south of Washington


      So generally speaking, locations in Washington tend to be north of locations
      in Oregon. This would suggest that 97227, OR would be south of 98229, WA.


      However, I should also consider the specific zip codes. In the US zip code system:

      - The first digit generally indicates a broad geographic region (0-9 from east
      to west)

      - The first three digits more specifically identify a sectional center facility

      - The full five digits identify a specific delivery area

      The second and third digits (72 for Oregon and 82 for Washington) generally

      3) Since 97227 is in Oregon and 98229 is in Washington, the Oregon zip code

      and their states.


      First, let''s consider the states:

      - OR (Oregon) is south of WA (Washington)

      - Washington state is directly north of Oregon


      In general, zip codes in the United States increase as you go from east to west,
      and they also tend to increase as you go from north to south. However, the first
      digit of the zip code tends to be more indicative of the general region.


      For these specific zip codes:

      - 97227 (Oregon): Starts with 9, which is the West Coast region

      - 98229 (Washington): Also starts with 9, which is the West Coast region


      Since both zip codes start with 9, they''re both in the West Coast region. But
      98xxx is higher than 97xxx, which typically means 98xxx would be further north.


      In this case, 97227 is in Oregon while 98229 is in Washington. Since Washington
      is north of Oregon, and the zip code pattern (98xxx vs 97xxx) is consistent

      1) First, I need to identify the states: 97227 is in Oregon (OR) and 98229 is
      in Washington (WA).


      2) Geographically, Washington state is located directly north of Oregon state
      on the west coast of the US.


      3) Looking at the zip codes themselves, Washington zip codes typically start

      4) The higher first digit in Washington''s zip codes (98xxx vs 97xxx) reflects

      1. NE stands for Nebraska, which is a state in the central United States

      - 68506 is in NE (Nebraska)

      - 58401 is in ND (North Dakota)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      North Dakota (ND) is located along the northern border of the United States,
      sharing a border with Canada.

      Nebraska (NE) is located south of North Dakota in the central United States.


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      to determine the relative geographic positions of two ZIP codes:

      1. 68506, NE (Nebraska)

      2. 58401, ND (North Dakota)


      I need to determine if the Nebraska ZIP code is north of the North Dakota ZIP
      code.


      First, let''s consider the states themselves. North Dakota is generally north
      of Nebraska in the United States. North Dakota borders Canada to the north,
      while Nebraska is several states south of the Canadian border.


      Looking at the ZIP codes:

      - ZIP codes in North Dakota typically start with 58xxx

      - ZIP codes in Nebraska typically start with 68xxx-69xxx


      Given the geography of the United States, North Dakota is north of Nebraska.
      Therefore, a ZIP code in Nebraska (68506, NE) cannot be north of a ZIP code
      in North Dakota (58401, ND).


      So the Nebraska ZIP code (68506) is south of the North Dakota ZIP code (58401),
      not north of it.</think># Determining if 68506, NE is north of 58401, ND


      I need to analyze the geographic locations of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 68506 is in Nebraska (NE)

      - 58401 is in North Dakota (ND)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states

      North Dakota is positioned along the northern border of the United States (adjacent
      to Canada), while Nebraska is located several states south of North Dakota.


      ## Step 3: Verify relative positions

      On a US map, North Dakota is clearly north of Nebraska. All locations in North
      Dakota (including ZIP code 58401) would be north of locations in Nebraska (including
      ZIP code 68506).


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 68506, NE is not located north of 58401, ND. It is actually located south
      of it.'

      - 68506, NE refers to a zip code in Nebraska (NE)

      - 58401, ND refers to a zip code in North Dakota (ND)


      The question asks if the Nebraska zip code is north of the North Dakota zip
      code.


      Let''s think about the geographical locations of these states. North Dakota
      is a northern state that borders Canada. Nebraska is located south of North
      Dakota.


      Since Nebraska is south of North Dakota, a zip code in Nebraska (68506, NE)
      would be south of a zip code in North Dakota (58401, ND), not north of it.


      So the answer would be NO - 68506, NE is not located north of 58401, ND. It''s
      located south of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the
      geographical relationship between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 68506 is in Nebraska (NE)

      - 58401 is in North Dakota (ND)


      Step 2: Recall the geographical positions of these states.

      North Dakota is a northern border state that sits along the Canadian border.
      Nebraska is located south of North Dakota.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Nebraska is positioned south of North Dakota on a map of the United States,
      any location in Nebraska would be south of (not north of) a location in North
      Dakota.


      NO'

      step:


      1. I need to determine if zip code 68506, NE (Nebraska) is north of zip code
      58401, ND (North Dakota).


      2. To determine this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these
      locations.


      3. In the US, states that are further north generally have higher latitudes.


      4. North Dakota (ND) is a northern border state that touches Canada, while Nebraska
      (NE) is south of North Dakota.


      5. In terms of general state geography, North Dakota is north of Nebraska.


      6. Since these zip codes are in their respective states (68506 in Nebraska and
      58401 in North Dakota), and North Dakota is north of Nebraska, it''s very likely
      that 58401, ND is north of 68506, NE.


      So, 68506, NE would NOT be north of 58401, ND. It would be south of it.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these two

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      North Dakota is located along the northern US border with Canada, while Nebraska
      is situated south of North Dakota.


      Step 3: Compare relative positions.

      Since North Dakota is entirely north of Nebraska in terms of latitude, any location
      in North Dakota (including 58401) would be north of any location in Nebraska
      (including 68506).

      is located north of 58401, ND (North Dakota), I need to understand the relative
      geographical positions of these states and locations.


      Generally in US geography:

      - North Dakota (ND) is a northern border state, touching Canada

      - Nebraska (NE) is south of North Dakota


      Looking at their relative positions on a mental map of the US:

      - North Dakota is positioned near the northern border of the contiguous United
      States

      - Nebraska is positioned in the central part of the country, south of North
      Dakota


      Since the zip codes don''t change the states they''re in:

      - 58401, ND is in North Dakota

      - 68506, NE is in Nebraska


      Given that North Dakota is north of Nebraska, any location in North Dakota would
      be north of any location in Nebraska. Therefore, 58401, ND would be north of
      68506, NE.


      So the question asks if 68506, NE is north of 58401, ND. The answer would be
      NO, because Nebraska is south of North Dakota, not north of it.</think># Is
      68506, NE located north of 58401, ND?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these zip codes by identifying
      their states and geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 68506, NE is in Nebraska

      - 58401, ND is in North Dakota


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      - North Dakota is a northern border state that touches Canada

      - Nebraska is located in the central United States

      - North Dakota is positioned north of Nebraska on the map


      Step 3: Apply this state relationship to the specific zip codes

      - Since 58401 is in North Dakota (a northern state)

      - And 68506 is in Nebraska (a state south of North Dakota)

      - The Nebraska zip code must be south of the North Dakota zip code


      Therefore, 68506, NE is NOT located north of 58401, ND. It is located south

      68506 in Nebraska (NE) is north of zip code 58401 in North Dakota (ND).


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these states
      and zip codes:


      1. North Dakota (ND) is a northern state that borders Canada

      2. Nebraska (NE) is south of North Dakota


      Looking at their positions, North Dakota is clearly north of Nebraska on a US
      map. So any location in North Dakota would generally be north of any location
      in Nebraska.


      Since 58401 is in North Dakota and 68506 is in Nebraska, the North Dakota zip
      code (58401) must be north of the Nebraska zip code (68506), not the other way
      around.

      North Dakota is positioned along the northern border of the United States (bordering
      Canada), while Nebraska is located in the central United States, south of North
      Dakota.


      Step 3: Compare relative positions.

      Since North Dakota is entirely north of Nebraska on the map, any location in
      North Dakota (including zip code 58401) would be north of any location in Nebraska
      (including zip code 68506).


      NO. 68506, NE is not located north of 58401, ND. Rather, it''s the opposite

      Specifically, I need to determine if 68506, NE is located north of 58401, ND.


      Step 1: Let me consider the states first. NE is Nebraska, and ND is North Dakota.
      Geographically, North Dakota is located north of Nebraska in the United States.


      Step 2: Now, I need to think about the specific zip codes within these states.
      US zip codes generally follow geographic patterns, with lower numbers in the
      northeast and numbers increasing as you go south and west. But within a state,
      the pattern can vary.


      Step 3: The zip code for Nebraska (68506) is higher than the zip code for North
      Dakota (58401), but that doesn''t necessarily tell us about north-south positioning
      directly.


      Step 4: Since North Dakota as a state is entirely north of Nebraska as a state,
      any location in North Dakota must be north of any location in Nebraska.


      Therefore, 68506, NE (in Nebraska) is NOT north of 58401, ND (in North Dakota).
      In fact, it''s the opposite - the North Dakota location is north of the Nebraska

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      North Dakota is located along the northern border of the United States (bordering
      Canada), while Nebraska is several states south of the Canadian border.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      North Dakota is entirely north of Nebraska on the map of the United States.
      The entire state of North Dakota is at a higher latitude than the entire state
      of Nebraska.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes

      The location with the higher latitude is further north.


      I need to first identify what states these ZIP codes are in:

      - 68506, NE: This is in Nebraska (NE)

      - 58401, ND: This is in North Dakota (ND)


      Geographically, North Dakota is located north of Nebraska. North Dakota borders
