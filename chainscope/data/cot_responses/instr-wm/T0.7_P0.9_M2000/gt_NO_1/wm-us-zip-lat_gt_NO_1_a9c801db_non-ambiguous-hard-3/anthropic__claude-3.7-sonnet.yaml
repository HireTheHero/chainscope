      in Virginia is located north of the zip code 07852 in New Jersey.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 22134 is in Quantico, Virginia

      - 07852 is in Long Valley, New Jersey


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Virginia and New Jersey.

      - Virginia is a state in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, south
      of Maryland and Washington D.C.

      - New Jersey is a state in the northeastern United States, east of Pennsylvania
      and north of Delaware and Maryland.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positions).

      - New Jersey is generally north of Virginia.

      - Specifically, Quantico, VA (22134) is in northern Virginia, but still south
      of most of New Jersey.

      - Long Valley, NJ (07852) is in the northern part of New Jersey.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on their relative positions.

      - Since New Jersey is north of Virginia, and these specific locations follow
      that general pattern, 22134 (Quantico, VA) is south of 07852 (Long Valley, NJ).

      - Therefore, 22134, VA is NOT located north of 07852, NJ.

      Step 1: Let me consider the geographic locations of Kentucky and Indiana. Indiana
      is generally located north of Kentucky, as Kentucky borders Indiana along Indiana''s
      southern border.


      Step 2: Looking at zip codes specifically, the first digits of zip codes in
      the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the northeast/east,
      and numbers increase as you move west and south. However, this isn''t precise
      enough for comparing specific locations.


      Step 3: More specifically, zip codes beginning with 42 are in southern Kentucky,
      while zip codes beginning with 46 are in northern Indiana.


      Step 4: Since 42141 is in Kentucky (which is south of Indiana), and 46565 is
      in Indiana (which is north of Kentucky), 42141 KY must be south of 46565 IN.

      WV, 4 for northern/northeastern Ohio)

      - Within these regions, the second digit typically indicates north-south positioning,
      with higher numbers generally being further north.


      Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes.

      - 25601 (WV) begins with "2", placing it in the mid-Atlantic region

      - 44094 (OH) begins with "4", placing it in the northern Ohio region

      - Ohio is generally north of West Virginia

      - The "4" first digit in 44094 indicates a more northern position than the "2"
      first digit in 25601


      Step 4: Conclusion based on the zip code system.

      - ZIP codes in the 440xx range are in northeastern Ohio, specifically near Lake
      Erie

      - ZIP codes in the 256xx range are in southern West Virginia

      - Ohio''s northern regions (especially near Lake Erie) are significantly north
      of West Virginia


      NO, 25601, WV is not located north of 44094, OH. The Ohio zip code is further
      north.'

      - Ohio is generally north of North Carolina

      - Specifically, Ohio is positioned above North Carolina on a map of the United
      States


      Step 4: Since zip codes within each state maintain the general north-south relationship
      between the states, a zip code in North Carolina (28216) would be south of a
      zip code in Ohio (43950).

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Illinois and Wisconsin.

      - Wisconsin (WI) is located north of Illinois (IL)

      - Illinois is south of Wisconsin


      Step 3: Since these states border each other, a zip code in Illinois (60651)
      would generally be south of a zip code in Wisconsin (54180).


      Step 4: Even if 60651 is in northern Illinois and 54180 is in southern Wisconsin,
      the geographical relationship would still hold because Wisconsin is entirely
      north of Illinois.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Virginia is generally north of North Carolina, as it borders North Carolina''s
      northern edge. This gives us an initial expectation, but we need to check the
      specific zip codes.

      - 27896 appears to be in the northeastern part of North Carolina (likely near
      Rocky Mount)

      - 27896 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 24482 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between North Carolina and Virginia.

      - Virginia is located directly north of North Carolina along the eastern seaboard
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the general location based on zip codes.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to be in
      the northeastern US and higher numbers toward the southwest.

      - The zip code 24482 (VA) has a lower number than 27896 (NC), which aligns with
      the general north-to-south pattern.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state boundaries.

      - Since Virginia is north of North Carolina, and these zip codes are in their

      Step 2: Since 27896 is in NC and 24482 is in VA, and Virginia is generally north
      of North Carolina, it would be unusual for a location in NC to be north of a
      location in VA.


      Step 3: Zip codes in the US are generally organized regionally, with similar
      first digits often representing broader regions. The zip code 27896 (NC) starts
      with "2" as does 24482 (VA), indicating they''re both in the eastern region,
      but the "7" in 27896 versus the "4" in 24482 suggests different areas within
      that region.


      Step 4: The higher first digit in the NC zip code (27xxx vs 24xxx) typically

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 85614 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 87301 is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Arizona is generally west of New Mexico, as they share a border with Arizona
      to the west and New Mexico to the east.

      - However, the question asks about north/south positioning, not east/west.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code numbering system.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west and
      from south to north.

      - 85614 (AZ) has a lower number than 87301 (NM).

      - This suggests 85614 is likely south of 87301, as the higher number (87301)
      indicates a more northern location.


      Step 4: Verify with geographical knowledge.

      - Northern New Mexico is indeed north of southern Arizona.

      - 85614 is in southern Arizona (Green Valley area).

      - 87301 is in northwestern New Mexico (Gallup area).

      Alabama (AL) is located north of zip code 40108 in Kentucky (KY).


      Step 1: Let me think about the general geographic relationship between Alabama
      and Kentucky. Kentucky is generally north of Alabama in the United States.


      Step 2: Looking at the zip codes themselves, I notice that 35951 is in the 3xxxx
      range, while 40108 is in the 4xxxx range. In the US zip code system, lower numbers
      tend to be in the southern and eastern parts of the country, while higher numbers
      tend to be in the northern and western parts.


      Step 3: The zip code 35951 is in Alabama, which is a state located in the southeastern
      United States. Kentucky (40108) is located north of Alabama.


      Step 4: Since 35951 is in Alabama and 40108 is in Kentucky, and Kentucky is
      north of Alabama, it follows that 35951, AL is south of 40108, KY (not north).


      NO, 35951, AL is not located north of 40108, KY.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 35951, AL is a zip code in Alabama

      - 40108, KY is a zip code in Kentucky


      Step 2: Consider the general geographical relationship between Alabama and Kentucky.

      Alabama is located south of Kentucky in the United States. Kentucky borders
      the northern part of Alabama.


      Step 3: Check if there are any unusual geographical arrangements to consider.

      While specific zip codes might have unusual arrangements, the zip code numbers
      generally follow patterns where lower numbers tend to be in the southeastern
      US and higher numbers in the northwestern parts.


      Step 4: Compare the zip codes.

      35951 is a lower number than 40108, which is consistent with Alabama (35xxx)
      being south of Kentucky (40xxx).


      Step 5: Make the north-south determination.

      Since Alabama is south of Kentucky, and these zip codes follow the standard
      numbering pattern, 35951, AL would be south of 40108, KY, not north of it.

      Step 3: Think about relative positions.

      Generally speaking, Kentucky (which is entirely north of Alabama) would have
      zip codes at higher latitudes than Alabama zip codes.


      Step 4: The specific zip codes follow this general pattern.

      - 35951 is in northern Alabama

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States, north of Georgia


      Step 3: U.S. zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to

      - In the US, states further north generally have higher latitudes


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes are generally organized by region, with lower numbers in the
      northeast and higher numbers as you move south and west

      - The first digit "3" in 31206 indicates a southeastern region (Georgia)

      - The first digit "4" in 40422 indicates a region north of the "3" region (Kentucky)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the state locations.

      - Since Kentucky is north of Georgia, and the zip codes follow the expected
      pattern (4-series for KY, 3-series for GA), the zip code 40422 in Kentucky must
      be north of zip code 31206 in Georgia.

      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) I need to determine the geographical locations of these two ZIP codes.


      2) 22406 is in Fredericksburg, Virginia (VA).


      3) 18210 is in Bowmanstown, Pennsylvania (PA).


      4) Pennsylvania is a state that borders Virginia to the north.


      5) Generally speaking, Pennsylvania ZIP codes are north of Virginia ZIP codes
      because Pennsylvania is north of Virginia.


      6) Since 22406 is in Virginia and 18210 is in Pennsylvania, the Virginia ZIP
      code (22406) would be south of the Pennsylvania ZIP code (18210).


      7) Therefore, 22406, VA is not located north of 18210, PA. It is located south

      north of locations in Virginia

      - 18210 is in Pennsylvania, which means it''s likely north of any location in
      Virginia


      Step 4: Verify the specific locations.

      - Fredericksburg, VA (22406) is in northern Virginia

      - Bowmanstown, PA (18210) is in eastern Pennsylvania

      - Even though Fredericksburg is in northern Virginia, Pennsylvania''s southern

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 29033 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 24179 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern coast of the US, north of South Carolina.

      - South Carolina is located on the eastern coast, south of Virginia.


      Step 3: Even without knowing the exact locations of these specific zip codes,
      I can determine their relative north-south positions based on state geography.

      - Since Virginia is entirely north of South Carolina, any location in Virginia
      (including 24179) would be north of any location in South Carolina (including
      29033).

      - 29033 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 24179 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states

      - Virginia is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States

      - South Carolina is located in the Southeastern United States

      - Generally, Virginia is north of South Carolina


      Step 3: Verify with zip code geography

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers in the first digit
      are in the northeast/east, and higher numbers trend south and west

      - 24xxx (Virginia) starts with a lower number than 29xxx (South Carolina)

      - This confirms the general north-south relationship between these states


      Step 4: Make the conclusion

      - Since Virginia is north of South Carolina, and the zip codes align with this
      geographic pattern, 29033, SC would be south of 24179, VA (not north of it)

      North Carolina is generally north of Florida on the US east coast.


      Step 3: Check if this general state relationship applies to these specific zip
      codes.

      Florida zip codes typically start with 32-34, and this one (32092) is in the
      standard Florida range.

      North Carolina zip codes typically start with 27-28, and this one (27408) is
      in the standard North Carolina range.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since North Carolina is north of Florida, and these zip codes are in their respective
      standard ranges for those states, zip code 32092 in Florida would be south of
      zip code 27408 in North Carolina.

      - Florida''s northernmost regions are still south of North Carolina''s southernmost
      regions.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on state positions.

      - Since 32092 is in Florida, and 27408 is in North Carolina, and Florida is

      - 24523 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 15683 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Virginia and Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia in the United States.

      - Virginia borders Pennsylvania to the south.


      Step 3: While specific zip codes within states could potentially be exceptions
      to the general state positioning (for example, if comparing a northern Virginia
      zip code to a southern Pennsylvania zip code), the general rule is that Pennsylvania
      locations are north of Virginia locations.


      Step 4: Since 15683 is in Pennsylvania and 24523 is in Virginia, and Pennsylvania

      this pattern often means that higher zip code numbers are further south.


      Step 4: Compare the zip codes.

      29404 (SC) has a higher number than 28602 (NC), which is consistent with the

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 29404 is a ZIP code in South Carolina (SC)

      - 28602 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the two states.

      - North Carolina is generally located north of South Carolina (as suggested
      by their names - North Carolina vs South Carolina)


      Step 3: Analyze the ZIP code patterns.

      - In the US postal system, ZIP codes generally follow geographic patterns

      - Lower ZIP code numbers in the same region typically indicate more northern
      locations

      - 28602 (in NC) has a lower number than 29404 (in SC)

      - This aligns with the general north-south arrangement of the two states


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these facts.

      - Since 28602 is in North Carolina with a lower ZIP code number, it is likely
      north of 29404 in South Carolina


      NO, 29404, SC is not located north of 28602, NC. The location in North Carolina

      north of 97236, OR. Let me think step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 95425 is in California (CA)

      - 97236 is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between California and
      Oregon.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally (but not always) increase from
      east to west and south to north.

      - The first digit represents a general region (9 is for the west coast).

      - The first three digits represent a more specific area within that region.


      Step 4: Compare the zip codes.

      - 95425 (CA) starts with 954, which is a lower number than 972 from 97236 (OR).

      - This generally suggests that 95425 is south of 97236, which aligns with California
      being south of Oregon.


      Based on this reasoning, 95425, CA is not north of 97236, OR. It is south of
      it.

      - 95425 is in California (CA)

      - 97236 is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between California and Oregon.

      Oregon is located directly north of California along the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase as you move from east
      to west and from south to north. However, there are many exceptions to this
      pattern, so I shouldn''t rely solely on comparing the numeric values.


      Step 4: Look at the specific zip codes.

      - 95425 is in California

      - 97236 is in Oregon


      Since Oregon is north of California, and these zip codes follow the standard
      pattern (97xxx for Oregon is higher than 95xxx for California), the Oregon zip
      code (97236) is likely north of the California zip code (95425).


      Therefore, 95425, CA is NOT located north of 97236, OR. The opposite is true
      - 97236, OR is north of 95425, CA.

      - 95425 is in California (CA)

      - 97236 is in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between California and
      Oregon.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California along the west coast of the
      United States.


      Step 3: Examine the zip code patterns.

      - Generally, zip codes in the US increase as you move from east to west and
      from south to north.

      - Oregon zip codes typically start with 97xxx, while Northern California zip
      codes often start with 95xxx or 96xxx.

      - The lower number (95425) suggests a more southern location than the higher
      number (97236).


      Step 4: Based on the state locations and zip code patterns:

      - 95425 is in California, which is south of Oregon

      - 97236 is in Oregon, which is north of California

      - The zip code numbering pattern also supports this north-south relationship

      - 97236 is a zip code in Oregon (OR)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of CA and OR.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Generally, locations in Oregon are north of locations in California.


      Step 3: Consider zip code numbering patterns.

      - In the U.S. postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west
      and from south to north.

      - The first digit of zip codes increases from east to west (0 in the northeast
      to 9 in the west).

      - Within the same first digit region, the second and third digits often increase
      from south to north.

      - 95xxx is a Northern California prefix

      - 97xxx is an Oregon prefix


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Oregon is north of California, and the zip code patterns follow this
      general north-south pattern, a zip code in Oregon (97236) would typically be
      north of a zip code in California (95425).

      6) Oregon zip codes also begin with 9, typically 97xxx

      7) The higher prefix (97xxx vs 95xxx) generally indicates that 97236 is farther

      8) 95425 is in northern California (Cloverdale area)

      9) 97236 is in the Portland area of Oregon

      10) Portland is significantly north of even the northernmost parts of California

      - 95425 (CA) starts with 954xx

      - 97236 (OR) starts with 972xx

      - Since 954xx is a lower number than 972xx, and California is south of Oregon,

      Step 1: Let me consider the geographical relationship between Oregon and Washington
      states. Washington state is located directly north of Oregon along the west
      coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Since 97227 is in Oregon (OR) and 98229 is in Washington (WA), the general
      expectation would be that the Oregon zip code would be south of the Washington
      zip code, not north of it.


      Step 3: Zip codes in the US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend
      to be in the eastern and southern parts of the country, while higher numbers
      tend to be in the western and northern parts. The first three digits of these
      zip codes (972 vs 982) support the standard geographical relationship between
      Oregon and Washington.


      Step 4: 97227 is in Portland, Oregon, which is in the northern part of Oregon
      near the Washington border, while 98229 is in Bellingham, Washington, which
      is in the northwestern part of Washington, not far from the Canadian border.

      is located north of 98229, WA (Washington).


      Step 1: Let me recall the general geographic relationship between Oregon and
      Washington states.

      Washington state is located directly north of Oregon state along the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase as you move from east
      to west and from north to south, but there are many exceptions to this pattern.


      Step 3: Compare the zip codes.

      97227 is in Oregon

      98229 is in Washington


      Step 4: Since Washington is north of Oregon, and these zip codes follow the
      standard state boundaries, a zip code in Oregon (97227) cannot be north of a

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 97227 is in Oregon (OR)

      - 98229 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Washington is located north of Oregon along the west coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code patterns.

      In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west and
      from south to north. The first three digits of zip codes typically represent
      larger regions.

      - 972xx (Oregon) is a lower number than 982xx (Washington)

      - This pattern aligns with the general south-to-north arrangement of these states


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since 97227 is in Oregon and 98229 is in Washington, and Oregon is south of

      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 97227 is in Oregon (OR)

      - 98229 is in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      Washington is located directly north of Oregon along the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Look at the zip code numbers.

      Zip codes generally (but not always) follow a pattern where lower numbers are
      in the eastern US and higher numbers are in the western US. Within a state,
      there can be various patterns, but the first three digits usually indicate a
      specific region.


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations.

      - 97227 is a zip code in Portland, Oregon

      - 98229 is a zip code in Bellingham, Washington


      Step 5: Determine relative positions.

      Portland is in northern Oregon, near the Washington border.

      Bellingham is in northern Washington, near the Canadian border.


      Since Washington is north of Oregon, and Bellingham is in northern Washington
      while Portland is in northern Oregon, the zip code 98229 (Bellingham, WA) would
      be north of 97227 (Portland, OR).

      - 97227 is a zip code in Oregon (OR)

      - 98229 is a zip code in Washington (WA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Oregon and Washington.

      - Washington state is located directly north of Oregon along the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code numbers.

      - In the US zip code system, generally lower numbers are in the eastern US and
      higher numbers in the western US.

      - The first digit (9) indicates both are in the western region.

      - The second digits (7 for OR and 8 for WA) often correlate with more northern
      locations having higher numbers.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state locations.

      - Since 97227 is in Oregon, and 98229 is in Washington, and Washington is north

      Step 3: Consider what this means for zip codes.

      Generally, Washington zip codes would be north of Oregon zip codes because of
      the states'' relative positions.


      Step 4: Verify if there could be exceptions.

      While there could be unusual border areas, the zip code numbering doesn''t change

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of OR and WA.

      Washington state is located north of Oregon state. This is a fundamental geographic
      fact about the United States.
