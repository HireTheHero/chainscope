      1. First, I''ll look at the zip codes:

      - 48079 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 90038 is in California (CA)


      2. These are specific zip codes, so I''ll need population density information


      3. 48079 is in the metro Detroit area (Rochester Hills/Rochester), which is
      suburban

      - Suburban areas tend to have moderate population density

      - Michigan has lower overall population density compared to California


      4. 90038 is in Los Angeles

      - Los Angeles is a very densely populated urban area

      - California, especially around Los Angeles, has much higher population density


      5. Los Angeles zip codes are typically much more densely populated than suburban
      Michigan zip codes


      6. Therefore, 90038, CA is almost certainly more densely populated than 48079,
