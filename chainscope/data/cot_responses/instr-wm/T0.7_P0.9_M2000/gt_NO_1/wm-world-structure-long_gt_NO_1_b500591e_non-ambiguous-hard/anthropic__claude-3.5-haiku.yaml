      2. Red Bluff Diversion Dam is located in Texas, on the Pecos River in Reeves
      County.


      3. FirstBank Southwest Tower is located in El Paso, Texas.


      4. El Paso is west of Reeves County, where the Red Bluff Diversion Dam is situated.


      5. This means the Red Bluff Diversion Dam is east of FirstBank Southwest Tower.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      1. First, I need to understand the locations of these two structures

      2. Red Bluff Diversion Dam is located in Texas, near the Pecos River

      3. FirstBank Southwest Tower is likely in Texas as well

      4. I''ll need to determine their specific geographic coordinates

      5. After checking reference maps, Red Bluff Diversion Dam is in western Texas

      6. FirstBank Southwest Tower is located in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle

      7. Comparing their locations, Red Bluff Diversion Dam is east of FirstBank Southwest
      Tower
