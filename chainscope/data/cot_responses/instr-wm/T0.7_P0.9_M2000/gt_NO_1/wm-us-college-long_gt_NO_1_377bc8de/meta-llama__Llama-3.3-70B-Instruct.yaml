      \ States but is north of Florida.\n\n3. **Comparing Locations:** \n   - **North-South\
      \ Orientation:** North Carolina is north of Florida.\n   - **East-West Orientation:**\

      \ However, considering the general geography, Florida (especially the eastern\
      \ part where Florida National University is located) is generally east of North\
      \ Carolina when looking at a map of the eastern United States.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ considering the general east-west geography of these locations, Florida National\
      \ University, being in eastern Florida, would indeed be east of Pfeiffer University\

      \ (FL) is located east of Pfeiffer University (NC), we need to establish the\
      \ geographical locations of both universities and then compare their positions\
      \ relative to each other.\n\n1. **Location of Florida National University (FL):**\
      \ Florida National University is located in the state of Florida. Florida is\
      \ situated in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic Ocean to\
      \ the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the west.\n\n2. **Location of Pfeiffer\
      \ University (NC):** Pfeiffer University is located in the state of North Carolina.\
      \ North Carolina is also situated in the southeastern United States, north of\
      \ Florida, and it borders the Atlantic Ocean to the east.\n\n3. **Comparing\
      \ Locations:** \n   - **Latitude:** North Carolina is north of Florida. \n \
      \  - **Longitude:** Both states are located in the eastern part of the United\
      \ States, with parts of both states bordering the Atlantic Ocean. However, the\
      \ question is about being east of Pfeiffer University, not just being at a similar\
      \ longitude. Since both universities are in states that border the Atlantic,\
      \ we must consider their relative positions east-west of each other.\n\n4. **East-West\
      \ Comparison:** Florida extends further west than North Carolina does, given\
      \ its shape and geographical layout. However, the key factor is whether Florida\
      \ National University is east of Pfeiffer University's location in North Carolina.\
      \ Given that both states border the Atlantic and considering the general geography,\
      \ we must look at specific longitudes or acknowledge that \"east of\" in this\
      \ context may not necessarily apply in a straightforward manner without exact\
      \ coordinates. Nonetheless, in general terms, parts of Florida can be considered\
      \ east of parts of North Carolina due to their shapes and the fact that they\
      \ both border the Atlantic Ocean, but this doesn't directly answer the question\
      \ without more precise geographical data.\n\nHowever, simplifying the logic\
      \ based on typical geographical understanding:\n- Florida is generally south\
      \ of North Carolina.\n- The question of being \"east\" depends on the specific\
      \ longitudes of the two universities, but given that Florida National University\
      \ is in Florida and Pfeiffer University is in North Carolina, and considering\
      \ the general east-west layout of the southeastern United States, the answer\
      \ hinges on the relative east-west positions rather than their north-south relationship.\n\
      \nWithout exact coordinates, one might initially think this requires complex\
      \ geographical analysis. However, knowing that both states border the Atlantic\
      \ and are relatively close in longitude, the question seems to simplify to a\
      \ basic geographical comparison.\n\nGiven these considerations and simplifying\
      \ the geographical context:\n- Florida National University is in a state that\
      \ is south of North Carolina, but the question is about being east, not south.\n\
      \nSince both universities are near the eastern seaboard and considering typical\
      \ geographical layouts, the direct answer to whether Florida National University\
      \ is east of Pfeiffer University would generally depend on their exact longitudes.\
      \ However, acknowledging that Florida can extend further west but also has an\
      \ eastern coastline similar to North Carolina, and without specific longitudes,\
      \ one might assume a comparison based on state-wide geographical positions.\n\
      \nBut to directly answer the question based on typical geographical knowledge\
      \ and without specific longitudes:\nFlorida National University is not necessarily\
      \ east of Pfeiffer University simply because it's in Florida and Pfeiffer University\
      \ is in North Carolina; their east-west relationship isn't directly determined\
      \ by their state locations alone without considering exact longitudes or acknowledging\
      \ that \"east of\" might not apply as expected due to the states' geometries\
      \ and coastal orientations.\n\nThus, considering a simplified geographical understanding\

      \ of their relative positions east-west, acknowledging the complexity of state\
      \ geometries and coastlines.\n\n**YES / NO Answer:** \nGiven the need for simplicity\

      4. **Conclusion**: Without explicit information on the exact locations or buildings
      of the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy and the University of Michigan
      School of Public Health, we cannot definitively say which one is east of the
      other based solely on their names and the fact they are both in Ann Arbor.


      However, considering the question demands a YES or NO answer and given that
      both institutions are likely within a small geographic area (the University
      of Michigan campus), if we had to make an educated guess based on typical campus
      layouts and without further information, we might lean towards a "NO" simply
      because the pharmacy college and the public health school could easily be in
      adjacent buildings or in the same general area, making their east-west relationship
      arbitrary without more specific location data.


      But, since we are to provide a definitive YES or NO based on the information
      given (and acknowledging that both are in Ann Arbor, MI, which does not inherently
      imply one is east of the other), the most appropriate response, given the lack
      of specific directional information, would be to not make assumptions. Yet,
      for the sake of providing an answer as requested:


      NO'
    64c868f8-6d77-41ef-a118-bb33e128a304: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to determine the locations of the University
      of Michigan College of Pharmacy and the University of Michigan School of Public
      Health. Both are part of the University of Michigan, which has its main campus
      in Ann Arbor, Michigan.


      2. **Understand the layout of the University of Michigan**: The University of
      Michigan''s main campus in Ann Arbor is divided into several areas, including
      the Central Campus, North Campus, and Medical Campus, among others. The specific
      locations of the College of Pharmacy and the School of Public Health within
      these areas need to be identified.


      3. **Location of University of Michigan College of Pharmacy**: The University
      of Michigan College of Pharmacy is located on the Central Campus of the University
      of Michigan in Ann Arbor.


      4. **Location of University of Michigan School of Public Health**: The University
      of Michigan School of Public Health is also located on the Central Campus but
      more specifically, it is situated in the Crossroads area, near the Michigan
      Union and other central buildings.


      5. **Relative locations**: Given that both are on the Central Campus, we need
      to consider their relative positions. The College of Pharmacy is often associated
      with buildings like the College of Pharmacy Building, which is near the center
      of campus. The School of Public Health is located in the SPH Building, which
      might be slightly to the east or in a comparable central location, depending
      on the exact reference points used for "east."


      6. **Determine east-west orientation**: Ann Arbor''s layout and the University
      of Michigan''s campus are not strictly aligned with cardinal directions due
      to the city''s and campus''s historical development and geography. However,
      generally speaking, the Huron River runs through Ann Arbor, and the campus layout
      can be considered in relation to this and other landmarks.


      Given the complexity and the need for precise geographical information that
      might not be readily available without a current campus map or specific addresses,
      the question seems to require more detailed spatial information than provided.
      However, considering typical campus layouts and assuming both schools are centrally
      located, it might be reasonable to assume they are relatively close to each
      other, potentially with one not significantly east or west of the other, depending
      on the precise locations of their buildings.


      But, to provide an answer based on the assumption that specific building locations
      within the central campus area might not drastically differ in their east-west
      orientation, and without exact addresses or a map to confirm:


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      east-west positions requires specific knowledge of the campus layout.


      6. **Assumption Based on Typical Campus Layout**: In many universities, schools
      within the same broader discipline (like health sciences) are often clustered
      together. However, this does not necessarily inform us about their east-west

      tudes (School of Higher Studies) is located in New York.\n   - New York University\
      \ Graduate School of Arts and Science is also located in New York.\n\n2. **Specific\
      \ Addresses**:\n   - The \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes was historically\
      \ associated with the New School in New York City. Assuming it's still related\
      \ or located near the New School, its address would be around 66 West 12th Street,\
      \ New York, NY 10011.\n   - New York University Graduate School of Arts and\
      \ Science is located in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, with its main campus around\
      \ Washington Square Park. A specific address could be 6 Washington Square North,\
      \ New York, NY 10012, though exact building locations might vary.\n\n3. **Determine\
      \ \"East\"**: To determine if one location is east of the other, we need to\
      \ understand the geography of Manhattan. Manhattan is laid out in a grid pattern\
      \ with avenues running north-south and streets running east-west. The further\
      \ east you go, the higher the avenue numbers (until you reach the East River).\n\
      \n4. **Compare Locations**:\n   - The New School (and by association, \xC9cole\
      \ libre des hautes \xE9tudes if it's in the same area) is roughly around 12th\
      \ Street and 6th Avenue.\n   - NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science is\
      \ around Washington Square Park, which is also in Greenwich Village, roughly\
      \ between 4th and 6th Streets and between 5th and University Place (near 6th\
      \ Avenue).\n\n5. **East-West Comparison**:\n   - Both locations are in close\
      \ proximity within Greenwich Village. However, to determine if one is east of\
      \ the other, we need to compare their east-west positions. Given that both are\
      \ near 6th Avenue, they are essentially on the same east-west line in Manhattan's\
      \ grid. However, specific buildings within NYU's campus spread out and could\
      \ be slightly east or west of the New School's location, depending on the exact\
      \ building.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that both institutions are in\
      \ close proximity and essentially on the same east-west axis in Manhattan's\
      \ grid (near 6th Avenue), and without precise building-by-building comparison,\
      \ it's challenging to definitively say one is east of the other based solely\
      \ on their general locations within Greenwich Village. However, considering\
      \ typical Manhattan geography and assuming a general location for each, it's\
      \ plausible they could be very close or even on the same street in terms of\
      \ east-west positioning.\n\n**Given the general nature of the question and without\
      \ exact addresses for specific buildings within each institution**, the answer\
      \ to whether \xC9cole libre des hautes \xE9tudes is located east of New York\

      \ is based on an assumption of their general proximity and not a precise measurement\
      \ of their locations. For a definitive answer, exact addresses or a detailed\
      \ map would be necessary.\n\n**Therefore, based on the steps and considering\

    a4710b08-06e6-42f2-93b6-4892864bab17: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Alfred
      University and Kate Gleason College of Engineering. Alfred University is located
      in Alfred, New York. The Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of the
      Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), which is located in Rochester, New
      York.


      2. **Determine geographical positions**: Next, we need to understand the geographical
      positions of these locations relative to each other. Alfred, New York, is situated
      in Allegany County, which is in the southern part of Western New York. Rochester,
      New York, where RIT and the Kate Gleason College of Engineering are located,
      is also in Western New York but is more northward compared to Alfred.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that both institutions are in Western New
      York, we need to determine their relative east-west positions. Rochester is
      generally north and slightly east of Alfred, but when considering strictly east-west,
      Rochester is not significantly east of Alfred; rather, it''s more to the north.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical information, Alfred University
      is not significantly east or west of the Kate Gleason College of Engineering
      in a manner that would make one decidedly east of the other. However, given
      the context of the question, which asks if Alfred University is east of Kate
      Gleason College of Engineering, and considering Rochester (where Kate Gleason
      College of Engineering is located) is slightly north and possibly very slightly
      east but not in a way that''s significant for this comparison, the question
      essentially asks for a determination based on their primary geographical relationship.


      Given the steps above and understanding that the question seeks a simple directional
      answer based on the locations provided:


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      County, which is in the southwestern part of New York State. Rochester, NY,
      where RIT and its Kate Gleason College of Engineering are located, is in Monroe
      County, also in western New York but more to the north and slightly east of
      Alfred.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Now, compare the positions of Alfred and Rochester.
      Given that Alfred is more southwest and Rochester is more north and slightly
      east in the context of western New York, we can conclude that Alfred University
      is generally west and slightly south of the Kate Gleason College of Engineering.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic analysis, Alfred University, NY,

      \ help in understanding the relative positions of landmarks and institutions.\n\
      \n3. **Find Specific Addresses**:\n   - City University of Seattle: Its main\

      \ the addresses or general areas where both universities are located, we can\
      \ compare their positions relative to each other, specifically focusing on whether\
      \ City University is east of Antioch University.\n\nGiven the need for specific\
      \ addresses or locations to accurately answer this question, let's proceed with\

      \ west of Lake Washington are generally considered \"west,\" while areas east\
      \ of the lake or further inland are considered \"east.\"\n\nAssuming City University\
      \ of Seattle is in a downtown or western part of Seattle and Antioch University\
      \ Seattle is also in a comparable area, without exact addresses, it's challenging\
      \ to definitively say. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's consider\
      \ a scenario where City University might be slightly more central or western\
      \ compared to Antioch University Seattle, which could potentially be in a location\
      \ that is not as far east but still requires a direct comparison of their addresses.\n\

      \ or a detailed map, providing a definitive YES or NO is speculative. However,\
      \ considering typical university placements in urban areas and assuming a general\
      \ layout of Seattle, if we were to speculate based on the original question's\
      \ intent, we might lean towards a \"NO\" given that both universities are likely\
      \ situated in central or western parts of Seattle, close to downtown, implying\
      \ that their locations might not have a significant east-west disparity. \n\n\

      \ Orientation**:\n   - Seattle is a city that runs along the Puget Sound to\
      \ the west and has Lake Washington to the east. The downtown area of Seattle,\
      \ where both universities are located, is relatively close to the waterfront\

      \n3. **Comparing Locations**:\n   - Given that both universities are in the\
      \ downtown area of Seattle, they are relatively close to each other and both\
      \ are near the waterfront. Without exact addresses, it's a bit challenging,\
      \ but typically, both would be considered to be in the western part of Seattle,\

    fb18874d-c707-4796-9b98-8a27902abe68: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of City
      University of Seattle and Antioch University Seattle. Both universities are
      in Seattle, Washington, but to answer the question, we need their specific addresses
      or general areas within Seattle.


      2. **City University of Seattle Location**: City University of Seattle is located
      in the heart of Seattle. For precision, let''s consider it to be around the
      downtown area or close to it, given its name and the general location of many
      city-named universities.


      3. **Antioch University Seattle Location**: Antioch University Seattle is also
      in Seattle. Without the exact address, we can consider that many universities
      in Seattle are clustered in certain areas, but knowing the exact location requires
      specific information. However, Antioch University Seattle is known to be located
      near the waterfront, which could place it relatively west or in a central location
      depending on the exact point of reference.


      4. **Seattle Geography**: Seattle is situated on the Puget Sound, with water
      to the west and land to the east. The city''s layout is generally north-south
      along the waterfront, with the downtown area being relatively central or western.


      5. **Comparison**: To determine if City University of Seattle is east of Antioch
      University Seattle, we would need to know if City University is located in an
      area that is further east than Antioch University''s location. Without exact
      addresses, this step requires general knowledge of Seattle''s geography and
      the relative positions of these universities.


      6. **Decision**: Given that both universities are in Seattle and without specific
      addresses, making a precise determination requires assuming their relative locations.
      Generally, universities in the same city can be quite close, and their relative
      east-west positioning can depend on very specific locations within the city.


      However, for the purpose of this exercise and without specific information on
      their exact locations, let''s consider a general scenario: If City University
      of Seattle is indeed in a more central or eastern part of the city compared
      to Antioch University Seattle, which might be closer to the waterfront or in
      a western part of downtown, then City University could be considered east of
      Antioch University Seattle.

      \ **Final Step - Specific Locations**:\n   - Heritage University is in Toppenish,\
      \ Washington.\n   - Madera Community College is in Madera, California.\n   -\
      \ Without precise longitudes, we consider the general geography: Toppenish,\

      \ knowledge that Washington state (where Heritage University is located) is\
      \ north of California (where Madera Community College is located) and considering\
      \ the shape of the North American continent, Heritage University would indeed\
      \ be more northward. However, the question asks about being \"east\" of Madera\
      \ Community College. \n\nGiven that both locations are on the West Coast, and\
      \ without specific longitude information, one might initially think it's a complex\
      \ comparison. However, considering the United States' geography, locations on\
      \ the West Coast are generally close to the same longitude (with variations),\
      \ with Washington being slightly more eastward than the coastal parts of California\
      \ but still much farther west than the eastern United States.\n\nTo accurately\
      \ answer without looking up exact longitudes:\n- If Heritage University is at\
      \ a higher longitude (more eastward) than Madera Community College, the answer\
      \ would be YES.\n- Given the typical longitude ranges for Washington state and\
      \ California, it's plausible that Heritage University could be east of Madera\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Heritage University is located in Washington
      state (WA), and Madera Community College is located in California (CA).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest,
      which is generally considered to be in the western part of the United States.
      California is also on the West Coast, south of Washington.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since both institutions are on the West Coast,
      we need to determine their relative positions east-west. Given that both are
      in western states, the question essentially becomes about their longitudinal
      positions (east-west) rather than their latitudinal positions (north-south).


      4. **Determine east-west orientation**: Without exact longitudes, we can still
      infer that both institutions are relatively far west in the United States. However,
      to answer the question, we need to establish whether Heritage University (in
      WA) is east of Madera Community College (in CA).


      5. **Geographical specifics**: Washington state is north of California. The
      question of whether it''s east or west of California depends on the specific
      longitudes of the two locations. Generally, the western coast of North America
      runs somewhat north-south, meaning that moving north along the coast, one might
      also move slightly east due to the Earth''s curvature and the continent''s shape.
      However, the difference in longitude between points in Washington and California
      is not significant enough to consider Washington as being "east" of California
      in a broad geographical sense, especially when considering the context of the
      entire United States.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Heritage University is in Washington and Madera
      Community College is in California, and considering the general westward position
      of both on the U.S. map, it''s unlikely that Heritage University would be considered
      "east" of Madera Community College based on standard geographical interpretations.

      \ locations**: Without specific building or address information, we must consider\
      \ that both the School of Library & Information Studies and the College of Social\
      \ Sciences are likely located within or very near the main FSU campus in Tallahassee.\
      \ \n\n4. **Compare locations**: Since both entities are part of FSU and presumably\

      2. **Same University, Same Location**: Since both entities are part of FSU,
      they are likely located on or near the main campus of Florida State University
      in Tallahassee, Florida.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Without specific building names or addresses, we
      can infer that since they are part of the same university, they would be relatively
      close to each other, likely on the same campus.


      4. **East/West Determination**: To determine if one is east of the other, we
      would need specific addresses or a campus map. However, given that they are
      on the same campus, the difference in their locations would be a matter of buildings
      or streets rather than significant geographical distances.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without a detailed campus
      map or specific addresses, it''s not possible to definitively say which building

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand the geographical
      layout of Florida State University (FSU) and its various colleges and schools.
      The College of Social Sciences and the School of Library & Information Studies
      are both part of FSU, which is located in Tallahassee, Florida.


      2. **Campus Layout**: FSU has a large campus with various departments and colleges
      located in different areas. Without specific information on the exact buildings
      or areas where the School of Library & Information Studies and the College of
      Social Sciences are located, we can''t directly determine their relative positions.


      3. **Assumption Based on Naming**: The question implies a need to understand
      the spatial relationship between two entities within the same university. However,
      without a detailed map or specific information about the layout of FSU''s campus,
      any answer would be speculative.


      4. **General Knowledge about FSU**: Knowing that both the School of Library
      & Information Studies and the College of Social Sciences are part of Florida
      State University, and without specific details on their locations within the
      campus, it''s reasonable to consider that they could be located in proximity
      to each other, given the integrated nature of university campuses.


      5. **Determining East-West Orientation**: To answer the question, one would
      ideally need to know the specific locations of these schools within the campus
      and how they relate to each other in terms of cardinal directions (east-west).


      Given the lack of specific information about the exact locations of the Florida
      State University School of Library & Information Studies and the College of
      Social Sciences within the FSU campus, and without a detailed campus map, it''s
      challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO answer based solely on the question
      as posed.


      However, the question seems to require an answer based on assumed or general
      knowledge. Since both entities are located within the same university and presumably
      on the same campus, and without specific details to the contrary, one might
      assume they are in relatively close proximity. But proximity does not necessarily
      determine east-west orientation without more specific location information.


      Given this, the most straightforward approach to answering the question directly,
      without overcomplicating it, would involve knowing the campus layout or having
      more specific details about the locations of these schools, which is not provided
      in the question.

      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand that both the Florida
      State University School of Library & Information Studies and the Florida State
      University College of Social Sciences are part of Florida State University (FSU),
      which is located in Tallahassee, Florida.


      2. **Campus Layout**: Typically, different colleges or schools within a university
      are located in different buildings or areas of the campus, but they are generally
      within the same geographic area, in this case, the FSU campus in Tallahassee.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Without specific information on the exact locations
      of these schools within the FSU campus, we can''t directly determine their relative
      positions (east-west) solely based on their names or general knowledge.


      4. **Researching the Campus Map**: To accurately answer the question, one would
      ideally need to consult a campus map or contact the university for information
      on the precise locations of the School of Library & Information Studies and
      the College of Social Sciences.


      5. **General Assumption**: However, given that both institutions are part of
      FSU and likely located on or very near the main campus, any difference in their
      locations would be relatively minor in terms of cardinal directions (north,
      south, east, west) when considering the broader geographic context.


      6. **Conclusion**: Without specific information on the locations of these two
      entities within the campus or a detailed campus map, it''s challenging to definitively
      say whether one is east of the other. However, the question seems to imply a
      need for a direct yes or no answer based on presumed knowledge or research that
      hasn''t been provided here.


      Given the steps above and the lack of specific information to directly answer
      the question, the most informed approach would be to acknowledge that without
      a campus map or specific details, we can''t accurately determine their relative
      east-west positions. However, since the format requires a YES or NO answer and
      considering that both schools are likely within the same campus area, making
      a significant east-west difference unlikely but not impossible without more

      University College of Social Sciences are part of Florida State University (FSU),
      which is located in Tallahassee, Florida.


      2. **Campus Layout**: Next, consider the layout of FSU''s campus. While the
      exact locations of specific colleges within a university can vary, typically,
      different schools or colleges within a university are not extremely far from
      each other, often being on the same campus or in closely adjacent areas.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Without specific information on the exact buildings
      or locations of these two entities within the FSU campus, we can''t directly
      determine their relative positions (east-west) solely based on their names or
      general knowledge about universities.


      4. **Assumption and Research**: Given that we don''t have the exact locations,
      a common assumption might be that since they are both part of FSU, their locations
      relative to each other (east-west) would depend on the specific layout of the
      FSU campus. However, without access to a detailed campus map or specific information
      stating the relative positions of these schools, we cannot definitively say
      which one is east of the other.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Since the question requires a definitive
      YES or NO answer and we''ve established that without specific information about
      their locations on campus, we cannot accurately determine their relative east-west
      positions. However, the question seems to imply a need for a direct answer based
      on possibly assumed or known information about their locations.


      Given the steps above and considering that typically, detailed campus maps would
      be needed to answer such a question accurately, and without assuming specific
      knowledge about the layout of FSU''s campus regarding these two schools, the
      most straightforward approach to answering the question directly would be to
      consider if there''s any publicly known information or common sense that could
      apply. However, since both are on the same campus and likely close, the specific
      east-west relationship might not be commonly known or could vary based on the
      reference point (the entire campus or a specific building).


      But, to give a direct answer as requested, and considering we are to provide
      a YES or NO without further information or context that might suggest one is
      definitively east of the other, we must rely on the most basic understanding
      and available data, which in this case, does not provide a clear answer without
      more specific details about their exact locations on campus.


      Therefore, based on the information provided and the steps of reasoning, the
      answer to whether the Florida State University School of Library & Information
      Studies is located east of the Florida State University College of Social Sciences,

      the locations of both the Florida State University School of Library & Information
      Studies and the Florida State University College of Social Sciences.


      1. **Identify the Location of Florida State University**: Both schools are part
      of Florida State University (FSU), which is located in Tallahassee, Florida.


      2. **Understand the Campus Layout**: FSU has a main campus in Tallahassee. The
      university''s colleges and schools are typically located on or near this main
      campus.


      3. **Consider the Names**: The names "Florida State University School of Library
      & Information Studies" and "Florida State University College of Social Sciences"
      indicate they are both part of FSU but do not inherently suggest separate locations
      outside of Tallahassee.


      4. **Research Specific Locations**: Without specific information on the exact
      buildings or locations within the FSU campus for these two entities, we must
      consider the general layout of the university. Most universities have their
      colleges and schools located on the main campus, often in close proximity to
      each other.


      5. **East/West Consideration**: Given that both are likely located on or very
      near the FSU main campus in Tallahassee, the question of whether one is east
      of the other depends on their specific locations within the campus. However,
      since they are both part of the same university and likely on the same campus,
      the difference in their east-west positioning would be minimal and dependent
      on the exact location of their respective buildings or facilities.


      6. **Conclusion**: Without exact addresses or a detailed campus map showing
      the specific locations of the School of Library & Information Studies and the
      College of Social Sciences, it''s challenging to definitively say which one
      is east of the other. However, considering the context of the question and the
      fact that both are part of FSU, the implication is that we are comparing locations

      Given the information and the steps above, the answer to whether the Florida
      State University School of Library & Information Studies is located east of
      the Florida State University College of Social Sciences would typically require
      specific knowledge of their building locations on campus. However, since the
      question demands a YES or NO answer and considering that both schools are on
      the same campus, the likelihood of one being significantly east of the other
      is low, but not impossible without exact locations.


      ANSWER: YES'
    9f3326e2-8bca-449f-b9fa-35b98e3f7669: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the locations of the two entities mentioned: Florida State University School
      of Library & Information Studies and Florida State University College of Social
      Sciences.


      1. **Identify the Location of Florida State University (FSU):** Both entities
      are part of Florida State University, which is located in Tallahassee, Florida.


      2. **Understand Campus Layout:** Typically, different colleges or schools within
      a university are located on the same campus or in close proximity to each other.
      However, without specific information on the layout of FSU''s campus, we must
      consider the general geography of Tallahassee and the common naming conventions
      of university facilities.


      3. **Consider the Naming Convention:** The question implies a distinction between
      the locations of the School of Library & Information Studies and the College
      of Social Sciences. If they were in the same building or directly adjacent,
      it''s unlikely the question would specify their locations as distinct.


      4. **Geographical Reference:** Since both are located within Florida State University
      in Tallahassee, Florida, the question of one being east of the other depends
      on their specific locations on or near the campus.


      5. **Final Consideration:** Without a detailed map of the FSU campus showing
      the exact locations of these two entities, the most direct way to answer this
      question is to consider if there''s any information that suggests one is indeed
      east of the other. Given that both are part of the same university and likely
      on or very near the same campus, any east-west distinction would be relatively
      minor and dependent on the specific geography of the campus.


      Given the lack of specific information on the exact locations of these entities
      and considering that both are likely located on or very near the FSU campus
      in Tallahassee, Florida, the answer to whether the Florida State University
      School of Library & Information Studies is located east of the Florida State
      University College of Social Sciences cannot be definitively determined without
      more detailed information. However, since the question format requires a YES
      or NO answer, and acknowledging that both schools are likely within a small
      geographic area (the university campus), if there''s any difference in their

      down step by step:


      1. **Understanding the Names**: The question involves two entities - "Eastern
      Michigan University, MI" and "Eastern Michigan University College of Health
      and Human Services, MI". The key is recognizing that the "College of Health
      and Human Services" is a part of Eastern Michigan University.


      2. **Location Consideration**: If the College of Health and Human Services is
      part of Eastern Michigan University, it implies that the college is located
      within or as part of the university''s campus.


      3. **Geographical Interpretation of "East"**: The question asks if Eastern Michigan
      University is located east of its College of Health and Human Services. Given
      that the college is a component of the university, it''s unlikely to be in a
      different geographical location than the university itself.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Logical Reasoning**: Since the College of Health and
      Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University and not a separate entity
      that could be located in a different area, it''s logical to conclude that Eastern
      Michigan University cannot be "east" of one of its own colleges in the context
      implied by the question.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**. Eastern Michigan University and its College
      of Health and Human Services are not separate entities that can have an east-west
      relationship in the manner the question suggests.'

      the steps:


      1. **Identify the Location of Eastern Michigan University (EMU):** Eastern Michigan
      University is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. This is a straightforward piece
      of information as it''s the main campus of the university.


      2. **Understand the Nature of the College of Health and Human Services:** The
      College of Health and Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University.
      It''s one of the colleges or schools within the university, focusing on health
      and human services disciplines.


      3. **Determine the Location of the College of Health and Human Services:** Since
      the College of Health and Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University,
      it is located on or near the main campus of EMU in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Colleges
      or schools within a university are typically housed on the university''s campus
      or in nearby facilities.


      4. **Compare Locations:** Given that both Eastern Michigan University and its
      College of Health and Human Services are essentially in the same location (on
      or very near the EMU campus in Ypsilanti), the question of one being east of
      the other becomes moot. They are not separate entities in terms of geographical
      location in a way that would make one distinctly east of the other.


      5. **Conclusion:** Based on the understanding that the College of Health and
      Human Services is part of Eastern Michigan University and located on or near
      its campus, it does not make sense to say that Eastern Michigan University is
      located east of its own College of Health and Human Services, as they are essentially
      in the same location.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'
    2f0fde41-4557-4cad-b176-d20e00a7b3b5: 'To determine if Eastern Michigan University
      (EMU) is located east of the Eastern Michigan University College of Health and
      Human Services, we need to consider the following steps:


      1. **Understanding the Entities**: Eastern Michigan University is a public university
      located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The College of Health and Human Services is
      one of the colleges within EMU, focusing on health and human services disciplines.


      2. **Location Consideration**: Since the College of Health and Human Services
      is a part of Eastern Michigan University, it is situated within or very near
      to the main campus of EMU in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


      3. **Geographical Analysis**: Given that the college is part of the university,
      it does not have a separate location that would be significantly east or west
      of the university itself. The university and its colleges typically share the
      same campus or are in very close proximity.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding that the College of Health and
      Human Services is part of Eastern Michigan University and likely located on
      or very near the university''s campus, it''s logical to conclude that the university
      is not located east of the college, as they essentially occupy the same geographical
      area.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand that Eastern Michigan
      University (EMU) is a specific university located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The
      College of Health and Human Services (CHHS) is one of the colleges within Eastern
      Michigan University.


      2. **Determine Relationship**: The College of Health and Human Services is a
      part of Eastern Michigan University, not a separate entity with a distinct location
      outside of the university. This implies that the CHHS is housed within the EMU
      campus or is an integral part of the university, not a separate location that
      could be compared in terms of east-west positioning.


      3. **Consider Geographic Implications**: Given that the CHHS is part of EMU
      and does not have a separate location, it''s not possible for EMU to be "east"
      of CHHS in the context of separate geographic locations. Both are essentially
      referring to the same overall institution, with CHHS being a component of EMU.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding that the College of Health and
      Human Services is an integral part of Eastern Michigan University and not a
      separate location, the question of whether EMU is located east of CHHS, MI,
      becomes moot. The premise of comparing the two as separate entities in a geographic
      sense is flawed.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Eastern Michigan University, MI, is located
      east of Eastern Michigan University College of Health and Human Services, MI,
      is **NO**, because they are not separate entities that can be compared in this

    6049cf3b-3cb9-4654-9ce0-d785af9c03af: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the University of Georgia (UGA) and Franklin College of Arts and Sciences (FCAS)
      to determine their relative positions.


      2. **University of Georgia Location**: The University of Georgia is located
      in Athens, Georgia. Athens is in the northeastern part of the state.


      3. **Franklin College of Arts and Sciences Location**: Franklin College of Arts
      and Sciences is a part of the University of Georgia itself. It is one of the
      colleges within UGA, focused on arts and sciences, and is located in Athens,
      Georgia, as part of the UGA campus.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Since both the University of Georgia and Franklin
      College of Arts and Sciences are located in the same city (Athens, GA), the
      question of one being east of the other becomes a matter of their exact positions
      within Athens.


      5. **Conclusion**: Considering that Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is
      a constituent college of the University of Georgia, and given that they are
      both located in Athens, the question seems to imply a comparison between two
      entities that are not separate in terms of their overall location. However,
      interpreting the question as asking whether the University of Georgia (as an
      institution) is located east of the specific location of Franklin College of
      Arts and Sciences (as a part of UGA) within Athens, GA, would require precise
      geographical information about their on-campus locations. But since they are
      part of the same institution and campus, the premise of comparing their locations
      in such a manner may be misleading.


      Given the information typically available and the fact that they are essentially
      in the same location (Athens, GA), and considering the spirit of the question
      might be aiming towards understanding geographical relationships between separate
      entities, it''s logical to conclude that the comparison as intended might not
      apply directly or meaningfully in this context. However, for the sake of providing
      a clear YES/NO answer based on a literal interpretation that the University
      of Georgia (as a whole) cannot be "east" of one of its colleges (since they
      are in the same location), the answer would lean towards indicating that the
      question''s premise may not accurately reflect a meaningful geographical comparison.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      the locations of both D''Youville University in New York and Eastern Mennonite
      University in Virginia and then compare their relative positions.


      1. **Identify the location of D''Youville University, NY**: D''Youville University
      is located in Buffalo, New York. Buffalo is in the western part of New York
      State, near the Canadian border and along the shores of Lake Erie.


      2. **Identify the location of Eastern Mennonite University, VA**: Eastern Mennonite
      University is located in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Harrisonburg is situated in
      the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, which is more to the south than Buffalo,
      New York, but still east of it when considering the broader geography of the

      \ IN is located east of The Way College of Biblical Research \u2013 Indiana\
      \ Campus, IN, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Locations**: First,\
      \ we need to identify the locations of both institutions. Ball State University\
      \ is located in Muncie, Indiana. \n\n2. **The Way College of Biblical Research\
      \ \u2013 Indiana Campus**: This institution's location is not as commonly known\
      \ as larger universities, so specific details about its exact location might\
      \ require research. However, for the purpose of this question, let's assume\
      \ we find that it is located in New Castle, Indiana, as an example. The actual\
      \ location might vary, but New Castle will serve for our illustrative purposes.\n\
      \n3. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Once we have the locations, we need\
      \ to determine their geographic relationship, specifically if one is east of\
      \ the other. Muncie, Indiana (Ball State University) and New Castle, Indiana\
      \ (our example location for The Way College of Biblical Research) are both in\
      \ Indiana. Muncie is approximately at 40.2\xB0N, 85.4\xB0W, and New Castle is\
      \ at about 39.9\xB0N, 85.4\xB0W.\n\n4. **Compare Longitudes**: Since both cities\
      \ are at roughly the same longitude (85.4\xB0W), we look at their latitudes\
      \ to determine their north-south relationship. Muncie is slightly north of New\
      \ Castle. However, the question asks about east-west orientation, not north-south.\n\
      \n5. **Conclusion Based on Geographic Data**: Given that both institutions are\
      \ at virtually the same longitude, neither is significantly east or west of\
      \ the other based on their longitudes. However, since the question specifically\
      \ asks if Ball State University is east of The Way College of Biblical Research,\
      \ and considering typical longitude values where lower values are west and higher\
      \ values are east (though both are at the same longitude in this scenario),\
      \ the critical factor is the slight difference in their specific locations which\
      \ isn't directly provided. \n\nGiven the assumption that The Way College of\
      \ Biblical Research \u2013 Indiana Campus is in a location similar to New Castle,\
      \ Indiana, and considering the need for precise location data for an accurate\
      \ answer, the question seems to hinge on specific geographic details not fully\
      \ provided. However, based on the information that can be gathered and assuming\
      \ both are in similar longitudinal positions (with Ball State in Muncie and\
      \ using New Castle as a proxy for the biblical research college), we must rely\
      \ on the understanding that \"east of\" implies a comparison of longitudes primarily.\n\
      \nTherefore, without exact longitude and latitude comparisons that show a significant\
      \ east-west difference and acknowledging the primary factor in such a determination\

    cd318414-9824-4543-9242-45faa87f6c8f: 'To determine if the University of West
      Los Angeles, CA is located east of Columbia College Hollywood, CA, let''s break
      down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the general locations
      of both institutions. The University of West Los Angeles is in Los Angeles,
      and its name suggests it is on the west side. Columbia College Hollywood is
      in Hollywood, which is also in Los Angeles but more centrally located.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: Next, understanding the geographic
      directions is key. "East" refers to the direction towards the sunrise, and "west"
      refers to the direction towards the sunset. If something is located "east" of
      another location, it means it is situated in the direction of the sunrise relative
      to that other location.


      3. **Apply Directions to Locations**: Given that "West" is in the name of the
      University of West Los Angeles, we can infer it is on the west side of Los Angeles.
      Columbia College Hollywood, being in Hollywood, is more centrally located but
      still west of the true eastern parts of Los Angeles. However, since the University
      of West Los Angeles is explicitly on the west side, it is unlikely to be east
      of Columbia College Hollywood.


      4. **Conclusion**: Considering the above steps, the University of West Los Angeles,
      given its name and implied location on the west side of Los Angeles, cannot
      be east of Columbia College Hollywood, which is in a more central but still
      western area of Los Angeles.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      the locations of Colorado State University (CSU) and Regis University in Colorado.


      1. **Identify the location of Colorado State University (CSU):** CSU is located
      in Fort Collins, Colorado. Fort Collins is situated in the northern part of
      the state, relatively close to the Wyoming border.


      2. **Identify the location of Regis University:** Regis University is located
      in Denver, Colorado. Denver is the capital city of Colorado and is situated
      more centrally in the state but is generally considered to be on the eastern
      side of the Rocky Mountains, which run through the middle of Colorado.


      3. **Compare the locations:** Considering the geographical layout of Colorado,
      with the Rocky Mountains running north-south through the center, Fort Collins
      (where CSU is located) is to the north and slightly west of Denver (where Regis
      University is located). Thus, CSU is not east of Regis University but rather
      northwest.

      Collins, Colorado. Regis University is located in Denver, Colorado.


      2. **Determine the geographical relationship**: Fort Collins is situated north
      of Denver. In general geography, when considering east-west positioning, being
      north or south does not directly indicate east or west positioning, but in the
      context of Colorado and these cities, it can give us a clue about their relative
      east-west positions because of how the state''s geography and cities are laid

      3. **Consider Colorado''s geography and major city layouts**: Denver, where
      Regis University is located, is relatively central in Colorado but leans more
      towards the eastern part of the state when considering the broader geography
      of Colorado, which stretches from the eastern plains to the western mountains.

      of the Arts is part of Southern Methodist University (SMU). It is located on
      the SMU campus in University Park, Texas, a suburb of Dallas.


      2. **Identify the location of Southern Methodist University, TX**: As mentioned,
      Southern Methodist University is located in University Park, Texas, which is
      a suburb of Dallas.


      3. **Determine the relative locations**: Since Meadows School of the Arts is
      part of SMU and located on its campus, it is not separate from SMU in terms
      of being east or west. They are essentially in the same location.


      Given these steps, the question seems to be based on a misunderstanding or a
      trick, as Meadows School of the Arts is not a separate entity located elsewhere
      but is an integral part of SMU. However, strictly speaking to the question of
      whether Meadows School of the Arts is located east of Southern Methodist University,
      the answer would be "NO" because it''s part of SMU, not a separate location
      that could be described as east or west of SMU.

    0c4d5240-51f8-41c5-a850-5f21b607f528: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Apple University and California South Bay University. Apple University is not
      a traditional university but rather an internal training program for Apple Inc.
      employees, located in Cupertino, California. California South Bay University
      does not appear to be a well-known or recognized institution under that exact
      name, but assuming it refers to a university in the South Bay area of California,
      this region includes cities like San Jose, Sunnyvale, and Mountain View, which
      are all located near Cupertino.


      2. **Determine Geographic Positions**: Cupertino, where Apple University is
      based, is located in the South Bay area of the San Francisco Bay Area in California.
      If we consider "California South Bay University" to be hypothetically located
      within the South Bay area, both institutions would be in the same general region.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Given that both are in the South Bay area, determining
      which is east of the other requires specific locations. Cupertino (Apple University)
      is generally west of the cities that might be considered part of the broader
      South Bay area, like San Jose. However, without a specific location for "California
      South Bay University," we can only assume it''s somewhere in the South Bay.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Assumptions**: Assuming "California South Bay University"
      could be in any part of the South Bay, including areas east of Cupertino (like
      parts of San Jose or further east in the South Bay), Apple University in Cupertino
      would not be east of all possible locations within the South Bay. However, since
      Apple University is in Cupertino, which is more towards the western part of
      the South Bay area, and considering the South Bay encompasses a broad region
      including areas that are indeed east of Cupertino, the question''s phrasing
      suggests a comparison that might not fully align with geographic realities without
      specific university locations.


      Given these considerations and focusing strictly on the question''s wording,
      if "California South Bay University" is assumed to be in a part of the South
      Bay that could be east of Cupertino (which is a reasonable assumption given
      the South Bay''s geography), then Apple University would not be east of it.
      Therefore, the answer to whether Apple University, CA is located east of California
      South Bay University, CA, based on the information provided and typical geographic
      understandings, would be "NO".'

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Apple University and California South Bay University. However, it''s crucial
      to note that "Apple University" is not a traditional university in the sense
      of an educational institution offering degrees like a typical college or university.
      Apple University is actually an internal training program for Apple Inc. employees,
      located at the company''s headquarters in Cupertino, California.


      2. **Location of Apple University**: Cupertino, where Apple University is based,
      is in the South Bay area of the San Francisco Bay Area in California.


      3. **Location of California South Bay University**: There isn''t a well-known
      or prominent university by the exact name "California South Bay University"
      in California. However, there are institutions like California State University,
      East Bay (in Hayward, CA), and San Jose State University (in San Jose, CA),
      both of which are in the Bay Area but specifically in the East Bay and South
      Bay, respectively. Given the name, if we were to consider a university in the
      "South Bay" area, we might think of institutions like San Jose State University
      or other colleges in the South Bay region.


      4. **Comparison**: Since Apple University is in Cupertino, which is in the South
      Bay, and if we consider California South Bay University to be a hypothetical
      or a misnomer for a university in the South Bay area (like San Jose State University),
      we''re essentially comparing two locations within the same general region.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both are in the South Bay area of California,
      the question of one being "east" of the other depends on their exact locations
      within the South Bay. Cupertino (Apple University) is generally west of San
      Jose (if we use San Jose State University as a reference for a South Bay university).
      Therefore, Apple University would not be east of a university located in San
      Jose or a similar location in the South Bay.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether Apple University, CA is located
      east of California South Bay University, CA would be: **NO**.'

      be some confusion because "Apple University" is not a traditional university
      but rather an internal training program for Apple Inc. employees, and it''s

      does not appear to be a recognized or accredited university in the traditional

      locations associated with their names or similar institutions.


      2. **Determine geographical locations**: Assuming Apple University refers to
      the location of Apple''s headquarters or a similar educational institution in
      the Cupertino area, it would be in the western part of the United States, specifically
      in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. If California South Bay University
      were a real institution, "South Bay" would refer to an area also in California,
      south of the San Francisco Bay Area, which includes parts of the Silicon Valley
      and areas like San Jose.


      3. **Compare locations**: Given that both are in California, with Apple University
      (or its equivalent) being in the San Francisco Bay Area and California South
      Bay University (if it existed) being in the South Bay area of California, we
      would determine their relative east-west positions. The South Bay area of California
      is generally south, not east, of the San Francisco Bay Area where Cupertino
      (and thus Apple) is located.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical analysis, since Apple University
      (or its equivalent location) is in the Cupertino area, and if we consider the
      South Bay area as the location for California South Bay University, Apple University
      would be north and slightly west or at a similar longitude to the South Bay
      area, not east.

      University does not appear to be a recognized institution in the traditional
      sense either, as there isn''t a well-known university by that exact name. However,
      for the sake of argument, let''s consider that it could be a fictional or less
      well-known institution located somewhere in the South Bay area of California,
      which includes cities like San Jose, Mountain View, and Palo Alto.


      2. **Understand Geographic Locations**: Cupertino, where Apple University is
      based, is located in the South Bay area of the San Francisco Bay Area in California.
      The South Bay refers to the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area,
      including parts of Santa Clara County.


      3. **Determine East/West Relationship**: Given that both institutions (if we
      consider them as being in the same general area for the sake of this thought
      experiment) are in the South Bay area, determining if one is east of the other
      requires knowing their exact locations within this area. Cupertino, where Apple
      University is, is relatively central in the South Bay area.


      4. **Conclusion Based on Hypothetical Locations**: Without specific addresses
      for California South Bay University (since it doesn''t appear to be a real institution),
      if we were to hypothetically place it anywhere in the South Bay area, the question
      of whether Apple University is east of it depends entirely on the precise location
      of California South Bay University. However, considering typical geographic
      understandings and assuming California South Bay University could be anywhere
      in the broader South Bay region, Apple University in Cupertino could potentially
      be east, west, north, or south of it, depending on the exact location of the
      hypothetical California South Bay University.


      Given the lack of clarity on the exact location of California South Bay University
      and considering Apple University''s known location in Cupertino, the question
      essentially becomes unanswerable with a simple "yes" or "no" without more specific

      Cupertino''s central location within this area, the likelihood of Apple University
      being strictly east of a hypothetical California South Bay University depends
      entirely on where exactly within the South Bay the latter is located.

      2. **Geographic Location**: Cupertino, where Apple University is based, is located
      in the South Bay area of the San Francisco Bay Area, California. If California
      South Bay University is indeed in the South Bay area, this places both institutions
      in the same general region.


      3. **East/West Determination**: To determine if Apple University is east of
      California South Bay University, we need to understand that the South Bay area
      is relatively compact. Cupertino, the location of Apple University, is west
      of the southern parts of the San Francisco Bay and east of the Pacific Ocean.
      Without a specific location for California South Bay University, if we consider
      the South Bay area as a whole, both institutions could potentially be in close

      Bay University.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of a specific location for California South
      Bay University and the fact that Apple University is in Cupertino, which is
      within the South Bay area, it''s challenging to definitively say one is east
      of the other without more precise information. However, if we consider the possibility
      that California South Bay University could be on the western edge of the South
      Bay (for example, in a city like Mountain View or further west), and Apple University
      is in Cupertino, it''s conceivable that Apple University could be east of it,

      also within the South Bay area.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Given that both Apple University (in Cupertino) and
      any university in the "South Bay" area (like San Jose State University) are
      within the same general region, their locations relative to each other (east-west)
      depend on the specific universities being compared. However, Cupertino (Apple

      in Cupertino, which is west or northwest of the general area that could be considered
      "South Bay" (if we''re considering a university like San Jose State University
      as a reference point for California South Bay University), it is not east of
      the South Bay area.

      \ a clear reference to a \"California South Bay University,\" we can consider\
      \ that the South Bay area of California is generally located in the western\
      \ part of the United States, specifically in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\
      3. **Determine East/West Location**:\n   - Given that Apple University (if we\
      \ were to consider it as being associated with Apple Inc.'s location) is in\
      \ the South Bay area of California, it is on the west coast of the United States.\n\
      \   - Without an actual \"California South Bay University,\" but knowing the\
      \ South Bay is also in California, we can infer that both would be in the same\
      \ general region if \"California South Bay University\" were a real entity located\
      \ in the South Bay area.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both entities (considering\
      \ the intended reference might be to institutions or locations within California's\
      \ South Bay area) are likely located in the same general area of California,\
      \ the question of one being east of the other becomes moot. However, if we strictly\
      \ interpret the question based on the assumption that both are in California\
      \ and considering the South Bay area itself is not \"east\" of itself, we can\
      \ deduce the answer.\n\nGiven these considerations and the lack of clear, real-world\
      \ references for \"Apple University\" and \"California South Bay University\"\
      \ as traditional educational institutions, the question seems to be based on\
      \ a premise that might not directly apply to real-world geography or institutions.\
      \ However, for the sake of providing an answer based on the assumption that\
      \ \"Apple University\" refers to a location associated with Apple Inc. in the\
      \ South Bay area and \"California South Bay University\" is a hypothetical institution\
      \ also in the South Bay area, the answer would lean towards \"NO\" because they\
      \ would be in the same general area, not one east of the other.\n\n**Answer:\
      \ NO**"
    faff3b8c-122f-42a1-b8a4-1975d5d9579a: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Apple University and California South Bay University. Apple University is located
      in Cupertino, California, which is in the San Francisco Bay Area, also known
      as the South Bay. California South Bay University doesn''t seem to be a real
      institution based on standard listings of universities, but for the sake of
      argument, let''s assume it''s located in the South Bay area of California, which
      could encompass a broad region including parts of the San Francisco Bay Area.


      2. **Understand geographical terms**: "East of" refers to the direction. Something
      that is east of another location is to the east of it on a map.


      3. **Apply geographical knowledge**: Cupertino, where Apple University is, is
      located west of the central part of the South Bay area if we consider the South
      Bay to include areas like San Jose and parts of Silicon Valley.


      4. **Consider the hypothetical university''s location**: Without a specific
      location for California South Bay University, we must consider the question''s
      intent. If California South Bay University were in the eastern part of the South
      Bay (for example, in or around the eastern edges of San Jose), Apple University
      would indeed be west of it, not east.


      5. **Conclusion based on reasoning**: Given the information and the process
      of elimination, we can see that Apple University is likely west of any location
      considered to be in the "South Bay" area of California, assuming California
      South Bay University is intended to be a part of or representative of institutions
      in that area.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis, the answer to whether Apple University,
      CA is located east of California South Bay University, CA is: **NO**.'

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of the University
      of Virginia Center for Pontialitics and the International Residel College. The
      University of Virginia (UVA) is located in Charlottesvlle, iVirginia. Both the
      Center for Politics and the International Residential College are associated
      with the University of Virginia.

      of Virginia is located on the UVA campus in Charlottesville. Howeexaver, the
      uilding ct bor its precise location on campus isn''t specified in the question,
      so we''ll consider it as being part of the UVA campus.


      3. **International Residential College Location**: The International Residtial
      College (ented on the UVIRC) at UVA is also locaA campus. It''s designed for
      students interested in international studies and global issues, providing a
      residencommutial nity with this focus.


      4. **Relative Locations**: Without specific addresses or a detailed map of the

      be challenging. e twHowever, given that both are part of the UVA campus, we''re
      essentially comparing locations within a relatively small geographic area.


      5. **UVA Campus Layout**: The University of Virginia campus is laid out with
      various schools, centers, and colleges distributed across it. The campus''s

      2. **Identify the International Residential College location**: The International
      Residential College (IRC) is also a part of the University of Virginia, located
      in Charlottesville, Virginia. It is situated on the university''s grounds.


      3. **Compare locations**: To determine if the University of Virginia Center
      for Politics is east of the International Residential College, we would need
      their exact locations on the campus map. However, without specific addresses
      or coordinates, we can consider general campus geography.


      Given that both institutions are part of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville,

      a residential facility, might be located in a area of the campus designed for
      student housing, which can vary in location. The Center for Politics, focusing
      on academic and research activities related to politics, could be situated near
      other academic buildings.

      both entities are part of it.


      2. **Campus Map**: Typically, to determine the relative positions of buildings
      or centers within a university, one would consult a campus map. However, without

      on political analysis and public service. The International Residential College
      (IRC) is a living-learning community that might be situated in a residential
      area of the campus.


      4. **General Orientation**: Without specific details, we consider the general
      layout of the University of Virginia. The main campus is situated in Charlottesville,
      Virginia. Buildings and facilities are spread across the campus, but without
      a map, we can''t determine their exact locations relative to each other.


      5. **Decision**: Given the lack of specific information on the exact locations
      of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and the International Residential
      College within the UVA campus, we cannot definitively say whether the Center
      for Politics is east of the International Residential College.


      However, the question demands a YES or NO answer, suggesting a simplification
      or assumption based on available or general knowledge. Without specific information
      or a campus map, any answer would be speculative. But considering typical university
      layouts and assuming the Center for Politics might be in a more central location,
      while the International Residential College could be in a variety of locations
      depending on the campus layout, we must still make an educated guess based on
      the typical east-west orientation of many US campuses and the possible placement
      of such facilities.


      Given these considerations and the necessity to provide a definitive answer
      despite the speculative nature of this analysis, the answer would have to be
      based on the assumption that one could typically find administrative or political

    7e73ec2a-e6b4-46ac-994e-fe359a90ad7b: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the University of Virginia Center for Politics and the International Residential
      College. The University of Virginia Center for Politics is located in Charlottesville,
      Virginia. The International Residential College is also a part of the University
      of Virginia, indicating it is likely located in or near Charlottesville as well.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Without exact addresses, we can consider
      the general layout of the University of Virginia. The university''s main campus
      is situated in Charlottesville, Virginia. If both institutions are part of the
      University of Virginia, they are likely on or near the main campus.


      3. **Consider Virginia''s Geography**: Virginia is a state in the eastern United
      States. Charlottesville, where the University of Virginia is located, is in
      the central part of the state. However, since both locations are within Virginia
      and likely within Charlottesville, we''re looking at a very localized comparison
      rather than a statewide or national one.


      4. **Final Consideration**: Given that both the University of Virginia Center
      for Politics and the International Residential College are affiliated with the
      University of Virginia and presumably located on or very near the university''s
      campus in Charlottesville, Virginia, determining their relative east-west positions
      requires specific address information or a campus map, which is not provided.
      However, considering the question asks for a yes or no answer regarding whether
      one is east of the other, we must consider the typical layout and geography
      of university campuses and the city of Charlottesville.


      Without specific addresses or a detailed map of the University of Virginia''s
      campus showing the exact locations of both the Center for Politics and the International
      Residential College, it''s challenging to definitively answer this question
      based solely on the information given. However, given the nature of the question
      and the requirement for a yes or no answer, one might assume that if there''s
      a basis for comparison (i.e., they are not in the same building or exact location),
      determining which is east of the other would depend on their specific locations
      on campus.


      Given the above steps and assuming the question implies a comparison based on
      their locations within the University of Virginia, the answer could be derived
      from knowing the campus layout or the exact positions of these entities. But
      without that specific information, we must rely on general knowledge and the
      fact that such specific locations are typically determinable with a map.


      Therefore, based on the process of reasoning and without specific location details,
      I must provide an answer that acknowledges the lack of precise information but
      also recognizes the nature of geographical comparisons:


      YES'
    8a66b302-d682-4a74-bc2a-bf3021fbf01c: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the University of Virginia Center for Politics and the International Residential
      College. The University of Virginia Center for Politics is located in Charlottesville,
      Virginia, on the grounds of the University of Virginia. The International Residential
      College is also a part of the University of Virginia, located in Charlottesville.


      2. **Relative Positions**: Next, we need to understand the relative positions
      of these two entities within the University of Virginia. The University of Virginia
      is a large campus, but generally, it is laid out with various schools, centers,
      and residential colleges in different areas. Without specific addresses or a
      detailed map, we can''t determine exact east-west relationships just from their
      names or general knowledge about the university.


      3. **University of Virginia Layout**: The University of Virginia''s campus is
      not strictly divided into east-west sections in a way that''s publicly well-known
      without a map. However, knowing that both institutions are part of the University
      of Virginia and likely within a reasonable distance of each other on campus,
      the question becomes about their specific locations relative to each other.


      4. **Center for Politics Location**: The Center for Politics is housed in a
      building on the University of Virginia''s campus but does not have a distinct,
      separate location that is widely recognized as being on one side of the campus
      or the other without more specific information.


      5. **International Residential College Location**: The International Residential
      College (IRC) at the University of Virginia is known to be located on the grounds
      of the university but again, without a map or detailed description, pinpointing
      its exact location relative to the Center for Politics is challenging.


      Given these considerations and the lack of detailed geographical information
      about the exact locations of these two entities within the University of Virginia,
      it''s not possible to definitively answer the question based solely on the information
      provided and general knowledge. However, since I must provide a YES or NO answer

      in Oklahoma is located east of Sam Houston State University in Texas, let''s
      break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Rogers State University is in Oklahoma, and Sam
      Houston State University is in Texas.


      2. **Understand geographical directions**: East refers to the direction towards
      the sunrise, and in the context of the United States, moving east means moving
      towards the Atlantic Ocean from any given point.


      3. **Compare the general locations of Oklahoma and Texas**: Oklahoma is located
      to the north of Texas. However, the question is about east-west positioning,
      not north-south.


      4. **Specific locations**: Rogers State University is in Claremore, Oklahoma,
      which is in the northeastern part of Oklahoma. Sam Houston State University
      is in Huntsville, Texas, which is in the southeastern part of Texas, but more
      towards the eastern part of the state.


      5. **Consider longitude**: To determine if one is east of the other, we can
      look at their longitudes. Generally, Oklahoma is west of Texas when considering
      their geographical positions in the United States.


      6. **Final comparison**: Since Oklahoma is generally west of Texas, and considering
      the specific locations of Rogers State University and Sam Houston State University,
      Rogers State University would likely be west of Sam Houston State University,
      not east.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: **NO**'

      \ in Enid, Oklahoma.\n\n**Concordia University Texas, TX**: This university\
      \ is located in Austin, Texas.\n\n**Comparing Locations**:\n- Enid, Oklahoma\

      \ approximately 30.3\xB0N, 97.7\xB0W.\n\nGiven these coordinates, we can see\
      \ that Austin, Texas (Concordia University Texas) is slightly east and significantly\
      \ south of Enid, Oklahoma (Phillips University). However, the east-west difference\
      \ is minimal, with Austin being only about 0.2 degrees west of Enid, which translates\

      to determine the locations of Phillips University, OK, and Concordia University
      Texas, TX.


      1. **Identify the location of Phillips University, OK**: Phillips University
      was located in Enid, Oklahoma. Oklahoma is generally considered to be in the
      western part of the United States, more specifically in the South-Central region.


      2. **Identify the location of Concordia University Texas, TX**: Concordia University
      Texas is located in Austin, Texas. Texas is also in the southern United States
      but is generally considered to be southeast of Oklahoma.


      3. **Compare the locations**: To determine if Phillips University, OK, is east
      of Concordia University Texas, TX, we must understand the geographical relationship
      between Oklahoma and Texas. Oklahoma is north of Texas, and considering their
      overall positions, parts of Oklahoma can be both east and west of parts of Texas
      due to their large sizes and the fact that Oklahoma is directly north of Texas.


      4. **Specific locations comparison**: Enid, Oklahoma (where Phillips University
      was located), is more towards the northwestern part of Oklahoma. Austin, Texas
      (where Concordia University Texas is located), is in the central part of Texas.
      Given these specific locations, Enid, Oklahoma, is generally northwest of Austin,
      Texas.

      University College of Health and Human Sciences and Purdue University College
      of Agriculture are part of Purdue University, which is located in West Lafayette,
      Indiana.


      2. **Campus Layout**: Purdue University has a single main campus in West Lafayette,
      Indiana. Both the College of Health and Human Sciences and the College of Agriculture
      are housed within this campus.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Without specific building locations or a detailed
      map, it''s challenging to determine the exact relative positions of these colleges
      on the campus. However, given that they are both part of the same university
      and situated on the same campus, their locations are relatively close to each
      other.


      4. **East/West Determination**: To determine if one is located east of the other,
      we would need precise information on their building locations or a map of the
      Purdue University campus. However, the question seems to imply a comparison
      based on their names or general knowledge, rather than specific geographical

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand that both the Purdue
      University College of Health and Human Sciences and the Purdue University College
      of Agriculture are part of Purdue University.


      2. **Campus Layout**: Purdue University is located in West Lafayette, Indiana.
      The university''s colleges and schools are distributed across its campus, but
      they are not typically referred to as being in separate locations within the
      state in terms of "east" or "west" since they are part of the same campus.


      3. **Interpretation of Question**: The question seems to imply a comparison
      of geographical locations within Indiana (IN), asking if one college is east
      of the other. However, given that both colleges are part of Purdue University
      and presumably located on or very near the main campus in West Lafayette, Indiana,
      the question''s premise may be misleading or based on a misunderstanding of
      how university campuses are organized.


      4. **Conclusion**: Without specific information on the exact locations of these
      colleges within the Purdue University campus (and assuming they are both located
      on the main campus in West Lafayette, IN), it''s reasonable to conclude that
      the question''s framing might not accurately reflect the typical way locations
      within a university campus are compared. However, if we are to take the question
      at face value and consider the possibility that these colleges could have satellite
      locations or extensions elsewhere in the state (which is not specified), we''d
      still lack the specific geographical information needed to definitively answer
      the question.


      Given the information typically available and the assumption that both colleges
      are located on the Purdue University campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, the
      most straightforward interpretation would lead us to conclude that the question''s
      premise might be flawed or that it''s based on an assumption that these colleges
      have distinct geographical locations outside of the main campus. However, without
      explicit details on their locations relative to each other within the campus
      or the state, providing a definitive "YES" or "NO" answer involves making assumptions.


      Therefore, based on the typical understanding of university campuses and the
      lack of specific geographical details in the question, the answer would lean
      towards "NO" under the assumption that both colleges are situated on or near
      the main Purdue University campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, and thus not distinctly
      "east" or "west" of each other in a manner that would be meaningful for separate
      locations within the state.

      steps:


      1. **Identify the locations** of both universities.

      2. **Compare their geographical positions**, specifically focusing on their
      longitudinal (east-west) coordinates.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Saint Joseph''s University is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

      - University of the Sciences is also located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      Since both universities are in Philadelphia, we need to look at their specific
      addresses or areas within the city to determine their relative east-west positions.


      - Saint Joseph''s University is situated in the northwest part of Philadelphia.

      - University of the Sciences is located in the west part of Philadelphia, but
      more specifically, it''s near the western edge of the city, close to the Schuylkill
      River.


      Given that both universities are in the western part of Philadelphia, with Saint
      Joseph''s being more to the northwest and University of the Sciences being to
      the west, we must consider the exact longitudinal positions or the general geography
      of Philadelphia to make a precise determination.


      However, since Philadelphia is a large city and both universities are on the
      western side, the question simplifies to comparing their relative positions
      within this western area. Saint Joseph''s University, being more to the northwest,
      could potentially be considered east of University of the Sciences if the latter
      is sufficiently to the west or southwest. But given the close proximity and
      the fact that both are in the western part of the city, the difference might
      be negligible or dependent on the specific definition of "east" in this context.


      Given this analysis, without precise longitudinal coordinates, the determination
      might seem complex. However, considering typical understandings of Philadelphia''s
      layout and assuming a general definition of "east" as meaning directly east
      or somewhat eastward in a broad sense within the city''s context, we could argue

      \ (PA). \n\n2. **Saint Joseph's University Location**: Saint Joseph's University\
      \ is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More specifically, it has campuses\
      \ in Lower Merion and Philadelphia.\n\n3. **University of the Sciences Location**:\
      \ University of the Sciences is also located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\
      \ \n\n4. **Compare Locations**: Since both universities are in Philadelphia,\
      \ we need to consider their exact locations within the city to determine if\

      \ can be described in terms of their proximity to the Delaware River (which\
      \ forms the eastern boundary of the city) or their position relative to major\
      \ landmarks or neighborhoods.\n\n5. **Determine East-West Orientation**: Without\
      \ the exact addresses, we can consider the general areas where these universities\

      \ west of the city center and the Delaware River, which serves as a reference\
      \ point for the eastern edge of the city.\n\n7. **Final Consideration**: For\

      \ 54th Street, both in the western part of Philadelphia, we can make an educated\
      \ guess about their relative positions.\n\nGiven the above considerations, and\
      \ knowing that \"east\" refers to being closer to the Delaware River relative\

      \ within Philadelphia.\n\n**Answer**: \nTo give an accurate answer without exact\
      \ coordinates or a detailed map showing both locations, let's consider their\
      \ general areas. University of the Sciences is near 42nd and Woodland, and Saint\
      \ Joseph's University is near City Avenue. City Avenue (which forms part of\
      \ the border between Philadelphia and the suburbs to the west) is generally\
      \ west of 42nd Street in the context of Philadelphia's grid. However, considering\
      \ the specific geography and the fact that both are in West Philadelphia but\
      \ the question asks about being \"east,\" the critical factor is their relative\
      \ position to each other, not their absolute position within the city.\n\nGiven\
      \ the nature of Philadelphia's layout and assuming the question aims to test\
      \ understanding of relative positions within the city, the exact answer depends\
      \ on precise locations. However, since both universities are essentially in\
      \ the western part of Philadelphia, and without more specific geographic information\
      \ or a map, one might initially think the question is about their relative positions\
      \ within that western area.\n\nBut considering typical addresses and locations:\n\
      - University of the Sciences: Around 600 S 43rd St, Philadelphia, PA 19104\n\
      - Saint Joseph's University: Main campus around 5600 City Ave, Philadelphia,\
      \ PA 19131\n\nAnd knowing City Avenue is a significant western boundary, and\
      \ considering the layout of Philadelphia, Saint Joseph's University, being on\
      \ City Avenue, is generally at the western edge of the city, whereas University\
      \ of the Sciences is slightly more eastward in the context of West Philadelphia,\
      \ given the grid layout of the city and the fact that City Avenue marks a western\
      \ boundary.\n\nTherefore, considering the above steps and understanding the\

      these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Des
      Moines University and Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.
      Both universities are located in Des Moines, Iowa.


      2. **Compare locations**: Since both are in Des Moines, the next step is to
      determine their relative positions within the city. Des Moines University is
      located in the downtown area of Des Moines. Drake University, including its
      College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, is also located in Des Moines, specifically
      in the Dogwood/Honda neighborhood but more generally associated with the area
      around University Avenue.


      3. **Determine east-west orientation**: Given that both institutions are in
      Des Moines, to determine if one is east of the other, we need to look at their
      specific addresses or known locations within the city. Des Moines University''s
      main campus is at 3200 Grand Avenue, Des Moines, IA 50312. Drake University
      is located at 2507 University Avenue, Des Moines, IA 50311.


      4. **Apply geographical knowledge**: Knowing the street layout of Des Moines,
      Grand Avenue and University Avenue run somewhat parallel to each other, with
      Grand Avenue being more to the west and University Avenue to the east in the
      context of these universities'' locations.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general locations and assuming the main campuses
      are being referenced, Des Moines University would be west of Drake University,
      given their respective locations on Grand Avenue and University Avenue.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Des Moines University is located east of Drake

      \ in Mesa. However, since both are mentioned in the context of Arizona, we are\
      \ comparing their positions within the state.\n    - Given that Northcentral\
      \ University does not have a widely recognized physical campus in Arizona (it's\
      \ primarily an online university), the question might imply comparing the general\

    c1df4d65-47ba-4d9e-be90-09c35ae9aa20: 'To determine if Northcentral University,
      AZ is located east of Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      universities. Northcentral University is based in San Diego, California, but
      it has an online presence and may have a location in Arizona due to its online
      nature. However, for the sake of this question, let''s consider it as being
      referenced in Arizona. Wilkes University has a location in Mesa, Arizona.


      2. **Geographical Positioning**: Next, we need to understand the geographical
      positioning of these locations in Arizona. Mesa, Arizona, is a city located
      in Maricopa County, which is in the south-central part of the state.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Since we are comparing the relative east-west positions
      of these universities, we need to determine the specific locations within Arizona.
      Northcentral University, if we consider its Arizona presence, does not have
      a specific physical campus location that is widely recognized like traditional
      universities. However, for the purpose of this question, let''s focus on the
      fact that we are comparing its general Arizona presence to Wilkes University
      in Mesa.


      4. **Wilkes University in Mesa**: Mesa is a city that is relatively central
      in Arizona but leans towards the eastern part of the Phoenix metropolitan area.
      Without a specific location for Northcentral University in Arizona that is widely
      recognized, we can consider the general area where these universities might
      be in relation to each other.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Northcentral University does not have a widely
      recognized physical campus in Arizona (it''s primarily an online university
      based in California) and considering we''re discussing a hypothetical or general
      presence in Arizona, it''s challenging to directly compare. However, considering
      Wilkes University is in Mesa, and if Northcentral University were to have a
      presence in Arizona, it''s unlikely that its general presence would be specifically
      designated as east or west without a clear location. But since Northcentral
      University is not physically located in Arizona in a traditional sense, and
      assuming we''re discussing a theoretical Arizona location for it, the question
      becomes about the relative positioning of Arizona locations.


      Given the information and the steps outlined, the question seems to imply a
      comparison that isn''t straightforward due to Northcentral University''s online
      nature and lack of a specific Arizona campus. However, for the sake of answering
      based on the premise that we''re discussing hypothetical or general locations
      within Arizona, and acknowledging that Mesa (where Wilkes University is located)
      is more towards the central part of the state but on the eastern side of the
      Phoenix area, without specific details on Northcentral''s Arizona presence,
      it''s a bit of a challenge.


      But considering the essence of the question and the need for a YES or NO answer:


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to identify the locations of Drury University
      and Missouri State University. Both are located in Missouri, but we need their
      specific locations within the state.


      2. **Drury University location**: Drury University is located in Springfield,
      Missouri.


      3. **Missouri State University location**: Missouri State University is also
      located in Springfield, Missouri.


      4. **Compare locations**: Since both universities are in the same city, Springfield,
      we need to consider their exact positions or addresses to determine if one is
      east of the other.


      5. **Determine east-west orientation**: Without specific addresses but knowing
      they are in the same city, the question seems to be asking for a general geographical
      comparison rather than a precise street-by-street analysis. However, given that
      both universities are in Springfield and not in different parts of the state,
      the difference in their locations would be minimal and not necessarily reflective
      of a clear east-west divide as the question implies.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that both universities are essentially in the same
      location (Springfield, MO), and without more precise information about their
      exact positions relative to each other (which would not significantly alter
      their overall location within the city), the question''s premise seems to be
      based on a misunderstanding of their geographical relationship. They are not
      in different parts of the state where an east-west comparison would make sense.


      However, to provide a direct answer based on the information that might be inferred
      from their shared location in Springfield, and considering the question might
      imply a need for a binary choice without the nuance of "same location":

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, identify the cities where Drury University
      and Missouri State University are located. Drury University is located in Springfield,
      Missouri, and Missouri State University is also located in Springfield, Missouri.


      2. **Compare locations**: Since both universities are in the same city, Springfield,
      Missouri, their locations relative to each other (east or west) are not about
      being in different cities or states but within the city itself.


      3. **Determine the relative positions within Springfield**: To accurately determine
      if one is east of the other, we would typically look at a map or know the specific
      addresses and their orientations within the city. However, given the information
      available, both universities being in Springfield suggests a need for more detailed
      local knowledge or a map to definitively say one is east of the other.


      4. **Conclusion based on typical knowledge**: Without a detailed map or specific
      addresses, one might infer that since they are in the same city, the difference
      in their locations would be relatively small and more about specific streets
      or areas within Springfield rather than broad cardinal directions like east
      or west. However, for the purpose of this question, we must consider if there''s
      any general knowledge or assumption that can be made about their relative positions.

      Missouri.


      3. **Missouri State University''s location**: Missouri State University is also
      located in Springfield, Missouri.


      4. **Compare locations**: Since both universities are in Springfield, Missouri,
      we must consider their exact positions within the city or their campuses'' layouts
      to determine if one is east of the other. However, given that they are in the
      same city and without specific directional information within that city, we
      can consider their general proximity.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both universities are in Springfield, Missouri,
      and without more precise information about their locations relative to each
      other within the city, the question essentially asks if Drury University is
      east of Missouri State University within the same city.


      However, considering the essence of the question and the fact that both universities
      are in the same city (Springfield, MO), and the question is about being "east"
      of each other, we should acknowledge that within a city, specific buildings
      or campuses can be east or west of each other based on their exact location.
      But given the lack of detailed directional information within Springfield and
      assuming the question intends to inquire about a significant geographical difference
      (which is not applicable here since they''re in the same city), we proceed to
      the final step.


      Given the information available and the nature of the question, the answer would
      be based on the understanding that both institutions are essentially in the
      same location (Springfield, MO), and without more detailed information about

      in Springfield, Missouri, and Missouri State University is also located in Springfield,
      Missouri.


      2. **Compare locations**: Since both universities are in the same city (Springfield,
      Missouri), we need to consider their exact positions within the city to determine
      if one is east of the other.


      3. **Determine the specific requirement**: The question asks if Drury University
      is located east of Missouri State University. This means we are looking for
      a geographical comparison within the city of Springfield.


      4. **Geographical comparison**: Given that both universities are situated in
      the same city and without precise geographical coordinates or a detailed map,
      one might initially think this comparison could be challenging. However, knowing
      that both institutions are in Springfield, Missouri, simplifies our task. The
      key information needed is the relative position of each university within Springfield.


      5. **Conclusion based on known information**: Without specific addresses or
      a map, the general knowledge is that Drury University and Missouri State University
      are both in Springfield, MO. If we consider typical city layouts and the fact
      that both are in the same city, the question seems to hinge on the precise locations
      within Springfield. However, it''s known that Drury University is situated southwest
      of downtown Springfield, and Missouri State University is located near downtown
      but more to the southeast when considering their general directions from the
      city center.

      the same city and considering general directions, Drury University is not east
      but rather southwest of the downtown area, and Missouri State University, while

    7ef8948b-8547-4a6a-b574-957d895cbac1: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to know the locations of both Widener
      University and Delaware State University in Delaware.


      2. **Widener University Location**: Widener University has a campus in Wilmington,
      Delaware, among other locations. Wilmington is in New Castle County, which is
      in the northern part of Delaware.


      3. **Delaware State University Location**: Delaware State University has its
      main campus in Dover, Delaware, which is the capital of Delaware and located
      more centrally in the state, specifically in Kent County.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Delaware is a relatively small state, but we can
      still determine the relative east-west positions of these universities. Wilmington
      (where Widener University is located) is generally to the north of Dover (where
      Delaware State University is located), but since Delaware is narrow, the east-west
      distinction is more about the specific longitude rather than a broad geographical
      area.


      5. **Determining East-West**: Given that Dover is more central and slightly
      east of the northern part of Delaware where Wilmington is located, we can consider
      their positions relative to each other in terms of east-west orientation.


      6. **Conclusion**: Considering the general geography of Delaware and the locations
      of these universities, Widener University in Wilmington is not significantly
      east of Delaware State University in Dover. In fact, Dover is slightly east
      of Wilmington in terms of longitude. However, the question asks if Widener University
      is east of Delaware State University, which requires a precise understanding
      of their geographical positions.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      To determine if Widener University in Delaware is located east of Delaware State
      University, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to know the locations of both universities.
      Widener University has a campus in Wilmington, Delaware, and Delaware State
      University is located in Dover, Delaware.


      2. **Understand Geography**: Next, we should understand the geography of Delaware
      to determine the relative positions of Wilmington and Dover. Delaware is a small
      state with Wilmington located in the northern part and Dover situated more centrally
      but towards the south.


      3. **Compare Locations**: Wilmington, where Widener University is located, is
      generally to the north of Dover, where Delaware State University is located.
      In terms of cardinal directions (north, south, east, west), north is the primary
      direction from Dover to Wilmington, not east.


      4. **Determine Direction**: Given that Wilmington is north of Dover, and considering
      the layout of Delaware, Widener University would not be east of Delaware State
      University but rather north.


      Therefore, based on the relative positions of Wilmington (Widener University)

      the location of both Widener University and Delaware State University within

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we identify the locations of both universities.
      Widener University has a campus in Wilmington, Delaware, but it''s essential
      to note that Widener University is primarily based in Chester, Pennsylvania.
      However, for the sake of this question, we''re focusing on its Delaware presence.
      Delaware State University is located in Dover, Delaware.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Next, we consider the geographical orientation
      of these locations within Delaware. Wilmington, where Widener University''s
      Delaware campus is located, is in the northern part of the state, near the Pennsylvania
      border. Dover, the location of Delaware State University, is more centrally
      located in Delaware but is south of Wilmington.


      3. **East-West Orientation**: Delaware is a relatively narrow state from east
      to west, with the Delaware Bay and River forming its eastern border and the
      Maryland border to the west and south. Given this, moving from west to east
      in Delaware means moving towards the Delaware Bay or the Atlantic Ocean.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Comparing the locations, Widener University in Wilmington
      is more to the north and slightly west of Delaware State University in Dover.
      However, since Dover is not directly west of Wilmington but rather south, the
      key consideration is their east-west alignment. Wilmington (Widener University)
      is not significantly east or west of Dover (Delaware State University) in a
      way that would make one decidedly east of the other, considering Delaware''s
      narrow width. Still, given Wilmington''s position relative to Dover, it is slightly
      east due to Delaware''s geography and the fact that Wilmington is closer to
      the Delaware River, which forms part of the eastern boundary of the state.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical positions, Widener University in Wilmington,
      Delaware, is indeed located east of Delaware State University in Dover, Delaware,

    07805988-c726-4bda-b06c-97b1e5e4dae3: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Cordoba
      University and Army Logistics University in Virginia. However, I must note that
      the name "Cordoba University" is not widely recognized in the context of institutions
      in Virginia. There''s a possibility it might be a lesser-known, private, or
      non-traditional institution, or it could be an error or confusion with another
      institution''s name. On the other hand, the Army Logistics University (ALU)
      is a well-known institution located in Fort Lee, Virginia.


      2. **Location of Army Logistics University**: The Army Logistics University
      is located at Fort Lee, Virginia. Fort Lee is situated in Prince George County,
      Virginia, which is in the eastern part of the state, relatively close to Richmond,
      the state capital.


      3. **Attempt to locate Cordoba University**: Without specific details on Cordoba
      University, such as its exact location or even confirmation of its existence
      in Virginia, it''s challenging to determine its geographical location relative
      to Army Logistics University. If Cordoba University is not a recognized institution
      in Virginia, or if it''s a mistake, this question becomes speculative.


      4. **Consider possible locations**: Assuming Cordoba University exists in Virginia
      (which is uncertain without further information), to determine if it''s east
      of Army Logistics University, we would need to know its exact location. Virginia
      spans a significant geographical area, with institutions spread across the state.
      The eastern part of Virginia includes the coastal regions and areas near the
      Chesapeake Bay, while the western parts are more mountainous and include the
      Shenandoah Valley.


      5. **Conclusion based on available information**: Given the uncertainty about
      Cordoba University''s existence and location in Virginia, it''s not possible
      to accurately determine its geographical relationship to Army Logistics University
      without more specific information.


      However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and considering the steps
      above, the most appropriate response, given the lack of information about Cordoba
      University, would be based on the assumption that without confirmation of its
      existence or location, we cannot accurately compare its location to that of
      Army Logistics University. Therefore, the question cannot be definitively answered
      with the information provided.


      But, to comply with the format and acknowledging the lack of specific information

      located in Fort Lee, Virginia. Fort Lee is situated in Prince George County,
      Virginia, which is in the southeastern part of the state.


      4. **Comparison**: Since we were unable to confirm the existence or location

      \n1. **Identify Locations**: \n   - First, we need to identify the locations\
      \ of both Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology (MSPP) and Newton\
      \ College of the Sacred Heart.\n   - Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology\
      \ is located in Newton, Massachusetts.\n   - Newton College of the Sacred Heart\
      \ was also located in Newton, Massachusetts, but it's essential to note that\
      \ Newton College of the Sacred Heart merged with Boston College in 1974, so\
      \ it no longer exists as a separate entity. However, for the purpose of this\
      \ geographical comparison, we'll consider its historical location.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ East-West Orientation**:\n   - To determine if MSPP is east of Newton College\
      \ of the Sacred Heart, we need to understand the geographical layout of Newton,\
      \ Massachusetts.\n   - Newton is a city located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts,\
      \ and it is situated west of Boston.\n\n3. **Specific Locations Within Newton**:\n\
      \   - The precise locations within Newton are crucial. MSPP is situated at 1\
      \ Wells Avenue, Newton, MA 02459.\n   - Newton College of the Sacred Heart was\
      \ located on Commonwealth Avenue (Route 30) in Newton, but the exact address\
      \ is less relevant since we are comparing general locations within the city.\n\
      \n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Given that both institutions are in Newton, the key\
      \ is understanding the layout of Newton and the relative positions of these\
      \ locations.\n   - Without exact coordinates or a detailed map, we can't make\
      \ a precise determination based solely on the information provided. However,\
      \ considering Newton's layout and assuming MSPP's location on Wells Avenue and\
      \ Newton College of the Sacred Heart's location on Commonwealth Avenue, we would\
      \ typically need to look at a map to determine their relative east-west positions.\n\
      \n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Newton College of the Sacred Heart is no longer\
      \ in operation and considering the need for specific geographical data to accurately\
      \ determine the locations' relative positions, the question seems to require\
      \ more detailed information than provided. However, for the sake of providing\
      \ an answer based on typical geographical analysis and acknowledging the limitations,\
      \ let's proceed with the assumption that we have access to the necessary geographical\
      \ data.\n\nGiven the steps and the need for geographical detail, without specific\
      \ information on the relative east-west positions of MSPP and the former Newton\
      \ College of the Sacred Heart within Newton, MA, it's challenging to provide\
      \ a definitive YES or NO answer. However, acknowledging the requirement for\

      \ the steps needed to determine if Atlantic University, VA is located east of\
      \ Misericordia University, PA.\n\n1. **Identify the location of Atlantic University,\
      \ VA**: First, we need to establish the location of Atlantic University in Virginia.\
      \ However, there seems to be a misunderstanding because there isn't a well-known\
      \ institution by the name of \"Atlantic University\" in Virginia that is widely\
      \ recognized in the context of American higher education. There is, however,\
      \ Atlantic University, which could refer to Atlantic University, a private online\
      \ university, but for geographical comparison, we'll consider Virginia's general\
      \ location.\n\n2. **Identify the location of Misericordia University, PA**:\
      \ Misericordia University is located in Dallas, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is\
      \ a state in the northeastern United States.\n\n3. **Compare the locations**:\
      \ Virginia is generally southeast of Pennsylvania. Given the geography of the\
      \ United States, locations in Virginia are typically southeast of locations\
      \ in Pennsylvania, depending on the specific parts of the states being compared.\n\
      \n4. **Determine if Atlantic University, VA is east of Misericordia University,\
      \ PA**: Given that Virginia is generally to the southeast of Pennsylvania, and\
      \ assuming Atlantic University refers to a location within Virginia, we would\
      \ consider if this location is east of Misericordia University in Pennsylvania.\
      \ Since Virginia stretches further south and slightly east of Pennsylvania,\
      \ but considering the general geography, parts of Virginia could indeed be east\
      \ of parts of Pennsylvania, depending on the specific locations within each\
      \ state.\n\nHowever, without a precise location for \"Atlantic University, VA\"\
      \ and considering typical geographical understandings, we recognize Virginia\
      \ as being generally southeast of Pennsylvania. Misericordia University is in\
      \ the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, which would place it relatively north\
      \ of most of Virginia. \n\nGiven these considerations and the specific question\
      \ of whether Atlantic University, VA (assuming a Virginia location) is east\
      \ of Misericordia University, PA, the answer hinges on the geographical relationship\
      \ between the two states and the specific locations within them. Since Virginia\
      \ is to the southeast, and Misericordia University is in northeastern Pennsylvania,\
      \ it's plausible that parts of Virginia could be east of it, but the question\
      \ lacks specificity regarding \"Atlantic University, VA.\"\n\nGiven the information\
      \ and focusing strictly on the geographical aspect without specific coordinates\
      \ or a recognized institution by that name in Virginia for a precise comparison,\
      \ the reasoning might lead to a less direct conclusion. However, typically,\
      \ when considering the easternmost parts of Virginia and the location of Misericordia\
      \ University in northeastern Pennsylvania, one might argue that yes, parts of\
      \ Virginia (and thus potentially a university located within it, if it were\
      \ precisely located in the eastern part of the state) could indeed be east of\
      \ Misericordia University, PA.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{YES}$"
    e50ea660-c2f7-4299-9d8d-221d3cc78691: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Atlantic
      University, VA, and Misericordia University, PA. Atlantic University is in Virginia,
      and Misericordia University is in Pennsylvania.


      2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Next, we determine the general
      geographical positions of these states. Virginia (VA) is located in the southeastern
      United States, while Pennsylvania (PA) is in the northeastern United States.


      3. **Compare the positions**: Considering the general geography of the United
      States, the southeastern part of the country (where Virginia is located) is
      generally south and slightly east of the northeastern part (where Pennsylvania
      is located).


      4. **Specific locations within the states**: However, to answer the question
      accurately, we need to consider the specific locations within these states.
      Misericordia University is located in Dallas, Pennsylvania, which is in the
      northeastern part of the state, relatively close to the eastern border of Pennsylvania.


      5. **Atlantic University''s location**: Since there might not be a well-known
      "Atlantic University" in Virginia (it''s possible the question refers to Atlantic
      University College in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, or another institution, but assuming
      it''s asking about an institution in Virginia), for the sake of this question,
      we''ll consider a hypothetical Atlantic University in Virginia. Virginia is
      a long state, stretching from the Atlantic coast westward into the Appalachian
      Mountains. Without a specific city, it''s challenging to pinpoint, but if we
      consider major cities in Virginia like Virginia Beach or Norfolk, these are
      directly south of Pennsylvania.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that Virginia is generally south of Pennsylvania and
      considering the eastern part of Virginia is still south of the eastern part
      of Pennsylvania, an institution in Virginia (east or otherwise) would typically
      be south, not east, of an institution in northeastern Pennsylvania.


      Based on the steps and considering the geographical layout of the United States,
      the answer is: **NO**'

      the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of South
      University, GA, and Ralston College, GA. However, to proceed, I must clarify
      that there seems to be a misunderstanding or a need for clarification in the

      2. **Location of South University, GA**: Assuming South University, GA, refers
      to the South University campus located in Savannah, Georgia, or another location
      within the state, we can consider its general location. Savannah, for instance,
      is located in the eastern part of Georgia.


      3. **Clarification on Ralston College, GA**: Without clear information on Ralston
      College, including its location within Georgia, it''s challenging to determine

      the first location must be situated to the east of the second on a map. Without
      the exact location of Ralston College or confirmation of its existence, we cannot
      accurately make this determination.

      the locations of South University and Ralston College in Georgia.


      1. **Identify South University''s location**: South University has multiple
      campuses across the United States, but when referring to Georgia, it''s essential
      to pinpoint which campus. South University''s main campus in Georgia is located
      in Savannah.


      2. **Identify Ralston College''s location**: After conducting research, it appears
      that there might be confusion or a lack of information on a "Ralston College"
      in Georgia. Without specific details on Ralston College, including its exact
      location, it''s challenging to compare its location directly with South University''s.


      3. **Determine the relative locations**: Given the potential lack of clarity
      around Ralston College''s existence or location in Georgia, a direct comparison
      to determine if South University (in Savannah, GA) is east of Ralston College
      is not feasible without more specific information about Ralston College.


      However, since the question format demands a YES or NO answer and considering
      the steps above did not conclusively resolve the query due to the ambiguity
      surrounding Ralston College, the most appropriate response, based on the information
      available and the requirement for a definitive answer, would have to consider
      the assumption that Ralston College might not be a recognized or easily locatable
      institution in Georgia, which complicates the comparison.


      Given the constraint of the question and the need for a clear YES or NO answer,
      and without specific locations for both institutions that can be verified, the
      response must be based on the information that can be confirmed. Since South
      University in Savannah, GA, is known to be on the eastern side of Georgia, and
      without a verifiable location for Ralston College to make a direct comparison,
      the question''s premise may rely on unverifiable assumptions about Ralston College''s
      location.


      Thus, based on the available and verifiable information, the answer would lean
      towards an inability to confirm the relative locations accurately due to the
      lack of clear information on Ralston College. However, the format requires a
      choice between YES or NO, suggesting an answer based on the assumption that
      the question intends to test knowledge of geographical locations within Georgia,

      Given these considerations and the need to select one of the options provided
      (YES or NO), and acknowledging the primary issue of not having sufficient information

      affirm the statement without clear evidence, which leads towards a negative

      4. **Comparing Locations**: Since we know South University is in Savannah, which
      is on the eastern coast of Georgia, to determine if it''s east of Ralston College,

      5. **Conclusion Based on Available Information**: Without the exact location
      of Ralston College, we cannot directly compare its location to South University''s
      Savannah location. However, given that Savannah is on the eastern edge of Georgia,
      for South University to be east of Ralston College, Ralston College would need

      in Georgia and anywhere west of Savannah, the answer would be YES. However,
      without confirming Ralston College''s existence and exact location, this is

    23c06f42-239b-41ae-9ed5-715954946197: 'To determine if California State University
      (CSU) is located east of Art Center College of Design (ACCD), we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. **Identify the Location of Art Center College of Design (ACCD):** Art Center
      College of Design is located in Pasadena, California. Pasadena is in Los Angeles
      County.


      2. **Identify the Location of California State University (CSU):** The question
      refers to "California State University, CA" without specifying which campus,
      as the California State University system is a large system with 23 campuses
      across the state of California. However, to proceed, we''ll consider the general
      direction from Pasadena, where ACCD is located.


      3. **Consider the Geographic Layout of California:** California is a long, narrow
      state that stretches from the Mexican border in the south to the Oregon border
      in the north. The eastern part of California includes the Sierra Nevada mountain
      range and the deserts of the southeastern part of the state.


      4. **Determine the Relative Positions:** Since Pasadena (and thus ACCD) is located
      in the southern part of the state, near the coast, we need to consider where
      the various CSU campuses are in relation to Pasadena. Most CSU campuses are
      near the coast or in the Central Valley of California.


      5. **Conclusion Based on Geographic Location:** Without specifying which CSU
      campus, it''s challenging to give a definitive answer. However, considering
      that many CSU campuses are located in the Central Valley or along the coast,
      and given that Pasadena is also near the coast, it''s possible for some CSU
      campuses to be east of ACCD, especially those located in the inland areas of
      Southern California or the Central Valley.


      Given these considerations and without specifying a particular CSU campus, it''s
      reasonable to conclude that some CSU campuses could indeed be located east of
      Art Center College of Design, depending on which specific CSU campus is being
      referred to.

      system with 23 campuses across California. Without a specific campus named,
      it''s broad to pinpoint an exact location, but most CSU campuses are spread
      throughout the state, including both coastal and inland areas.


      2. **Location of Art Center College of Design (ACCD):** ACCD is located in Pasadena,
      California. Pasadena is situated in Los Angeles County, which is in the southern
      part of the state, relatively close to the coast.


      3. **Determining East/West Location:** Since ACCD is in Pasadena, to be east
      of it, a location would need to be in the eastern part of Los Angeles County
      or further east into other counties like San Bernardino or Riverside.


      4. **CSU Campuses in Relation to ACCD:** While CSU has numerous campuses, some
      of which could indeed be east of Pasadena (like California State University,
      San Bernardino), others are located in various parts of the state, including
      areas west of Pasadena (e.g., California State University, Los Angeles, or campuses
      in the San Francisco Bay Area or Central Coast).


      Given the broad distribution of CSU campuses across California and the specific
      location of ACCD in Pasadena, without specifying which CSU campus is being referred
      to, it''s not possible to definitively say all CSU campuses are east of ACCD.
      However, some CSU campuses are indeed east of Pasadena.


      But considering the question seems to ask for a generalization about "California
      State University, CA" as a whole entity in relation to Art Center College of

      To determine if California State University (CSU) is located east of Art Center
      College of Design (ACCD), we first need to understand the locations of both
      institutions.


      1. **Identify the location of California State University (CSU):** California
      State University is a system of public universities, with multiple campuses
      spread across California. However, without specifying a particular campus, we
      can consider that many of its campuses are located in various parts of the state,
      including the northern, central, and southern regions.


      2. **Identify the location of Art Center College of Design (ACCD):** Art Center
      College of Design is located in Pasadena, California. Pasadena is in Los Angeles
      County, in the southern part of the state.


      3. **Determine the geographical relationship:** To determine if any CSU campus
      is east of ACCD, we need to consider the geography of California. Pasadena,
      where ACCD is located, is relatively in the southwest part of the state, near
      the coast.


      Given these considerations:

      - Some CSU campuses are located in the Central Valley or eastern parts of California,
      which could indeed be east of Pasadena.

      - However, without specifying which CSU campus, we must consider all possibilities.


      Therefore, considering the broad distribution of CSU campuses across California
      and the specific location of ACCD in Pasadena, the answer to whether California
      State University (without specifying a campus) is located east of Art Center
      College of Design is:

      1. **Identify the Location of California State University (CSU):** California
      State University is a large system with multiple campuses across California.
      Without specifying which CSU campus, it''s challenging to determine its exact
      location. However, most CSU campuses are spread throughout the state, including
      areas like Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and points in between.


      2. **Identify the Location of Art Center College of Design, CA:** Art Center
      College of Design is located in Pasadena, California. Pasadena is in Los Angeles
      County, situated northeast of downtown Los Angeles.


      3. **Comparative Location Analysis:** Given that Art Center College of Design
      is in Pasadena, to determine if a CSU campus is east of it, we must consider
      the geography of California. Pasadena is relatively west in the state, considering
      California''s coastline runs along its western edge. Many parts of California,
      including areas where CSU campuses are located, stretch eastward from the Los

      the locations of California State University (CSU) and Art Center College of
      Design (ACCD) in relation to each other, specifically in terms of their geographical
      positions (east or west).


      1. **Identify the location of California State University (CSU):** CSU is a
      large university system with multiple campuses across California. Since the
      question does not specify which CSU campus, we''ll consider the general location
      of the CSU system, which spans across the state, including both northern and
      southern parts of California.


      2. **Identify the location of Art Center College of Design (ACCD):** Art Center
      College of Design is located in Pasadena, California. Pasadena is in Los Angeles
      County, which places it in the southern part of California.


      3. **Determine the relative locations (east-west):** To determine if CSU is
      east of ACCD, we need to consider the geographical layout of California. The
      state stretches from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the eastern borders with
      Nevada and Arizona. Given that Pasadena (where ACCD is located) is in the southern
      part of California, near Los Angeles, we can infer that any part of California
      State University that would be considered "east" of ACCD would need to be on
      the eastern side of the San Gabriel Mountains or further east towards the desert
      regions of California.


      4. **Conclusion based on typical locations:** Since ACCD is in Pasadena, which
      is west of the San Gabriel Mountains and not far from the coast, any significant
      portion of CSU that is "east" would imply a location on the other side of the
      mountains or in the eastern desert regions of California. However, most CSU
      campuses are located in urban or suburban areas along the coast or in the Central
      Valley, which are generally west or northwest of Pasadena, not east.


      Considering these steps, the answer to whether California State University (in
      a general sense, given the lack of specificity about which campus) is located
      east of Art Center College of Design is **NO**. This conclusion is based on
      the understanding that most CSU campuses are in areas that are not east of Pasadena

      the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Columbus Technical College (CTC) and Columbus State University (CSU) in Georgia.


      2. **Columbus Technical College**: According to various sources, Columbus Technical
      College is located in Columbus, Georgia. Its address is typically found to be
      around 928 Manchester Expressway, Columbus, GA 31904.


      3. **Columbus State University**: Similarly, Columbus State University is also
      located in Columbus, Georgia. Its main campus is usually listed as being at
      4225 University Ave, Columbus, GA 31907.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if CTC is east of CSU, we need to compare
      their locations relative to each other. This involves looking at their addresses
      or geographic coordinates.


      5. **Geographic Orientation**: In the context of Columbus, GA, the orientation
      (east, west, north, south) of one location relative to another can be determined
      by their street addresses or by plotting their coordinates on a map.


      Given the specific addresses:

      - Columbus Technical College: 928 Manchester Expressway, Columbus, GA 31904

      - Columbus State University: 4225 University Ave, Columbus, GA 31907


      Using a mapping tool or service to determine the relative positions:

      - Manchester Expressway (CTC) is generally southwest of the downtown area.

      - University Avenue (CSU) is more in the central part of Columbus.


      Based on typical mapping and address analysis, Columbus Technical College is
      southwest of Columbus State University, which implies it is not east but rather
      west or southwest of CSU.

      Answer: **NO**"
    6b92677a-ab88-46ad-88e9-9bf634eec356: 'To answer this question, we''ll break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know where California Coast
      University (CCU) and Rancho Santiago Community College District (RSCCD) are
      located.


      2. **California Coast University Location**: California Coast University is
      located in Santa Ana, California. However, it''s an online university, so its
      physical presence might be minimal, but for the sake of this question, we consider
      its administrative or main office location.


      3. **Rancho Santiago Community College District Location**: The Rancho Santiago
      Community College District is also located in Santa Ana, California. It includes
      Santa Ana College and Santiago Canyon College.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Since both institutions are based in Santa Ana, California,
      they are essentially in the same city. The question of one being east of the
      other depends on their exact addresses within Santa Ana.


      5. **Determine East/West Orientation**: Without exact addresses, we can still
      reason that since they are in the same city, the difference in their locations
      would be relatively small. However, to answer the question accurately, we would
      ideally need the specific street addresses or a map to compare their locations
      directly.


      6. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Given that both are in Santa Ana
      and without precise location data, it''s challenging to definitively say one
      is east of the other. However, for the purpose of this exercise and assuming
      we must provide a yes or no answer based on typical geographical comparisons,
      if California Coast University and Rancho Santiago Community College District
      are in the same general area (Santa Ana), the likelihood of one being significantly
      east of the other is low. But, without exact coordinates or addresses, this
      step requires an assumption.


      Given these steps and acknowledging the lack of precise location data, the most
      straightforward answer based on the information provided and the nature of geographical
      comparisons within the same city would lean towards a "NO" due to the close
      proximity of both institutions within Santa Ana, California. However, please
      note, this answer assumes both are centrally located within Santa Ana and does
      not account for potential eastern or western variations within the city limits.

      the locations of both Apollos University and City of Hope Graduate School of
      Biological Sciences in California and then compare their positions relative
      to each other, specifically in terms of being east or west.


      1. **Location of Apollos University, CA**: Apollos University is an online university,
      but its administrative offices are located in Great Falls, Montana, not in California.
      However, for the sake of this question, if we consider it as having a presence
      or an address in California (which might be a mailing address or a subsidiary
      office, though not its main operations), we would still need to find a specific
      location. Given the confusion, let''s proceed with the understanding that the
      question implies a comparison within California.


      2. **Location of City of Hope Graduate School of Biological Sciences, CA**:
      City of Hope is located in Duarte, California. It''s a well-known medical research
      center and hospital, and its graduate school focuses on biological sciences.


      3. **Determining East/West Location**: To say one location is east of another
      in California, we need to understand the general geography of the state. California
      is a long, narrow state with its length primarily running north-south. Duarte,
      where City of Hope is located, is in Los Angeles County, relatively central
      in the southern part of the state.


      Given the lack of a specific California location for Apollos University and
      considering the main operations are in Montana, it''s challenging to directly
      compare. However, if we were to hypothetically place Apollos University in any
      location within California for the sake of argument, we would need to know that
      location to make a comparison.


      Since Apollos University''s primary operations are not in California, and without
      a specific location provided for any potential California presence, it''s not
      feasible to accurately determine its relation (east or west) to City of Hope
      Graduate School of Biological Sciences in Duarte, CA.


      However, given the constraints of the question and the format required for the
      answer (YES or NO), and acknowledging the primary location of Apollos University

      Apollos University and City of Hope Graduate School of Biological Sciences.
      Apollos University is located in Huntington Beach, California, but it''s primarily
      an online university. However, for the sake of geographical comparison, we''ll
      consider its administrative base as the point of reference. City of Hope Graduate
      School of Biological Sciences is located in Duarte, California.


      2. **Determine geographical positions**: Next, we determine the geographical
      positions (east-west orientation) of these locations within California. Huntington
      Beach, where Apollos University has its base, is located in Orange County, which
      is in the southern part of California, near the coast. Duarte, where City of
      Hope Graduate School of Biological Sciences is located, is in Los Angeles County,
      also in southern California but slightly inland and north of Huntington Beach.


      3. **Compare east-west positions**: To compare their east-west positions, we
      note that Duarte (City of Hope) is generally east or northeast of Huntington
      Beach (Apollos University), considering the typical east-west layout of Southern
      California''s coastal and inland areas.


      Based on these steps, since Duarte (where City of Hope Graduate School of Biological
      Sciences is located) is generally east or northeast of Huntington Beach (the
      location associated with Apollos University), the answer to whether Apollos

      the locations of both Loyola University Chicago and the Illinois College of
      Optometry, and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Loyola University Chicago Location**: Loyola University Chicago has several
      campuses, but its main campus is located in Rogers Park, Chicago, Illinois.
      This is on the north side of the city.


      2. **Illinois College of Optometry (ICO) Location**: The Illinois College of
      Optometry is located in the South Loop area of Chicago, Illinois.


      Given these locations:

      - Loyola University Chicago is on the north side of Chicago.

      - Illinois College of Optometry is in the South Loop of Chicago, which is more
      central but south of the north side.


      Considering the geography of Chicago:

      - The north side of Chicago (where Loyola University is) is indeed east of the
      western parts of the city but when comparing two points within the city, we
      need to consider their specific locations.

      - The South Loop (where ICO is) is centrally located and extends south from
      the downtown area, not particularly west or east of the north side in a significant
      way that would make one consistently east or west of the other based on their
      general locations.


      However, considering the exact locations:

      - Loyola University Chicago (north side) is generally north and somewhat east
      of the South Loop area where ICO is located, given the layout of Chicago''s
      grid system and the fact that Chicago''s north side extends along the shores
      of Lake Michigan, which is to the east of the city''s western parts.


      Therefore, based on their locations within Chicago:

      - Loyola University Chicago is indeed located east of the Illinois College of
      Optometry, considering the city''s layout and the fact that the north side (where
      Loyola is) is along Lake Michigan, to the east of the South Loop (where ICO

      Illinois College of Optometry is also located in Chicago, Illinois.


      2. **Understand Geographic Directions**: Next, we need to understand the geographic
      directions. "East" refers to the direction towards the sunrise, which is on

      \ can vary significantly from north to south and east to west.\n\n4. **Determining\
      \ East/West Position**: Generally, in the context of U.S. geography, \"east\"\
      \ refers to a location that is more towards the eastern part of a city or state,\
      \ while \"west\" refers to a location more towards the western part. Given that\
      \ both institutions are in Chicago, we must look at their exact addresses or\
      \ areas to determine their relative east-west positions.\n\n5. **Specific Locations**:\n\
      \   - Loyola University Chicago has several campuses, but its main campus is\
      \ located on the North Side of Chicago.\n   - The Illinois College of Optometry\
      \ is located on the South Side of Chicago.\n\n6. **Relative Positioning**: The\
      \ North Side and South Side of Chicago are primarily distinguished by their\
      \ position relative to the Chicago Loop (downtown area) and the branches of\
      \ the Chicago River, rather than strict east-west divisions. However, considering\
      \ the layout of Chicago, the South Side extends farther to the south and slightly\
      \ to the east of the North Side, but both areas have east-west spreads.\n\n\
      7. **Conclusion**: Without exact addresses, it's challenging to definitively\
      \ state which is east of the other solely based on being on the North or South\
      \ Side. However, considering general geography, if Loyola University Chicago's\
      \ main campus is on the North Side and Illinois College of Optometry is on the\
      \ South Side, and given that Chicago's grid system and the shores of Lake Michigan\
      \ might influence east-west positioning, we would need precise locations to\
      \ accurately determine which is east of the other.\n\nHowever, given the general\
      \ information:\n- Loyola University Chicago (North Side) could potentially be\
      \ east or west of the Illinois College of Optometry (South Side) depending on\
      \ their specific locations within those broad areas.\n- But considering typical\
      \ layouts and assuming Loyola's main campus is near the lake (which would put\
      \ it more to the east in the city's layout), and the ICO being on the South\
      \ Side, which could extend more to the east but also depends on the exact location,\
      \ it's a complex comparison without exact addresses.\n\nGiven these steps and\
      \ acknowledging the complexity without exact addresses, the most straightforward\
      \ approach to provide a YES/NO answer based on typical geographical assumptions\
      \ and the general layout of Chicago would be to consider if Loyola's location\
      \ is generally east of ICO's location. \n\nBut, to simplify and directly answer\

      \ **Consider Chicago's geography**:\n   - Chicago is situated on the southwestern\
      \ shore of Lake Michigan. The city's layout is generally organized in a grid\
      \ pattern with the lake to the east.\n\n4. **Find specific addresses or areas**:\n\
      \   - Loyola University Chicago has campuses along the lakefront, with its main\
      \ campus in the Rogers Park neighborhood, which is on the north side of Chicago,\
      \ directly adjacent to Lake Michigan.\n   - The Illinois College of Optometry\

      \ the locations**:\n   - Given that both institutions are near Lake Michigan\
      \ (the eastern boundary of Chicago), the question essentially asks if Loyola\
      \ University is east of the Illinois College of Optometry within the city's\

      \ the grid layout of Chicago and the fact that both institutions are near the\
      \ eastern edge of the city (Lake Michigan), the critical factor is their north-south\
      \ positioning rather than east-west. However, considering the question's phrasing,\
      \ it implies a comparison based on the grid layout rather than geographic features\
      \ like the lake.\n   - Loyola University Chicago, being on the north side, and\

    37b6965b-9e58-492e-b881-c14141af371e: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Corcoran College of Art and Design and Strayer University in
      Washington, D.C., and then compare their positions relative to each other, specifically
      whether Corcoran College is east of Strayer University.


      1. **Location of Corcoran College of Art and Design**: Historically, Corcoran
      College of Art and Design was located in Washington, D.C. The main campus was
      situated near the White House, which places it in the downtown area of D.C.


      2. **Location of Strayer University**: Strayer University has multiple locations,
      but focusing on its Washington, D.C. campus, it is also situated within the
      city. However, without the exact address, we can consider that universities
      in D.C. can have multiple locations, but typically, they are within the city
      limits.


      3. **Determining East/West Orientation in D.C.**: Washington, D.C. is laid out
      in a grid pattern with a mix of alphabetical and numerical street names, and
      it has a clear distinction between its four quadrants: Northwest (NW), Northeast
      (NE), Southwest (SW), and Southeast (SE). The city''s layout is divided by the
      U.S. Capitol, with North and South divisions, and by North Capitol Street and
      South Capitol Street for East and West divisions.


      4. **Comparison**: Without the exact addresses, we can generalize based on typical
      locations. If Corcoran College is near the White House, which is in the NW quadrant,
      and considering Strayer University could be in various locations but must be
      compared to Corcoran''s position, we need specific addresses to accurately determine
      their relative east-west positions.


      However, given that Corcoran College of Art and Design has been associated with
      the downtown area, which can include parts of both the NW and NE quadrants depending
      on how one defines "downtown," and Strayer University''s exact location isn''t
      specified, a precise determination requires more detailed information.


      But, considering the likely scenarios and general locations:

      - Corcoran College of Art and Design was associated with the downtown area,
      potentially placing it in the NW quadrant, near the White House.

      - Strayer University, without a specified location, could potentially be in
      any quadrant, but if it''s in the downtown area, it could be in either the NW
      or NE quadrants.


      Given these considerations and without exact addresses, it''s challenging to
      provide a definitive answer. However, considering that both institutions could
      potentially be in the NW quadrant or nearby areas, the likelihood of Corcoran
      being east of Strayer would depend on their exact locations within the city.


      **Conclusion**: Without precise locations or addresses, it''s not possible to
      give a definitive YES or NO answer based on the general information provided.
      However, the instructions require a YES or NO response, so based on the potential
      for both institutions to be in similar areas of the city and the lack of specific
      detail to accurately compare their locations:

    41c6c0c9-1f8f-4e2e-80d6-89b52404e607: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Corcoran College of Art and Design and Strayer University in
      Washington, D.C. and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of Corcoran College of Art and Design, DC**: The
      Corcoran College of Art and Design was historically located in Washington, D.C.
      Before its merger with George Washington University, it was situated near the
      National Mall, which is roughly in the center of Washington, D.C.


      2. **Identify the location of Strayer University, DC**: Strayer University has
      multiple locations, but when referring to its Washington, D.C. location, we
      are typically talking about its campus in the downtown area or near it. Strayer
      University''s main campus in D.C. is often considered to be in the northwest
      part of the city, though it can vary slightly depending on the specific campus.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that Corcoran College of Art
      and Design is near the National Mall (more towards the center of D.C.) and considering
      Strayer University''s general location in the downtown/northwest area, we need
      to establish if the Corcoran College is east of Strayer University.


      Washington, D.C. is laid out in a grid pattern with the U.S. Capitol building
      as a central reference point. Areas west of the Capitol would be considered
      "west," and areas east would be considered "east." The National Mall, where
      Corcoran College of Art and Design is situated, stretches from the Lincoln Memorial
      in the west to the U.S. Capitol building in the east, meaning it covers central
      D.C.


      Strayer University, being in the northwest part of D.C., would generally be
      west and slightly north of the Corcoran College of Art and Design''s location
      near the National Mall.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Corcoran College of Art and Design is more centrally
      located near the National Mall and Strayer University is in the northwest, Corcoran
      College of Art and Design would indeed be east (or more east) of Strayer University,
      considering the grid layout of Washington, D.C.


      The final answer is: **YES**'
    87f3b9ad-12d8-445c-91fa-fd719c2c9e70: 'To determine if Corcoran College of Art
      and Design in Washington, D.C. is located east of Strayer University in Washington,
      D.C., let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations of
      both institutions within Washington, D.C.


      2. **Corcoran College of Art and Design**: Historically, Corcoran College of
      Art and Design was located in downtown Washington, D.C. However, it''s crucial
      to verify its current status and location. As of my last update, Corcoran College
      of Art and Design merged with George Washington University and operates under
      the name Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, with locations near the National
      Mall and possibly other sites in D.C.


      3. **Strayer University, DC**: Strayer University has multiple locations, but
      focusing on its Washington, D.C. campus, it''s essential to pinpoint the exact
      address. Strayer University has a campus in Northwest Washington, D.C.


      4. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: To say one location is east of another
      in Washington, D.C., we consider the city''s grid system and major landmarks.
      Generally, areas east of the National Mall and north of the Anacostia River
      can be considered "east" in the context of the city''s layout.


      5. **Compare Locations**: Knowing the specific addresses would allow us to compare
      their locations directly. However, without current, precise addresses, we rely
      on general knowledge of Washington, D.C.''s layout. The Corcoran School (formerly
      Corcoran College of Art and Design) being part of George Washington University
      and near the National Mall, and Strayer University being in Northwest D.C.,
      suggests that Corcoran could potentially be southeast of Strayer University,
      given Northwest D.C.''s position relative to the Mall.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general locations and without exact addresses,
      if Corcoran School of the Arts and Design (the successor to Corcoran College
      of Art and Design) is near the National Mall, and considering Strayer University''s
      Northwest D.C. location, Corcoran would likely be southeast or south of Strayer
      University, not directly east. However, the precise answer depends on the specific
      locations of their campuses.


      Given the steps above and considering the typical layout of Washington, D.C.,
      the answer to whether Corcoran College of Art and Design is located east of
      Strayer University, DC, would generally be **NO**, based on the assumption that
      "east" implies a direct eastern direction and considering the likely positions
      of these institutions within the city''s grid. However, this conclusion is drawn
      with the caveat that exact addresses and current operational statuses of the
      institutions were not verified during this reasoning process.'

      - Corcoran College of Art and Design has historically been located near the\
      \ National Mall, which is relatively central in Washington, D.C.\n- Strayer\
      \ University's exact location can vary, but if we consider a central D.C. location\

      and Columbia rivers. Marylhurst, where Marylhurst University is located, is
      to the south of Portland, along the Willamette River.


      3. **Compare locations**: To determine if OCOM is east of Marylhurst University,

    8ad0067b-314a-463d-aec1-c460662abb9b: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Oregon
      College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM) and Marylhurst University in Oregon.


      2. **Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM)**: OCOM is located in Portland,
      Oregon. Portland is in the northwest part of Oregon, near the Columbia River,
      which forms the border between Oregon and Washington.


      3. **Marylhurst University**: Marylhurst University is located in Marylhurst,
      Oregon, which is also near Portland but slightly south of it. Marylhurst is
      situated on the Willamette River.


      4. **Compare locations**: Both institutions are near Portland, but we need to
      determine their relative positions to answer if OCOM is east of Marylhurst University.


      5. **Portland and surroundings**: Portland is a major city in the northwest
      part of Oregon. Given that both universities are in or near Portland, their
      east-west positioning depends on their exact locations within the metropolitan
      area.


      6. **Determine east-west orientation**: Since both universities are in the Portland
      metropolitan area, we need to consider the city''s layout. Portland is generally
      laid out with the Willamette River running through it, and the city''s grid
      system is aligned with the river. Marylhurst University, being south of Portland
      and on the Willamette River, would be southwest of the city center. OCOM, being
      in Portland, would be positioned relative to the city''s grid and the river.


      7. **Final comparison**: Without exact addresses or a detailed map, we can consider
      the general layout of Portland and its surroundings. However, given that Marylhurst
      University is to the south and slightly west of Portland''s city center, and
      OCOM is within Portland, OCOM would likely be north and possibly east of Marylhurst
      University, depending on the specific locations within the city.


      Based on the general locations and considering Portland''s geography, OCOM is
      likely north and possibly east of Marylhurst University. However, without precise
      locations, this reasoning relies on the general geography of the area.


      Given the information and typical layouts, the answer would lean towards YES,
      but it''s essential to verify exact locations for a definitive answer. Since
      I must provide a YES or NO answer based on the step-by-step reasoning provided:

      steps:


      1. **Identify the locations** of both Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM)
      and Marylhurst University.

      2. **Determine their positions** relative to each other, specifically whether
      OCOM is east of Marylhurst University.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations**

      - Oregon College of Oriental Medicine is located in Portland, Oregon.

      - Marylhurst University was located in Marylhurst, Oregon, but it''s essential
      to note that Marylhurst University closed in 2018. However, for the sake of
      this exercise, we consider its former location.


      **Step 2: Determine their positions relative to each other**

      - Portland, where OCOM is situated, is generally in the northwestern part of
      Oregon.

      - Marylhurst, the location of the former Marylhurst University, is south of
      Portland but still in the western part of Oregon.


      Given these locations:

      - Portland (OCOM) is not east of Marylhurst (former Marylhurst University);
      instead, Portland is north of Marylhurst.


      Therefore, considering the geographical positions:

      The answer is **NO**.'

      south and slightly east of Wayne, where WPU is located, but in the context of
      New Jersey''s geography, the difference in their east-west positioning is what
      matters.


      6. **East-West Orientation**: Considering New Jersey''s layout, moving from
      west to east, we would first encounter Wayne (WPU) before reaching Lakewood
      (GCU) if traveling directly east. However, since Lakewood is more south than
      east of Wayne, the primary movement from Wayne to Lakewood is southward rather
      than eastward.


      7. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical layout and the primary direction of
      travel from Wayne to Lakewood being south rather than east, we can conclude
      that Georgian Court University is not strictly east of William Paterson University.

      the locations of Naval Postgraduate School and Tri-Valley University in California.


      1. **Location of Naval Postgraduate School (NPS):** The Naval Postgraduate School
      is located in Monterey, California. Monterey is on the central coast of California,
      which is considered to be on the western part of the state.


      2. **Location of Tri-Valley University:** Tri-Valley University was located
      in Pleasanton, California. Pleasanton is in the San Francisco Bay Area, in Alameda
      County, which places it in the eastern part of the San Francisco Bay Area but
      still on the western side of California, though more inland and somewhat east
      of Monterey.


      Given these locations:


      - Monterey (Naval Postgraduate School) is generally west or southwest of Pleasanton
      (Tri-Valley University).

      - Therefore, Naval Postgraduate School is not located east of Tri-Valley University.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Naval
      Postgraduate School (NPS) and Tri-Valley University (TVU). Naval Postgraduate
      School is located in Monterey, California. Tri-Valley University was located
      in Pleasanton, California, before it closed.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Monterey, where NPS is located, is on the Monterey
      Peninsula, which is on the western coast of the United States, in Central California.
      Pleasanton, where TVU was located, is in the Tri-Valley region of the San Francisco
      Bay Area, which is also in Northern California but more inland compared to Monterey.


      3. **Determine east-west orientation**: To determine if NPS is east of TVU,
      we need to understand the east-west orientation of California. Generally, the
      eastern part of California would be towards the Nevada border, and the western
      part would be towards the Pacific Ocean.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Given that Monterey (NPS) is directly on the Pacific
      coast and Pleasanton (TVU) is inland but still in the western part of the United
      States, we can deduce their relative positions. Monterey is west of Pleasanton
      because it is directly on the coast, and Pleasanton is more inland.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since Monterey (where NPS is located) is west of Pleasanton
      (where TVU was located), NPS cannot be east of TVU.


      The final answer is: **NO**'
