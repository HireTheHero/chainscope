      2. **Lincoln Christian University, IL**: This university is also located in
      the city of Lincoln, Illinois.


      Since both institutions are in the same city, the question of whether one is
      east of the other would depend on their specific addresses and locations within
      the city.


      To provide a definitive answer, we would need to compare the specific east-west
      coordinates (longitude) of each institution. However, since they are both in
      the same city, any difference would likely be negligible and not significant
      enough to generally categorize one as being east of the other in a broader sense.


      Thus, without specific address-based longitude data, the general answer is:


      NO, Lincoln College is not located east of Lincoln Christian University in a
      meaningful geographic sense, as both are in the same city.'

      position.


      **Step 1: Identify Locations**

      - City University of Seattle is located in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle.

      - Antioch University Seattle is located in the Belltown neighborhood as well.


      **Step 2: Compare Longitudes**

      - Since both universities are in the Belltown area, their longitudinal differences
      are minimal. However, the specific street addresses might provide a more precise
      comparison.


      Given the proximity within the same neighborhood, any minor longitudinal difference
      would require exact address comparison. Typically, in such a small area, the
      difference in east-west positioning is negligible for practical purposes.


      **Conclusion:** Without precise longitudinal data or specific street addresses,
      it is not feasible to definitively say that one is east of the other based solely
      on neighborhood information. However, given the same neighborhood, the likelihood
      is they are quite close longitudinally.

      2. Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is one of the colleges within the University
      of Georgia.


      Since Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is a part of the University of Georgia,
      it is not geographically separate from the university. Rather, it is located
      within the university''s campus in Athens, Georgia.


      Therefore, it doesn''t make sense to ask if the University of Georgia is located
      east of Franklin College of Arts and Sciences because they are essentially in
      the same location, with the latter being a component of the former.


      The answer is NO, the University of Georgia is not located east of Franklin
      College of Arts and Sciences.'

      2. **Geographical Comparison**: Since both the University of Georgia and the

      in Athens, Georgia, they share the same general location.


      Given that both entities are part of the same campus, the concept of one being

      the locations of both institutions.


      1. **Apple University**: Apple University is not a traditional university with
      a campus. It is an internal corporate university within Apple Inc., located
      at Apple''s headquarters in Cupertino, California. Cupertino is in the South
      Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area.


      2. **California South Bay University**: This university is a lesser-known institution,

      in the general area around the southern part of the San Francisco Bay.


      Given that both Apple University and California South Bay University are associated

      to definitively say that one is east of the other without more specific location
