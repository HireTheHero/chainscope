      2. Next, I''ll locate State University of New York at Purchase, NY

      - It''s located in Purchase, NY, which is in Westchester County (in southeastern
      New York)


      3. Comparing their geographical locations

      - Albany is in the eastern part of New York state

      - Purchase is in southeastern New York, closer to New York City

      - Albany is further west/northwest compared to Purchase


      4. Therefore, Mildred Elley, NY (in Albany) is NOT east of State University
      of New York at Purchase, NY


      The answer is: NO'

      4. Since both colleges are in Newton, they are very close to each other geographically.


      5. To determine if MSPP is east of Newton College of the Sacred Heart, I would
      need to know their precise locations within Newton.


      6. However, Newton College of the Sacred Heart was closed in 1991 and its campus
      was sold to Boston College.


      7. Without a current, precise location for Newton College of the Sacred Heart,

      Given the lack of definitive information about the exact location of Newton
      College of the Sacred Heart, I cannot confidently answer YES or NO.'
