      3) They are both located on Texas Tech''s main campus in Lubbock, Texas.


      4) Since they are part of the same campus, I can try to find their specific
      locations on campus.


      5) Looking at the Texas Tech campus map, the Whitacre College of Engineering
      is located in the central/western part of the main campus, while the Agricultural
      Sciences buildings are generally located in the eastern portion of the main
      campus.


      6) Therefore, Whitacre College of Engineering is actually WEST of the College
      of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources, not east.

      5) Therefore, since The Rockefeller University is closer to the East River and
      Sophie Davis is closer to the Hudson River side, Rockefeller is indeed east
      of Sophie Davis.

      1. First, let me identify the locations:

      - Bethel University is in McKenzie, Tennessee

      - Marian University is in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin


      2. Let me compare their locations:

      - Tennessee is in the southeastern United States

      - Wisconsin is in the northern midwest United States


      3. Looking at relative positions:

      - Wisconsin is further west than Tennessee

      - Specifically, Tennessee is east of Wisconsin


      4. Therefore, since Bethel University is in Tennessee and Marian University
      is in Wisconsin, Bethel University is east of Marian University.


      Answer: YES'
