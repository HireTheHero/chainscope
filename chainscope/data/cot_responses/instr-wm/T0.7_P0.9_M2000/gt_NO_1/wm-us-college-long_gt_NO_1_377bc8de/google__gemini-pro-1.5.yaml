      to locate Florida State University''s School of Library & Information Studies
      and the College of Social Sciences.

      2. **Determine their relative locations:**  Since both are part of the same
      university, they are likely on the same campus or very close by. We need to
      find their specific locations on the FSU campus.

      3. **East vs. West:**  The question asks if the Library & Information Studies
      building is *east* of the Social Sciences building.  A map is the best way to
      determine this.


      A quick search shows both are indeed on the same FSU campus.  The School of
      Library & Information Studies (SLIS) is located in the Strozier Library, and
      the College of Social Sciences is primarily in Bellamy.  Looking at a campus
      map, Strozier Library is slightly west of Bellamy.

      need to determine the general geographic location of each university.

      2. **Focus on Longitude:**  Since the question is about East vs. West, we are
      concerned with longitude.  A more easterly location will have a higher degree
      of longitude (further East from the Prime Meridian).

      3. **Compare Longitudes:** Once we have the longitude for each university, we
      can compare them to see which is further east.


      D''Youville University is in Buffalo, NY.  Buffalo is in western New York.

      Eastern Mennonite University is in Harrisonburg, VA. Harrisonburg is in the
      Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.


      New York is generally east of Virginia. Therefore, D''Youville is likely east
      of Eastern Mennonite University.

      parts of NY *could* theoretically be west of far eastern parts of VA.  However,
      Buffalo is in western NY, and Harrisonburg is in western VA, making it very
      unlikely for Buffalo to be further west.

    fce07c10-fcf4-4f25-a716-10cbb578550c: '1. **Find the locations of the two universities:**
      We need to determine the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) or
      general location of Lander University in South Carolina and King University
      in Virginia.


      2. **Focus on Longitude:** Since we are determining East vs. West, longitude
      is the relevant coordinate.  A location further East will have a higher degree
      of longitude (e.g., -80 is east of -90).


      3. **Compare Longitudes:** Once we have the longitude of both universities,
      we can compare them to determine which is further east.


      Lander University, SC is located in Greenwood, SC at approximately -82.13 degrees
      longitude.  King University, TN is located in Bristol, TN at approximately -82.18
      degrees longitude and also has a campus in Bristol, VA which is in the same
      general area.


      Since -82.13 is greater than -82.18, Lander University is east of King University.

      location descriptions of Coppin State University and Notre Dame of Maryland
      University.


      2. **Compare longitudes:**  Since the question asks about "east of", I need
      to focus on the longitude.  A location further east will have a higher longitude
      value (more positive).


      3. **Determine which university has the higher longitude:**  Once I have both
      longitudes, I can compare them to see which is greater.


      4. **Answer the question:** If Coppin State University has a higher longitude
      than Notre Dame of Maryland University, the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer
      is NO.


      Using a map or online search, I find:


      * Coppin State University is in Baltimore, MD.

      * Notre Dame of Maryland University is also in Baltimore, MD.


      More specifically, Coppin State is slightly west of Notre Dame of Maryland University.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.

      location (city, state) of each college.

      2. **Compare longitudes:**  Since we are looking at East vs. West, longitude
      is the relevant coordinate.  A location further East will have a *higher* longitude
      value.

      3. **Determine which has the higher longitude:** The college with the higher
      longitude is further East.


      Mildred Elley has multiple campuses, including one in Albany, NY and one in
      Pittsfield, MA. SUNY Purchase is in Purchase, NY.  Purchase, NY is just north
      of New York City. Albany, NY is significantly north *and west* of New York City.
      Pittsfield, MA is east of Albany, NY, but still west of Purchase, NY.


      Therefore, regardless of which Mildred Elley campus is considered, neither is
      east of SUNY Purchase.

      which one is further east *longitudinally*.


      4. **Relative Longitude:** Virginia Beach is on the coast, and Pennsylvania
      is inland. Coastal locations will naturally be further east than inland locations

      If South Georgia Technical College has a higher longitude than Southeastern
      Christian College, then it is east of it.

      The Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education (part of the City College of
      New York) is located in Harlem, also in Manhattan.  Harlem is generally north
      of the Upper East Side, but because Manhattan is a long, narrow island, north
      also means somewhat west.


      Therefore, The Rockefeller University is likely east of the Sophie Davis School.  A
      quick map check confirms this.

      need to determine the geographic locations of The Rockefeller University and
      the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education.  Both are in New York City.


      2. **Determine which is further east:**  New York City geography generally follows
      a grid pattern.  Higher street numbers and avenues are generally further east.  I
      need to find more precise locations to compare.


      3. **Rockefeller University is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, along the
      East River.** This places it towards the eastern edge of Manhattan Island.


      4. **Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education is part of the City College
      of New York (CCNY) and is located in Harlem in Upper Manhattan.** While also
      in Upper Manhattan, Harlem is generally west of the East River.


      5. **Compare East River to Harlem:**  The East River is the eastern border of
      Manhattan Island. Harlem is west of the East River.


      6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, Rockefeller University, being on the East River,
      is east of Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education.

      York) is in Harlem, also in Manhattan.


      2. **Determine the relative east/west positions within Manhattan:** Manhattan''s
      street grid is mostly oriented north-south and east-west.  Generally, higher
      street numbers are further east, and avenues further east are also further east.

      likely requires an online search for each school''s address.

      2. **Determine their longitudes.**  Longitude is the east-west measurement on
      a map.  A higher longitude value means further east.

      3. **Compare the longitudes.**  If Rockefeller University has a higher longitude
      than Sophie Davis, it''s located further east.


      *Rockefeller University is located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.*

      *Sophie Davis is part of the City College of New York, located in Harlem, Manhattan.*


      Harlem is north of the Upper East Side, but they are both on the East Coast.  Manhattan
      is a relatively long and thin island, oriented north-south.  Therefore, being
      further north doesn''t guarantee a location further east.  It''s possible for
      a location further south to be further east.  I need to check their exact locations
      to be sure.

      Rockefeller is further east than Sophie Davis.

      need to determine the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) or at
      least the general location within New York City of both institutions.


      2. **Compare the longitudes:**  Longitude determines east/west positioning.
      A location further east will have a higher longitude value.


      3. **Determine which has the higher longitude:** Once we have the longitudes,
      we can compare them to see which institution is further east.


      Rockefeller University is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Sophie Davis
      is located in Harlem, Manhattan.  Manhattan is a long, relatively narrow island
      oriented north-south.  Therefore, locations further uptown (north) are generally
      considered further east on the map, even if the avenues (east-west streets)
      might curve slightly. The Upper East Side is north of Harlem.


      Therefore, Rockefeller is east of Sophie Davis.

      Specifically, Rockefeller is around -73.95 longitude and Sophie Davis is around
