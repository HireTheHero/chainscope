      City University of Seattle and Antioch University Seattle. Both institutions
      are in Seattle, Washington.


      2. **Location of City University of Seattle**: City University of Seattle has
      its main campus in Seattle, Washington. Seattle is a city in the western part
      of Washington State, located on the Puget Sound.


      3. **Location of Antioch University Seattle**: Antioch University Seattle is
      also in Seattle, Washington. Like City University of Seattle, it is located
      in the city of Seattle, which is situated on the Puget Sound.


      4. **Comparison**: Since both universities are in Seattle, Washington, we''re
      essentially comparing two locations within the same city.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both universities are in Seattle, Washington,
      the question of one being "east" of the other depends on their exact locations
      within the city. However, since they are in the same city and Seattle is not
      a particularly large city in terms of east-west orientation, it''s likely that
      they are relatively close to each other and not significantly east-west of each
      other.

      the University of the Southwest and National American University.


      2. **University of the Southwest Location**: The University of the Southwest
      is located in Hobbs, New Mexico. Hobbs is situated in the southeastern part
      of the state, near the Texas border.


      3. **National American University Location**: National American University has
      multiple campuses across the United States. One of its campuses is in Rapid
      City, South Dakota. Rapid City is located in the western part of South Dakota.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if the University of the Southwest is
      east of National American University, we need to compare their locations. New
      Mexico (where the University of the Southwest is located) is generally south
      of South Dakota (where National American University''s Rapid City campus is
      located).


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that New Mexico is south of South Dakota, the University
      of the Southwest is not east of National American University''s Rapid City campus.
      Instead, it is more to the south.


      The final answer is: **NO**'

      In summary, without a specific campus map, it''s challenging to definitively
      answer whether the Florida State University School of Library & Information
      Studies is located east of the Florida State University College of Social Sciences,
      as both are part of the same university campus in Tallahassee, Florida. The
      answer would depend on their exact locations within the campus, which is not
      readily available without a detailed map.

      3. **Location of California South Bay University**: There isn''t a well-known

      Bay, respectively. Given the name, if we were to consider a university in the

      we''re essentially comparing two locations within the same general region.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that both are in the South Bay area of California,
      the question of one being "east" of the other depends on their exact locations
      within the South Bay. Cupertino (Apple University) is generally west of San
      Jose (if we use San Jose State University as a reference for a South Bay university).
      Therefore, Apple University would not be east of a university located in San
      Jose or a similar location in the South Bay.

      and Fort Valley, Georgia, we find that Bluffton is located to the north and
      slightly west of Fort Valley. This is because Ohio is generally north of Georgia,
      and within Ohio, Bluffton is situated in the northwest part of the state.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical positions of Bluffton, Ohio, and Fort
      Valley, Georgia, Bluffton University is not located east of Fort Valley State
      University. Instead, it is located north and slightly west of Fort Valley State
      University.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Coppin State University and Notre Dame of Maryland University.


      2. **Coppin State University**: Coppin State University is located in Baltimore,
      Maryland. Baltimore is a major city on the Patapsco River in the central part
      of Maryland.


      3. **Notre Dame of Maryland University**: Notre Dame of Maryland University
      is also located in Baltimore, Maryland, specifically in the North Baltimore
      neighborhood.


      4. **Comparison**: Since both universities are located in Baltimore, they are
      essentially in the same city. However, the question asks if Coppin State University
      is east of Notre Dame of Maryland University.


      5. **East-West Orientation in Baltimore**: Baltimore is situated on the Patapsco
      River, which flows into the Chesapeake Bay. Generally, the western part of the
      city is closer to the Patapsco River, and the eastern part is closer to the
      Chesapeake Bay.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical orientation of Baltimore, Coppin
      State University is not east of Notre Dame of Maryland University. Both universities
      are in Baltimore, but they are not in a clear east-west relationship within
      the city.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      University is also located in Baltimore, Maryland.


      4. **Comparison**: Since both universities are located in the same city, Baltimore,
      the question of one being east of the other depends on their exact locations
      within the city.


      5. **Geographical Orientation**: Baltimore is a city on the east coast of the
      United States, situated in the state of Maryland. The city is oriented roughly
      north-south, with the Chesapeake Bay to its east and the Appalachian Mountains
      to its west.


      6. **Conclusion**: Given that both universities are in the same city and the
      city''s orientation, the question of one being "east" of the other depends on
      their specific locations within Baltimore. However, since they are in the same
      city, it''s unlikely that one is significantly east of the other, especially
      considering that Baltimore is not a very large city.

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Kentucky Christian University and Ohio Dominican University.


      2. **Location of Kentucky Christian University**: Kentucky Christian University
      is located in Grayson, Kentucky. Grayson is a city in Carter County, Kentucky,
      in the eastern part of the state.


      3. **Location of Ohio Dominican University**: Ohio Dominican University is located
      in Columbus, Ohio. Columbus is the capital city of Ohio and is situated in the
      central part of the state.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if Kentucky Christian University is east
      of Ohio Dominican University, we need to compare their locations. Grayson, Kentucky
      (where KCU is located), is generally east of Columbus, Ohio (where ODU is located).
      This is because Kentucky is east of Ohio when considering the east-west orientation
      of the two states.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on their geographical positions, Kentucky Christian
      University (Grayson, KY) is indeed east of Ohio Dominican University (Columbus,
      OH), as Grayson is to the east of Columbus when looking at the states of Kentucky
      and Ohio.

    883d6700-9099-419a-9c0a-9921594ab237: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Widener University and Delaware State University. Widener University has multiple
      campuses, but its main campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania, which is just across
      the border from Delaware. Delaware State University is located in Dover, Delaware.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: Delaware is a relatively small state, and it''s
      crucial to understand its geography. The state is elongated in shape, with its
      western border being adjacent to Maryland and its eastern border being adjacent
      to New Jersey. The state''s southern border is the Delaware Bay, and its northern
      border is with Pennsylvania.


      3. **Comparative Location**: Since Widener University''s main campus is in Chester,
      Pennsylvania, which is just north of the Delaware border, and Delaware State
      University is in Dover, Delaware, we need to consider the east-west orientation
      of Delaware.


      4. **East-West Orientation in Delaware**: Delaware is oriented north-south,
      with its western border being Maryland and its eastern border being New Jersey.
      The northern part of the state is adjacent to Pennsylvania, and the southern
      part is along the Delaware Bay.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Widener University''s main campus is in Chester,
      Pennsylvania, which is north of the Delaware border, and Delaware State University
      is in Dover, Delaware, which is more towards the middle of the state, we can
      conclude that Widener University is not located east of Delaware State University.
      Instead, it''s located north of Delaware State University when considering the
      state''s east-west orientation.

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU) and the University of Jamestown.


      2. **Location of Southwestern Oklahoma State University**: SWOSU is located
      in Weatherford, Oklahoma, which is in the western part of the state.


      3. **Location of the University of Jamestown**: The University of Jamestown
      is located in Jamestown, North Dakota, which is in the southeastern part of
      the state.


      4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if SWOSU is east of the University of
      Jamestown, we need to compare their geographical positions. Jamestown, North
      Dakota, is situated in the upper Midwest region of the United States, while
      Weatherford, Oklahoma, is in the southwestern part of the country.


      5. **Determine East/West Orientation**: Since the question is about being "east"
      of each other, we need to consider the relative positions of these locations
      on the east-west axis. Jamestown, ND, is significantly north of Weatherford,
      OK. On a map, you''ll notice that Oklahoma is generally south and west of North
      Dakota.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on their geographical positions, Southwestern Oklahoma
      State University (in Weatherford, Oklahoma) is not east of the University of
      Jamestown (in Jamestown, North Dakota). Instead, SWOSU is southwest of the University
      of Jamestown.

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences (SLU CAS) and Jackson State
      University (JSU).


      2. **Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences**: SLU CAS is located
      in St. Louis, Missouri, in the central part of the state, near the border with
      Illinois.


      3. **Jackson State University**: JSU is located in Jackson, Mississippi, which
      is the capital city of the state. Jackson is in the central-western part of
      Mississippi.


      4. **Geographical Orientation**: Missouri and Mississippi are neighboring states,
      with Missouri to the north and Mississippi to the south.


      5. **Comparative Location**: St. Louis, where SLU CAS is located, is in the
      central part of Missouri, while Jackson, where JSU is located, is in the central-western
      part of Mississippi. If you draw an imaginary line from St. Louis to Jackson,
      it would be a southeast direction.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations and the direction from
      St. Louis to Jackson, SLU CAS in St. Louis, Missouri, is not located east of
      JSU in Jackson, Mississippi. Instead, it''s more north and slightly west.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

    b77c016b-0a97-4591-97b0-9900502d4f87: "To answer this question, let's break down\
      \ the process:\n\n1. **Identify Locations**: \n   - **Naval Postgraduate School**:\
      \ The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) is located in Monterey, California. Monterey\
      \ is a coastal city in the central part of the state, known for its historical\
      \ significance and its proximity to the Monterey Bay.\n   - **Tri-Valley University**:\
      \ Tri-Valley University is a former institution that was based in Pleasanton,\
      \ California. It was closed down in 2011 due to issues with its accreditation\
      \ and visa programs.\n\n2. **Geographical Orientation**:\n   - **East/West Orientation\
      \ in California**: California is a large state with a diverse geography. The\
      \ eastern part of the state would be closer to the Nevada and Arizona borders,\
      \ while the western part would be closer to the Pacific Ocean. Central California,\
      \ where Monterey is located, is roughly in the middle of the state when considering\
      \ its width from east to west.\n   - **Tri-Valley Region**: The Tri-Valley region\
      \ in California refers to the area around the cities of Pleasanton, Livermore,\
      \ and Dublin. This region is located in the East Bay area, east of the San Francisco\
      \ Bay.\n\n3. **Comparative Location**:\n   - Monterey, where the Naval Postgraduate\
      \ School is located, is generally west and slightly south of the Tri-Valley\
      \ region where Pleasanton, the former location of Tri-Valley University, is\
      \ situated.\n   - Considering the broad geography, central California (where\
      \ the Naval Postgraduate School is) is west of the East Bay area (where the\
      \ Tri-Valley region, including Pleasanton, is located), given that you're looking\
      \ at the state's layout from a north-south perspective.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   Based on the geographical layout of California and the relative positions\
      \ of central California (Monterey) and the East Bay area (Tri-Valley region),\
      \ the Naval Postgraduate School, CA is not located east of Tri-Valley University,\
      \ CA. Instead, it is located west (and slightly south) of the Tri-Valley region.\n\
      \nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{NO}$\n\n"

      \ the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the\
      \ locations of Naval Postgraduate School and Tri-Valley University. Naval Postgraduate\
      \ School is located in Monterey, California, while Tri-Valley University was\
      \ a fraudulent institution that was shut down in 2011. However, for the sake\
      \ of the question, let's assume that Tri-Valley University was located in the\
      \ Tri-Valley area of California, which includes cities like Pleasanton, Livermore,\
      \ and Dublin.\n\n2. **Compare Longitudes**: To determine if one location is\
      \ east of another, we need to compare their longitudes. The longitude of Monterey\
      \ is approximately 121.88\xB0 W, while the approximate longitude of the Tri-Valley\
      \ area is around 121.9\xB0 W.\n\n3. **Determine the Relative Positions**: Since\
      \ the longitudes are very close, we can conclude that Naval Postgraduate School\
      \ in Monterey is not significantly east of Tri-Valley University in the Tri-Valley\
      \ area. They are roughly on the same longitudinal line.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\
