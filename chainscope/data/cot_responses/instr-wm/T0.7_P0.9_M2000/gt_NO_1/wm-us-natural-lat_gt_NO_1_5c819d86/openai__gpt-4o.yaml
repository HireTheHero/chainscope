      near the Sierra Nevada foothills.


      2. **Identify the location of Crazy Lake, CA**: Crazy Lake is not a widely recognized
      or documented natural landmark in California. If Crazy Lake refers to a lesser-known
      or informal location, it may not be found on standard maps or databases.


      3. **Comparison**: Without the specific location of Crazy Lake, it is not possible
      to definitively compare its latitude to that of Eastman Lake.

      recognized geographical feature, it is not possible to provide a clear YES or

      1. **Identify the approximate latitude of Lake Overholser, OK**: Lake Overholser
      is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Oklahoma City is situated at approximately
      35.5 degrees North latitude.

      Given these latitudes, Lake Overholser and Ivanpah Lake are approximately at

      mean one is slightly north or south of the other, but generally, they are very

      2. **Identify the location of Vulture Mountains, AZ**: The Vulture Mountains
      are located in central Arizona, near the town of Wickenburg, northwest of Phoenix.


      3. **Compare their latitudinal positions**: Luna Lake is situated in eastern
      Arizona, which is generally farther north compared to the central Arizona location
      of the Vulture Mountains.


      Given these points, Luna Lake is indeed located north of the Vulture Mountains.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.'

    91b4caf1-d751-4a7f-b584-eed92c8ab5b3: 'To determine if La Poudre Pass Lake is
      located north of Lake Agnes, we need to consider the geographical positions
      of both lakes in Colorado.


      1. **Identify the location of La Poudre Pass Lake**: La Poudre Pass Lake is
      located in the Rocky Mountains of northern Colorado. It is near the headwaters
      of the Colorado River, close to the northern boundary of Rocky Mountain National
      Park.


      2. **Identify the location of Lake Agnes**: Lake Agnes is located in the State
      Forest State Park, also in northern Colorado. It is situated near Cameron Pass,
      in the Medicine Bow Mountains.


      3. **Compare the latitudinal positions**: La Poudre Pass Lake is situated slightly
      north of the latitude where Lake Agnes is located.


      Therefore, based on their geographic locations, La Poudre Pass Lake is indeed
      north of Lake Agnes.


      The answer is: YES.'

      York is located north of Honnedaga Lake in New York, we need to consider their
      geographical positions.


      1. **Locate Lizard Pond, NY**: Lizard Pond is a small lake in the Adirondack
      Mountains, which is in upstate New York. There are several small ponds called
      Lizard Pond in the Adirondack region, but for the sake of this question, we
      assume it refers to the one located near the Indian Lake area in the central
      part of the Adirondacks.


      2. **Locate Honnedaga Lake, NY**: Honnedaga Lake is located in the southwestern
      part of the Adirondack Park, and it is relatively close to the town of Ohio,
      NY. It lies to the north of the West Canada Lakes Wilderness area.


      3. **Compare the Locations**: Generally, the Indian Lake area (where one of
      the Lizard Ponds is located) is situated to the northeast of where Honnedaga
      Lake is found.


      Based on this information, Lizard Pond (near Indian Lake) is indeed located
      north of Honnedaga Lake.
