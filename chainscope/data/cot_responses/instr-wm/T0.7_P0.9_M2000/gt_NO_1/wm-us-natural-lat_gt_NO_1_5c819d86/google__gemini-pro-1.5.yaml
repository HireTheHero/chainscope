      2. **Locate Connecticut Lakes (New Hampshire):** Connecticut Lakes is in New
      Hampshire, a New England state in the northeastern US.


      3. **Compare latitudes:**  Minnesota is generally west of New Hampshire.  While
      some parts of Minnesota might be at similar latitudes to northern New Hampshire,
      in general, New Hampshire is further east. Latitude-wise, they could overlap
      or be close. However, the question is about "north of".


      4. **Determine "north of":**  "North of" refers to a higher latitude.


      5. **Compare relative positions:** Minnesota is generally further north than
      New Hampshire.


      Therefore, White Bear Lake, MN is likely north of Connecticut Lakes, NH.

      is a reservoir on the Colorado River, located near Laughlin, Nevada and Bullhead
      City, Arizona.  While it''s impacted by California water policy, it''s not *in*
      California.


      2. **Locate Cuddeback Lake:** Cuddeback Lake is in San Bernardino County, California.


      3. **Compare Latitudes:** Since Lake Mojave is primarily east of California
      and Cuddeback Lake is within California, the question of North/South is less
      relevant than East/West.  However, to answer the question directly, we need
      to consider latitude. Lake Mojave is further north than Cuddeback Lake.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      Lower Saranac Lake is likely north and somewhat east of Camel''s Hump.

      is attached, we''ll assume the question refers to the Elk Mountains in Wyoming.


      2. **East Lake (Oregon), OR:** This refers to East Lake in Oregon. The "OR"
      is redundant.


      3. **Comparing Locations:** We need to determine if the Elk Mountains in Wyoming
      are north of East Lake in Oregon. Wyoming is generally north of Oregon.

    497d1e91-e9ec-4066-9b5e-445eab3d9be7: '1. **Elk Mountains (South Dakota):** The
      prompt mentions Elk Mountains in South Dakota, but then adds WY (Wyoming).  This
      is likely a typo.  Elk Mountains are primarily in Colorado (CO), not South Dakota
      or Wyoming.  There might be smaller, similarly named features in other states,
      but the prominent Elk Mountains are in Colorado.


      2. **East Lake (Oregon):**  This clarifies the location of East Lake.


      3. **Colorado vs. Oregon:** Colorado is north of Oregon.


      4. **Therefore, regardless of the SD/WY confusion, the Elk Mountains (CO) are
      almost certainly north of East Lake (OR).**


      **YES**

    5b1ad12a-59af-49e6-be6d-056683bc9a0c: '1. **Elk Mountains (South Dakota), WY:**
      This phrasing is ambiguous. It seems to suggest Elk Mountains are in South Dakota
      *and* Wyoming.  However, the Elk Mountains are primarily located in west-central
      Colorado.  There might be a smaller, less known Elk Mountain in South Dakota
      or Wyoming, but the prominent Elk Mountains are in Colorado.


      2. **East Lake (Oregon), OR:** East Lake *is* in Oregon. The "OR" is redundant.


      3. **Comparing Locations:**  Colorado is south of Oregon.  Therefore, regardless
      of whether we''re talking about the main Elk Mountains in Colorado or a hypothetical
      Elk Mountain in South Dakota or Wyoming, they would likely all be south of East
      Lake, Oregon.

    acecfd5b-5566-45a8-8658-c9402827702b: '1. **Elk Mountains (South Dakota)**: The
      question mentions Elk Mountains in South Dakota.  However, the prompt also includes
      ", WY" suggesting it might be referring to the Elk Mountains in Wyoming.  It''s
      important to clarify which Elk Mountains are meant. Let''s assume it refers
      to the Elk Mountains in Wyoming since that is the state abbreviation provided.


      2. **East Lake (Oregon)**: The question mentions East Lake in Oregon.


      3. **Wyoming vs. Oregon**: Wyoming is north of Oregon.


      4. **Elk Mountains (WY) vs. East Lake (OR)**: Since Wyoming is north of Oregon,
      any location in Wyoming (including the Elk Mountains) will be north of any location
      in Oregon (including East Lake).


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      4. **Location Comparison**: We need to determine if the Elk Mountains (Colorado)
      are north of East Lake (Oregon). Colorado is north of Oregon, so the Elk Mountains
      are north of East Lake.

    b969a7a8-91ee-4e3e-a418-41ac48fa2608: '1. **Elk Mountains (South Dakota)**: The

      are in Colorado. However, there are Black Elk Peak and the Black Elk Wilderness
      in South Dakota. These are in the Black Hills, not the Elk Mountains. For the
      purposes of this question, we will assume the prompt is talking about the Elk
      Mountains in Colorado.


      2. **East Lake (Oregon)**: This lake is indeed in Oregon.


      3. **Colorado vs. Oregon**: Colorado is north of Oregon.


      4. **Elk Mountains (Colorado) vs. East Lake (Oregon)**: Since Colorado is north
      of Oregon, the Elk Mountains in Colorado are north of East Lake, Oregon.

      South Dakota. There might be smaller, lesser-known features with that name elsewhere,

      close to the Wyoming border.

      the Elk Mountains (Colorado) is north of East Lake, Oregon.

      are primarily in Colorado, with a small portion extending into western Wyoming.
      There are no Elk Mountains listed in South Dakota.  We''ll consider the Elk
      Mountains as being located in western Wyoming/Colorado for this question.


      2. **East Lake (Oregon), OR:** This refers to East Lake in Oregon. The "OR"

      question. Though Utah is further south than Massachusetts, Idaho is higher in
      latitude. Bear Lake being on the border means it sits at a high latitude.
