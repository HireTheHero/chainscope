      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Castle Mountains is in Montana (MT)

      - Packwood Lake is in Washington state (WA)


      2) When comparing north-south positions in the US:

      - Montana shares a border with Washington state

      - Montana is entirely east of Washington

      - Montana is generally at a more northern latitude than Washington


      3) Castle Mountains is in central Montana

      - Packwood Lake is in south-central Washington state

      - Being in central Montana puts Castle Mountains at a higher latitude than most
      points in Washington


      4) Therefore, Castle Mountains in Montana is indeed located north of Packwood
      Lake in Washington.

      - Baldwin Hills is roughly at the same latitude as downtown LA

      - Puente Hills is also roughly at the same latitude as downtown LA


      6) Both ranges are approximately on the same east-west line, with Baldwin Hills

    a233a842-00d8-4d4d-86ee-10652662e226: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Lake Tuendae is located in the Mojave Desert, specifically near the Desert
      Studies Center at Zzyzx, CA.


      2. Soda Lake (San Bernardino County) is a dry lake bed also located in the Mojave
      Desert.


      3. Lake Tuendae is actually a small pond that is part of the Zzyzx Springs complex.


      4. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Soda Lake is a large dry lake bed that forms the lowest point of the Mojave
      River watershed

      - Lake Tuendae/Zzyzx is located on the western edge of Soda Lake


      5. Since Lake Tuendae is positioned on the western edge of Soda Lake, not north
      of it, this means it is not north of Soda Lake.


      Answer: NO'
