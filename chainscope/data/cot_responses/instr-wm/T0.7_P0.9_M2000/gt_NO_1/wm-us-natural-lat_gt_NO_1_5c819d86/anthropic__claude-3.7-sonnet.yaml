      Step 1: Identify the location of Marston Lake, CO.

      Marston Lake is a reservoir located in the southwestern part of Denver, Colorado.


      Step 2: Identify what the Front Range is.

      The Front Range is a mountain range that is part of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado.
      It runs north-south along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains.

      The Front Range extends from approximately the Wyoming border in the north down
      through central Colorado. Denver (where Marston Lake is located) sits on the
      plains just east of the Front Range.


      Step 4: Compare the positions.

      Marston Lake is located east of the Front Range, not north of it. The lake is
      situated in the Denver metro area, which is positioned east of the mountain
      range, not north of it.


      NO, Marston Lake, CO is not located north of Front Range, CO. It is located

      the relative positions of these two natural places.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Castle Mountains (Montana), MT is in Montana, as indicated by both the name
      and the MT abbreviation.

      - Packwood Lake, WA is in Washington state, as indicated by the WA abbreviation.


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of Montana and Washington.

      - Montana is located in the northern United States, bordering Canada.

      - Washington state is also in the northern United States, bordering Canada,
      but it''s located to the west of Montana.


      Step 3: Consider north-south positioning.

      - Both states are at similar latitudes in the northern United States.

      - Montana and Washington both border Canada, so they share roughly similar northern
      extents.

      - Within these states, the specific locations could vary in their exact north-south
      positioning.


      Step 4: Check the specific locations.

      - Castle Mountains in Montana would be somewhere within Montana''s boundaries.

      - Packwood Lake in Washington would be somewhere within Washington''s boundaries.

      - Without specific coordinates, I need to rely on general knowledge of these
      locations.

      - Packwood Lake is in the Cascade Range in southern Washington.

      - The Castle Mountains in Montana are in the central to northern part of Montana.


      Based on these considerations, since Montana and Washington are at similar latitudes
      but Castle Mountains is likely in the northern part of Montana while Packwood
      Lake is in the southern part of Washington, Castle Mountains is likely north
      of Packwood Lake.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify this. Let me reconsider the latitudes more carefully.


      Packwood Lake is in the Cascade Range of Washington, which would put it roughly
      in the middle latitude of Washington state.

      The Castle Mountains in Montana are in the central part of Montana.


      Since Washington and Montana are at similar latitudes, and these specific locations
      are in the middle portions of their respective states, they are likely at similar
      latitudes, with Castle Mountains possibly slightly north of Packwood Lake due
      to Montana''s generally higher latitude.

      Step 1: Identify the locations mentioned.

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is in Montana (MT)

      - Salish Sea is in Washington state (WA)


      Step 2: Determine their general geographic positions.

      - Montana is located east of Washington state

      - Washington state borders the Pacific Ocean on its western side

      - The Salish Sea is along the northwest coast of Washington, including the waters
      of Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the Strait of Georgia

      - Swiftcurrent Lake is in Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Glacier National Park (and thus Swiftcurrent Lake) is located near the Canadian
      border in the northern part of Montana

      - The Salish Sea extends from the middle/upper part of Washington''s western
      coast

      - Geographically, northwestern Montana is at a similar latitude to or slightly
      north of the Salish Sea

      Step 2: Let me identify where Henry Hagg Lake is located in Oregon.

      Henry Hagg Lake is a reservoir located in Washington County, Oregon, near the
      town of Forest Grove.


      Step 3: Let me determine their relative positions.

      Chehalem Mountains are located in the northern part of Yamhill County and southern
      Washington County, while Henry Hagg Lake is in western Washington County.


      Step 4: Comparing their specific north-south positioning:

      Chehalem Mountains run roughly northwest to southeast, with their northern portions
      near Newberg and Sherwood. Henry Hagg Lake is located southwest of Forest Grove,
      which puts it south of the main portion of the Chehalem Mountains.


      Based on this analysis, the Chehalem Mountains are generally positioned to the
      north of Henry Hagg Lake.

      the relative positions of these two Oregon locations.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Chehalem Mountains is a mountain range in northwestern Oregon, in the Willamette
      Valley region.

      - Henry Hagg Lake is a reservoir in Washington County, Oregon, also in the northwestern
      part of the state.


      Step 2: Determine their specific positions.

      - Chehalem Mountains runs roughly northwest to southeast between Newberg and
      Sherwood.

      - Henry Hagg Lake is located near Forest Grove and Gaston.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Chehalem Mountains is located in the northeastern part of Yamhill County and
      southern Washington County.

      - Henry Hagg Lake is located in western Washington County.

      - When looking at their positions, Chehalem Mountains is generally to the northeast
      of Henry Hagg Lake.


      Step 4: Determine north/south relationship.

      - Since Chehalem Mountains is northeast of Henry Hagg Lake, it has both an eastern
      and northern component relative to the lake.

      - This means at least portions of the Chehalem Mountains are indeed north of
      Henry Hagg Lake.


      YES'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both mountain ranges in Colorado.

      - La Plata Mountains are located in southwestern Colorado, part of the San Juan
      Mountains.

      - The Sangre de Cristo Range runs along the eastern edge of central and southern
      Colorado (and extends into New Mexico).


      Step 2: Compare their north-south positions.

      - La Plata Mountains are positioned in the southwestern quadrant of Colorado.

      - The Sangre de Cristo Range runs north-south along the eastern side of Colorado.

      - When comparing their latitudes, the La Plata Mountains are situated further
      north than the southern portions of the Sangre de Cristo Range, but the Sangre
      de Cristo Range extends further north than the La Plata Mountains.


      Step 3: Make the determination based on overall positioning.

      - Since the Sangre de Cristo Range extends further north than the La Plata Mountains,
      the La Plata Mountains cannot be considered north of the Sangre de Cristo Range.
