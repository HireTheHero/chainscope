    7ecaf893-1795-4e19-afbb-86eeaeabd886: '1. **Locate Clint, TX:** Clint is in far
      west Texas, near El Paso.

      2. **Locate Peralta, NM:** Peralta is in central New Mexico, south of Albuquerque.

      3. **Compare Latitudes:**  Texas generally lies east of New Mexico. While Clint
      is further west in Texas than most cities, and Peralta is in central NM, meaning
      they are closer longitudinally than a typical TX/NM city pair would be, Clint
      is still significantly further north than Peralta due to the overall geographic
      layout of these states.


      **Answer:** YES

      in El Paso County, Texas, near the Texas-New Mexico border.  It is effectively
      part of the El Paso metropolitan area.


      2. **Locate Peralta, NM:** Peralta is a town in Valencia County, New Mexico,
      south of Albuquerque.


      3. **Compare Latitudes:**  Since latitude determines how far north or south
      a location is, this is the key information. El Paso is significantly further
      south than Albuquerque. Therefore, Clint, TX is south of Peralta, NM.

      in El Paso County, Texas, near the Texas-New Mexico border.  It''s essentially
      part of the El Paso metropolitan area and therefore on the western edge of Texas.


      2. **Locate Peralta, NM:** Peralta is a town in Valencia County, New Mexico,
      south of Albuquerque.  This places it in central New Mexico.


      3. **Compare Latitudes:** Since Clint is far west Texas and Peralta is in central
      New Mexico, Clint would have to be significantly *north* to be at a higher latitude
      than Peralta. Western Texas is generally at a similar latitude to central New
      Mexico.
