      - East Mountain, TX is in Texas, in the eastern part of the state.

      - Pocola, OK is in Oklahoma.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - East Mountain is in East Texas, but still within Texas.

      - Pocola is in eastern Oklahoma, near the Arkansas border.

      - East Mountain, being in Texas, would be south of Pocola, which is in Oklahoma.

      - There are no unusual geographic exceptions that would place East Mountain

      - Burns Flat, OK is in Oklahoma, which is generally north of Texas.


      Step 2: Let me be more precise about their relative positions.

      - Bertram, TX is located in central Texas, in Burnet County.

      - Burns Flat, OK is located in western Oklahoma, in Washita County.


      Step 3: Consider their positions on a north-south axis.

      - Texas is south of Oklahoma, with their state border running east-west.

      - Since Bertram is in Texas and Burns Flat is in Oklahoma, and the Oklahoma-Texas
      border runs east-west, Bertram would be south of Burns Flat.

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Portageville is in Missouri (MO)

      - Columbus Junction is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Iowa is located north of Missouri in the United States


      Step 3: But I need to check the specific locations of these cities, as a city
      in southern Iowa could be further south than a city in northern Missouri.


      Step 4: Portageville, MO is located in the southeastern "bootheel" region of
      Missouri, near the border with Tennessee and Kentucky. This puts it in the far
      southern part of Missouri.


      Step 5: Columbus Junction, IA is located in southeastern Iowa, but since Iowa
      is entirely north of most of Missouri, and especially north of Missouri''s bootheel
      region, Columbus Junction must be north of Portageville.


      NO - Portageville, MO is not located north of Columbus Junction, IA. It is located
      south of it.'

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - La Plata is in Maryland (MD)

      - Kenilworth is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Maryland is generally south of New Jersey on the East Coast of the United
      States.

      - La Plata is in southern Maryland

      - Kenilworth is in northern New Jersey


      Step 4: Compare latitudes.

      be south of Kenilworth.

      - Therefore, La Plata is NOT north of Kenilworth.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Bruce, MS is in Mississippi (MS), which is a southern state in the US.

      - Knightsville, IN is in Indiana (IN), which is a midwestern state in the US.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map of the United States.

      - Mississippi is located in the deep south of the United States.

      - Indiana is located much further north, in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - States in the US are generally arranged with northern states being at higher
      latitudes than southern states.

      - Indiana is significantly north of Mississippi on the map.

      - Any city in Indiana (including Knightsville) would be north of most cities
      in Mississippi (including Bruce).


      Therefore, Bruce, MS is NOT located north of Knightsville, IN. Bruce is south
      of Knightsville.

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the states.

      - Texas is generally south of Kansas in the United States.

      - Kansas is north of Texas, with Oklahoma in between them.


      Step 3: Check the specific locations within their states.

      - While Pottsboro is in northern Texas, Kansas as a whole is significantly north
      of Texas.

      - Maize, KS is in the southern part of Kansas, but even southern Kansas is north
      of the Texas-Oklahoma border.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Even though Pottsboro is in northern Texas, it would still be south of Maize,
      Kansas, because the entirety of Texas is south of Kansas.


      NO, Pottsboro, TX is not located north of Maize, KS. It is south of Maize, KS.'

      of Pottsboro, TX and Maize, KS to answer whether Pottsboro is north of Maize.


      Step 1: Let me recall the approximate locations of these cities.

      - Pottsboro, TX would be in Texas, which is in the southern United States.

      - Maize, KS would be in Kansas, which is north of Texas in the central United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions in terms of latitude.

      - Texas generally lies south of Kansas.

      - Cities in Texas would typically have lower latitude values than cities in
      Kansas.

      - Pottsboro is in Texas, so it''s likely south of most Kansas cities.

      - Maize is in Kansas, so it''s likely north of most Texas cities.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the general geographic relationship.

      - Since Kansas is north of Texas, and Pottsboro is in Texas while Maize is in
      Kansas, Pottsboro would be south of Maize, not north.

      - Illinois is south of Wisconsin


      Step 3: Check if there are any exceptions to this general north-south relationship.

      - Elburn is in northern Illinois

      - Mole Lake is in northern Wisconsin

      - Even northern Illinois is still south of northern Wisconsin


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Step 1: Identify the states and their general locations.

      - NC stands for North Carolina, which is a state in the southeastern United
      States.

      - PA stands for Pennsylvania, which is a state in the northeastern United States.

      - Generally, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina.


      Step 2: Consider the approximate locations of the specific cities.

      - Stantonsburg is in North Carolina

      - Lehighton is in Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - Since Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina, and these cities aren''t near
      the border regions where exceptions might occur, Stantonsburg in NC would be
      south of Lehighton in PA.

      - This means Stantonsburg is NOT north of Lehighton.

      - Lehighton, PA is in Pennsylvania, which is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is significantly north of North Carolina.


      Step 3: Check the specific locations of these cities within their states.

      - Stantonsburg is in eastern North Carolina.

      - Lehighton is in eastern Pennsylvania.

      - The relative positions within their states don''t change the overall north-south
      relationship between them.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geographic knowledge.

      - Since Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina, and the specific locations
      of these cities within their states don''t reverse this relationship, Stantonsburg

      United States.

      - Lehighton is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is a state in the northeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located north of North Carolina.

      - States in the US generally follow a north-south arrangement where higher latitudes
      are in the north.


      Step 3: Even without knowing the exact locations within each state, I can determine
      that:

      - Any city in North Carolina would typically be south of any city in Pennsylvania,
      as NC is entirely south of PA.

      - Stantonsburg, being in NC, would be south of Lehighton, PA.

      Coast on the border with Louisiana.

      - Norfork, AR is located in north-central Arkansas.

      - Norfork is in the northern part of Arkansas.


      Step 3: Make the north-south comparison.

      is located.

      - Norfork, being in north-central Arkansas, is definitely north of Pearlington,
      MS.
