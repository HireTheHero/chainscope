      \ of the island.\n   - Michigan is situated much farther north, in the Midwestern\
      \ region of the U.S.\n   - Since Cuba is west of the prime meridian but east\
      \ of most of the United States, the precise comparison between Sierra de los\
      \ \xD3rganos and Ford Lake (Michigan) is necessary.\n\n4. **Longitude comparison**:\
      \  \n   - The approximate longitude of Sierra de los \xD3rganos is around **-83.7\xB0\
      **.\n   - The approximate longitude of Ford Lake (Michigan) is around **-83.6\xB0\
      **.\n   - Since **-83.7\xB0 is slightly west of -83.6\xB0**, Sierra de los \xD3\
      rganos is **west** of Ford Lake.\n\n### Final Answer:  \n**NO**, Sierra de los\
      \ \xD3rganos is not east of Ford Lake (Michigan); it is slightly west."
