      1.  **Identify Machuelo Abajo:** Machuelo Abajo is a barrio (neighborhood/district)
      within the municipality of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is an island in the
      Caribbean Sea.

      2.  **Identify Capracotta:** Capracotta is a town (comune) in the Molise region

      1.  **Identify the location of Mascouche:** Mascouche is a city in Quebec, Canada.

      2.  **Identify the location of Shipley, West Sussex:** Shipley is a village
      in West Sussex, which is in England, United Kingdom.

      3.  **Compare their relative positions on the globe:** Canada is located in
      North America. England is located in Europe. North America is geographically
      west of Europe across the Atlantic Ocean.

      4.  **Determine the directional relationship:** Therefore, Mascouche (in Canada)
      is located west of Shipley (in England).

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Mascouche is *east*
      of Shipley. Since Mascouche is west of Shipley, the statement is incorrect.
