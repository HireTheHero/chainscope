      1. First, I need to locate both places:

      - Patcham is a suburb of Brighton, England, located in the south of the UK

      1. First, I need to locate both places:

      - Peterchurch is in Herefordshire, England, UK

      - Mohadi is in Maharashtra, India


      2. Now I need to compare their locations:

      - England is in Western Europe

      - India is in South Asia

      - When looking at a world map, India is clearly east of England


      3. Therefore, since:

      - Peterchurch is in England

      - Mohadi is in India

      - And India is east of England

      - Then Mohadi must be east of Peterchurch, not the other way around

      1. First, let me identify Ramsey Island:

      - Ramsey Island is located off the coast of Wales, UK

      - Specifically, it''s in the Celtic Sea, off the coast of Pembrokeshire

      - This puts it in Western Europe


      2. Next, let me identify Rukum District:

      - Rukum District is in Nepal

      - Nepal is in South Asia

      - Rukum is in the western part of Nepal


      3. Now I can compare their positions:

      - The UK is west of Nepal

      - Therefore, Ramsey Island (in the UK) is west of Rukum District (in Nepal)

      - Not east of it

      1. First, let me identify these locations:

      - Combe Down is in Bath, England, UK

      - Koraput district is in Odisha state, India


      2. Now let''s determine their relative positions:

      - Combe Down is in western Europe

      - Koraput is in eastern India


      3. Looking at the global map:

      - India is significantly east of the UK

      - Therefore, Combe Down (in UK) is WEST of Koraput district (in India)


      4. Since the question asks if Combe Down is EAST of Koraput, and we determined
      it''s actually WEST...
