      3) Now I need to compare their relative positions globally. The United States
      is located in North America, which is west of the United Kingdom (which is in
      Europe).


      4) More specifically, Maryland is on the eastern seaboard of the United States,
      but even the easternmost points of the US mainland are still west of the United
      Kingdom.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Graeagle, California is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Gibson, Tennessee is in Tennessee, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - California is on the west coast, while Tennessee is much further east.

      - In the United States, locations in California are generally west of locations
      in Tennessee.


      Step 3: Apply directional reasoning.

      - For a place in California to be east of a place in Tennessee, it would need
      to be located across the globe on the other side (which isn''t possible for
      these two U.S. locations).

      - Since California is west of Tennessee on the map of the United States, Graeagle

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Graeagle is in California, which is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Gibson is in Tennessee, which is in the southeastern/eastern part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - California is one of the westernmost states in the continental US.

      - Tennessee is much further east, roughly in the middle-eastern portion of the
      country.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since California is on the west coast and Tennessee is in the eastern half
      of the country, any location in California (including Graeagle) would be west
      of any location in Tennessee (including Gibson).

      - For Graeagle to be east of Gibson, it would need to be located further east

      - Graeagle, California is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Gibson, Tennessee is in Tennessee, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west arrangement of U.S. states.

      - California is one of the westernmost states in the continental U.S.

      - Tennessee is much further east, located in the eastern half of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the continental United States, you would encounter
      California first, then eventually Tennessee.

      - This means Tennessee (and thus Gibson, Tennessee) is east of California (and
      thus Graeagle, California).

      - Conversely, California (and Graeagle) is west of Tennessee (and Gibson).

      I need to determine where La Vera is. There are a few possibilities:

      White County, Indiana is located approximately in the central part of the United

      - Basti district is a district in Uttar Pradesh, India.

      - Motobu is a town located in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.


      Step 2: Determine their general positions on a world map.

      - India is located in South Asia.

      - Japan (including Okinawa) is located in East Asia.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - India is positioned to the west of Japan on a world map.

      - Basti district in Uttar Pradesh would be significantly west of any location
      in Japan.

      - Okinawa is one of the easternmost parts of Japan, extending into the Pacific
      Ocean.


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      - Since Basti district is in India, which is west of Japan, and Motobu is in
      Okinawa, Japan, Basti district cannot be east of Motobu.

      Step 1: Let me identify where Santo Domingo Oeste is located.

      Santo Domingo Oeste is a city in the Dominican Republic, which is in the Caribbean.
      The name "Oeste" means "West" in Spanish, indicating it''s on the western side
      of Santo Domingo.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Mira, Veneto is located.

      Mira is a town in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy.


      Step 3: Compare their global positions.

      - The Dominican Republic is in the western hemisphere (North America/Caribbean)

      - Italy is in the eastern hemisphere (Europe)


      Step 4: Determine east-west relationship.

      When comparing locations across hemispheres, we need to consider global longitude.
      The Dominican Republic is much further west in global terms than Italy. This
      means Santo Domingo Oeste is west of Mira, Veneto, not east of it.

      if Ramsey Island is located east of Rukum District.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Ramsey Island.

      Ramsey Island is a small island off the coast of Wales, UK, in the St. George''s
      Channel of the Atlantic Ocean. It''s located in Western Europe.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Rukum District.

      Rukum District is located in western Nepal, which is in South Asia.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions globally.

      When considering global east-west positioning, I need to determine which is
      further east in terms of longitude:

      - Nepal is in Asia, which is east of Europe

      - Rukum District is in western Nepal, but even western Nepal is still far east
      of any part of the UK

      - Ramsey Island, being off the western coast of Wales, is in Western Europe


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Nepal (including Rukum District) is located in Asia, which is east of
      Europe (where Ramsey Island is located), Ramsey Island cannot be east of Rukum
      District. Rather, Ramsey Island is west of Rukum District.

      Northern Ireland).

      - When looking at a world map, Europe is to the east of North America.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Florida is in North America, which is west of Europe, and Lisburn is
      in Northern Ireland (Europe), Sarasota Springs would be WEST of Lisburn, not

      \ move eastward in North America (114\xB0W is east of 139\xB0W), and Indiana's\
      \ longitude range (84\xB0W-88\xB0W) has smaller numbers than British Columbia's\

      - Vinger (or Vingrom) appears to be a small settlement in Norway, in northern
      Europe.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a world map.

      - India is in South Asia.

      - Norway is in Northern Europe.

      - Lumle is a village in Nepal, which is in South Asia.


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative positions on a world map.

      - Italy is located in Europe, which is west of Asia.

      - Nepal is located in Asia, which is east of Europe.

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both Cerda and Lumle.

      - Cerda is a town in Sicily, Italy.

      - Lumle is a village in Nepal, near Pokhara.


      Step 2: Now I need to compare their positions on a global map.

      - Italy is in southern Europe.
