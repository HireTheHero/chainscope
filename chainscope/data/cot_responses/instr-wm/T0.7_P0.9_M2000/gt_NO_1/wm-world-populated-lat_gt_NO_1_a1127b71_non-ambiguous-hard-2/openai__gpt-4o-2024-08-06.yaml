      1. Identify the location of Ranau District: Ranau District is located in the
      Malaysian state of Sabah, on the island of Borneo.


      2. Identify the location of Bhagalpur Division: Bhagalpur Division is located
      in the state of Bihar, in the northeastern part of India.


      3. Determine the relative positions: Malaysia (where Ranau is located) is southeast
      of India. More specifically, Borneo is situated to the southeast of the Indian
      subcontinent.


      4. Compare the latitudinal positions: Bhagalpur is situated in the northern
      hemisphere but is further north compared to the latitude of Ranau in Borneo.
