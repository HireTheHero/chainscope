      \ and north/south?**  When we think about location in terms of north/south,\
      \ we need to consider a reference point.  For a location to be north of another\
      \ location, it has to be positioned higher on the north side of that reference\
      \ point.\n\n**Therefore, Bay Pines, Florida is likely located somewhere in Florida.\
