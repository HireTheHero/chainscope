      - Dibrugarh is a district in the state of Assam, India

      - It is located in northeastern India, near the border with China and Myanmar


      2. Next, let''s locate Velika Planina:

      - Velika Planina is a mountain plateau located in Slovenia

      - Slovenia is in central Europe, specifically in the southern part of Central
      Europe


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Dibrugarh is in northeastern India, which is in Asia

      - Velika Planina is in Slovenia, which is in Europe

      - Dibrugarh is significantly east and south of Velika Planina


      4. Determining the north/south relationship:

      2. Ranau District is located in Malaysia, specifically in the state of Sabah
      on the island of Borneo.


      3. Bhagalpur division is located in India, specifically in the state of Bihar
      in the eastern part of the country.


      4. These two locations are on completely different continents - Malaysia in
      Southeast Asia and India in South Asia.


      5. To determine if Ranau District is north of Bhagalpur division, I need to
      compare their geographical positions.


      6. Looking at a world map, Ranau District is significantly south of Bhagalpur
      division.


      7. Therefore, Ranau District is NOT located north of Bhagalpur division.


      Answer: NO'
