      1. **Rutland Island**: This is an island off the northwest coast of County Donegal

      2. **Vicovaro**: This is a town in the Lazio region of central Italy, located

      Now, let''s analyze their relative latitudes:


      - Rutland Island (Ireland) is located at a higher (more northern) latitude because
      Ireland is situated significantly farther north than central Italy.

      - Vicovaro, being in central Italy, is farther south compared to most of Ireland.


      So, when comparing these two:


      - Rutland Island is in Ireland, which is generally north of Italy.

      - Therefore, Rutland Island is north of Vicovaro.

      \ of Maharashtra, India. It lies in the central-western part of India. Maharashtra\
      \ is situated roughly between latitudes 15\xB0N and 22\xB0N.\n\nStep 2: Location\
      \ of Clarenville  \nClarenville is a town in the province of Newfoundland and\

      \ Newfoundland and Labrador is situated between approximately 46\xB0N and 53\xB0\
      N latitude.\n\nStep 3: Comparing latitudes  \n- Mohadi is approximately at 21\xB0\
      N latitude.  \n- Clarenville is approximately at 48\xB0N latitude.\n\nSince\
      \ 48\xB0N (Clarenville) is clearly north of 21\xB0N (Mohadi), we conclude:\n\

      - Beitbridge is approximately at latitude **-22 degrees** (22 degrees south
      of the Equator).

      - Bui, Cameroon, is approximately at latitude **6-7 degrees north** of the Equator.

      \ north of Llanddona, let's go through the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Identify\
      \ the locations**:\n   - **A\xEFn Defla** is a city in northern Algeria, which\
      \ is in North Africa.\n   - **Llanddona** is a village in Wales, United Kingdom,\
      \ located on the island of Anglesey.\n\n2. **Determine their latitudes**:\n\
      \   - A\xEFn Defla is approximately at latitude **36.26\xB0 North**.\n   - Llanddona\
      \ is approximately at latitude **53.32\xB0 North**.\n\n3. **Compare the latitudes**:\n\
      \   - Since 53.32\xB0 N (Llanddona) is farther north than 36.26\xB0 N (A\xEF\
      n Defla), Llanddona is located to the north of A\xEFn Defla.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ answer to the question \"Is A\xEFn Defla located north of Llanddona?\" is:\n\
      \n**NO**."

      \ **53.3\xB0 North**.\n\n3. **Compare the latitudes:**\n   - 36.25\xB0 N (A\xEF\
      n Defla) is clearly south of 53.3\xB0 N (Llanddona).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\
      \   - Since A\xEFn Defla is at a lower latitude than Llanddona, it is located\
      \ to the south of Llanddona.\n\n**Answer: NO**."
