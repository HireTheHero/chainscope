    1e2b6e3f-8ca6-4c01-bbda-9b15b8a43d42: 'Okay, let''s break this down step-by-step:


      1.  **Identify the first location:** Mongo, Chad.

      2.  **Determine its continent and approximate latitude:** Mongo is a city in
      Chad, which is a country in Central Africa. Its approximate latitude is around
      12 degrees North.

      3.  **Identify the second location:** Camden County, North Carolina.

      4.  **Determine its country/state and approximate latitude:** Camden County
      is in North Carolina, which is a state in the United States. Its approximate
      latitude is around 36 degrees North.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** We need to determine if 12 degrees North (Mongo)
      is north of 36 degrees North (Camden County).

      6.  **Conclusion:** Since 12 degrees is a smaller number than 36 degrees, 12
      degrees North is south of 36 degrees North. Therefore, Mongo, Chad is south
      of Camden County, North Carolina.

      1.  **Identify Location 1:** Koraput district.

      2.  **Find Location 1:** Koraput district is in Odisha, India. India is entirely
      in the Northern Hemisphere. Koraput''s approximate latitude is around 18 degrees
      North.

      3.  **Identify Location 2:** Grant County, Indiana.

      4.  **Find Location 2:** Grant County is in Indiana, USA. The USA (specifically
      Indiana) is entirely in the Northern Hemisphere. Grant County''s approximate
      latitude is around 40 degrees North.

      5.  **Compare Latitudes:** 18 degrees North (Koraput) vs. 40 degrees North (Grant
      County).

      6.  **Determine Relative Position:** A higher latitude number in the Northern
      Hemisphere means a location is further north. 40 degrees North is further north
      than 18 degrees North. Therefore, Grant County, Indiana is north of Koraput
      district.

      7.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Koraput district is *north*
      of Grant County, Indiana. Since Grant County is north of Koraput, Koraput is
      *south* of Grant County.

      2.  **Identify Zira''a:** "Zira''a" is an Arabic word meaning agriculture or
      farming. It is not commonly known as a specific geographical place name in relation
      to Manchester or the UK. There is a Zira''a Island (also known as Nargin) in
      the Caspian Sea, belonging to Azerbaijan. There might be other minor localities
      or businesses with this name elsewhere, but no prominent place called Zira''a
      is typically associated with the geography near Crumpsall.

      3.  **Compare Locations:** Crumpsall is in Manchester, UK. Zira''a Island is
      in Azerbaijan, which is far to the east/southeast of the UK. Therefore, Zira''a
      Island is not north of Crumpsall.
