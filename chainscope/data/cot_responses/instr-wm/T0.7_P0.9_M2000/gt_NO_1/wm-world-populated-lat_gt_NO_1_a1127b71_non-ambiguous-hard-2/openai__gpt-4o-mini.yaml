    01564be4-ee66-467c-859f-9dba64cb5fc5: 'To determine if Mongo, Chad is located
      north of Camden County, North Carolina, we need to consider the geographical
      locations of both places.


      1. **Locate Camden County, North Carolina**: Camden County is situated in the
      northeastern part of North Carolina, bordered by the Albemarle Sound to the
      west and the Pasquotank River to the east.


      2. **Locate Mongo, Chad**: Mongo is a town in Chad, which is located in north-central
      Africa. Chad is situated south of Libya and northeast of Nigeria.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Camden County is at approximately 36 degrees North
      latitude, while Chad, including Mongo, is generally located between 7 and 24
      degrees North latitude.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Camden County is at a higher
      latitude (further north) than Mongo, Chad, it means that Mongo is located further
      south compared to Camden County.


      Based on this reasoning, Mongo, Chad is not located north of Camden County,
      North Carolina.

      in the northern hemisphere but further north compared to Madurai.


      After analyzing the locations:

      - Thiruparankundram Dargah is south of Jezzine District.
