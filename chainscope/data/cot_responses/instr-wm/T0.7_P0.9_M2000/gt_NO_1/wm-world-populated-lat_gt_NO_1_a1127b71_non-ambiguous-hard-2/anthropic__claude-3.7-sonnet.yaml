      Rwanda is much further north on the African continent than South Africa.

      Since Moretele is in South Africa and Gicumbi is in Rwanda, Moretele must be
      south of Gicumbi.


      Therefore, Moretele Local Municipality is NOT located north of Gicumbi District.

      1) First, I need to identify where Jubb al-Safa is located. Jubb al-Safa appears

      3) Now I need to determine their relative positions. Syria is in the Middle
      East, which is southeast of the United Kingdom. This means that Jubb al-Safa

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Maer is in Staffordshire, which is a county in England, UK.

      - Gamawa is a town in Bauchi State, Nigeria.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate latitudes.

      - Maer, Staffordshire is located in the UK, which is in the northern hemisphere
      at approximately 52-53 degrees north latitude.

      - Gamawa in Nigeria is located in West Africa, which is closer to the equator,
      at approximately 12 degrees north latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Since Maer is at around 52-53 degrees north and Gamawa is at around 12 degrees
      north, Maer is farther north than Gamawa.

      - For a location to be north of another, it needs to have a higher latitude.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      - Since Gamawa has a lower latitude than Maer, Gamawa is not north of Maer,
      but rather south of it.


      NO, Gamawa is not located north of Maer, Staffordshire.'

      Step 1: Let me identify where Thiruparankundram Dargah is located.

      Thiruparankundram Dargah is a religious site located in Thiruparankundram, near
      Madurai in the state of Tamil Nadu, southern India.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Jezzine District is located.

      Jezzine District is an administrative district in southern Lebanon, in the Middle
      East.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      India is located in South Asia, while Lebanon is in the Middle East (Western
      Asia).

      Looking at their positions on a world map:

      - India is positioned east of Lebanon

      - In terms of north-south positioning, southern India (where Thiruparankundram
      is) is located south of Lebanon (where Jezzine District is)


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Thiruparankundram Dargah in southern India is south of Jezzine District
      in Lebanon, it is NOT located north of Jezzine District.


      NO'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Thousand Islands (Indonesia) is an archipelago in Indonesia, which is in Southeast
      Asia.

      - Littlefield, Texas is a city in the United States.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate latitudes.

      - Indonesia is located near the equator, with the Thousand Islands archipelago
      at approximately 5-6 degrees North latitude.

      - Littlefield, Texas is located in the northern hemisphere at approximately
      33.9 degrees North latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - Places with lower latitude numbers in the Northern Hemisphere are closer to
      the equator and thus further south.

      - Places with higher latitude numbers in the Northern Hemisphere are further
      north.

      - 5-6 degrees North (Thousand Islands) is a lower number than 33.9 degrees North
      (Littlefield).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on latitude comparison.

      - Since Thousand Islands has a lower northern latitude than Littlefield, Texas,
      it is located south of Littlefield, not north.


      NO, Thousand Islands (Indonesia) is not located north of Littlefield, Texas.
      It is located south of Littlefield, Texas.'
