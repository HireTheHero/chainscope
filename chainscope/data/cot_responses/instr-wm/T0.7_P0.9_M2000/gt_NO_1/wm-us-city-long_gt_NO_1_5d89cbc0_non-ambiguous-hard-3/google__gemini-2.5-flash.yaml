      Duson, LA is in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana. A quick search or mental map places
      it in the southern part of Louisiana.


      **Step 2: Locate Fort Rucker, AL**

      Fort Rucker, AL is in Dale County, Alabama. A quick search or mental map places
      it in the southeastern part of Alabama.

      will be west of any location in Alabama, assuming comparable latitudes.

      4.  **Hypothetical Consideration (if a town existed):** If there *were* a town

      Therefore, any point in Colorado would be west of Grandview, MO.

      **Step 2: Find the longitude of West Conshohocken, PA.**

      A quick search reveals that West Conshohocken, PA is located at approximately
      **-75.31 degrees longitude**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**

      *   Circleville, OH: -82.94 degrees

      *   West Conshohocken, PA: -75.31 degrees


      On a longitude scale, numbers further to the west (left on a map) are more negative.
      Numbers further to the east (right on a map) are less negative (closer to zero).


      Since -82.94 is a smaller (more negative) number than -75.31, Circleville, OH
      is located to the west of West Conshohocken, PA.


      **Conclusion:** If Circleville, OH is to the west of West Conshohocken, PA,
      then it is NOT located east of West Conshohocken, PA.
