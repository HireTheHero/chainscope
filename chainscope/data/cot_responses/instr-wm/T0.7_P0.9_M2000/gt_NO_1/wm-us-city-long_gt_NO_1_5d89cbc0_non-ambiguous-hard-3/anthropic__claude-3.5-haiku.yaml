      1. First, I''ll locate Riverwood, KY on a map

      2. Then I''ll locate North Beach, MD on a map

      3. I''ll compare their relative east-west positions


      Step 1: Riverwood, KY appears to be in the western part of Kentucky, likely

      Step 3: Comparing their positions:

      - Kentucky is west of Maryland

      - Riverwood, being in western Kentucky, would be even further west

      - North Beach is in eastern Maryland


      Therefore, Riverwood, KY is located west of North Beach, MD.
