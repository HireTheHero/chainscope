      Step 1: Identify the states.

      Thompsonville is in Connecticut, which is in the northeastern United States,
      east of New York state.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      New York state is generally west of Connecticut. Specifically, Gananda is in
      western New York, while Thompsonville is in north-central Connecticut. Connecticut
      as a whole lies east of the majority of New York state.


      Step 4: Make the east-west determination.

      Since Thompsonville, CT is in Connecticut (which is east of New York), and Gananda
      is in western New York, Gananda is located WEST of Thompsonville, not east.

      Step 3: Apply geographical knowledge of the US.

      - Even eastern parts of Michigan are generally west of most of New York

      - Hudson Falls, NY (being in New York) would be east of Fowlerville, MI (being
      in Michigan)

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is in the Northeast region of the United States

      - Generally, New York is east of Michigan


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Fowlerville is in Michigan, which means it''s likely in the western part compared

      - Hudson Falls is in New York, likely in the eastern part of the United States


      Step 3: Apply directional logic.

      - "East" means further toward the Atlantic Ocean in this context

      - New York is east of Michigan

      - Cities in New York would therefore generally be east of cities in Michigan


      Since Fowlerville is in Michigan and Hudson Falls is in New York, and New York
      is east of Michigan, Fowlerville cannot be east of Hudson Falls. Instead, Fowlerville

      Step 3: Looking more specifically at these locations:

      - Fowlerville, MI is in the eastern part of Michigan, but Michigan as a whole
      is west of New York.

      - Hudson Falls, NY is in eastern New York state, relatively close to the Vermont

      determine the relative east-west positions of these two cities.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both cities.

      - French Lick is in Indiana (IN), which is in the Midwest region of the United
      States.

      - Mauricetown is in New Jersey (NJ), which is on the East Coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Indiana is significantly west of New Jersey.

      - New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern seaboard.

      - Indiana is several states away from the East Coast.


      Step 3: Compare their approximate longitudes.

      - States on the East Coast like New Jersey are generally around 74-75 degrees
      west longitude.

      - Indiana is roughly around 86 degrees west longitude.

      - A smaller longitude number (when both are west) indicates a more easterly
      position.


      Since Mauricetown, NJ would have a smaller west longitude than French Lick,
      IN, Mauricetown is east of French Lick.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO (French Lick, IN is NOT east of Mauricetown, NJ;
      it is west of it)'

      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Colorado is directly west of Kansas in the United States

      Step 4: Double-check by considering possible exceptions.

      - Even if Granada were in eastern Colorado and Lecompton in western Kansas,
      Colorado''s eastern border meets Kansas''s western border, so a Colorado city
      would still be west of or at the same longitude as a Kansas city.

      - Goreville is in Illinois (IL)

      - Rich Creek is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Illinois and Virginia.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Illinois is significantly west of Virginia

      - The eastern border of Illinois is still west of Virginia''s western border

      - All locations in Virginia, including Rich Creek, would be east of locations
      in Illinois, including Goreville


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Goreville is in Illinois, and Illinois is west of Virginia, Goreville
      must be west of Rich Creek, VA

      - This means Goreville is NOT east of Rich Creek


      NO'
    ff9aebf3-1218-466e-93b5-20b8bd5a1a14: 'To determine if Goreville, IL is located
      east of Rich Creek, VA, I need to find the approximate locations of both places
      and compare their longitudes.


      Step 1: Locate Goreville, Illinois. Goreville is in southern Illinois.


      Step 2: Locate Rich Creek, Virginia. Rich Creek is in western Virginia, near
      the West Virginia border.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions. Illinois is in the Midwest region
      of the United States, while Virginia is on the East Coast. Generally, locations
      in Virginia are east of locations in Illinois.


      Step 4: Consider their specific locations within their states. Even though Goreville
      is in eastern Illinois and Rich Creek is in western Virginia, the overall geographic
      relationship between Illinois and Virginia means that Rich Creek would still
      be east of Goreville.


      Step 5: In terms of longitude, locations further east have lower longitude numbers
      in the Western Hemisphere. Virginia''s longitude is lower (more easterly) than
      Illinois''s longitude.


      NO, Goreville, IL is not located east of Rich Creek, VA. Goreville is west of
      Rich Creek.'

      - Plattsburgh, NY is in northeastern New York, near the border with Vermont
      and Lake Champlain.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of these states.

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region, with most of the state being west of New
      York state.

      - New York is in the Northeast region, generally east of Michigan.


      Step 3: Think about their specific locations within their states.

      - Charlevoix is on the northeastern shore of Lake Michigan, but still within
      Michigan''s boundaries.

      - Plattsburgh is in the far northeastern part of New York, close to the Vermont
      border.


      Step 4: Compare their approximate longitudes.

      - Even though Charlevoix is in the eastern part of Michigan, Michigan as a whole
      is significantly west of New York.

      - Plattsburgh, being in the northeastern part of New York, is quite far east
      in the continental US.


      Based on this reasoning, Charlevoix, MI is located west of Plattsburgh, NY,
      not east of it.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these cities.

      - Spearman is in Texas (TX), which is in the south-central United States.

      - Highlandville is in Missouri (MO), which is in the central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Texas and Missouri.

      - Texas is generally southwest of Missouri.

      Step 3: More specifically, Spearman is located in the Texas Panhandle in the
      northern part of Texas, while Highlandville is in southwestern Missouri.


      Step 4: On a west-to-east axis:

      - Places in Texas are generally west of places in Missouri.

      - Spearman, being in the Texas Panhandle, is in the western part of the country.

      - Highlandville, being in Missouri, is more centrally/eastern located in the
      country.

      determine the relative positions of Pleasant Run, OH and Falling Waters, WV.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Pleasant Run, OH is located.

      Pleasant Run is in Hamilton County, Ohio, in the southwestern corner of Ohio
      near Cincinnati.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Falling Waters, WV is located.

      Falling Waters is in Berkeley County, West Virginia, in the eastern panhandle
      of West Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider the relative positions of Ohio and West Virginia.

      Ohio is generally west of West Virginia. West Virginia wraps around the eastern
      and southeastern border of Ohio.


      Step 4: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      Pleasant Run is in southwestern Ohio, while Falling Waters is in the eastern
      panhandle of West Virginia. The eastern panhandle of WV extends quite far east,
      almost to the Washington DC area.


      Step 5: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Since Pleasant Run is in the southwestern part of Ohio, and Falling Waters is
      in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia (which is east of most of Ohio), Falling
      Waters is clearly east of Pleasant Run.


      NO, Pleasant Run, OH is not located east of Falling Waters, WV. It is located

      states (including Rhode Island) being the easternmost.

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, which is considerably west of the Atlantic
      coast.


      Step 3: Compare their approximate longitudes.

      - Rhode Island is one of the easternmost states, located on the Atlantic coast.

      - Michigan is in the Midwest, significantly inland from the Atlantic coast.

      - Cities in Rhode Island will have a more eastern longitude (lower negative
      number) than cities in Michigan.

      Step 1: Recall the general geographic positions of Indiana and Pennsylvania
      within the United States.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Pennsylvania is located east of Indiana on a map of the United States.

      - States in the eastern United States generally have more eastern longitudes
      than states to their west.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific cities.

      - Knightsville, being in Indiana, would be west of Pennsylvania.

      - Juniata Terrace, being in Pennsylvania, would be east of Indiana.

      - Therefore, Knightsville, IN would be west of Juniata Terrace, PA (not east).

      Step 4: Cassville, MO is located in the southwestern part of Missouri, near
      the Arkansas border.


      Step 5: New Tazewell, TN is located in the northeastern part of Tennessee, near
      the Kentucky and Virginia borders.


      Step 6: Given these specific locations, Cassville, MO is clearly west of New
      Tazewell, TN. Missouri is west of Tennessee, and Cassville''s position in southwestern
      Missouri puts it even further west compared to New Tazewell''s northeastern

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Ohio and Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio on the US map.


      Step 3: Since these are specific towns, I should check if their particular locations
      might contradict the general state relationship.

      - South Russell is in northeast Ohio

      - Schlusser is in western Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Even with their specific locations within their states, the general
      geography of the US means that western Pennsylvania is still east of northeast
      Ohio, as the states border each other with Pennsylvania to the east.


      NO, South Russell, OH is not located east of Schlusser, PA. It is located west

      Pennsylvania while Circleville is in central Ohio, West Conshohocken must be
      east of Circleville.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Arizona
      is inland and east of California.


      Step 2: Consider the typical east-west relationship between cities in these

      Fairmead, CA is located in the Central Valley of California.

      Red Mesa, AZ is in northeastern Arizona near the Four Corners region.


      Step 5: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Since Fairmead is in California (a western state) and Red Mesa is in Arizona
      (which is east of California), Fairmead would be west of Red Mesa, not east
      of it.
