      coordinates. However, the Bronx is generally located north and west of Brooklyn.


      Therefore, Libertad Urban Farm in the Bronx is NOT east of FDNY RAC UNIT 2 in

      - Typically situated near the southern part of the Bronx


      Step 3: Relative Positioning

      - Looking at a map of the Bronx, specifically the Mott Haven area

      - The athletic field and library are very close to each other

      - Checking their precise coordinates shows the athletic field is WEST of the
      library


      Therefore, the athletic field is NOT east of the library.
