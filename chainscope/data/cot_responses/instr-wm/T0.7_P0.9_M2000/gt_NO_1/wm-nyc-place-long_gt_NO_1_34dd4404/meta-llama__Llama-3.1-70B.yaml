      \ the specific locations mentioned. \n   - **Stuyvesant Town**: Stuyvesant Town\
      \ is a large residential complex in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan,\
      \ New York City. The addresses 622 E 20, 624 E 20, 626 E 20, and 628 E 20 likely\

      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: Brooklyn, being a borough in New York
      City, has a grid-like street pattern in many areas, making it easier to determine

      in Brooklyn is located east of THE BROOKLYN SCHOOL FOR MATH AND RESEARCH in
      Brooklyn, we need to follow a few steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      the post office and the school. For this, we can use tools like Google Maps
      or other mapping services. Without specific addresses, we can use keywords or
      general descriptions to locate them.


      2. **Determine Coordinates**: Once we have located both the post office and
      the school on a map, we can determine their approximate coordinates (latitude
      and longitude).


      3. **Compare Coordinates**: We can compare the coordinates of the post office
      and the school to determine their relative positions. If the longitude of the
      post office is greater than the longitude of the school, then the post office
      is east of the school.


      4. **Consider the Map Scale**: Keep in mind that the map scale can affect the
      accuracy of our comparison. If the map is zoomed out too much, the difference
      in coordinates might not be significant enough to determine the relative positions
      accurately.


      5. **Analyze the Results**: Based on the comparison of coordinates, we can determine
      if the post office is located east of the school. If the post office''s longitude
      is greater than the school''s longitude, then the post office is indeed east
      of the school.


      However, it''s important to note that without specific addresses or more detailed
      information, the answer may not be entirely accurate. The exact location of
      these places within Brooklyn might vary, and our analysis is based on approximate
      coordinates and general map representations.

      Office in Brooklyn is located east of The Brooklyn School for Math and Research
      in Brooklyn, we need to follow a series of steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to pinpoint the locations of both
      the Brownsville Post Office and The Brooklyn School for Math and Research on
      a map. We can use tools like Google Maps or a city map to do this.


      2. **Understand Geography**: Brooklyn is a borough of New York City, and it''s
      important to understand its geography. Brooklyn is generally laid out in a grid
      pattern with streets running east-west and avenues running north-south.


      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: To determine if one location is east
      of another, we need to know which direction is east. In Brooklyn, the East River
      lies to the east of most of the borough, so anything closer to the East River
      would be considered "east."


      4. **Compare Locations**: Once we have identified the locations of both the
      Brownsville Post Office and The Brooklyn School for Math and Research, we can
      compare their positions on the map. If the Brownsville Post Office is closer
      to the East River than The Brooklyn School for Math and Research, it would be
      considered "east" of the school.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the map analysis and the understanding of Brooklyn''s
      geography, we can conclude whether the Brownsville Post Office is located east
      of The Brooklyn School for Math and Research.


      Given the information provided, it''s not possible to provide a definitive YES/NO
      answer without more specific location details. However, following the steps
      above will guide you in determining the answer based on the locations of these
      two places in Brooklyn.

    b42e6179-7932-4cbd-8255-61765b30555a: 'To determine if Red Hook Community Farm
      in Brooklyn is located east of St. Peter''s RC Church in Manhattan, we need
      to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to locate the exact positions of both
      the Red Hook Community Farm and St. Peter''s RC Church on a map.


      2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Once we have the locations, we need to
      understand their relative positions to each other in terms of cardinal directions
      (north, south, east, west).


      3. **Consider Manhattan and Brooklyn**: It''s essential to note that Red Hook
      Community Farm is in Brooklyn, while St. Peter''s RC Church is in Manhattan.
      These are two separate boroughs of New York City.


      4. **Geographical Orientation**: Generally, Manhattan is located north and west
      of Brooklyn. This is a crucial fact to keep in mind when comparing locations
      between these two boroughs.


      5. **Compare East-West Orientation**: To determine if one location is east of
      another, we must consider their east-west alignment. Being east means being
      to the right when facing north.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographical orientation of Manhattan
      and Brooklyn and the specific locations of Red Hook Community Farm and St. Peter''s
      RC Church, we can make an educated guess about their relative positions.


      Given that Red Hook Community Farm is in Brooklyn, which is generally east of
      Manhattan, and St. Peter''s RC Church is in Manhattan, it is **highly likely**
      that Red Hook Community Farm is located east of St. Peter''s RC Church. However,
      without exact addresses or coordinates, we can''t be absolutely certain.


      Therefore, based on the steps of reasoning and the available information, the
      answer is: **YES**'

      in Manhattan is located east of Seward Park Ext Houses Bldg 2 in Manhattan,
      we need to follow a series of steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand the locations of
      both the New Delancey Hotel and Seward Park Ext Houses Bldg 2 in Manhattan.
      For the purpose of this question, we''ll assume that these locations are in
      the Lower East Side of Manhattan.


      2. **Understand Manhattan''s Geography**: Manhattan is a borough of New York
      City that is known for its grid-like street layout. Generally, streets run east-west,
      and avenues run north-south. However, there are exceptions, especially in the
      older parts of Manhattan.


      3. **Determine Directions**: To answer the question, we need to understand the
      relative positions of the New Delancey Hotel and Seward Park Ext Houses Bldg
      2. In Manhattan, being "east" of something means being to the right (or more
      towards the East River) when facing north.


      4. **Specific Locations**: The New Delancey Hotel is located on Delancey Street,
      which runs east-west. Seward Park Ext Houses Bldg 2 is likely part of the Seward
      Park Extension housing project, which is also located on Delancey Street.


      5. **Comparison**: Since both locations are on the same street (Delancey Street),
      we can compare their positions along this street. Given that Delancey Street
      runs east-west, being east of something on this street means being further towards
      the East River.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout of Manhattan and the specific
      locations of the New Delancey Hotel and Seward Park Ext Houses Bldg 2, it''s
      likely that the New Delancey Hotel is located east of Seward Park Ext Houses
      Bldg 2.

      SCHOOL FOR COLLABORATIVE HEALTHCARE in Brooklyn is located east of CLASON POINT
      GARDENS BLDG 25 in the Bronx, we need to follow a series of steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations of
      both the school and the building. In this case, we know that the school is in
      Brooklyn, and the building is in the Bronx. However, we need more specific locations
      to determine their relative positions.


      2. **Geographic Context**: New York City consists of five boroughs: Manhattan,
      Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Brooklyn and the Bronx are two
      of these boroughs. Understanding the general layout of these boroughs is crucial.


      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: Generally, Brooklyn is located to the
      south and southwest of the Bronx. However, this can vary depending on the specific
      locations within each borough. To determine whether the school is east of the
      building, we need to consider their precise locations.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the exact locations, we can compare them
      on a map to determine whether the school is east of the building. If the school
      is located further east on the map than the building, then the answer is YES.
      If the building is located further east, or if they are approximately in the
      same east-west position, the answer is NO.

      in Brooklyn is located east of ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY IT PAVILION in Manhattan,
      we need to understand the relative positions of these two locations within New
      York City.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the specific locations
      of both KESHET LEARNING CENTER and ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY IT PAVILION. Without
      specific addresses, we can use general knowledge about these locations to estimate
      their positions.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: New York City is divided into five boroughs:
      Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. Manhattan and Brooklyn
      are adjacent to each other, with Brooklyn being to the east of Manhattan.


      3. **KESHET LEARNING CENTER**: Keshet Learning Center is likely located in Brooklyn,
      based on its name and the fact that it''s mentioned as being in Brooklyn. Brooklyn
      is east of Manhattan.


      4. **ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY IT PAVILION**: Rockefeller University is located
      on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, which is generally east of the center of
      Manhattan.


      5. **Relative Positions**: Given that Brooklyn is generally east of Manhattan,
      and the Rockefeller University IT Pavilion is on the Upper East Side, which
      is also east of the center of Manhattan, we can make a reasonable assumption
      about their relative positions.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographical layout of New York City
      and the relative positions of Brooklyn and the Upper East Side of Manhattan,
      it''s likely that KESHET LEARNING CENTER in Brooklyn is located east of ROCKEFELLER
      UNIVERSITY IT PAVILION in Manhattan.

      is located east of Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church in Brooklyn.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      places. Bronx River Houses is in the Bronx, and Ghana Wesley United Methodist
      Church is in Brooklyn. Both are different boroughs of New York City.


      2. **Understand Geography**: We need to understand the geography of New York

      to each other. The Bronx is located north of Manhattan and Queens, while Brooklyn
      is located south of Queens.


      3. **Consider Cardinal Directions**: To answer whether something is east or
      west of something else, we need to consider the cardinal directions. East is
      the direction towards the rising sun, and west is the direction towards the
      setting sun.


      4. **Determine Relative Positions**: Now, we need to determine the relative
      positions of Bronx River Houses and Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church. Since
      they are in different boroughs, we can''t directly compare their positions on

      Manhattan. The Bronx is generally east of Brooklyn, especially the western parts
      of the Bronx.


      **Step 3: Consider Geography**

      - Bronx River Houses Building 8 is likely located in the eastern part of the
      Bronx, closer to the border with Queens.

      - Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church is in Brooklyn, which is generally west
      of the Bronx.


      **Step 4: Compare Locations**

      - Given the general geography of New York City, it''s likely that Bronx River
      Houses Building 8 is east of Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church.


      **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions of these two locations,

      Arts Ctr in Manhattan is located east of JHS 227 Edward B Shallow in Brooklyn,
      let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to understand where these two
      locations are. FIT Business & Liberal Arts Ctr is located in Manhattan, and
      JHS 227 Edward B Shallow is located in Brooklyn. Both are in New York City.


      2. **Understand the geography of NYC**: New York City is composed of five boroughs:
      Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. Manhattan and Brooklyn
      are two of these boroughs.


      3. **Determine the relative positions of Manhattan and Brooklyn**: Manhattan
      is generally considered the central borough of New York City. Brooklyn is located
      to the east of Manhattan. This means that, in general, locations in Manhattan
      are west of locations in Brooklyn.


      4. **Consider the specific locations**: Without knowing the exact addresses
      or locations of these two institutions, we can''t make a precise determination.
      However, based on the general geography of New York City, it''s likely that
      FIT Business & Liberal Arts Ctr in Manhattan is located west of JHS 227 Edward
      B Shallow in Brooklyn.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general geographic relationship between Manhattan
      and Brooklyn, and the lack of specific information about the exact locations
      of these two institutions, it''s likely that FIT Business & Liberal Arts Ctr
      in Manhattan is NOT located east of JHS 227 Edward B Shallow in Brooklyn.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      \   - **ST MARGARETS EPISCOPAL CHURCH**: This is a church also located in the\

    a4423dd3-8fe2-40fd-b8cb-25d9419350f7: 'To answer this question, we need to identify
      the locations of Jamaica Bay National Wildlife Refuge and CCB School Flushing
      in Queens, New York. Without specific addresses or coordinates, I''ll use a
      general understanding of the geography of Queens to make an educated guess.


      1. **Jamaica Bay National Wildlife Refuge**: This is a wildlife refuge located
      in the southern part of Queens, near the border with Brooklyn. It''s situated
      on the western edge of Jamaica Bay, which is a large bay on the southern coast
      of Queens.


      2. **CCB School Flushing**: I''m not familiar with this specific school, but
      based on its name, it''s likely located in Flushing, which is a neighborhood
      in northern Queens. Flushing is a fairly large area, so the exact location of
      the school within Flushing can vary.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Based on the general descriptions above, Jamaica
      Bay National Wildlife Refuge is located in the southern part of Queens, while
      Flushing is in the northern part. This means that Jamaica Bay is generally to
      the south or southwest of Flushing.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: When considering east-west orientation, we need
      to understand that Queens is a relatively long borough running from the west
      to the east. If we imagine a line running from the western edge of Queens (where
      Jamaica Bay is) to the eastern edge, Flushing would be more towards the western
      side of this line.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Jamaica Bay National Wildlife Refuge is in the
      southern part of Queens, and Flushing is more towards the northern part, and
      considering the east-west orientation of Queens, it''s reasonable to assume
      that Jamaica Bay National Wildlife Refuge is **not east** of CCB School Flushing.
      Instead, it''s likely to be west or southwest of it.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      OLMSTED-BEIL COMPLEX and OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE PARK are both in Staten Island,
      which is one of the five boroughs of New York City.

      side facing the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern side facing the rest of New York
      City.

    7db55f64-beb1-43a7-b075-d034c72161c8: 'To determine if the OLMSTED-BEIL COMPLEX
      in Staten Island is located east of the OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE PARK in Staten Island,
      we need to understand the geography of Staten Island and the specific locations
      of these two places.


      1. **Geographical Context**: Staten Island is one of the five boroughs of New
      York City, and it''s located southwest of Manhattan and Brooklyn. The island
      is oriented roughly north-south, with the east-west axis being shorter than
      the north-south axis.


      2. **Location of OLMSTED-BEIL COMPLEX**: Without specific addresses or coordinates,
      we can assume that the OLMSTED-BEIL COMPLEX is named after the OLMSTED-BEIL
      HOUSE, which is a historic house located in the Clifton area of Staten Island.
      This would place the complex on the north-central part of Staten Island.


      3. **Location of OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE PARK**: Based on the name, we can assume
      that the OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE PARK is likely located near the historic OLMSTED-BEIL
      HOUSE. This would also place the park in the north-central part of Staten Island.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Given the information we have, both the OLMSTED-BEIL
      COMPLEX and the OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE PARK are likely located in the same general
      area, possibly even adjacent to each other or within the same complex.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the limited information provided and the geographic
      context, it''s highly likely that the OLMSTED-BEIL COMPLEX and the OLMSTED-BEIL
      HOUSE PARK are in the same general area and not significantly east-west of each
      other.


      Therefore, the answer to whether the OLMSTED-BEIL COMPLEX is located east of
      the OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE PARK is: **NO**'

      \n4. **Comparison**: \n   - Given that the Olmsted-Beil House is on the eastern\
      \ side of Staten Island, it's unlikely that the complex or park is located further\

      \   - Richmond Parkway Malls is located in the southwestern part of Staten Island,\

      \ is located in the northeastern part of Staten Island, closer to the Verrazzano-Narrows\
      \ Bridge and the New York Bay.\n\n4. **Comparison**: \n   - **East-West Orientation**:\
      \ Being \"east\" of something means being to the right (or more towards the\
      \ Atlantic Ocean) when facing north. Given that Richmond Parkway Malls is in\
      \ the southwestern part of Staten Island and Ida Court Playground is in the\

    7d4335ec-f8fc-4c6f-a771-0bedc7f9b18c: 'To determine if the FACING HISTORY SCHOOL
      in Manhattan is located east of THE ANDREWS HOMELESS SHELTER in Manhattan, I''ll
      follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the specific addresses
      or locations of both institutions. Without exact addresses, we can use general
      information about their locations.


      2. **FACING HISTORY SCHOOL**: The Facing History School is a public school located
      in Manhattan. Without a specific address, we can assume it''s within the general
      area of Manhattan.


      3. **THE ANDREWS HOMELESS SHELTER**: The Andrews Homeless Shelter is a shelter
      for the homeless in Manhattan. Again, without a specific address, we can assume
      it''s within Manhattan.


      4. **Geographical Orientation**: Manhattan is generally laid out in a grid pattern,
      with avenues running north-south and streets running east-west. This makes it
      easier to determine relative positions.


      5. **Determine East-West Orientation**: To determine if one location is east
      of another, we need to understand their relative positions. Without specific
      addresses, we can make an educated guess based on general knowledge of Manhattan''s
      layout.


      6. **Consider the General Manhattan Layout**: Manhattan is a long, narrow island
      with the East River to the east and the Hudson River to the west. The southern
      part of Manhattan is more densely populated, while the northern part is less
      so.


      7. **Comparison**: Without exact addresses, we can assume that both institutions
      are within the general area of Manhattan. However, it''s difficult to determine
      their exact east-west orientation without more specific information.


      **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific addresses and the general layout
      of Manhattan, it''s challenging to determine if the FACING HISTORY SCHOOL is
      located east of THE ANDREWS HOMELESS SHELTER. Therefore, the answer is: **It''s
      difficult to determine without more specific information.**

      1. **Identify Locations**: We need to establish the exact locations of both
      places. Without specific addresses or coordinates, we can use general descriptions
      and approximate locations.


      2. **Determine Cardinal Directions**: To answer the question, we need to understand
      which direction is east in the context of the Bronx. The Bronx is one of the
      five boroughs of New York City, and it''s located north of Manhattan. In this
      context, east generally refers to the direction towards Long Island Sound or
      the East River.


      3. **Compare Relative Positions**: We need to compare the relative positions
      of ST MARY''S PARK HOUSES BLDG 2 and ST MARYS CONCORD AVE OV CSX RAIL. Without
      specific coordinates, we can make a general assessment based on the known layout
      of the Bronx.


      4. **Consider Known Landmarks**: We can use known landmarks and geographical
      features to determine the relative positions of these two locations. For example,
      if one location is near the East River and the other is further inland, we can
      make a reasonable guess about their east-west positions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout of the Bronx and the lack of
      specific coordinates, we can make an educated guess. However, without more precise

      locations, it''s challenging to provide an accurate answer. However, we can
      make an educated guess based on general knowledge of the Bronx.

      question mentions Brooklyn and Manhattan, we''d ideally have specific addresses
      to make a more precise determination.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: New York City is laid out in a grid pattern,
      with avenues running north-south and streets running east-west. This orientation
      is important for determining east-west directions.


      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: Given the general locations of Brooklyn
      and Manhattan, we know that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan. However, we need
      to be more specific about the locations of the Senior Club and the Conservatory
      within their respective boroughs.


      4. **Compare Locations**: If we had specific addresses, we could pinpoint their
      exact locations on a map and compare their east-west positions. Without specific
      addresses, we can only make a general assumption based on the boroughs.

    3506dfd5-2335-4e60-ac27-46c0dde8fedd: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: The first step is to identify the locations of the
      Belasco Theatre in Manhattan and Wyckoff Gardens Houses in Brooklyn. The Belasco
      Theatre is located on 44th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues in the Theater
      District of Manhattan. Wyckoff Gardens Houses is a public housing complex located
      in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, near the intersection of Wyckoff Street and Nevins
      Street.


      2. **Understand Geography**: To determine if one location is east of another,
      we need to understand the geography of New York City. Manhattan is a long, narrow
      island that runs roughly north-south, with the East River on the east side and
      the Hudson River on the west side. Brooklyn is located south and east of Manhattan,
      across the East River.


      3. **Determine Directions**: To determine if the Belasco Theatre is east of
      Wyckoff Gardens Houses, we need to compare their relative positions. If the
      Belasco Theatre is on the east side of Manhattan, it would be east of Wyckoff
      Gardens Houses in Brooklyn, which is across the East River.


      4. **Comparison**: The Belasco Theatre is located on the east side of Manhattan,
      while Wyckoff Gardens Houses is in Brooklyn, which is east of Manhattan.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the above steps, the Belasco Theatre in Manhattan
      is indeed located east of Wyckoff Gardens Houses in Brooklyn.

      Jersey is located east of Conference House in Staten Island, we need to understand
      the geography and locations involved:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the specific locations
      mentioned. Woodbridge Creek is a waterway in New Jersey, and Conference House
      is a historic site in Staten Island, New York.


      2. **Geographical Context**: Staten Island and New Jersey are two distinct geographical
      entities. Staten Island is one of the five boroughs of New York City, while
      New Jersey is a state in the United States, bordering New York to the west.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To answer whether Woodbridge Creek is east of Conference
      House, we need to understand their relative positions. In a general sense, east
      and west are cardinal directions. East is the direction towards the rising sun,
      while west is the direction towards the setting sun.


      4. **Geographical Comparison**: Staten Island is located to the southwest of
      New Jersey. This means that most of New Jersey is located to the west of Staten
      Island. Woodbridge Creek, being in New Jersey, would be located to the west
      of Conference House, which is in Staten Island.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical context and the relative positions
      of these locations, Woodbridge Creek in New Jersey is **not** located east of
      Conference House in Staten Island. Instead, it''s located to the west.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**'

      compared to Brooklyn. We need to determine which location is further east.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Without specific addresses, we can only make a general

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: We need to know the exact or approximate locations
      of "BUSHMAN STEPS" and "UPACA SENIOR CENTER" in Manhattan, New York City.


      2. **Map Analysis**: We can use a map, like Google Maps, to pinpoint the locations
      of both places. However, without specific addresses, it might be challenging
      to find exact locations.


      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: In Manhattan, streets generally run
      east-west, and avenues run north-south. To determine if one location is east
      of another, we need to find which one is further east.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations on the map, we can compare
      their relative positions, focusing on the east-west orientation.


      **Example**: If, for instance, "BUSHMAN STEPS" is located in the vicinity of
      Central Park (which is more towards the west in Manhattan), and "UPACA SENIOR
      CENTER" is located in the Financial District (which is more towards the east),

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to understand the locations of both
      the FERMI PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION and the RIVER AVE OVR METRO N HUDSN LINE.
      The FERMI PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is likely a specific location within Brooklyn,
      while the RIVER AVE OVR METRO N HUDSN LINE is probably a subway or rail line
      that crosses the Hudson River between the Bronx and Manhattan.


      2. **Geographical Orientation**: New York City is organized with Manhattan at
      its core, surrounded by the other boroughs. The Bronx is located to the north
      of Manhattan, and Brooklyn is located to the south and east of Manhattan.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Given that the Bronx is north of Manhattan and Brooklyn
      is south and east of Manhattan, we can infer that the Bronx is generally west
      of Brooklyn.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of New York City and the relative
      positions of the Bronx and Brooklyn, it''s unlikely that FERMI PLAYGROUND COMFORT
      STATION in Brooklyn is located east of RIVER AVE OVR METRO N HUDSN LINE in the

    7ea2818c-47e4-4431-9e3b-47999b361015: 'To determine if Holy Cross Church in Manhattan
      is located east of Bais Esther School 50 ST in Brooklyn, we need to follow these
      steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the specific locations
      of both the church and the school. Holy Cross Church is located in Manhattan,
      while Bais Esther School 50 ST is in Brooklyn, two distinct boroughs of New
      York City.


      2. **Understand Manhattan and Brooklyn''s Locations**: Manhattan is one of the
      boroughs of New York City, located on an island. Brooklyn is another borough,
      located to the southeast of Manhattan, across the East River.


      3. **Consider Cardinal Directions**: East and west are cardinal directions.
      To be east of something, an object or location must be to the right (east) when
      facing north. In this case, we need to determine if Holy Cross Church is to
      the right of Bais Esther School 50 ST when facing north.


      4. **Determine the Relative Positions**: Given that Brooklyn is generally southeast
      of Manhattan, any location in Manhattan would be to the northwest of a location
      in Brooklyn. Therefore, Holy Cross Church in Manhattan is not east of Bais Esther
      School 50 ST in Brooklyn; instead, it''s likely to the northwest.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations of Manhattan and Brooklyn,
      and the fact that Brooklyn is to the southeast of Manhattan, we can conclude
      that Holy Cross Church in Manhattan is not located east of Bais Esther School
      50 ST in Brooklyn.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**'

      a location in Brooklyn. Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'
    56037312-5380-43a1-bb9b-17bd8e997ab1: 'To answer this question, we need to understand
      the locations of both places:


      1. **11 AVE VIADUCT OV LIRR W SD YD, Manhattan**: This is a viaduct or elevated

      New York City. The "11 AVE" likely refers to the street or avenue where this
      structure is located.


      2. **CHRIST UNITED METHODIST CHURCH, Brooklyn**: This is a church located in
      Brooklyn, New York City.


      To determine if the 11 AVE VIADUCT is located east of the church, we need to

      1. **Manhattan and Brooklyn**: Manhattan and Brooklyn are two separate boroughs
      in New York City. They are not contiguous; there is a body of water (the East
      River) separating them.


      2. **Cardinal Directions**: In New York City, the Hudson River is generally
      to the west, and the East River is generally to the east. This is a generalization,
      but it''s a helpful starting point.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if one location is east of another,

      determine that Brooklyn is generally south and east of the Bronx. However, this
      is a general statement, and specific locations within these boroughs can vary
      significantly.


      4. **Specific Locations**: Without more specific information about the exact
      locations of PINK HOUSES BUILDING 3 and BLESSED SACRAMENT CHURCH, we can''t
      definitively say if one is east of the other. We would need more detailed information,
      such as street addresses or coordinates, to make a precise determination.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general geographical relationship between Brooklyn
      and the Bronx, and without more specific information about the exact locations
      of PINK HOUSES BUILDING 3 and BLESSED SACRAMENT CHURCH, we can make an educated
      guess based on the general geography of NYC.

      \ to establish the exact locations of Bethel Church of Christ and Rangel Houses\
      \ Building 4 in Manhattan. Without specific addresses, we would typically use\
      \ a map or search engine to find their locations.\n\n2. **Geographical Orientation**:\
      \ Manhattan is a long, narrow island, and it's important to understand its general\
      \ layout. The island is divided into East Side and West Side by Fifth Avenue,\
      \ with the East River to the east and the Hudson River to the west.\n\n3. **Specific\
      \ Locations**:\n   - **Bethel Church of Christ**: If we assume that Bethel Church\

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      places. We have "WHITESTONE VOLUNTEER AMBULANCE" and "YOUNG ISRAEL OF BRIARWOOD,"
      both in Queens.


      2. **Determine East-West Orientation**: To determine if one location is east
      of another, we need to understand the general layout of Queens and how it relates
      to cardinal directions (east, west, north, south).


      3. **Geographical Layout of Queens**: Queens is a large borough in New York
      City. It has a diverse geography, with different areas having different east-west
      orientations. Some areas might be more east-west aligned, while others might
      have a more north-south orientation.


      4. **Specific Locations**: We don''t have specific addresses for these locations,
      so we can''t pinpoint their exact positions. However, we can make an educated
      guess based on their names.


      5. **Whitestone Volunteer Ambulance**: "Whitestone" is a neighborhood in Queens,
      located in the northern part of the borough, close to the Bronx. It''s generally
      considered to be on the western side of Queens.


      6. **Young Israel of Briarwood**: "Briarwood" is also a neighborhood in Queens,
      located in the central part of the borough. It''s generally considered to be
      more central or eastern in its location within Queens.


      7. **Conclusion**: Based on the general locations of Whitestone and Briarwood
      within Queens, it''s likely that **Whitestone Volunteer Ambulance is located
      west of Young Israel of Briarwood**. However, without exact addresses, this

      Court in Manhattan is located east of Berkeley Carroll School Lower School in
      Brooklyn, we need to follow a series of steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the specific locations
      of both the Bellevue South Park Basketball Court and the Berkeley Carroll School
      Lower School. This would typically involve looking up their addresses or coordinates.


      2. **Understand Geography**: Manhattan and Brooklyn are two separate boroughs
      in New York City. We need to understand their general layout and geography.


      3. **Determine Cardinal Directions**: To determine if one location is east of
      another, we need to understand the cardinal directions (north, south, east,
      west) in relation to these boroughs.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the locations and understand the cardinal
      directions, we can compare the positions of Bellevue South Park Basketball Court
      and Berkeley Carroll School Lower School.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, we can determine whether Bellevue
      South Park Basketball Court is located east of Berkeley Carroll School Lower
      School.


      Given that we don''t have specific addresses or coordinates, it''s challenging
      to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the general layout of Manhattan
      and Brooklyn, we can make some assumptions:


      - Manhattan is generally located to the west of Brooklyn.

      - The Bellevue South Park Basketball Court is likely located somewhere in the
      southern part of Manhattan, given that Bellevue Hospital is located in the Kips
      Bay neighborhood of Manhattan.

      - The Berkeley Carroll School Lower School is likely located in the Park Slope
      or surrounding neighborhoods in Brooklyn, given the school''s location.


      Considering these assumptions and the general geography of New York City, it''s
      likely that Bellevue South Park Basketball Court in Manhattan is **not** located
      east of Berkeley Carroll School Lower School in Brooklyn. However, without specific
      addresses or coordinates, this answer is based on general assumptions and is
      not definitive.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      of these locations in terms of cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).


      4. **The Bronx and Manhattan**: The Bronx is located to the north of Manhattan.
      Manhattan is the central borough and is surrounded by water on three sides,
      with the Hudson River to the west and the East River to the east.


      5. **Specific Locations**: YANKEE STADIUM is located in the southern part of
      The Bronx, near the Harlem River. HIGH SCHOOL FOR HEALTH CAREERS AND SCIENCES
      is located in Manhattan.


      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of New York City and the specific
      locations of YANKEE STADIUM in The Bronx and HIGH SCHOOL FOR HEALTH CAREERS
      AND SCIENCES in Manhattan, YANKEE STADIUM is not located east of the high school.
      Instead, YANKEE STADIUM is located to the north of Manhattan, while the high
      school is located within Manhattan.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      \ we need to understand the locations and their relative positions. Here's a\
      \ step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify Locations**: \n   - **Straus Houses\
      \ Community Center**: This is a community center located in the Straus Houses,\
      \ a public housing development in Manhattan. The Straus Houses are situated\
      \ in the East Village neighborhood, which is on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.\n\
      \   - **FDNY Rescue Collapse 1**: This is a fire station or a unit of the New\

      However, this grid can be irregular in some areas.


      3. **Assume a Standard Grid**: For the sake of this exercise, let''s assume
      that Smith Houses Building 6 and Smith Houses Building 7 are located in an area
      of Manhattan that follows a standard grid pattern.


      4. **Relative Positions**: In a standard grid, buildings with higher numbers
      are generally located further east. So, if Smith Houses Building 7 is indeed
      east of Smith Houses Building 6, then Building 7 would have a higher number.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the assumption that the buildings are in a standard
      grid, and that buildings with higher numbers are generally located further east,
      we can conclude that Smith Houses Building 7 is located east of Smith Houses
      Building 6.

      Center in Brooklyn is located east of PS 75 Mayda Cortiella in Brooklyn, we
      need to consider the geography of Brooklyn and the specific locations of these
      two institutions.


      1. **Identify the Locations**: The New York City Children''s Center is a mental
      health facility, and PS 75 Mayda Cortiella is an elementary school, both located
      in Brooklyn, New York.


      2. **Understand Brooklyn''s Geography**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City, located on the western end of Long Island. It''s a large borough
      with various neighborhoods and districts.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Without specific addresses, we can assume that the
      New York City Children''s Center and PS 75 Mayda Cortiella are located within
      the borough of Brooklyn.


      4. **Brooklyn''s Orientation**: Brooklyn is generally oriented with the western
      end closer to the East River and the eastern end closer to Jamaica Bay. The
      borough is divided into various neighborhoods, each with its own specific location.


      5. **Comparison**: Given the general orientation of Brooklyn and the lack of

      is located east of LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE in Manhattan, let''s break down the
      steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: We need to know the exact locations of both PIER
      107 CVII and LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE in Manhattan. Without specific addresses
      or coordinates, we can''t accurately determine their relative positions.


      2. **Understand Manhattan''s Layout**: Manhattan is generally laid out in a
      grid pattern, with avenues running north-south and streets running east-west.
      This knowledge will help us understand the relative positions of the locations.


      3. **Determine Directions**: To answer whether PIER 107 CVII is east of LINCOLNTON
      POST OFFICE, we need to understand the concept of "east" in the context of Manhattan''s
      grid layout. "East" means being more towards the East River, which runs along
      the eastern side of Manhattan.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Once we have the exact locations, we can compare them.
      If PIER 107 CVII is more towards the East River compared to LINCOLNTON POST
      OFFICE, then it''s located east. If it''s more towards the Hudson River (the
      western side of Manhattan) or roughly in the middle, it''s not located east.


      Without specific addresses or coordinates, I can''t accurately determine the
      answer. However, based on the limited information provided, I can provide a
      general approach:


      **To provide an accurate YES/NO answer, I would need the exact addresses or
      more specific locations of both PIER 107 CVII and LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE in

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to locate both places on a map of
      Queens, New York City. The Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport is likely near the
      John F. Kennedy International Airport, while Police Officer Edward Byrne Park
      is a public park in Queens.


      2. **Understand Directional Terms**: To answer whether one location is east
      of another, we need to understand the directional term "east." East generally
      refers to a direction on the compass that is to the right when facing north.
      So, we''ll need to look at the map to see if the Comfort Inn Hotel is to the
      right of Police Officer Edward Byrne Park when facing north.


      3. **Map Analysis**: Using a map of Queens, we can find the locations of both
      the Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport and Police Officer Edward Byrne Park. We can
      then compare their relative positions.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the map, if the Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport is
      to the right (or east) of Police Officer Edward Byrne Park when facing north,
      the answer is YES. If it''s not, the answer is NO.


      However, without access to a map or more specific information about the exact
      locations of these places, it''s difficult to provide a definitive answer. Therefore,
      I would need more information or a map to accurately determine the relative
      positions of these locations.

      I''ll follow these steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to establish the locations of both
      places. The PROSPECT PARK FLOWER GARDEN PAVILION is located within Prospect
      Park, which is a large public park in the heart of Brooklyn. LURIA ACADEMY OF
      BROOKLYN is a school that may have multiple locations or branches in Brooklyn.


      2. **Specific Addresses**: Without specific addresses, we can''t pinpoint their
      exact locations. However, we can use general information to make an educated
      guess.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Brooklyn is generally laid out in a grid pattern,
      with streets running east-west and avenues running north-south. Prospect Park
      is located in the central part of Brooklyn.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that Prospect Park is in the central part of Brooklyn,
      it''s likely that the PROSPECT PARK FLOWER GARDEN PAVILION is not located east
      of LURIA ACADEMY OF BROOKLYN, as the academy is likely to be located in a more
      eastern part of Brooklyn.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general layout of Brooklyn and the location
      of Prospect Park, it''s reasonable to conclude that PROSPECT PARK FLOWER GARDEN

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to pinpoint the locations of both
      places. Horace Mann School Spence Cottage is in the Riverdale section of the
      Bronx, while Crotona Park - Clinton Playground is located within Crotona Park,
      which is in the southern part of the Bronx.


      2. **Understand Geography**: The Bronx is a borough of New York City, and it''s
      generally rectangular in shape. The Hudson River borders the Bronx on the west,
      and the East River borders it on the east. Crotona Park is located in the southern
      part of the Bronx, while Riverdale is in the northwest corner of the borough.

      1. **Geography of Staten Island**: Staten Island is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City. It''s the southernmost borough and is separated from the rest
      of New York City by the Narrows, a strait connecting the Upper New York Bay
      with the Lower New York Bay. The island is generally oriented with the Atlantic
      Ocean to the south and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge connecting it to Brooklyn
      to the north.


      2. **Fort Wadsworth**: Fort Wadsworth is a former military installation located
      on the northeastern shore of Staten Island. It''s a historic site with several
      buildings and structures, including the Fort Wadsworth Garage and the Fort Wadsworth
      Guard Shack.


      3. **Relative Positions**: To determine if the garage is east of the guard shack,
      we need to understand their positions relative to each other. Without specific

      or near the entrance of the fort, and the garage is likely located within the
      fort''s premises, it''s reasonable to assume that the garage is further inside
      the fort, which is generally to the east of the entrance.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of Staten Island and the likely
      relative positions of the Fort Wadsworth Garage and Guard Shack within the fort''s
      premises, it''s likely that the garage is located east of the guard shack.

      2. **Understand Manhattan''s Geography**: Manhattan is laid out in a grid pattern,
      with avenues running north-south and streets running east-west. This makes it
      easier to determine relative positions.


      3. **Determine Directions**: To answer the question, we need to determine if
      the W 72 ST MARINA is east of NYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS GOUVERNEUR. Being "east"
      means being to the right (or more towards the East River) when facing north.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Without specific addresses, we can make an educated
      guess based on the names of the locations. "W 72 ST" suggests a location on
      the west side of Manhattan, while "GOUVERNEUR" suggests a location on the Lower
      East Side, which is on the east side of Manhattan.

      \ a marina or a dock area on West 72nd Street in Manhattan. NYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS\
      \ GOUVERNEUR is a health facility in Manhattan.\n\n2. **Geographical Orientation**:\

      Pkwy WB Nr Lga, Queens" is located east of "Rainbow School for Child Development,
      Bronx," we need to follow a step-by-step process:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact or approximate
      addresses of both locations. The "Gas Station Grand Central Pkwy WB Nr Lga,
      Queens" suggests a gas station near LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in Queens, while
      "Rainbow School for Child Development, Bronx" is likely a school in the Bronx.


      2. **Map Analysis**: Once we have the addresses, we can use a map (physical
      or digital, like Google Maps) to pinpoint their locations. We need to determine
      the relative positions of these locations, focusing on their east-west orientation.


      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: Queens and the Bronx are two separate
      boroughs in New York City. Generally, Queens is located east of the Bronx. However,
      within each borough, specific locations can vary in their east-west orientation.


      4. **Compare Locations**: After pinpointing both locations on the map, we compare
      their positions relative to each other, focusing on their east-west orientation.


      Given that we don''t have specific addresses for these locations, we can make
      some assumptions based on the general geography of New York City:


      - If the gas station is located near LaGuardia Airport in Queens, it''s likely
      to be in the eastern part of Queens, which is indeed east of the Bronx.

      - The Rainbow School for Child Development is in the Bronx, which is generally
      west of Queens.


      Therefore, based on the general geography of New York City and the relative
      positions of these locations, the answer to whether "Gas Station Grand Central
      Pkwy WB Nr Lga, Queens" is located east of "Rainbow School for Child Development,
      Bronx" is: **YES**'

      ROOMS HEAD START in Brooklyn, we need to understand the relative positions of
      these two locations within Brooklyn.


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations of
      both BREUKELEN RECREATION ROOMS DCC and BREUKELEN RECREATION ROOMS HEAD START.
      Without specific addresses, we can assume they are in different parts of Brooklyn.


      2. **Understand Brooklyn''s Geography**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City. It''s a large area with various neighborhoods and communities.


      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: To determine if one location is east
      of another, we need to understand the east-west orientation of Brooklyn. In
      general, the eastern parts of Brooklyn are closer to the water (East River,
      Jamaica Bay) and the western parts are more inland.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Once we have a general understanding of Brooklyn''s
      geography, we can compare the locations of BREUKELEN RECREATION ROOMS DCC and
      BREUKELEN RECREATION ROOMS HEAD START. Without specific addresses, we can''t
      pinpoint their exact locations, but we can make an educated guess based on the

      DCC in Brooklyn is located east of BREUKELEN RECREATION ROOMS HEAD START in

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the exact locations of
      both places. Without specific addresses or coordinates, we can only make assumptions
      based on the information provided.


      2. **Assume Locations**: Since we don''t have specific addresses, let''s assume
      that both BREUKELEN RECREATION ROOMS DCC and BREUKELEN RECREATION ROOMS HEAD
      START are located in the same general area of Brooklyn, given that they share
      the name "BREUKELEN RECREATION ROOMS."


      3. **Determine East-West Orientation**: Brooklyn, like many parts of New York
      City, has a grid-like street pattern in many areas. We need to understand which
      direction is east and which is west.


      4. **Assess Relative Positions**: Based on the assumption that both locations
      are in the same general area, we can infer that they are relatively close to
      each other. If they were significantly far apart, it would be less likely for
      them to share the same name.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the assumptions made,
      we can conclude that it''s unlikely that BREUKELEN RECREATION ROOMS DCC is located
      east of BREUKELEN RECREATION ROOMS HEAD START. The fact that they share the
      same name suggests that they are in the same area, making it more likely that
      they are either in the same location or very close to each other.

      answer is: **NO**'
    ee48d65f-146a-4196-85d0-63fc1d0ec889: 'To answer this question, let''s break it

      2. **Understand Geography**: Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York

      some general assumptions based on their names and the general layout of Brooklyn.


      4. **Relative Positions**: Assuming these locations are in the same general
      area, we can use the general east-west orientation of Brooklyn to determine
      their relative positions. If one is located more towards the eastern part of
      Brooklyn, it would be considered "east" of the other.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific addresses or coordinates, we cannot
      definitively answer whether one location is east of the other. However, based
      on the general geography of Brooklyn, if both locations are within the same

      SCHOOL" is in Manhattan.


      2. **Understand Geography**: Brooklyn and Manhattan are two separate boroughs
      in New York City. Manhattan is located to the west of Brooklyn.


      3. **Determine Directions**: To determine if one place is east of another, we
      need to understand the cardinal directions. East means towards the rising sun
      or to the right when facing north.


      4. **Compare Locations**: Now, let''s compare the locations. Greenpoint, where
      the church is located, is in the northern part of Brooklyn, while Manhattan
      is to the west of Brooklyn.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Manhattan is to the west of Brooklyn and Greenpoint
      is in the northern part of Brooklyn, it''s unlikely that the church in Greenpoint
      would be east of the school in Manhattan.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**'
