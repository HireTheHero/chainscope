      4. **Compare their positions**  \n   - Ansche Chesed Synagogue is on the Upper\
      \ West Side at 100th Street.  \n   - If \"TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66\" is around\
      \ **66th Street**, it is **south** of the synagogue.  \n   - The key question\

      \ **inside Central Park or even on the East Side**.  \n   - **Central Park is\

      \ Central Park, it is indeed **east of Ansche Chesed Synagogue**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\
      Since a location near the **66th Street Transverse** would be east of **100th\

      - The Sedgwick Houses are located near University Heights and Morris Heights,
      which are on the **western** side of the Bronx.

      - Willis Avenue is in Mott Haven, which is on the **eastern** side of the Bronx.


      ### Step 3: Determine Directionality

      - Since **Sedgwick Houses are in the western Bronx** and **PS 49 Willis Avenue
      is in the eastern Bronx**, it follows that **SEDGWICK HOUSES BUILDING 5 is west

      \ If \"PIER 107 CVII\" follows the usual numbering system, it would likely be\
      \ located on the East River, as higher-numbered piers (above Pier 100) are typically\
      \ on the east side.  \n   - If the \"LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE\" is in Manhattan,\
      \ it would likely be inland rather than directly on the water.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ east-west positioning:**  \n   - If \"PIER 107 CVII\" is on the East River,\
      \ it is towards the eastern edge of Manhattan.  \n   - If \"LINCOLNTON POST\
      \ OFFICE\" is inland, it is likely west of the pier.\n\nSince we infer that\
      \ \"PIER 107 CVII\" is on the eastern edge and \"LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE\" is\
      \ likely further inland, the pier is **east** of the post office.\n\n**Final\
