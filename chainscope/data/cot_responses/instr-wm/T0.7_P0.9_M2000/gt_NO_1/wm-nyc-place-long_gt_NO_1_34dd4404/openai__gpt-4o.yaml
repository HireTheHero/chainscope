      for Social Action in Manhattan is located east of Brooklyn Charter School in
      Brooklyn, we need to consider the geographic locations of these two schools.


      1. **Locate PS 527 East Side School for Social Action**: This school is located
      in Manhattan, which is an island situated to the north of Brooklyn. Specifically,
      it''s located on the east side of Manhattan.


      2. **Locate Brooklyn Charter School**: This school is located in Brooklyn, which
      is to the south of Manhattan.


      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: In general, the entire borough of
      Manhattan is west of most parts of Brooklyn, as Manhattan is more aligned with
      the Hudson River to the west, while Brooklyn is closer to the Atlantic Ocean
      to the east.


      Based on the general geography of these boroughs:


      - Manhattan, where PS 527 is located, is generally west of Brooklyn, where Brooklyn

      to follow these steps:


      1. Identify the addresses or locations of both places.

      2. Determine the relative positions of these locations in terms of east and
      west.


      **Step 1: Identify Locations**


      - **Linden Houses Building 2:** The Linden Houses are a public housing development
      located in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. Building 2 would be part
      of this development.


      - **Passages Academy Belmont:** This is an educational facility located in the
      Belmont section of the Bronx, not Brooklyn. However, assuming you meant a location
      in Brooklyn, it''s necessary to clarify that Passages Academy Belmont doesn''t
      exist in Brooklyn and might be confused with another location.


      **Step 2: Determine Relative Positions**


      Assuming we are indeed looking within Brooklyn and not the Bronx, there might
      be a misunderstanding about the locations. However, if we''re strictly considering
      locations in Brooklyn, East New York (where Linden Houses are) is generally
      east of central Brooklyn areas.


      Given this analysis, it seems there''s a fundamental error in the premise of
      the question. If Passages Academy Belmont refers to a Bronx location, then it
      isn''t relevant to compare it to Linden Houses in Brooklyn. But if we''re considering
      some other Brooklyn-based location mistakenly referred to as Passages Academy
      Belmont, without a defined reference point, it''s not possible to accurately
      determine east or west relations.


      Based on the information as it stands and assuming Passages Academy Belmont
      is a misplacement in the given context, the answer is inconclusive due to potential
      errors in location names.


      However, if we strictly interpret a location within Brooklyn for both entities
      based on general assumptions of naming:


      - **YES**, Linden Houses in East New York is likely east of most central Brooklyn
      locations, but this assumes a correct comparison point within Brooklyn.


      Overall, given the ambiguity and potential error in the naming, the initial
      query itself contains a geographical inconsistency.'

      is located in the Hunters Point area of Long Island City, Queens. Long Island
      City is in the western part of Queens, situated along the East River, directly
      across from Midtown Manhattan.


      2. **Identify the location of Red Balloon Learning Center**: This center is

      over the Long Island Rail Road West Side Yard in Manhattan is located east of
      Christ United Methodist Church in Brooklyn, we need to consider the geography
      of New York City.


      1. **Location of the 11th Avenue Viaduct**: This viaduct is in Manhattan, specifically
      on the west side, near the Hudson River. 11th Avenue runs north-south on the
      west side of Manhattan.


      2. **Location of Christ United Methodist Church**: This church is located in
      Brooklyn, which is east of Manhattan. Brooklyn is separated from Manhattan by
      the East River.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Manhattan is generally west of Brooklyn. Given
      that the viaduct is on the west side of Manhattan, it is even more to the west
      compared to the general western boundary of Brooklyn.


      Considering these steps, the 11th Avenue Viaduct in Manhattan is located west
      of Christ United Methodist Church in Brooklyn.

      Place, along the FDR Drive near the Brooklyn Bridge.


      2. **Determine the layout of the buildings:** The buildings within the Smith

      \ it would be on the west side of Manhattan.\n\nGiven that both locations appear\

      1. **Identify the locations**: Fort Wadsworth is a historic military installation
      on Staten Island, located at the northeastern tip of the island, near the Verrazzano-Narrows
      Bridge. The Fort Wadsworth Garage and Guard Shack are both within this area.


      2. **Relative position within Fort Wadsworth**: The Fort Wadsworth Garage and
      Guard Shack are not widely documented as specific tourist attractions, so precise
      geographic coordinates may not be readily available in general public resources.
      However, Fort Wadsworth itself is not a very large area.


      3. **General orientation**: If more detailed local maps or site plans are available
      (e.g., from a visitor''s guide, local GIS data, or a map provided by the National
      Park Service, which manages Fort Wadsworth as part of the Gateway National Recreation
      Area), these could provide specific information about their locations relative
      to each other.

      1. **Identify Locations**: First, identify the exact locations of both the FT
      WADSWORTH GARAGE and the FT WADSWORTH GUARD SHACK within Fort Wadsworth on Staten
      Island. This may require looking at a detailed map or satellite imagery of the
      area.


      2. **Determine Orientation**: Understand the cardinal directions as they relate
      to the area. East is to the right if you are facing north.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: If possible, compare the longitude coordinates of
      both locations. A location with a smaller longitude value is further west, whereas
      a location with a larger longitude value is further east.


      4. **Visual Assessment**: If precise coordinates are not available, a visual
      inspection using a reliable map may help determine the relative positions of
      the two locations.


      After considering these steps, you would be able to conclude whether the FT

      is located at 321 East 140th Street, Bronx, NY 10454.


      2. **Identify the location of the Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic Field**:
      The Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic Field is associated with Cardinal Hayes
      High School, which is located at 650 Grand Concourse, Bronx, NY 10451. The athletic
      field is typically nearby the school.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: The Mott Haven Library is located on
      East 140th Street, while Cardinal Hayes High School, and its associated athletic
      field, is located on the Grand Concourse. The Grand Concourse runs north-south,
      whereas East 140th Street runs east-west.


      4. **Compare the east-west positions**: The address of Mott Haven Library indicates
      it is on an east street, suggesting it''s relatively east in position. The Grand
      Concourse is more centrally located in the Bronx compared to the eastern avenues.


      Based on these steps, the Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic Field on the Grand
      Concourse is located to the west of the Mott Haven Library on East 140th Street.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, the Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic Field is

      1. **Identify the location of Bethlehem Baptist Church, Brooklyn**: Bethlehem
      Baptist Church is located in Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn is one of the five
      boroughs of New York City and is situated to the west of Queens and to the southeast
      of Manhattan.


      2. **Identify the location of W 205 St over NYCT Subway Yards, Bronx**: W 205
      St is located in the Bronx, another borough of New York City. The Bronx is situated
      to the north of Manhattan and to the northeast of Brooklyn.


      3. **Compare the relative positions**: Brooklyn is geographically located to
      the south and somewhat east of the Bronx. Therefore, generally speaking, most
      locations in Brooklyn, including Bethlehem Baptist Church, would be west of
      locations in the Bronx, including W 205 St over NYCT Subway Yards.


      Based on the above steps, the answer is NO. Bethlehem Baptist Church in Brooklyn
