      3.  **Determine the relative locations of the states:** Minnesota (MN) is a
      northern state in the US, bordering Canada. Florida (FL) is the southernmost
      state on the US mainland.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** Any location in Minnesota will be significantly
      farther north (higher latitude) than any location in Florida.

      5.  **Apply to the lakes:** Therefore, Lake Osakis in Minnesota is north of
      Lake DeFuniak in Florida.

      1.  **Identify the first location:** Lake of the Arbuckles is in Oklahoma (OK).

      2.  **Identify the second location:** Lake Traverse is in South Dakota (SD)
      (specifically, on the border between South Dakota and Minnesota).

      3.  **Determine the relative location of the states:** South Dakota is located
      north of Oklahoma in the United States.

      4.  **Determine the relative location of the lakes:** Since Lake Traverse is
      in a state (South Dakota) that is north of the state where Lake of the Arbuckles
      is located (Oklahoma), Lake Traverse is north of Lake of the Arbuckles.

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Lake of the Arbuckles
      (OK) is *north* of Lake Traverse (SD). Based on the reasoning above, Lake of

      south) than northwestern Utah (where the Raft River Mountains are).

      4.  **Determine the relationship:** Since the Raft River Mountains are in a
      state (Utah) that is significantly north of the state where Prien Lake is (Louisiana),
      Prien Lake must be south of the Raft River Mountains.

    384603b8-7614-4afb-86cf-4791f2c0b10d: 'Okay, let''s break this down step-by-step:


      1.  **Identify Location 1:** Clermont Chain of Lakes, Florida (FL).

      2.  **Identify Location 2:** Lake Agnes, Colorado (CO).

      3.  **Determine the general latitude of Florida:** Florida is one of the southernmost
      states in the contiguous United States.

      4.  **Determine the general latitude of Colorado:** Colorado is a state located
      in the Mountain West region, significantly further north than Florida.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** Since Colorado as a whole is much further north
      than Florida, any specific location in Florida (like the Clermont Chain of Lakes)
      will be south of almost any specific location in Colorado (like Lake Agnes).

      6.  **Conclusion:** The Clermont Chain of Lakes in Florida is south of Lake
      Agnes in Colorado.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Clermont chain of lakes, FL located
      north of Lake Agnes (Colorado), CO?" is:

      of any location in Arkansas (like White Oak Lake State Park).

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if White Oak Lake State
      Park (Arkansas) is *north* of the Sapphire Mountains (Montana). Based on the
      states'' locations, this is incorrect. White Oak Lake State Park is *south*
      of the Sapphire Mountains.
