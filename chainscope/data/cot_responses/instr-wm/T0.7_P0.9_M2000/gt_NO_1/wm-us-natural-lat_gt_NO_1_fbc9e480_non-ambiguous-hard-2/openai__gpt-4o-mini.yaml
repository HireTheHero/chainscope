      Now, we can compare their latitudinal positions. Arkansas is situated significantly
      further south than Washington state. Consequently, the Ouachita Mountains, being
      in Arkansas, are located south of the Tatoosh Range, which is in Washington.


      Thus, the final conclusion is:


      NO, the Ouachita Mountains, AR are not located north of the Tatoosh Range, WA.'

      positions of both locations. Since White Oak Lake State Park is in southern
      Arkansas and the Sapphire Mountains are in western Montana, it is evident that
      Arkansas is located south of Montana.


      Given this information:


      - White Oak Lake State Park is south of the Sapphire Mountains.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is **NO**.'
