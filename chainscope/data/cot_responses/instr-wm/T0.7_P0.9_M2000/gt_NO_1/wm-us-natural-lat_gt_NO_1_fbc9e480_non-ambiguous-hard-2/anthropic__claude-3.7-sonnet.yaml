      Step 1: Identify the locations mentioned.

      - Wheeler Lake, AL (Alabama)

      - Anaconda Range, MT (Montana)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions in the United States.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Montana is located in the northwestern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Montana is significantly north of Alabama in the United States.

      - Any location in Montana, including the Anaconda Range, would be north of locations
      in Alabama.

      - Therefore, Wheeler Lake in Alabama would be south of the Anaconda Range in
      Montana.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on the question.

      The question asks if Wheeler Lake, AL is located north of Anaconda Range, MT.
      Since Alabama is south of Montana, Wheeler Lake cannot be north of the Anaconda
      Range.

      Topock Gorge is located in western Arizona, along the Colorado River near the
      California border, in the southwestern United States.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Lake Pend Oreille, ID is located.

      Lake Pend Oreille is located in the northern Idaho panhandle, in the northwestern
      United States.

      Lake Pend Oreille is) is significantly further north than western Arizona (where
      Topock Gorge is).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Lake Pend Oreille is in northern Idaho and Topock Gorge is in western
      Arizona, Lake Pend Oreille is further north than Topock Gorge. This means Topock
      Gorge is NOT north of Lake Pend Oreille, but rather south of it.

      positions of Coleto Creek Reservoir in Texas and the Sandwich Range in New Hampshire.


      Step 1: Let me identify the approximate latitude of Coleto Creek Reservoir,
      TX.

      Coleto Creek Reservoir is located in south Texas, near Goliad. Texas is in the
      southern United States, and this reservoir would be in the southern portion
      of Texas. Its approximate latitude would be around 28-29 degrees North.


      Step 2: Let me identify the approximate latitude of the Sandwich Range, NH.

      The Sandwich Range is located in New Hampshire, which is in the northeastern
      United States. New Hampshire is much further north than Texas. The Sandwich
      Range would be approximately at 43-44 degrees North latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Since Coleto Creek Reservoir is at approximately 28-29 degrees North and the
      Sandwich Range is at approximately 43-44 degrees North, the Sandwich Range is
      further north than Coleto Creek Reservoir.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Prien Lake is in Louisiana (LA), which is in the southeastern United States.

      - Raft River Mountains are in Utah (UT), which is in the western United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Louisiana is located in the southeastern part of the United States.

      - Utah is located in the western part of the United States.

      - In terms of latitude, Louisiana is generally south of Utah.


      Step 3: More specifically for these locations:

      - Prien Lake is in southwestern Louisiana (near Lake Charles).

      - The Raft River Mountains are in northwestern Utah.

      - When comparing latitudes, places in Louisiana are typically south of places
      in Utah.


      Therefore, Prien Lake, LA is located south of (not north of) the Raft River
      Mountains, UT.

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Louisiana is in the southeastern part of the United States

      - Utah is in the western part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Louisiana is generally located in the southern United States

      - Utah is located further north than Louisiana


      Step 4: Specifically for these locations:

      - Prien Lake is in southwestern Louisiana (near Lake Charles)

      - The Raft River Mountains are in northwestern Utah


      Step 5: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Since Louisiana is south of Utah, and these specific locations follow this
      general pattern, Prien Lake would be south of the Raft River Mountains, not
      north.


      NO, Prien Lake, LA is not located north of Raft River Mountains, UT. It is located
