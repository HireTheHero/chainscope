      1. Locate Sangre de Cristo Range, CO:

      - This mountain range is located in southern Colorado

      - It is in the southeastern part of Colorado


      2. Locate Rainy Lake, MN:

      - Rainy Lake is located in northern Minnesota

      - It is near the border with Canada


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Colorado is in the southwestern United States

      - Minnesota is in the north-central United States

      - Colorado is significantly south of Minnesota


      4. Determine relative positioning:

      - Since the Sangre de Cristo Range is in southern Colorado, and Rainy Lake is
      in northern Minnesota, the Sangre de Cristo Range is south of Rainy Lake


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Sangre de Cristo Range, CO is NOT located north

      - Since Bristol Lake is in southern California and Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes
      is in northern Maine, Bristol Lake is SOUTH of Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes


      5. The specific question asks: "Is Bristol Lake, CA located north of Pemadumcook
      Chain of Lakes, ME?"


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'

      - These mountains are in western North Carolina, in the Blue Ridge Mountain
      range

      - They are located in the southeastern part of the United States


      2. Next, I''ll locate Bears Paw Mountains in Montana

      - These mountains are in north-central Montana

      - Little Blue Run Lake is in Washington County, Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Texas is south of Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, a location in Texas (Medina Lake) would be south of a location
      in Pennsylvania (Little Blue Run Lake)


      4. So when asked "Is Medina Lake, TX located north of Little Blue Run Lake,
      PA?", the answer is:


      NO'
