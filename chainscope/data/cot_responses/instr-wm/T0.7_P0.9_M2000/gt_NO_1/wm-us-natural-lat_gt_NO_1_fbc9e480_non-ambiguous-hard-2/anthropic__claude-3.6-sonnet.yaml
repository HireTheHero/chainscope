      - Colorado is south of Minnesota in general

      - Sangre de Cristo Range is in the southern part of Colorado

      - Rainy Lake is in the northern part of Minnesota

      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Buena Vista Lake is in California

      - Kettle River Range is in Washington state


      2) In terms of US geography:

      - Washington state is located along the northern US border

      - California is located along the west coast, south of Washington


      3) Since Washington state is entirely north of California:

      - Any location in Washington state must be north of any location in California

      - Therefore, Buena Vista Lake (CA) must be south of Kettle River Range (WA)


      NO (Buena Vista Lake is not north of Kettle River Range)'

      1. Let me identify the locations:

      - Topock Gorge is in western Arizona, along the Colorado River

      - Lake Pend Oreille is in northern Idaho


      2. Think about their relative positions:

      - Idaho is entirely north of Arizona

      - Lake Pend Oreille is in the northern part of Idaho

      - Topock Gorge is in the western part of Arizona


      3. Make the comparison:

      - Since Idaho is north of Arizona, and Lake Pend Oreille is in northern Idaho,
      it must be well north of any point in Arizona, including Topock Gorge


      Therefore:

      NO - Topock Gorge is NOT located north of Lake Pend Oreille. It is south of
      it.'

      4) Comparing latitudes:

      - Places in Texas are generally much further south than places in New Hampshire

      - Coleto Creek Reservoir, being in southern Texas, is definitely south of any
      point in New Hampshire


      Therefore: NO, Coleto Creek Reservoir is not located north of Sandwich Range.
