      asks about Joe Pool Lake, TX and Payette Lake, ID.

      2.  **Determine the state of each location:** Joe Pool Lake is in Texas (TX).
      Payette Lake is in Idaho (ID).

      3.  **Consider the general geographical position of the states:** Texas is a
      southern state in the US. Idaho is a northwestern state in the US.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** States in the south are generally at lower latitudes
      (closer to the equator) than states in the north. Idaho is significantly further
      north than Texas.

      5.  **Infer the relative position of the lakes:** Since Joe Pool Lake is in
      Texas and Payette Lake is in Idaho, and Idaho is generally north of Texas, it
      follows that Payette Lake is north of Joe Pool Lake.

      6.  **Answer the question as posed:** The question asks if Joe Pool Lake is
      north of Payette Lake. Based on the previous steps, Payette Lake is north of
      Joe Pool Lake, meaning Joe Pool Lake is *south* of Payette Lake.

      asks about Kern Lake (Kern County), CA and Woman Lake, MN.

      2.  **Determine the approximate latitude of Kern Lake, CA:** Kern County is
      in Southern California. Kern Lake is in the southern part of Kern County, near
      Bakersfield. Bakersfield''s latitude is roughly 35.3 degrees North. Kern Lake''s
      latitude would be similar, let''s estimate around 35 degrees North.

      3.  **Determine the approximate latitude of Woman Lake, MN:** Woman Lake is
      in Cass County, Minnesota. Walker, MN, which is nearby, has a latitude of roughly
      46.9 degrees North. Woman Lake''s latitude would be similar, let''s estimate
      around 47 degrees North.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** 35 degrees North (Kern Lake) is less than 47
      degrees North (Woman Lake).

      5.  **Relate latitude to north/south position:** A higher latitude means a more
      northerly location.

      6.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since Woman Lake, MN has a higher latitude
      than Kern Lake, CA, Woman Lake is located *north* of Kern Lake. Therefore, Kern
      Lake, CA is located *south* of Woman Lake, MN.

      coast of the US. Minnesota is in the upper Midwest of the US.

      3.  **Consider the typical latitude of each state:** California is a long state,
      spanning a range of latitudes, but its southern end (where Kern County is) is
      relatively far south. Minnesota is a northern state, located at a higher latitude
      than most of the contiguous US.

      4.  **Compare the general latitudes:** States in the upper Midwest (like Minnesota)
      are generally located at higher latitudes (further north) than states on the
      southern or central West Coast (like southern California).

      5.  **Apply this comparison to the specific locations:** Kern Lake is in Kern
      County, which is in the southern half of California. Woman Lake is in Minnesota.
      Given the relative positions of the states, it is highly probable that Minnesota
      (and thus Woman Lake) is located significantly further north than southern California
      (and thus Kern Lake).

      2.  **Determine the state of each location:** La Plata Mountains are in Colorado

      3.  **Determine the relative geographical position of the states:** Colorado
      is located directly south of Wyoming. Montana is located directly north of Wyoming.
      Therefore, Montana is located north of Colorado.

      4.  **Relate the locations within their states to the state positions:** Since
      La Plata Mountains are in Colorado and Grinnell Lake is in Montana, and Montana
      is north of Colorado, any location within Montana will be generally north of
      any location within Colorado (assuming they are roughly within the core latitudes
      of their respective states, which is true here).

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** A quick check (or general knowledge of US geography)
      confirms that Montana is significantly further north in latitude than Colorado.


      Therefore, a location in Montana (Grinnell Lake) is located north of a location
      in Colorado (La Plata Mountains). The question asks if La Plata Mountains, CO
      is north of Grinnell Lake, MT. This is the opposite of the finding in step 5.

      \ of each location.\n    *   Colorado (CO) is a state in the Mountain West region\
      \ of the US. It's generally south of Montana.\n    *   Montana (MT) is a state\
      \ in the Northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains region of the US. It's generally\
      \ north of Colorado.\n\n4.  **Refine the Locations (Mental Map or Quick Search):**\n\
      \    *   Colorado is roughly between 37\xB0N and 41\xB0N latitude. Southern\
      \ Colorado is closer to 37\xB0N. La Plata Mountains are in southwestern Colorado,\
      \ near Durango. This puts them in the southern part of CO.\n    *   Montana\
      \ is roughly between 44\xB0N and 49\xB0N latitude. Grinnell Lake is in Glacier\
      \ National Park, which is in northwestern Montana. This puts it in the northern\
      \ part of MT, specifically quite far north within the state.\n\n5.  **Compare\
      \ the Latitudes:**\n    *   La Plata Mountains, CO (Southwestern CO) are at\
      \ a latitude around 37\xB0 to 38\xB0 N.\n    *   Grinnell Lake, MT (Northwestern\
      \ MT, Glacier NP) is at a latitude around 48\xB0 to 49\xB0 N.\n\n6.  **Determine\
      \ the Relative North/South Position:** A higher latitude number means further\
      \ north (in the Northern Hemisphere).\n    *   48-49\xB0 N (Grinnell Lake) is\
      \ significantly higher than 37-38\xB0 N (La Plata Mountains).\n    *   Therefore,\
      \ Grinnell Lake is located *north* of La Plata Mountains.\n\n7.  **Answer the\
      \ Specific Question:** The question asks: \"Is La Plata Mountains, CO located\
      \ *north* of Grinnell Lake, MT?\"\n    *   My comparison showed Grinnell Lake\
      \ is north of La Plata Mountains.\n    *   This means La Plata Mountains are\
      \ *south* of Grinnell Lake.\n\n8.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** The answer\
      \ to the question \"Is La Plata Mountains, CO located north of Grinnell Lake,\
      \ MT?\" is NO.\n\n9.  **Add the Reasoning Steps:** Explain the process:\n  \
      \  *   Identify the locations and states.\n    *   Determine their general geographic\
      \ positions (states' relative positions).\n    *   Determine the specific regions\
      \ within the states (southwestern CO, northwestern MT).\n    *   Compare the\
      \ latitudes (or relative north/south positions based on a map).\n    *   Conclude\
      \ which location is north of the other.\n    *   Answer the question based on\
      \ that conclusion.\n\nThis step-by-step process confirms the relative positions\
      \ and leads directly to the correct YES/NO answer.\n\n**Final Answer Construction:**\n\
      \n*   Start with the reasoning steps.\n*   Clearly state the locations and their\
      \ states.\n*   Explain that Montana is north of Colorado.\n*   Specify the regions\
      \ within the states (southwestern CO vs. northwestern MT).\n*   Compare their\
      \ latitudes implicitly or explicitly.\n*   State the conclusion about their\
      \ relative north/south position.\n*   Finally, give the YES/NO answer based\
      \ on the conclusion.\n\n**(Self-Correction/Double Check):** Does it make sense\
      \ that a location in southern Colorado is north of a location in northern Montana?\
      \ No, that's counter-intuitive. My logic confirms the intuitive understanding\
      \ that Montana is generally north of Colorado, and the specific locations within\
      \ those states reinforce this.\n\nOkay, ready to give the answer.Okay, let's\

      \ Montana is located *north* of Colorado.\n4.  Consider the specific locations\
      \ within those states. The La Plata Mountains are in southwestern Colorado,\
      \ relatively far south within the state. Grinnell Lake is in Glacier National\
      \ Park, in northwestern Montana, relatively far north within the state.\n5.\
      \  Since Montana is generally north of Colorado, and specifically Grinnell Lake\
      \ is in northern Montana while La Plata Mountains are in southern Colorado,\
      \ Grinnell Lake is significantly further north than the La Plata Mountains.\n\
      6.  The question asks if La Plata Mountains are *north* of Grinnell Lake. Based\

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Arizona (AZ) is in the
      Southwestern United States. Washington (WA) is in the Northwestern United States.

      3.  **Consider the relative latitude of the states:** States further south generally
      have lower latitudes than states further north. Arizona is significantly south
      of Washington.

      4.  **Reason about the latitude of places within those states:** A lake in Arizona
      will likely be at a lower latitude (further south) than a lake in Washington,
      assuming they aren''t located at extreme edges of their respective states (which
      these lakes aren''t; they are relatively central within their state''s north-south
      extent).

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** Since Arizona is south of Washington, Mormon
      Lake in Arizona will be at a lower latitude (further south) than Coldwater Lake
      in Washington.

      6.  **Determine the relative north-south position:** If Mormon Lake is south

      \ Lake State Park, AR:** White Oak Lake State Park is located in southwestern\
      \ Arkansas. Arkansas is roughly between 33\xB0N and 36\xB0N latitude. Southwestern\
      \ Arkansas is closer to the southern end of the state, so its latitude is approximately\
      \ 33.8\xB0N.\n3.  **Determine the latitude of the Sapphire Mountains, MT:**\
      \ The Sapphire Mountains are located in western Montana. Montana is roughly\
      \ between 44\xB0N and 49\xB0N latitude. Western Montana is closer to the western\
      \ side of the state, and the Sapphire Mountains are in the central-western part,\
      \ so their latitude is approximately 46\xB0N.\n4.  **Compare the latitudes:**\
      \ White Oak Lake State Park is at approximately 33.8\xB0N latitude. The Sapphire\
      \ Mountains are at approximately 46\xB0N latitude.\n5.  **Determine relative\
      \ position based on latitude:** A higher latitude means a location is further\
      \ north. Since 46\xB0N is higher than 33.8\xB0N, the Sapphire Mountains are\
      \ located north of White Oak Lake State Park.\n6.  **Answer the question asked:**\
      \ The question is \"Is White Oak Lake State Park, AR located north of Sapphire\
      \ Mountains, MT?\". Since the Sapphire Mountains are north of White Oak Lake\
      \ State Park, White Oak Lake State Park must be located south of the Sapphire\
