      positioning of two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 60087 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Illinois and Ohio.

      - Illinois is located west of Ohio in the United States.


      Step 3: Check if these specific zip codes might be exceptions to the general
      state positions.

      - 60087 is in Waukegan, IL, which is in the northeastern part of Illinois

      - 43952 is in Steubenville, OH, which is in the eastern part of Ohio


      Step 4: Even though 60087 is in northeastern Illinois, and 43952 is in eastern
      Ohio, the general geography of the United States means that Illinois locations
      are west of Ohio locations.

      - Missouri is located in the central United States

      - Michigan is located in the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Missouri is generally west of Michigan

      - Michigan is further east than Missouri


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are within these states, they follow the same general
      geographic relationship.

      - A zip code in Missouri (63670) would be west of a zip code in Michigan (48624)

      - Therefore, 63670, MO is NOT east of 48624, MI (it''s west of it)

      - 27604 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 11572 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - New York is further north on the east coast

      - North Carolina is further south on the east coast


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      - Eastern locations have smaller longitude values in the western hemisphere

      - North Carolina is generally east of New York on the map because the coastline

      due to the curvature of the coastline


      Step 3: Check the specific zip codes.

      - 97229 is in the Portland area of Oregon, in the northwestern part of the state

      - 90650 is Norwalk, CA, which is in the Los Angeles area in southern California


      Step 4: Compare east-west positioning.

      - West coast zip codes generally start with higher numbers in the north and
      lower numbers in the south

      - However, the specific locations matter more than the zip code numbers

      - Portland, OR (97229) is slightly east of the Pacific coast

      - Norwalk, CA (90650) is also inland from the coast, in the Los Angeles basin

      - Looking at a map, Portland is actually slightly WEST of Norwalk when considering

      NJ tend to be further east than southern states like SC


      Step 4: To be more precise, I should consider the specific longitude of these
      zip codes.

      - NJ zip codes (including 08062) are typically around 74-75 degrees west longitude

      - SC zip codes (including 29388) are typically around 80-83 degrees west longitude

      - A smaller longitude number (west) means further east


      Step 5: Make the determination based on longitude.

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 85255 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ), specifically in the Scottsdale area.

      2) 80130 is a zip code in Colorado (CO), specifically in the Highlands Ranch
      area.

      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) First, I need to understand the geographic relationship between Texas (TX)
      and Louisiana (LA). Generally, Louisiana is east of Texas, as Texas is in the
      south-central part of the US, while Louisiana is in the southeastern part.


      2) ZIP codes in the US are somewhat organized geographically. The first digit
      usually indicates a general region, with lower numbers typically in the northeast
      and higher numbers in the west.


      3) The ZIP code 76008 is in Texas, and the ZIP code 70712 is in Louisiana.


      4) Looking at the first two digits: 76xxx ZIP codes are in north-central Texas
      (around the Dallas-Fort Worth area), while 70xxx ZIP codes are in Louisiana.


      5) Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these ZIP codes follow the standard
      geographic pattern, the Louisiana ZIP code (70712) would be east of the Texas
      ZIP code (76008).


      Therefore, 76008, TX is NOT located east of 70712, LA. Instead, 76008, TX is

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Louisiana.

      - Louisiana is located directly east of Texas along the Gulf Coast.

      - Texas is west of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally follow west-to-east patterns, with lower numbers in
      the east and higher numbers in the west.

      - However, the first digit is more important for regional location than the
      entire number.

      - 7xxxx zip codes cover Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma region.

      - Within this region, 760xx (Texas) is west of 707xx (Louisiana).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since 76008 is in Texas and 70712 is in Louisiana, and Louisiana is east of

      (toward the Atlantic Ocean) of 01810, MA.


      Step 4: Apply geographic knowledge.

      Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania. Since 01810 is in MA and 15468
      is in PA, the PA location would be to the west of the MA location, not to the
      east.

      - Pennsylvania is located southwest of Massachusetts


      Step 3: More specifically, Massachusetts is on the eastern seaboard, while Pennsylvania
      is inland and to the west of Massachusetts.


      Step 4: The specific zip codes don''t change this fundamental geographic relationship.
      All of Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts.


      Step 5: Since Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts, a location in Pennsylvania
      (15468) must be west of a location in Massachusetts (01810), not east of it.


      NO, 15468, PA is not located east of 01810, MA. It is located west of it.'

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located southwest of Massachusetts


      Step 3: In the United States, when comparing eastern and western positions:

      - States further east have locations with lower longitude values

      - Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania on a map


      Step 4: Since ZIP codes follow geographic distribution patterns:

      - ZIP codes in Massachusetts (like 01810) are generally east of ZIP codes in
      Pennsylvania (like 15468)

      - The specific ZIP codes follow this general state positioning

      Step 1: Let me identify the states. 73701 is in Oklahoma (OK) and 47834 is in
      Indiana (IN).


      Step 2: I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these states.
      Indiana is located in the Midwest region, bordering Illinois to its west and
      Ohio to its east. Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States, west
      of Arkansas and Missouri.


      Step 3: When comparing the east-west positioning of states in the US, Indiana
      is significantly east of Oklahoma. The entire state of Oklahoma lies west of
      Indiana.


      Step 4: Since 73701 is in Oklahoma and 47834 is in Indiana, and Oklahoma is
      west of Indiana, then 73701 must be west of 47834, not east of it.


      NO, 73701, OK is not located east of 47834, IN. It is located west of it.'

      To determine this, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their east-west positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 73701 is a zip code in Enid, Oklahoma (OK)

      - 47834 is a zip code in Clinton, Indiana (IN)


      ## Step 2: Determine their relative positions

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - On a west-to-east orientation, Oklahoma is west of Indiana


      ## Step 3: Make the comparison

      Since Oklahoma is west of Indiana, any location in Oklahoma (including Enid,
      73701) would be west of locations in Indiana (including Clinton, 47834).


      Therefore, 73701, OK is NOT located east of 47834, IN. It is located west of
      it.

      To solve this problem, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 91360 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in Thousand Oaks in
      Southern California.


      2) 84056 is a zip code in Utah (UT).


      3) Looking at the geography of the United States, Utah is located to the east
      of California. Utah shares its western border with Nevada, which in turn borders
      California.


      4) In terms of longitude (which measures east-west position), locations in Utah
      have more easterly longitudes than locations in California.


      5) Therefore, a location in California (91360) would be WEST of a location in
      Utah (84056), not east of it.


      NO, 91360, CA is not located east of 84056, UT. It is located west of it.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 91360 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 84056 is a zip code in Utah (UT)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is located inland, east of California


      Step 3: Think about relative positions.

      - States further east have higher longitude values (measured in degrees east
      of the Prime Meridian)

      - California is west of Utah, meaning California has lower longitude values
      than Utah


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 91360 is in California, and 84056 is in Utah, the California zip code
      must be west of the Utah zip code

      - Therefore, 91360, CA cannot be east of 84056, UT

      - 10918 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - States on the East Coast generally align north-south

      - New York is north of Georgia

      - However, when comparing east-west positioning, Georgia is generally west of
      New York, not east


      Step 4: To be more precise, let me consider the longitude (east-west positioning).

      - Eastern locations have more easterly longitudes (higher negative numbers or
      lower positive numbers in the Western Hemisphere)

      - New York is typically further east (more easterly longitude) than Georgia

      To determine this, I need to compare the geographical locations of these two
      zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      - Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Georgia is also on the eastern seaboard, but is located south of Virginia

      - In terms of east-west positioning, Virginia is generally east of Georgia


      Step 3: Verify the specific zip code locations

      - 30534 appears to be in northeastern Georgia

      - 20121 is in northern Virginia, near the Washington DC area

      - Even though 30534 is in northeastern Georgia, Virginia''s position on the
      Atlantic coast places it further east than northeastern Georgia


      Step 4: Make the determination

      - Virginia zip codes, including 20121, are generally east of Georgia zip codes,
      including 30534


      NO, 30534, GA is not located east of 20121, VA. Rather, 20121, VA is east of
      30534, GA.'
    ea8999f5-f3cf-46a9-8ea6-7032f07c8f86: '# Is 30534, GA located east of 20121, VA?


      To determine this, I need to find the relative geographic positions of these
      two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states

      Georgia is located south of Virginia, but the question is specifically about
      east/west positioning.


      Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Georgia is also
      on the eastern seaboard but further south.


      ## Step 3: Consider longitude (east-west positioning)

      - Virginia is generally positioned in the eastern United States

      - Georgia is also in the eastern United States, but typically west of Virginia


      Looking at the specific zip codes:

      - 30534 appears to be in northern Georgia

      - 20121 appears to be in northern Virginia (likely in the DC metro area)


      Northern Georgia is west of northern Virginia. The Appalachian mountains run
      through this region, with Virginia being on the eastern side and Georgia on
      the western side of the general mountain chain.


      ## Conclusion

      NO, 30534, GA is not located east of 20121, VA. It is located west of it.'

      - Connecticut is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Ohio is significantly further west than Connecticut


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Ohio is west of Connecticut, any ZIP code in Ohio (including 45204) would
      be west of any ZIP code in Connecticut (including 06770). This means 45204,
      OH is NOT east of 06770, CT, but rather west of it.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographical locations of these
      two zip codes and compare their east-west positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 77340 is a zip code in Huntsville, Texas

      - 30342 is a zip code in Atlanta, Georgia


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography of Texas and Georgia

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Generally, Georgia is east of Texas on a map of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      Since Huntsville, TX (77340) is in Texas, and Atlanta, GA (30342) is in Georgia,
      and Georgia is east of Texas, this means that 77340 is located WEST of 30342,
      not east.

      - 97331 is in Oregon (OR)

      - 90043 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the US, locations
      are generally considered "east" of each other based on their longitude (where
      lower longitude numbers are further east).


      Step 3: Let me consider the general geography of Oregon and California:

      - Oregon is located north of California

      - Oregon is generally in line with or slightly east of California, depending
      on the specific locations


      Step 4: For more precision, I need to consider the specific zip codes:

      - 97331 is in Corvallis, Oregon, which is in the western part of Oregon

      - 90043 is in Los Angeles, California, which is in the southwestern part of
      California


      Step 5: Comparing these specific locations:

      - Corvallis, OR (97331) is actually west of Los Angeles, CA (90043)

      - The Pacific coast curves inward as you move north from California to Oregon,
      placing western Oregon further west than Los Angeles

      - 90043 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Oregon and California.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California, also on the west coast.


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - In the United States, states that are further east have higher longitude values
      (measured in degrees east of the Prime Meridian).

      - California and Oregon share a north-south relationship, with Oregon being
      north of California.

      - Generally, Oregon is not east of California - they are roughly aligned on
      the north-south axis.


      Step 4: Check the specific zip codes.

      - 97331 is in Corvallis, Oregon, in the western part of Oregon.

      - 90043 is in Los Angeles, California, in the southwestern part of California.

      - Los Angeles is closer to the Pacific coast than Corvallis, but Corvallis is
      not east of Los Angeles - it''s north and slightly east.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 91352 is a ZIP code in California (CA)

      - 88048 is a ZIP code in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New Mexico within

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, but east of California


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since California is west of New Mexico, any location in California (including
      91352) would be west of any location in New Mexico (including 88048)

      - Therefore, 91352, CA cannot be east of 88048, NM; it must be west of it

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 80237 is a zip code in Colorado (CO)

      - 76114 is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Colorado and Texas.

      - Colorado is located directly north of New Mexico

      - Texas is located east of New Mexico

      - This means Texas is generally southeast of Colorado


      Step 3: More specifically, let me think about the longitude (east-west positioning).

      - Colorado is in the Mountain Time Zone

      - Texas spans both Central Time Zone and Mountain Time Zone

      - Central Time Zone is east of Mountain Time Zone


      Step 4: For these specific zip codes:

      - 80237 is in Denver, Colorado, in the eastern part of Colorado

      - 76114 is in Fort Worth, Texas, in the north-central part of Texas

      - Fort Worth is well into the eastern half of Texas


      Step 5: Comparing east-west positions:

      - Even though 80237 is in eastern Colorado, Texas extends much further east

      - Fort Worth (76114) is in the eastern portion of Texas

      - Therefore, 76114 in TX is east of 80237 in CO


      NO, 80237, CO is not located east of 76114, TX. It''s the opposite - 76114,

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 43160 is a ZIP code in Ohio (OH)

      - 12549 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States, south of
      New Jersey

      - New Jersey is also on the east coast, north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - On a map of the United States, the east coast has a general northeast to southwest
      orientation

      - This means locations further north on the east coast (like New Jersey) tend
      to be further east than locations further south (like North Carolina)

      - New Jersey is positioned more eastward into the Atlantic Ocean compared to

      - On a map of the United States, New Jersey is positioned to the northeast of
      North Carolina.

      - When comparing east-west positioning specifically, New Jersey is generally
      east of North Carolina since the east coast curves inward as it goes south from

      if 24354, VA is east of 28457, NC.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 24354 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Virginia and North Carolina.

      - Virginia is north of North Carolina

      - However, the question asks about east/west positioning, not north/south


      Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      - In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to west

      - Lower zip codes tend to be further east than higher zip codes

      - 24354 is a lower number than 28457


      Step 4: Compare the first digits of the zip codes.

      - 24354 starts with "2"

      - 28457 starts with "2"

      - Both are in the same first-digit region, but 243xx is generally east of 284xx


      Step 5: Verify the specific locations.

      - 24354 is in southwestern Virginia (Grayson County area)

      - 28457 is in central/western North Carolina


      Based on this analysis, 24354 (VA) is indeed located east of 28457 (NC), despite
      being in a different state.


      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check this. Looking more carefully at the specific locations:

      - 24354 is in the southwestern part of Virginia

      - 28457 is in the central/western part of North Carolina


      Since Virginia is generally northeast of North Carolina, and these specific
      zip codes are in the western portions of their respective states, 24354 is actually
      northeast of 28457, which means it is east of 28457.

      - 24354 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Virginia is located north of North Carolina

      - Virginia is generally to the northeast of North Carolina

      - The eastern parts of Virginia are east of North Carolina, but western Virginia
      is more directly north of western North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider the zip code patterns.

      - In the US zip code system, lower numbers generally (but not always) correspond
      to more eastern and northern locations

      - 24xxx zip codes in Virginia are typically in western/southwestern Virginia

      - 28xxx zip codes in North Carolina are typically in the central to western
      portions of North Carolina


      Step 4: Make a determination based on the specific zip codes.

      - 24354 is in southwestern Virginia (specifically in the Grayson County area)

      - 28457 is in western North Carolina

      - When comparing these specific locations, 24354 (VA) is north of 28457 (NC),

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the eastern United States.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Virginia is located south of New Jersey, but also extends inland (west)


      Step 3: Think about cardinal directions.

      - "East" refers to a location that is further toward the Atlantic Ocean

      - New Jersey is generally east of Virginia on a map


      Step 4: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - New Jersey zip codes (especially those beginning with "08") tend to be in
      the eastern/coastal parts of NJ

      - Virginia zip codes in the "244xx" range are typically in the western/central
      part of Virginia


      Step 5: Make a conclusion based on the general positions.

      - 08221, NJ is likely on or near the Atlantic coast in New Jersey

      - 24486, VA is likely in the western/central region of Virginia

      - Therefore, 08221, NJ would be east of 24486, VA
