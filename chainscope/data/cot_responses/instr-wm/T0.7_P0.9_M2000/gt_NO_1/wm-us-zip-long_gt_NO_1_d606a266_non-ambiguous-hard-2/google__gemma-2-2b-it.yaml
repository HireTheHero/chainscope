      1. **Map it out:**  You need to visualize the locations of 30534, GA and 20121,
      VA.  You can use a map online.

      2. **Consider the states:**  Georgia (GA) is in the southern part of the US,
      while Virginia (VA) is in the east coast.

      3. **Determine direction:**  Think about which way the state lines generally
      run.

      4. **Compare:**  Based on the general direction of the states and the placement
      of the zip codes, you can determine which location is located east of the other.


      **Answer:**  Based on the above reasoning, the answer is **NO**'
