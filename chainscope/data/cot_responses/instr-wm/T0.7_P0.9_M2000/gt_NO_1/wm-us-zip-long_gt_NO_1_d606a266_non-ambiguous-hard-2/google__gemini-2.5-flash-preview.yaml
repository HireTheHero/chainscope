      comparing 60087, IL and 43952, OH.

      2.  **Determine the state for each zip code:** 60087 is in Illinois (IL). 43952
      is in Ohio (OH).

      3.  **Consider the relative geographical positions of the states:** Illinois
      is located west of Ohio in the United States.

      4.  **Infer the relative positions of the zip codes:** Since Illinois is west
      of Ohio, any location within Illinois (including 60087) will generally be west
      of any location within Ohio (including 43952).

      5.  **Formulate the answer based on the question:** The question asks if 60087,
      IL is *east* of 43952, OH. Based on the states'' relative positions, this is
      not true.

      considered part of the Midwest, west of Indiana and Ohio. Ohio (OH) is also
      part of the Midwest, but is located east of Indiana and Illinois.

      3.  **Compare the states geographically:** Based on the general positions, Ohio
      is located east of Illinois.

      4.  **Consider if specific zip code locations within the states could reverse
      the general trend:** While zip codes within a state vary, the difference in
      longitude between Illinois and Ohio is significant enough that a zip code in
      Illinois will almost certainly be west of a zip code in Ohio. There are no zip
      codes in far western Ohio that are west of far eastern Illinois.

      5.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since Ohio is east of Illinois, a location
      in Illinois (60087) will be west of a location in Ohio (43952). Therefore, 60087,
      IL is NOT located east of 43952, OH. The question asks if it IS located east.

      This is a zip code in North Carolina. North Carolina is located on the East
      Coast of the United States, south of states like Connecticut.

      2.  **Identify the location of 06250, CT:** This is a zip code in Connecticut.
      Connecticut is located in the northeastern part of the United States, on the
      East Coast, north of states like North Carolina.

      3.  **Compare the relative positions:** To be "east" of another location in
      the US, you generally need to be further east in terms of longitude. While both
      states are on the East Coast, North Carolina is significantly further south
      than Connecticut. The coastline of North Carolina (where 28403 is located, near
      Wilmington) extends further east than the coastline of Connecticut (where 06250
      is located, near Storrs). However, "east of" usually implies a direct longitudinal
      comparison. Looking at a map or coordinates, the longitude of Wilmington, NC
      (around -77.9 degrees) is *west* of the longitude of Storrs, CT (around -72.2
      degrees).

      4.  **Formulate the final comparison:** Since the longitude of 28403, NC is

      3.  **Consider the eastward/westward relationship:** Since Virginia is south
      of Massachusetts, and both states are on the east coast, their relative east-west
      positions are not immediately obvious just from their north-south relationship.

      4.  **Consider the typical progression of zip codes:** Lower numbered zip codes
      (like 0xxxx) are generally located further east than higher numbered zip codes
      (like 2xxxx) within the eastern United States, although there are exceptions
      and complex boundaries. Massachusetts zip codes generally start with 0, while
      Virginia zip codes generally start with 2.

      5.  **Visualize or mentally map the locations:** Massachusetts is further north
      and east than Virginia.

      6.  **Formulate the comparison:** The question asks if 23702, VA is *east* of
      01364, MA.

      7.  **Conclusion:** Since Massachusetts is located to the northeast of Virginia
      along the Atlantic coast, 01364, MA is actually *east* of 23702, VA. Therefore,
      23702, VA is *not* east of 01364, MA.

      zip codes.

      - 32129 is in Florida (FL).

      - 10162 is in New York (NY).


      Step 2: Determine the approximate geographical locations of Florida and New
      York within the United States.

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States.

      - New York is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 3: Consider the general east-west positions of the southeastern and northeastern
      regions of the US.

      - The southeastern US is generally located to the south and somewhat to the
      west of the northeastern US, relative to a central point in the country. More
      specifically, looking at a map, Florida is located to the south and west of
      New York.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudinal positions of the two states.

      - Florida is a peninsula that extends southward and westward. Most of Florida
      is further west than most of New York. Even the easternmost points of Florida
      are generally further west than the westernmost points of New York.


      Step 5: Based on the geographical locations of Florida and New York, determine
      the relative east-west position of 32129 compared to 10162.

      - Since 32129 is in Florida and 10162 is in New York, and Florida is generally
      located west of New York, 32129 is located west of 10162.

      \ compared to parts of Oregon, and its longitude is indeed further east (less\
      \ negative) than Portland's. The logic holds.Here's the step-by-step thinking:\n\
      \n1.  **Identify the locations:** We are comparing the locations associated\
      \ with zip code 97229 in Oregon (OR) and 90650 in California (CA).\n2.  **Determine\
      \ the general areas:** 97229 is in the Beaverton/Portland area of Oregon. 90650\
      \ is in the Norwalk/Los Angeles area of Southern California.\n3.  **Consider\
      \ relative positions on a map:** Oregon is north of California. Both are on\
      \ the West Coast of the US.\n4.  **Focus on East/West:** To determine which\
      \ is east or west, we need to consider their longitude.\n    *   The Portland\
      \ area (97229) is generally around 122 degrees West longitude.\n    *   The\
      \ Los Angeles area (90650) is generally around 118 degrees West longitude.\n\
      5.  **Apply the East/West rule:** On a map, locations further east have a larger\
      \ longitude value (less negative in the Western Hemisphere). -118 is a larger\
      \ number than -122.\n6.  **Compare longitudes:** Since -118 (90650, CA) is greater\
      \ than -122 (97229, OR), 90650, CA is located *east* of 97229, OR.\n7.  **Answer\
      \ the specific question:** The question asks if 97229, OR is located *east*\
      \ of 90650, CA. Based on step 6, 97229, OR is located *west* of 90650, CA.\n\

      2. **Determine the states:** 36107 is in Alabama (AL) and 44030 is in Ohio (OH).

      3. **Consider the general geographic relationship:** Alabama is in the southeastern
      United States, while Ohio is in the midwestern United States.

      4. **Consider the typical north-south and east-west positioning:** Generally,
      states in the Southeast are further south and often further west than states
      in the Midwest.

      2.  **Determine the states:** 36107 is in Alabama (AL). 44030 is in Ohio (OH).

      3.  **Visualize the relative positions of the states:** Ohio is generally north
      and east of Alabama on a map of the US.

      4.  **Determine the general longitude:** Alabama is primarily in the Central
      Time Zone (though the eastern edge is near the Eastern Time Zone boundary).
      Ohio is entirely in the Eastern Time Zone. The Eastern Time Zone is geographically
      east of the Central Time Zone. Therefore, locations in Ohio are generally east
      of locations in Alabama.

      5.  **Confirm the specific locations:** While zip codes can cover areas, the
      question asks about the *location* represented by the zip code (or, more accurately,
      the general area). Montgomery, AL is associated with 36107. Elyria, OH is associated
      with 44030. Montgomery, AL is located around 86.3 degrees West longitude. Elyria,

      the state-level relationship. Michigan is significantly west of New Jersey.

      4.  Compare the positions: Since Michigan is geographically west of New Jersey,
      any location within Michigan (like Troy) will be west of any location within
      New Jersey (like Seaside Heights).

      5.  Formulate the answer based on the comparison. The question asks if 48085

      08750 is in New Jersey (NJ).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographical location of each state within the
      United States.

      Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, generally considered part of the Midwest
      or Northeast depending on the specific definition, but its main landmass is
      west of the Atlantic coast.

      New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions of Michigan and New Jersey.

      New Jersey is situated along the Atlantic coast, which is the eastern edge of
      the continental United States. Michigan is located significantly inland, west
      of the Atlantic coast.


      Step 4: Conclude the relative east-west position of a location within Michigan
      compared to a location within New Jersey.

      Since New Jersey is generally further east than Michigan, a location in Michigan
      (48085) will be located west of a location in New Jersey (08750).


      Step 5: Re-evaluate the question asked: Is 48085, MI located east of 08750,

      asks about the relative longitudinal position of two US zip codes: 17202, PA
      and 11563, NY. Specifically, is 17202, PA east of 11563, NY?


      2.  **Understand "east of":** In geographical terms, "east of" means having
      a smaller (more positive) longitude value (closer to the Prime Meridian). Locations
      to the west have larger (more negative) longitude values.


      3.  **Determine the general location of 17202, PA:** Pennsylvania is generally
      located west of New York. Specifically, 17202 corresponds to Chambersburg, PA,
      which is in south-central Pennsylvania.


      4.  **Determine the general location of 11563, NY:** New York is generally located
      east of Pennsylvania. Specifically, 11563 corresponds to Lynbrook, NY, which
      is on Long Island, New York, near the Atlantic coast.


      5.  **Compare the locations:** Chambersburg, PA is located inland and to the
      west compared to Lynbrook, NY, which is located on the coast and much further
      east.


      6.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since Chambersburg, PA (17202) is geographically
      west of Lynbrook, NY (11563), 17202, PA is *not* located east of 11563, NY.


      7.  **Final Answer Derivation:** The question asks "Is 17202, PA located east
      of 11563, NY?". Based on the comparison, the answer is no.


      NO'

      2.  **Determine the state locations:** Missouri (MO) is a state generally located
      in the central US. Kentucky (KY) is a state generally located in the southeastern
      US.

      3.  **Consider the relative positions of the states:** States in the southeastern
      US (like Kentucky) are generally located east of states in the central US (like
      Missouri).

      4.  **Refine by specific zip code locations:** While states have general locations,
      specific zip codes within them can vary. However, given the large geographical
      separation and the relative positions of MO and KY, it is highly probable that
      any location in Kentucky (especially a specific zip code) will be east of any
      location in Missouri.

      5.  **Confirm general geographical relationship:** Missouri is west of the Mississippi
      River for the most part, while Kentucky is entirely east of the Mississippi
      River. The Mississippi River forms a significant geographical boundary and runs
      roughly north-south. Locations east of the Mississippi are generally east of
      locations west of the Mississippi.


      Therefore, 64701, MO is located west of 40175, KY. This means 40175, KY is located
      east of 64701, MO. The question asks if 64701, MO is east of 40175, KY.

      Folsom, LA (zip code 70444) and Wytheville, VA (zip code 22936, though the zip
      code is technically 24382).  The zip code 22936 corresponds to Crozet, Virginia,
      which is also east of Wytheville. For simplicity and since the question provides
      the zip code, let''s use Crozet, VA (22936).


      2. **Determine the relative positions:** We need to know if Folsom, LA is east
      of Crozet, VA.


      3. **Consider their general locations:** Louisiana is a state in the southern
      US, generally located west of the Mississippi River. Virginia is a state on
      the Atlantic coast of the US.


      4. **Compare longitudes:** To be definitively east, a location must have a higher
      (less negative) longitude than the other location. Without looking up the exact
      coordinates, based on their general state locations, Louisiana is significantly
      further west than Virginia.


      5. **Conclusion based on general location:** Since Louisiana is west of Virginia,
      Folsom, LA will be west of Crozet, VA.


      6. **Confirm with a map or coordinates (optional but helpful):** A quick check
      shows that Folsom, LA is around 90 degrees West longitude, while Crozet, VA
      is around 78 degrees West longitude. A higher West longitude number means the
      location is further west.

      1.  Identify the two locations: 48219, MI (Detroit area, Michigan) and 06379,
      CT (Mystic/Stonington area, Connecticut).

      2.  To determine relative east/west position in the US, we need to compare their
      longitudes.

      3.  Michigan (especially the Detroit area) is located further west geographically
      within the continental US than Connecticut.

      4.  Specifically, the longitude of the 48219 area is approximately -83 degrees
      West.

      5.  The longitude of the 06379 area is approximately -71.9 degrees West.

      6.  Comparing the longitudes, -83 is further west than -71.9.

      7.  Therefore, 48219, MI is located west of 06379, CT.

      zip codes.

      79331 is in Littlefield, Texas.

      60137 is in Glen Ellyn, Illinois.


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographical positions of Texas and Illinois.
      Texas is located in the south-central United States, while Illinois is located
      in the Midwest.


      Step 3: Consider the general east-west orientation of Texas and Illinois. Illinois
      is generally located to the east of Texas.


      Step 4: Therefore, a location in Texas is generally located west of a location
      in Illinois.


      Step 5: Specifically, Littlefield, TX is located west of Glen Ellyn, IL.


      Step 6: The question asks if 79331, TX is located *east* of 60137, IL.

      in the South Central United States. Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest United States,
      significantly further east and north than Texas.

      3.  **Compare the relative locations:** Illinois is geographically located to
      the east of Texas.

      4.  **Apply to the specific zip codes:** Since Illinois is east of Texas, any
      location within Illinois will generally be east of any location within Texas
      (ignoring minor local variations within the states, which are irrelevant given
      the large distance between them).

      5.  **Formulate the answer:** The question asks if the Texas zip code (79331)
      is *east* of the Illinois zip code (60137). Based on the relative positions
      of the states, 79331, TX is *west* of 60137, IL. Therefore, 79331, TX is *not*

      2.  **Determine the state of each zip code:** 79331 is in Texas (TX). 60137
      is in Illinois (IL).


      3.  **Determine the general geographic position of each state within the US:**
      Texas is generally in the South Central part of the US. Illinois is generally
      in the Midwest part of the US.


      4.  **Compare the relative longitude of the two states:** Illinois is significantly
      further east than Texas.


      5.  **Infer the relative longitude of the specific zip codes:** Since the states
      themselves have a clear east-west relationship (Illinois is east of Texas),
      the specific locations within those states will generally follow that relationship,
      especially given the large geographic separation between the states. A specific
      point in Texas will almost certainly be west of a specific point in Illinois.


      6.  **Formulate the question:** Is 79331, TX located *east* of 60137, IL?

      the general knowledge that Texas is overwhelmingly west of Illinois. Even the
      easternmost parts of Texas are west of the westernmost parts of Illinois.

      5.  **Compare the locations:** Since Illinois is located generally northeast
      of Texas, any location within Texas will be west of essentially any location
      within Illinois. Therefore, 79331, TX is located west of 60137, IL.

      continental United States. Florida is in the southeastern US, and New Hampshire
      is in the northeastern US.

      3.  Mentally or visually place these states on a map of the US. New Hampshire
      is significantly further north than Florida.

      4.  Determine the relative east/west position. Both states are on the Atlantic
      coast. However, due to the curvature of the North American coastline, the coastline
      of Florida is generally further west than the coastline of New Hampshire. Specifically,
      points in central or northern Florida (where 32095 is located) are typically
      west of points in southern New Hampshire (where 03079 is located).

      29067, SC (South Carolina).

      2.  **Identify the second zip code and state:** 10457, NY (New York).

      3.  **Determine the approximate location of South Carolina:** South Carolina
      is in the Southeastern US, on the Atlantic coast.

      4.  **Determine the approximate location of New York:** New York is in the Northeastern
      US, also on the Atlantic coast. Specifically, the 104xx zip codes are in the
      Bronx, New York City.

      5.  **Compare the longitudinal positions:** While both states are on the East
      Coast, South Carolina is generally further south than New York. When comparing
      locations on the same coast, further south often means further west in terms
      of longitude (the coast curves inward as you go north). However, the key is
      relative longitude. The US is generally arranged such that states further east
      have smaller longitudes (closer to the prime meridian).

      6.  **Consider the relative positions:** New York City (where 10457 is located)
      is significantly further *north* than South Carolina. When comparing points
      on the US East Coast, points further north are generally further *east* in longitude
      than points further south.

      7.  **Conclusion:** New York City is located further east in longitude than
      South Carolina. Therefore, 29067, SC is located west of 10457, NY.

      4.  **Compare the positions of FL and NJ:** New Jersey is further north along\

      \ of the continental US.\n5.  **Focus on the \"east of\" relationship:** To\
      \ be \"east of\" something, you must be located at a longitude further to the\
      \ east (closer to the Prime Meridian relative to the other location).\n6.  **Compare\

      \ easternmost point of the continental US is in Maine, followed by areas further\
      \ south along the coast. Areas further south and west along the coast (like\
      \ Florida) are generally *west* of areas further north and east along the coast\

      \ longitude around -80.2 degrees West.\n    *   A location within 08620, NJ\
      \ (like Ewing, NJ) has a longitude around -74.7 degrees West.\n8.  **Compare\

      code.

      34994 is in Florida (FL).

      08620 is in New Jersey (NJ).


      Step 2: Determine the approximate geographic location of Florida and New Jersey
      within the United States.

      Florida is a peninsula in the southeastern United States.

      New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions of the two states. Generally, states
      in the southeastern US are further west than states in the northeastern US,
      though there is overlap. However, to be more precise, we need to consider the
      specific locations within the states.


      Step 4: Determine the approximate location associated with each zip code within
      its state.

      34994 is in the Port St. Lucie area of Florida. This is on the Atlantic coast
      of Florida.

      08620 is in the Trenton area of New Jersey. This is in central New Jersey.


      Step 5: Compare the longitudinal positions of Port St. Lucie, FL and Trenton,
      NJ.

      Port St. Lucie, FL is located around longitude 80.3 degrees West.

      Trenton, NJ is located around longitude 74.7 degrees West.


      Step 6: A location is considered "east" of another location if its longitude
      is a smaller (less negative) number when using degrees West. 80.3 degrees West
      is a larger number than 74.7 degrees West. Therefore, 34994 (Port St. Lucie,
      FL) is located *west* of 08620 (Trenton, NJ).


      Step 7: The question asks if 34994, FL is located east of 08620, NJ. Based on
      the comparison in Step 6, it is not.


      Step 8: Formulate the final YES or NO answer.

      \ become *larger* (further from 0 or the prime meridian) as you move west.\n\
      - 84.38\xB0 W is a larger value than 74.28\xB0 W.\n\nStep 4: Interpret the comparison\

      2.  Determine the relative geographical positions of North Dakota and Texas.
      North Dakota is in the Upper Midwest/Great Plains region, significantly north
      of Texas, which is in the Southern United States.

      3.  Visualize or recall the map of the United States. North Dakota is located
      to the north and somewhat west of the central part of the US. Texas is located
      to the south and somewhat central to the southern border of the US.

      4.  Consider the general east-west position of these states. North Dakota is
      generally west of the Mississippi River and further west than much of the eastern
      half of the US. Texas spans a wide longitudinal range, but its general position
      is west of states like Louisiana, Arkansas, and further west than the eastern
      seaboard states.

      5.  Compare the longitudes. While specific zip code longitudes are not strictly
      necessary for a general comparison of states, it''s clear that North Dakota
      lies significantly further north than Texas. More importantly for the east-west
      question, North Dakota''s western border is further west than much of Texas''s
      eastern half, and its eastern border is roughly aligned with or slightly west
      of the central US. Texas extends far to the west, but also has a significant
      eastern portion.

      6.  The question asks if 58501 (ND) is located *east* of 77362 (TX). Since North
      Dakota is located significantly *north* of Texas, and their general east-west
      positions place ND either directly north of parts of Texas or slightly to the
      west depending on the specific locations within the states, it is clear that
      North Dakota, and thus 58501, is not located *east* of Texas, and thus not east

      is in the Upper Midwest, and Texas is in the South/Southwest.

      3. **Consider the typical north-south and east-west layout of the contiguous

      States further east are generally to the right of states further west on a standard

      4. **Compare the relative positions:** North Dakota is significantly north of
      Texas. While there''s a large east-west span across the US, North Dakota is
      situated more to the central/northern part of the country, and Texas is more
      to the central/southern part.

      5. **Reason about east-west position:** To determine if ND is east of TX, you
      need to consider their longitudinal positions. While specific zip code locations
      within the states matter for precise detail, examining the states as a whole
      is sufficient for this general comparison. North Dakota is generally situated

      GA. A quick search reveals that 30534 corresponds to Flowery Branch, Georgia.


      Step 2: Determine the location of 20121, VA. A quick search reveals that 20121
      corresponds to Centreville, Virginia.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions of Flowery Branch, GA and Centreville,
      VA. Flowery Branch, GA is located at approximately 34.27 degrees North latitude
      and 83.92 degrees West longitude. Centreville, VA is located at approximately
      38.84 degrees North latitude and 77.47 degrees West longitude.


      Step 4: To be east of another location in the Western Hemisphere, a location
      must have a smaller absolute value of its West longitude (or a more easterly
      longitude).


      Step 5: Comparing the longitudes: -83.92 degrees West for Flowery Branch and
      -77.47 degrees West for Centreville. Since -77.47 is greater than -83.92, Centreville
      is further east than Flowery Branch.

      4.  **Consider longitude:** To be "east" of another location, you generally
      need to have a higher longitude value (or less negative, depending on the convention,
      but essentially further east). Florida is geographically located further west
      than the majority of New York state.

      5.  **Specific locations within states (optional but confirms):** While specific
      zip code locations can vary slightly within a state, Florida''s westernmost

      asks about the relative location of zip code 76210 in Texas (TX) and zip code
      61611 in Illinois (IL).

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Texas is a large state
      in the south-central part of the United States. Illinois is in the Midwest,
      north of the south-central region.

      3.  **Compare the general east-west positions of the states:** Illinois is generally
      located significantly east of Texas.

      4.  **Consider potential edge cases:** While zip codes can be small areas, the
      overall geographic positions of states are generally consistent. It''s highly
      improbable that a small area within a state located significantly west of another
      state would be located east of an area within the eastern state.

      5.  **Conclusion based on state locations:** Since Illinois is located significantly
      east of Texas, any location within Texas will be located west of any location
      within Illinois. Therefore, 76210, TX is located west of 61611, IL.

      6.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if 76210, TX is *east*

      code.

      48069 is in Michigan (MI).

      11218 is in New York (NY).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographical location of Michigan and New York
      relative to each other.

      Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States, west of the
      Appalachian Mountains.

      New York is located in the Northeastern region of the United States, on the

      1.  **Understand the question:** The question asks if the location represented
      by zip code 48069 in Michigan is geographically to the east of the location
      represented by zip code 11218 in New York.


      2.  **Determine the relevant geographic feature for comparison:** To determine
      east/west relationships, we need to compare longitudes. Longitude lines run
      north-south and measure distance east or west of the Prime Meridian (0 degrees
      longitude). Locations further east have higher (or less negative) longitude
      values, and locations further west have lower (or more negative) longitude values.


      3.  **Find the approximate location of 48069, MI:** 48069 is a zip code in Royal
      Oak, Michigan. Royal Oak is located in the Detroit metropolitan area. Michigan
      is in the Eastern Time Zone, but its western border is roughly around 88 degrees
      West longitude, and its eastern edge is around 82 degrees West longitude. Royal
      Oak is closer to the eastern edge.


      4.  **Find the approximate location of 11218, NY:** 11218 is a zip code in Brooklyn,
      New York City. New York City is on the eastern coast of the United States. New
      York is also in the Eastern Time Zone, but is significantly further east than
      Michigan. New York City is roughly around 74 degrees West longitude.


      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** Royal Oak, MI (48069) is roughly around 83 degrees
      West longitude. Brooklyn, NY (11218) is roughly around 74 degrees West longitude.


      6.  **Interpret the comparison:** A longitude of -83 degrees is further west
      than a longitude of -74 degrees (or 83 degrees West is further west than 74
      degrees West).


      7.  **Formulate the answer:** Since 48069, MI is located at a longitude further

      \n2.  **Identify the Core Information Needed:** To determine if one location\
      \ is east of another, we need to compare their longitudes. Longitude lines run\
      \ north-south. Locations with *lower* (more negative) longitude values are west\
      \ of locations with *higher* (less negative) longitude values.\n\n3.  **Find\
      \ the Locations Corresponding to the Zip Codes:**\n    *   77340, TX\n    *\
      \   30342, GA\n\n4.  **Determine the Latitude and Longitude for Each Location:**\
      \ This requires looking up the geographic coordinates associated with these\
      \ zip codes. I would use a reliable online tool or database for this.\n\n  \
      \  *   Looking up 77340, TX: The approximate centroid is around 30.07 degrees\
      \ North latitude and -95.19 degrees West longitude.\n    *   Looking up 30342,\
      \ GA: This is a zip code in Atlanta. The approximate centroid is around 33.88\
      \ degrees North latitude and -84.35 degrees West longitude.\n\n5.  **Compare\
      \ the Longitudes:**\n    *   Longitude of 77340, TX: -95.19 degrees\n    * \
      \  Longitude of 30342, GA: -84.35 degrees\n\n6.  **Analyze the Comparison:**\n\
      \    *   -95.19 is a *lower* (more negative) number than -84.35.\n    *   Lower\
      \ (more negative) longitudes are further *west*.\n    *   Higher (less negative)\
      \ longitudes are further *east*.\n\n7.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Since\
      \ the longitude of 77340 (-95.19) is lower (more negative) than the longitude\
      \ of 30342 (-84.35), 77340 is located *west* of 30342.\n\n8.  **Address the\
      \ Original Question:** The question asks if 77340 is *east* of 30342. Based\
      \ on the comparison, it is *west*.\n\n9.  **Provide the Final YES/NO Answer:**\
      \ Since the answer to \"Is 77340, TX located east of 30342, GA?\" is no, the\
      \ final answer is NO.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  Identify the locations\
      \ by zip code and state.\n2.  Understand that \"east of\" requires comparing\
      \ longitudes.\n3.  Look up the approximate longitude for each zip code.\n4.\

      \ 2: 07440, New Jersey (NJ)\n    *   The question is about relative geographic\
      \ location: Is the first location *east of* the second location?\n\n2.  **Determine\
      \ the general locations of the states:**\n    *   Alabama (AL) is a state in\
      \ the southeastern United States.\n    *   New Jersey (NJ) is a state in the\
      \ northeastern United States.\n\n3.  **Visualize or recall the relative positions\
      \ of AL and NJ on a map of the US:**\n    *   New Jersey is on the East Coast.\n\

      \ area of northeastern Alabama.\n    *   07440 is in the Oakland/Franklin Lakes\
      \ area of northern New Jersey.\n\n5.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine\
      \ which is east or west of the other, we need to think about longitude.\n  \
      \  *   Locations with higher (less negative) longitudes are further east.\n\
      \    *   Locations with lower (more negative) longitudes are further west.\n\
      \    *   New Jersey is on the East Coast, meaning its longitude is significantly\
      \ further east (less negative) than Alabama, which is much further inland and\
      \ to the west.\n\n6.  **Formulate the comparison:** Since New Jersey is located\
      \ much further east than Alabama, any point in Alabama will be located west\
      \ of any point in New Jersey.\n\n7.  **Apply the comparison to the specific\
      \ question:** The question asks if 35954 (AL) is *east of* 07440 (NJ). Since\
      \ Alabama is west of New Jersey, 35954 (AL) is *west* of 07440 (NJ).\n\n8. \

      asks about the relative locations of 75025, TX and 55043, MN.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Texas (TX) is a southern
      state in the US. Minnesota (MN) is a northern state in the US.

      3.  **Consider the typical layout of the US:** The US is generally oriented
      such that states further south are below states further north.

      4.  **Visualize the relative positions:** If you imagine a map, Texas is significantly
      south of Minnesota.

      5.  **Focus on the East/West comparison:** The question asks if the Texas location
      is *east* of the Minnesota location.

      6.  **Compare the longitudes (implicitly):** While we don''t need the exact
      longitudes, we know that Minnesota is generally more centrally located *north-south*
      compared to Texas. More importantly, when comparing east-west, looking at the
      overall shape and common understanding of US geography, Texas stretches further
      west than the *eastern* part of Minnesota, and Minnesota is generally more centrally
      located north-south relative to Texas. However, the key is the north-south separation.
      A location in Texas is primarily *south* of a location in Minnesota.

      7.  **Consider the question "east of":** For Texas to be east of Minnesota,
      you would have to travel west from Texas to reach Minnesota. This is clearly
      not the case. You travel north from Texas to reach Minnesota.

      8.  **Conclusion based on relative state positions:** Since Texas is primarily
      south of Minnesota, a location in Texas cannot be *east* of a location in Minnesota
      in the geographical sense being asked.

      \ Denver, CO and Fort Worth, TX.\n    *   Denver, CO is located in the Rocky\
      \ Mountain region of the US.\n    *   Fort Worth, TX is located in North Texas.\n\
      \n6.  **Visualize or Consult a Map:** I can visualize the locations on a mental\
      \ map of the US or look at an actual map.\n    *   Colorado is generally west\
      \ of Texas when looking at the central US. Denver is in the eastern part of\
      \ Colorado, but Colorado itself is further west than Texas.\n    *   Fort Worth\
      \ is in the eastern part of Texas (relative to the whole state's width, though\
      \ it's in North Texas).\n\n7.  **Determine Relative Longitude:**\n    *   Denver's\
      \ approximate longitude is around 105\xB0 West.\n    *   Fort Worth's approximate\
      \ longitude is around 97\xB0 West.\n    *   A location is *east* of another\
      \ if its longitude is *closer to 0* (or less negative, if using negative values\
      \ for West).\n    *   -105 is *more negative* (further west) than -97.\n   \
      \ *   Therefore, Fort Worth (97\xB0 W) is east of Denver (105\xB0 W). Conversely,\
      \ Denver (105\xB0 W) is west of Fort Worth (97\xB0 W).\n\n8.  **Answer the Question:**\
      \ The question asks if 80237 (Denver) is EAST of 76114 (Fort Worth). Based on\
      \ the longitude comparison, Denver is WEST of Fort Worth.\n\n9.  **Formulate\
      \ the Final Answer (YES/NO):** Since Denver is west of Fort Worth, the answer\
      \ to the question \"Is 80237, CO located east of 76114, TX?\" is NO.\n\n10.\
      \ **Final Check:** Reread the question and my reasoning. The question is clear.\
      \ The steps identified the locations and compared their east/west positions\
      \ using longitude/geographic knowledge. The conclusion directly answers the\

      \ associated with the zip codes:\n    *   80237 is a zip code in Denver, Colorado.\n\
      \    *   76114 is a zip code in Fort Worth, Texas.\n2.  Determine the relative\
      \ geographic positions of Denver, CO and Fort Worth, TX.\n3.  Denver, CO is\
      \ located in the Mountain Time Zone and is situated near the Rocky Mountains.\n\
      4.  Fort Worth, TX is located in the Central Time Zone and is situated in North\
      \ Texas.\n5.  Comparing the locations on a map of the United States, Colorado\
      \ is generally west of Texas. Specifically, Denver is significantly further\
      \ west in longitude than Fort Worth.\n6.  Therefore, Denver (80237) is located\
      \ west of Fort Worth (76114).\n\nBased on this, 80237, CO is NOT located east\
      \ of 76114, TX.\n\nNO"

      \ zip code within a state be an outlier?\n    *   Texas is very wide. Could\
      \ the easternmost part of Texas be east of the westernmost part of Indiana?\

      by "TX") and zip code 46567 (which is in Indiana, as indicated by "IN").


      2. **Determine general geographic positions:** Texas is a state in the south-central
      United States. Indiana is a state in the Midwest United States.


      3. **Compare relative positions:** Generally, states in the Midwest are located
      east of states in the south-central US. Looking at a map of the United States
      confirms that Indiana is located significantly east of Texas.


      4. **Consider the specific zip codes:** While general state locations are helpful,
      we are comparing *specific* zip codes. However, since the states are so far
      apart geographically, it is highly unlikely that a specific location within
      Texas would be east of a specific location within Indiana. Zip codes within

      further south, its longitude is generally further west than New Jersey''s.


      4.  **Consider potential edge cases within the states:** While the states as
      a whole have a general east/west relationship, it''s possible that a specific
      location within a state could be geographically positioned differently relative
      to a specific location in the other state. However, considering the overall
      shape and position of the states, it is highly likely that any point in Virginia
      will be west of any point in New Jersey.

      \ 2's location?\n\n3.  **Recall or Determine the Locations:**\n    *   Where\
      \ is 55904? I know it's in Minnesota. A quick search or internal knowledge base\
      \ confirms 55904 is Rochester, MN.\n    *   Where is 32579? I know it's in Florida.\
      \ A quick search or internal knowledge base confirms 32579 is Niceville, FL.\n\
      \n4.  **Compare the Locations Geographically:**\n    *   I have two points:\
      \ Rochester, MN and Niceville, FL.\n    *   I need to determine their relative\
      \ east-west positions.\n    *   Visualize the United States map.\n    *   Locate\

      \ relative positions of Rochester, MN and Niceville, FL on a map or by considering\
      \ their longitudes.\nStep 3: Rochester, MN is located in southeastern Minnesota.\
      \ Niceville, FL is located in the Florida panhandle.\nStep 4: Florida is generally\
      \ further east than much of Minnesota. Specifically, Niceville, FL is at a longitude\
      \ of approximately 86.5 degrees West, while Rochester, MN is at a longitude\
      \ of approximately 92.5 degrees West.\nStep 5: A location with a smaller (less\
      \ negative in the western hemisphere) longitude is east of a location with a\
      \ larger (more negative) longitude. Since -86.5 is greater than -92.5, Niceville,\
      \ FL is east of Rochester, MN.\nStep 6: The question asks if 55904, MN (Rochester)\
      \ is *east* of 32579, FL (Niceville). Based on the comparison, Rochester is\
