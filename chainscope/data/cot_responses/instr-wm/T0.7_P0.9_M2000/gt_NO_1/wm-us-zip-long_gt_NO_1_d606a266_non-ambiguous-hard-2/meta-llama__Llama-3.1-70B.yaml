      east of 11572, NY, we need to consider the relative positions of North Carolina
      and New York. Here are the steps:


      1. **Identify the states**: 27604 is located in North Carolina (NC), and 11572
      is located in New York (NY).


      2. **Understand general geographical positions**: North Carolina is located
      in the southeastern part of the United States, while New York is in the northeastern
      part.


      3. **Compare east-west positions**: North Carolina is located to the south and

      (CO).

      2. **Understand east-west directions**: When we talk about east and west, we
      are referring to the cardinal directions. East is the direction to the right
      when facing north, and west is the direction to the left when facing north.

      3. **Determine the general locations of the states**: Arizona is located in
      the southwestern United States, while Colorado is in the western-central part
      of the country.

      4. **Compare the states'' locations**: Arizona is west of Colorado, which means
      that any point in Arizona is west of any point in Colorado.
