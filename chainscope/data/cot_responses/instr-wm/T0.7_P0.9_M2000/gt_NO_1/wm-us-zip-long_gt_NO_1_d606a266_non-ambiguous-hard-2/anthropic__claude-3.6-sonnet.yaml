      2) Looking at their relative positions:

      - Waukegan, IL is on the western shore of Lake Michigan

      - Toronto, OH is in eastern Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border


      3) When comparing their positions:

      - Illinois is west of Ohio

      - Therefore, any point in Illinois (including Waukegan) must be west of any
      point in Ohio (including Toronto)

      1. First, let me identify these locations:

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      2. Looking at ZIP code patterns:

      - ZIP codes starting with 0 are in New England

      - ZIP codes starting with 1 are generally in PA, NY area


      3. Specifically:

      - 01810 is in Andover, Massachusetts

      - 15468 is in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania


      4. Geographical relationship:

      - Massachusetts is in New England, on the east coast

      - Pennsylvania is southwest of Massachusetts

      - Any location in PA will be west of Massachusetts


      5. Therefore, Mount Pleasant, PA (15468) must be WEST of Andover, MA (01810),
      not east.


      Answer: NO'

      1) First, let me identify these locations:

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      2) Let me recall the zip code system:

      - First digit represents a certain geographical region

      - Lower numbers (0,1) are generally in the northeast

      - Higher numbers (1,2) are generally moving westward


      3) Looking at the specific codes:

      - 01810 starts with ''0'' which is New England region

      - 15468 starts with ''1'' which is Delaware/Pennsylvania/etc region


      4) Geographically:

      - Massachusetts is in New England, on the east coast

      - Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts


      5) Therefore, since 15468 is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is WEST of Massachusetts
      (where 01810 is), the answer is NO.


      NO'

      3) Looking at general zip code geography:

      - 20xxx codes are in the DC/MD/VA area

      - 30xxx codes are in Georgia


      4) On a US map:

      - Virginia is on the east coast

      - Georgia is south of Virginia

      - Both states touch the Atlantic, but Virginia is clearly further east than
      Georgia


      5) Specifically:

      - 30534 is in Dahlonega, GA

      - 20121 is in Centreville, VA

      - Centreville, VA is closer to the Atlantic coast than Dahlonega, GA


      Therefore: NO, 30534 (Dahlonega, GA) is not east of 20121 (Centreville, VA)'

      location, 24486 VA cannot be east of 08221 NJ.


      NO'
    eb78c82b-1bab-459d-9b50-41cc7e324ae5: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) 24486 is in Virginia (VA)

      2) 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      3) In general:

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast

      - Virginia is inland from New Jersey, to the south and west


      4) More specifically:

      - NJ zip codes beginning with 08 are in southern New Jersey, near the coast

      - VA zip codes beginning with 244 are in the Shenandoah Valley region of western
      Virginia


      5) Therefore, 24486 VA is clearly WEST of 08221 NJ, not east of it.


      NO'
