      check shows this corresponds primarily to Anderson, Indiana.

      2.  **Identify the second location:** Zip code 08734 is in New Jersey (NJ).
      A quick check shows this corresponds primarily to Lakehurst, New Jersey.

      3.  **Compare the states'' locations:** Indiana is a state in the Midwestern
      United States. New Jersey is a state on the East Coast of the United States.

      4.  **Determine relative position:** Geographically, the East Coast (where New
      Jersey is located) is east of the Midwest (where Indiana is located).

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if the location in Indiana
      (46016) is *east* of the location in New Jersey (08734). Since Indiana is west
      of New Jersey, the location 46016, IN is *west* of 08734, NJ.


      Therefore, the statement "46016, IN located east of 08734, NJ" is incorrect.

      Chester/Chesterfield, which are suburbs of Richmond, Virginia.

      3.  **Compare the general east-west positions of Ohio and Virginia:** Ohio is
      located generally to the west of Virginia.

      4.  **Compare the specific locations:** Dayton, Ohio is significantly west of
      Richmond, Virginia. You would travel east from Dayton to reach Richmond.

      5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if 45439 (Ohio) is *east* of
      23834 (Virginia). Based on the geography, 45439 is *west* of 23834.

    ca9af150-ebf5-4d3e-9bb5-e6011b304e27: 'Okay, let''s break this down:


      1.  **Identify the location of 21209, MD:** This zip code corresponds to parts
      of Baltimore and Pikesville in Maryland.

      2.  **Identify the location of 03303, NH:** This zip code corresponds to Concord,
      New Hampshire.

      3.  **Compare their East-West positions:** Maryland is located geographically
      southwest of New Hampshire. Concord, NH is significantly further east (closer
      to the Atlantic coast at that latitude and having a smaller West longitude value)
      than Baltimore, MD.

      4.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if the Maryland location
      (21209) is *east* of the New Hampshire location (03303). Since New Hampshire
      is east of Maryland, the Maryland location is *west* of the New Hampshire location.

    df3a6053-f893-440b-9525-e5a998f41184: 'Okay, let''s break this down:


      1.  **Identify the states:** 33330 is in Florida (FL) and 06712 is in Connecticut
      (CT).

      2.  **Locate the states geographically:** Florida is in the southeastern United
      States. Connecticut is in the northeastern United States.

      3.  **Determine relative longitude:** On a map of the United States, the East
      Coast runs roughly northeast to southwest. Connecticut is significantly further
      north and also further east than Florida. Locations further east have smaller
      negative longitude values (or larger positive ones if measured differently,
      but in the US, they are typically West longitude).

      4.  **Compare:** Connecticut (CT) is located east of Florida (FL).

      5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if the Florida location (33330)
      is east of the Connecticut location (06712). Since Connecticut is east of Florida,
      Florida must be west of Connecticut.


      Therefore, the statement "33330, FL is located east of 06712, CT" is incorrect.
