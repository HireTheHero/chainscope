      2. **General US geography:** Illinois is generally west of Ohio.

      3. **Specific zip code relevance:**  Zip codes within a state further east will
      have higher values (generally).  Since Illinois is west of Ohio, this reinforces
      the idea that a zip code in Illinois is unlikely to be east of one in Ohio.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

      NY''s longitude will be in the 70s West.  NC''s longitude will be in the 70s
      or 80s West.  A higher number for West longitude means further West.


      Therefore, we need to look up the longitudes.  A quick search shows:


      * 27604 (Raleigh, NC) is approximately -78.6 West

      * 11572 (Woodbury, NY) is approximately -73.5 West

      positioning of the zip codes within their respective states wouldn''t be enough
      to offset the large east/west difference between the states.

      -77.5 degrees longitude, and 11239, NY is approximately -73.9 degrees longitude.


      5. **Interpret the results:** More negative longitude values are further west.

      United States. 10958 corresponds to New City, New York, which is also in the
      Eastern United States.


      2. **Determine relative east/west positions:**  North Carolina is generally
      south and slightly east of New York.


      3. **Consider the specific locations:** While NC is generally east of much of
      NY, New City (10958) is located on the western side of the Hudson River which
      places it further west in relation to Durham (27705).

      on the East Coast but further north.

      2. **Consider east vs. west within the US:**  Longitude increases as you go
      west.  Since both states are on the East Coast, we need to determine which one
      is further east.

      3. **Relative location of NC and NY:** North Carolina is south and slightly
      *west* of New York.

      4. **Conclusion:** 27705, NC is *west* of 10958, NY.

      2. **Determine relative east/west positions:**  North Carolina is generally
      south and east of New York.  However, since both locations are on the East Coast,
      we need to be more precise.


      3. **Consider longitude:**  Longitude is the key factor in determining east/west
      position.  A location further east will have a lower (more negative) longitude
      value.  We need to find the longitude of each zip code.  (A quick online search
      will provide this information).


      4. **Compare longitude values:** Durham, NC (27705) is approximately -78.9 degrees
      longitude. Pomona, NY (10958) is approximately -74.1 degrees longitude.


      5. **Analyze comparison:** -78.9 is a lower value than -74.1.


      6. **Conclusion:** Since Durham, NC has a lower longitude value, it is further
      east than Pomona, NY.

      24486 is in Monterey, VA, in the western part of the state. 08221 is in Brigantine,
      NJ, near the coast.

      and NJ is New Jersey.

      2. **General US Geography:** Virginia is south of New Jersey.  The question
      asks about East/West.

      3. **East Coast Geography:**  Both states are on the East Coast.  Longitude
      increases as you move West.

      4. **Specifics aren''t needed:** Since Virginia is south of New Jersey, any
      location in Virginia will be west of any location in New Jersey on the East
      Coast.  We don''t need to look up the specific zip codes.

      2. **General US Geography:** Virginia is south of New Jersey.  However, the
      question is about East/West.

      3. **East Coast Geography:**  Both states are on the East Coast.  States generally
      run north-south. Therefore, a location in Virginia would be generally west of
      a location in New Jersey due to the curvature of the coastline.

      4. **Specific zip codes aren''t necessary with this general knowledge:**  Due
      to the north-south orientation of the states on the east coast, any location
      in Virginia will be west of any location in New Jersey.

      states:** Virginia (VA) is on the East Coast, and New Jersey (NJ) is also on
      the East Coast.

      2. **Determine relative positions:** Virginia is south of New Jersey.

      3. **Consider longitude:**  Since both states are on the East Coast, the further
      east a location is, the higher its longitude.

      4. **East vs. West is determined by longitude, not latitude:**  While Virginia
      is south of New Jersey, the question asks about East/West.

      5. **We need to know if the Virginia zip code is further east (higher longitude)
      than the New Jersey zip code.** While generally locations in VA might be west
      of locations in NJ, it''s not a guarantee.  We need more information than just
      the states.


      Therefore, I cannot answer YES or NO without looking up the longitude of each
      zip code.

      2. **General US Geography:** Virginia is south of New Jersey.  The question
      asks about East/West.

      3. **East Coast Geography:** Both states are on the East Coast.  Longitude increases
      as you go West.  Therefore, a location further east will have a *lower* longitude.

      4. **Need for more information:**  Zip codes alone don''t tell us longitude.
      We need to look up the locations.  However, since both locations are on the
      East Coast and relatively close to each other latitudinally, the difference
      in longitude will likely be the deciding factor.  A location further east will
      be further out into the Atlantic Ocean.  Virginia is generally west of New Jersey.

      5. **Conclusion:**  24486, VA is very likely west of 08221, NJ.
