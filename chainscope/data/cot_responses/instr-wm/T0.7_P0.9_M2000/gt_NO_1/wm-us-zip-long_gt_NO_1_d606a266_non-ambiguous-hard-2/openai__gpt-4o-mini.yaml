      \ - The ZIP code 80130 corresponds to an area in Parker, Colorado.\n\n2. **Check\
      \ the States**:\n   - Arizona (AZ) is located to the southwest of Colorado (CO).\n\
      \n3. **Geographical Orientation**:\n   - When considering the overall orientation\
      \ of the two locations, Arizona is generally to the south and slightly west\
      \ of Colorado.\n   - Specifically, Scottsdale, AZ (85255) is located south of\
      \ Parker, CO (80130).\n\n4. **Comparing Longitudes**:\n   - The longitude of\
      \ Scottsdale, AZ is approximately 111.9\xB0 W.\n   - The longitude of Parker,\
      \ CO is approximately 104.8\xB0 W.\n   - Since longitudes increase as you move\
      \ eastward, a location with a higher longitude is further east.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Given that Scottsdale, AZ (85255) has a longitude of 111.9\xB0 W and Parker,\
      \ CO (80130) has a longitude of 104.8\xB0 W, Scottsdale is actually further\
      \ west than Parker.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is NO."

      1. **Locate 67037, KS**: The zip code 67037 corresponds to the city of Derby,
      Kansas. Kansas is generally located in the central part of the United States.


      2. **Locate 55404, MN**: The zip code 55404 corresponds to an area in Minneapolis,
      Minnesota. Minnesota is located in the northern part of the United States, north

      1. **Locate 42431, KY**: This ZIP code is in the state of Kentucky. Specifically,
      it is in the western part of Kentucky.


      2. **Locate 18951, PA**: This ZIP code is in Pennsylvania, specifically in the
      eastern part of the state, near the New Jersey border.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Kentucky is generally situated to the
      south of Pennsylvania. Since 42431 is in western Kentucky and 18951 is in eastern
      Pennsylvania, we can deduce that 42431 is not only south of 18951 but also west
      of it.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 42431, KY is located to the west of 18951, PA, it cannot
