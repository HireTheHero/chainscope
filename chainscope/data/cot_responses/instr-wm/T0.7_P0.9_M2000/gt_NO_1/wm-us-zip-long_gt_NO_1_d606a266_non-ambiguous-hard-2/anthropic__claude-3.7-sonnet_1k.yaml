      whether a zip code in Illinois (60087) is east of a zip code in Ohio (43952).


      Let me think about the geographic layout of these states. In the US, Ohio is
      east of Illinois. Illinois borders the western part of Ohio. So generally speaking,
      locations in Ohio tend to be east of locations in Illinois.


      But I need to be more specific about these particular zip codes. Let me consider:


      1. 60087 is in IL (Illinois)

      2. 43952 is in OH (Ohio)


      Since Ohio is east of Illinois, typically a location in Illinois (like 60087)
      would be west of a location in Ohio (like 43952), not east of it.


      However, I should be careful because:

      - States can have irregular shapes

      - Zip codes in the eastern part of Illinois could potentially be east of zip
      codes in the western part of Ohio


      But given the general geography of these states, it''s highly unlikely that
      a zip code in Illinois would be east of a zip code in Ohio. Illinois is west
      of Ohio on the map of the United States.</think># Is 60087, IL located east
      of 43952, OH?


      To solve this, I need to consider the geographic positions of these zip codes
      and their states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 60087 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Illinois and Ohio

      Illinois is located directly west of Ohio in the United States. Ohio''s western
      border connects with Illinois''s eastern border.


      ## Step 3: Determine the relative positions

      Since Illinois is west of Ohio, any location in Illinois (including zip code
      60087) would be west of locations in Ohio (including zip code 43952), not east.


      ## Conclusion

      NO, 60087, IL is not located east of 43952, OH. It is located west of it.'

      60087 in Illinois is located east of zip code 43952 in Ohio.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Figure out where 60087, IL is located (what city/town)

      2. Figure out where 43952, OH is located (what city/town)

      3. Compare their positions on a map to determine if the Illinois location is
      east of the Ohio location


      First, let''s think about the general geography of Illinois and Ohio. Ohio is
      generally east of Illinois. The two states are not adjacent - Indiana lies between
      them. So typically, locations in Ohio would be east of locations in Illinois.
      But I need to check the specific zip codes to be sure.


      Zip code 60087 is in Illinois. It''s likely in the northeastern part of Illinois,
      possibly in the Chicago metro area, since Chicago area codes often start with
      606xx.


      Zip code 43952 is in Ohio. Ohio zip codes starting with 43xxx are often in the
      central to eastern parts of the state.


      Given that Illinois is west of Ohio, and without specific information about
      these zip codes being unusual outliers, it would be unlikely that the Illinois
      zip code is east of the Ohio zip code. So my initial reasoning suggests the
      answer is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Analysis


      First, I need to determine the locations of these zip codes and their geographical
      relationship.


      ## Step 1: Geographic context of Illinois and Ohio

      Illinois is generally located west of Ohio, with Indiana between them. On a
      standard US map, Ohio is to the east of Illinois.


      ## Step 2: Specific zip code locations

      - 60087 is in Waukegan, Illinois, which is in the northeastern part of Illinois
      near Lake Michigan

      - 43952 is in Steubenville, Ohio, which is in the eastern part of Ohio, near
      the Pennsylvania border


      ## Step 3: Comparing their positions

      Since Illinois is west of Ohio, and these specific zip codes don''t represent
      any unusual geographic outliers that would change this relationship, the Illinois
      zip code (60087) must be west of the Ohio zip code (43952).


      # Answer: NO


      60087, IL is not located east of 43952, OH. It is located to the west.'
    6df9005d-b175-4f90-931c-6badbcfbd8a0: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      if a ZIP code in Illinois (60087) is located east of a ZIP code in Ohio (43952).


      Step 1: Let me identify where these ZIP codes are located.

      - 60087 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: I need to think about the relative geographical positions of Illinois
      and Ohio.

      Illinois is located west of Ohio in the United States. Illinois borders Ohio''s
      western neighbor (Indiana) on the east. So generally, locations in Illinois
      would be west of locations in Ohio.


      Step 3: Let me consider if there could be exceptions to this general rule.

      ZIP codes don''t always perfectly follow state boundaries, and states can have
      irregular shapes. However, Illinois is fully west of Ohio with no overlapping
      territories. Even the easternmost point of Illinois would still be west of the
      westernmost point of Ohio.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on geographical knowledge.

      Since Illinois is west of Ohio, a ZIP code in Illinois (60087) would be west
      of a ZIP code in Ohio (43952), not east.</think># Is 60087, IL located east
      of 43952, OH?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 60087 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of these states

      Illinois and Ohio are neighboring Midwestern states. However, they don''t directly
      border each other - Indiana lies between them.


      ## Step 3: Determine their relative positions

      Looking at a US map:

      - Illinois is located west of Indiana

      - Indiana is located west of Ohio

      - Therefore, Illinois is located west of Ohio


      ## Step 4: Apply this to the specific ZIP codes

      Since 60087 is in Illinois and 43952 is in Ohio, and Illinois is west of Ohio,
      this means that 60087 is located west of 43952, not east.

      To determine this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of these
      zip codes. In the US, generally speaking, states themselves follow some geographical
      patterns, but I''ll need to determine the specific locations of these zip codes.


      Let me think about the general geography first:

      - Illinois (IL) is generally west of Ohio (OH) since Ohio borders Pennsylvania
      to the east and Illinois is further west in the Midwest.

      - So just based on the state locations, I would expect that a zip code in Illinois
      would be WEST of a zip code in Ohio, not east.


      To be completely certain, I would normally look up the precise longitude coordinates
      of these zip codes, but since I need to answer based on my knowledge, I''ll
      go with the general geographical relationship between Illinois and Ohio.


      Illinois is west of Ohio in the United States. Therefore, a zip code in Illinois

      (OH) within the United States.


      2) Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region, bordering Pennsylvania

      3) Illinois is located in the Midwest region, west of Ohio, with Indiana between

      4) Since Illinois is positioned west of Ohio geographically, any zip code in
      Illinois (including 60087) would be west of any zip code in Ohio (including

      2. Illinois (IL) is generally west of Ohio (OH) in the United States.

      3. Ohio borders Lake Erie to the north and extends to the Ohio River in the
      south. It''s in the eastern part of the Midwest.

      4. Illinois is also in the Midwest but is further west, bordering the Mississippi
      River on its western border.


      Since Illinois is west of Ohio geographically, any location in Illinois would

      2) Ohio is located east of Illinois in the United States. Ohio borders Pennsylvania
      to its east, while Illinois is further west in the Midwest region.


      3) Since these states don''t have irregular borders that significantly interweave

      - 43952 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positioning of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest, along the western shore of Lake Michigan

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest, but positioned east of Illinois


      Step 3: Consider the directional relationship.

      - Illinois is generally west of Ohio

      - Ohio borders Illinois to the east

      - Moving from Illinois to Ohio means traveling eastward

      - Moving from Ohio to Illinois means traveling westward


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 60087 is in Illinois and 43952 is in Ohio, the Illinois zip code must
      be west of the Ohio zip code, not east of it.

      28403 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC).

      06250 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT).


      In the US, states along the East Coast are arranged roughly north-to-south.
      Connecticut is in the Northeast, while North Carolina is further south along
      the East Coast.


      When considering east/west positions, I need to think about longitude (east-west
      position). Generally, locations with similar distances from the Atlantic Ocean
      along the East Coast would have similar east-west positions, though there can
      be variations due to the coastline''s shape.


      The East Coast of the US curves slightly, with Connecticut being further inland
      compared to parts of North Carolina''s coast. North Carolina''s eastern portions
      (especially the Outer Banks) extend further east into the Atlantic Ocean than

      - 28403 is a zip code in Wilmington, North Carolina

      - 06250 is a zip code in Mansfield Center, Connecticut


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positioning

      - Mansfield Center, CT (06250) is located inland from the Connecticut coast

      - The East Coast curves inward as you move northeast from North Carolina to
      Connecticut


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      North Carolina''s coastal areas, including Wilmington, extend further east into
      the Atlantic than Connecticut''s position. This is because of the natural curve
      of the eastern seaboard.

      3. Compare their longitudinal coordinates (east-west position)


      Let me reason about this:


      28403 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC). North Carolina is on the east coast
      of the US, in the southeastern region.


      06250 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT). Connecticut is also on the east coast,
      but in the northeastern region.


      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - East = smaller longitude numbers

      - West = larger longitude numbers


      North Carolina is generally south of Connecticut, but that doesn''t tell us
      about the east-west positioning. Let me think about the general location of
      these states:


      Connecticut is in New England, on the northeastern coast.

      North Carolina is further south on the east coast.


      If you look at a map of the US east coast, you''ll notice it curves - the coastline
      runs roughly northeast to southwest. This means that as you move south along
      the coast, you also generally move westward.


      So North Carolina is likely to be slightly west of Connecticut, not east of
      it. This would mean 28403, NC is likely west of 06250, CT, not east of it.

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 28403 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 06250 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographical positions

      Both states are on the eastern seaboard of the US, but in different regions:

      - Connecticut is in the Northeast

      - North Carolina is in the Southeast


      ## Step 3: Analyze east-west positioning

      The US eastern coastline curves from northeast to southwest. When moving south
      along the coast from Connecticut to North Carolina, you also move slightly westward.


      ## Step 4: Compare longitudes

      Due to this coastline curvature, locations in North Carolina are generally west
      of locations in Connecticut, not east of them. North Carolina has greater longitude
      values (more westward) than Connecticut.

      to determine the relative east-west positioning of two zip codes: 29206 in South
      Carolina (SC) and 06438 in Connecticut (CT).


      Let me think about the geographic positions of these states:

      - South Carolina (SC) is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Connecticut (CT) is located in the northeastern United States, specifically
      in New England


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude), Connecticut is generally east
      of South Carolina. The eastern seaboard of the US runs roughly northeast to
      southwest, with New England states (including Connecticut) being further east
      than southeastern states (including South Carolina).


      To be precise, we should check the specific longitudes of these zip codes, but
      even without that specific data, we can be confident that a zip code in Connecticut
      would be east of a zip code in South Carolina, not the other way around.


      So the answer would be NO - 29206, SC is NOT located east of 06438, CT. Instead,
      06438, CT would be east of 29206, SC.</think>I need to determine whether 29206,

      Step 1: Let me identify the states.

      - 29206 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 06438 is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States (New England region)

      - South Carolina is located on the southeastern coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions (longitude).

      - While both states are on the eastern seaboard, Connecticut is positioned further
      northeast

      - Connecticut is generally east of South Carolina on a map of the United States

      - The US eastern coastline runs in a northeast-southwest direction, with New
      England states (including Connecticut) being further east than South Carolina


      NO, 29206, SC is not located east of 06438, CT. Connecticut is actually east
      of South Carolina.'

      In the United States, states in the east have lower zip codes, and states in
      the west have higher zip codes. However, this is only a general pattern and
      not an exact rule for determining relative east-west positions.


      Let me think about the geographic positions of Indiana and New Jersey:

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region


      Looking at a mental map of the US, New Jersey is definitely east of Indiana.
      The entire state of New Jersey is east of Indiana.


      So if 46016 is in Indiana and 08734 is in New Jersey, then 08734, NJ would be

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Looking at a US map, New Jersey is significantly east of Indiana. All of New
      Jersey is east of all of Indiana, regardless of the specific locations within
      those states.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since 46016 is in Indiana and 08734 is in New Jersey, and New Jersey is east

      to determine whether zip code 67218 in Kansas is located east of zip code 30354
      in Georgia.


      First, let me think about the geographic locations of Kansas (KS) and Georgia
      (GA) within the United States:

      - Kansas is located in the central part of the United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the United States


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Kansas. If we think about the U.S. map,
      Kansas is in the middle of the country, while Georgia is on the eastern coast.


      So if we''re asking if a Kansas zip code (67218) is east of a Georgia zip code
      (30354), the answer would almost certainly be NO, since Kansas is west of Georgia,
      not east.


      To be completely sure, we could look up the exact longitude coordinates of these
      zip codes, but based on the general geographic locations of these states, we
      can be confident that any location in Kansas would be west of (not east of)
      any location in Georgia.</think>To determine if 67218, KS is located east of
      30354, GA, I need to think about the geographic locations of these states.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions on the US map.

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the central United States

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 2: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned significantly to the
      east of Kansas

      - Moving east means moving toward the Atlantic Ocean, which is where Georgia
      is situated

      - Kansas is much farther inland and westward from Georgia


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Zip code 67218 is in Kansas, which means it shares Kansas''s western position

      - Zip code 30354 is in Georgia, which means it shares Georgia''s eastern position


      Since Kansas is west of Georgia (not east of it), zip code 67218 in Kansas must
      be west of (not east of) zip code 30354 in Georgia.

      to figure out the locations of two US ZIP codes and determine if one is east

      The ZIP codes in question are:

      1. 67218, KS (in Kansas)

      2. 30354, GA (in Georgia)


      First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of Kansas and Georgia
      in the US.

      - Kansas is located in the central part of the US

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the US


      On a US map, east is to the right, and west is to the left. Georgia is positioned
      to the east (right) of Kansas. So generally speaking, locations in Georgia would
      be east of locations in Kansas.


      Since 67218 is in Kansas and 30354 is in Georgia, it''s very likely that 30354,
      GA is east of 67218, KS.


      So the answer would be NO, 67218, KS is NOT located east of 30354, GA. Rather,

      Step 2: Recall the geographic locations of these states within the US.

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - On a US map, Georgia is clearly to the east of Kansas

      - All of Georgia is east of all of Kansas


      Step 4: Compare the specific ZIP codes.

      - Since 67218 is in Kansas and 30354 is in Georgia, and Georgia is east of Kansas,
      it follows that 30354, GA must be east of 67218, KS

      - Therefore, 67218, KS cannot be east of 30354, GA

      First, let me think about the geography of the United States. Kansas is in the
      central part of the country, while Georgia is in the southeastern part. Generally,
      Georgia is east of Kansas.


      So a zip code in Kansas (67218) would typically be west of a zip code in Georgia
      (30354), not east of it.


      To be thorough, I should consider the specific zip codes, but the general state

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 67218 is in Kansas (KS)

      - 30354 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Kansas is located in the central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning

      - Georgia is significantly east of Kansas on the US map

      - All locations in Kansas are west of nearly all locations in Georgia

      - The specific zip codes don''t change this fundamental geographic relationship


      Since Kansas is west of Georgia, zip code 67218 in Kansas must be west of (not
      east of) zip code 30354 in Georgia.

      I need to determine if the Kansas zip code is east of the Georgia zip code.


      Looking at the United States geography:

      - Kansas is located in the Midwest/Great Plains region of the United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Georgia is much further east than Kansas

      - Kansas is west of Georgia


      Since the question asks if the Kansas zip code (67218) is east of the Georgia

      We have two zip codes:

      1. 67218, KS (Kansas)

      2. 30354, GA (Georgia)


      The question is asking if the Kansas zip code is east of the Georgia zip code.


      To answer this, I need to understand the relative geographic positions of Kansas
      and Georgia in the United States.


      The United States is generally laid out with the east coast on the right (when
      looking at a map) and the west coast on the left. The state of Georgia is located
      in the southeastern part of the United States, along the Atlantic coast. The
      state of Kansas is located in the central part of the United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Georgia is significantly east of Kansas.
      This means that locations in Kansas would be west of locations in Georgia, not
      east.

      Kansas is located in the central United States, while Georgia is located in
      the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning

      Looking at a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned significantly to
      the east of Kansas. The eastern border of Kansas is still far west of Georgia''s
      western border.


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes

      1. Identify the locations of the two ZIP codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me work through this:


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 44627, OH is a ZIP code in Ohio

      - 28512, NC is a ZIP code in North Carolina


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions

      I need to think about the general geographic positions of Ohio and North Carolina
      in the United States.


      Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, while North Carolina is on the East
      Coast.


      Looking at a map of the US, Ohio is generally west of North Carolina. Ohio borders
      Pennsylvania to its east, and Pennsylvania borders states like New Jersey and
      Maryland, which are north of North Carolina.


      So if we look at the general positions, Ohio is to the west of North Carolina,
      not to the east.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States, while
      North Carolina is on the East Coast of the US.


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning

      Looking at a US map, Ohio is positioned to the west of North Carolina. The East
      Coast states (including North Carolina) are generally east of the Midwest states
      (including Ohio).


      Therefore, 44627, OH is located WEST of 28512, NC, not east of it.

      To solve this, I need to determine if the Ohio ZIP code is located east of the
      North Carolina ZIP code.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast


      Generally speaking, North Carolina is east of Ohio, not the other way around.
      This means that typically, a location in Ohio would be WEST of a location in

      Just to be completely sure, let me think about their positions more precisely.
      On a west-to-east arrangement:

      - Ohio is situated roughly in the middle-eastern part of the country

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, further east than Ohio

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states

      - North Carolina is located on the East Coast along the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - When looking at a US map, North Carolina is positioned to the east of Ohio

      - The states'' relative positions mean that locations in Ohio are generally
      west of locations in North Carolina


      Step 4: Make my conclusion based on the geographic relationship

      28512 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC).


      Geographically in the United States:

      - Ohio is generally in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast


      In terms of east-west positioning, North Carolina is generally east of Ohio.
      The eastern parts of the US are closer to the Atlantic Ocean, and North Carolina
      is a coastal state, while Ohio is more inland.


      So without even looking up the specific coordinates, I would expect that 28512,
      NC is east of 44627, OH. This means that 44627, OH is west of 28512, NC, not
      east of it.


      To be completely sure, I would need to look up the exact longitudes of these

      - 28512 is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the East Coast


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning of these states.

      - Ohio is located inland, in the eastern part of the Midwest

      - North Carolina is an Atlantic coastal state


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - When looking at a US map, North Carolina is clearly east of Ohio

      - The East Coast (including NC) is east of the Midwest region (including OH)

      - This means that 28512, NC would be east of 44627, OH, not the other way around


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      - Since North Carolina is east of Ohio, 44627, OH cannot be east of 28512, NC

      - Instead, 44627, OH is west of 28512, NC

      I need to determine if 23702, VA is east of 01364, MA.


      In the United States, locations further east have higher longitude values (less
      negative or more positive). The eastern states are generally along the Atlantic
      coast, with Maine being the northeasternmost state.


      Virginia (VA) is a mid-Atlantic state, located on the East Coast.

      Massachusetts (MA) is a northeastern state, also on the East Coast.


      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is north of Virginia, but the question is

      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - While Massachusetts is generally northeast of Virginia, western Massachusetts
      (where Orange is) extends further west than coastal Virginia

      - Portsmouth is right on the Atlantic coastline, positioning it quite far east

      - Orange, MA, being in western Massachusetts, is more inland and westward


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Portsmouth, VA (23702) is indeed further east than Orange, MA (01364).

      VA is located east of 01364, MA.


      To do this, I need to:

      1. Identify where ZIP code 23702 in Virginia is located

      2. Identify where ZIP code 01364 in Massachusetts is located

      3. Compare their geographic locations to determine which one is more easterly


      Let''s think about this:


      ZIP code 23702 is in Virginia (VA). Virginia is a state on the east coast of
      the United States, and is generally in the southeastern part of the country.


      ZIP code 01364 is in Massachusetts (MA). Massachusetts is also on the east coast,
      but it''s in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is north of Virginia. But the question is
      about east/west positioning, not north/south.


      Looking at a map of the US east coast, Massachusetts forms part of New England
      which juts out eastward into the Atlantic Ocean, while Virginia''s coastline
      is straighter and typically not as far east as the eastern parts of Massachusetts.


      However, I need to consider the specific locations of these ZIP codes, not just
      the general state positions.</think># Analyzing the East-West Relationship Between
      Two ZIP Codes


      To determine if 23702, VA is east of 01364, MA, I need to identify the specific
      locations of these ZIP codes and compare their positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - ZIP code 23702 is in Portsmouth, Virginia, located near the Atlantic coast

      - ZIP code 01364 is in Orange, Massachusetts, located in central/western Massachusetts


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Portsmouth, VA is very close to the Atlantic Ocean on Virginia''s eastern
      shore

      - Orange, MA is in western Massachusetts, far from the Atlantic coast

      - Massachusetts is north of Virginia, but that''s not what we''re determining
      here


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudes

      - Coastal Virginia locations like Portsmouth are further east than western/central
      Massachusetts locations

      - The eastern parts of Virginia (including Portsmouth) are at a more eastern
      longitude than western Massachusetts


      # NO


      01364 in Orange, Massachusetts is in the western part of Massachusetts, while
      23702 in Portsmouth, Virginia is on the Atlantic coast. Therefore, the Virginia
      ZIP code is farther east.'
    89b9115e-7cf4-40f8-a4a6-39ae9105f8d1: '<think>I need to determine if zip code
      23702 in Virginia (VA) is located east of zip code 01364 in Massachusetts (MA).


      First, let me think about the general geographic layout of these states:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is located in the northeastern United States (New England
      region)

      - Virginia (VA) is located in the mid-Atlantic/southeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Virginia is generally located southwest of
      Massachusetts. This means that most locations in Virginia would be west of locations
      in Massachusetts, not east.


      Let me try to be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 23702 is a zip code in Virginia. Without looking up the specific city, it''s
      somewhere in Virginia.

      - 01364 is a zip code in Massachusetts. Without looking up the specific city,
      it''s somewhere in Massachusetts.


      Since Virginia is generally west and south of Massachusetts, it''s likely that
      23702, VA is west of 01364, MA, not east.


      Therefore, the answer is likely "NO" - 23702, VA is not located east of 01364,
      MA.


      However, I should note that zip codes don''t perfectly follow an east-to-west
      pattern, and there could be some unusual geographic arrangement that I''m not
      aware of. But based on the general geographic positions of Virginia and Massachusetts,
      Virginia is west of Massachusetts, not east.</think># Is 23702, VA located east
      of 01364, MA?


      To determine this, I need to identify where these zip codes are located and
      compare their positions from east to west.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Zip code 23702 is in Portsmouth, Virginia (VA)

      - Zip code 01364 is in Orange, Massachusetts (MA)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States (New England region)

      - Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic region, south of Massachusetts


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - Looking at a map of the United States, Massachusetts is located further east
      than Virginia

      - This means that locations in Massachusetts are generally east of locations
      in Virginia

      - Therefore, a location in Virginia (like Portsmouth) would be west of a location
      in Massachusetts (like Orange), not east of it


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Virginia is west of Massachusetts, zip code 23702 in VA cannot be east
      of zip code 01364 in MA.

      First, let me identify the locations:


      23702 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA)

      01364 is a ZIP code in Massachusetts (MA)


      Specifically:

      - 23702 appears to be in Portsmouth, Virginia, which is in the southeastern
      part of Virginia, near the Atlantic coast.

      - 01364 appears to be in Orange, Massachusetts, which is in the central/western
      part of Massachusetts.


      Now, to determine which is more easterly, I need to compare their relative positions.
      The eastern United States has the Atlantic Ocean as its eastern border. In general,
      lower longitude numbers (more negative in the Western Hemisphere) correspond
      to more easterly locations.


      Virginia is south of Massachusetts, but that doesn''t tell us about the east-west
      relationship. However, Portsmouth, VA (where 23702 is located) is a coastal
      city on the Atlantic, while Orange, MA (01364) is in inland Massachusetts, not
      on the coast.


      Geographically, Virginia''s eastern regions (especially coastal areas like Portsmouth)
      tend to be further east than western Massachusetts. Portsmouth is very close
      to the Atlantic coast, while Orange, MA is in the interior of the state, closer
      to the New York border than to the Atlantic.


      So, 23702, VA (Portsmouth) should be east of 01364, MA (Orange).</think># Is

      - 23702 is a zip code in Portsmouth, Virginia

      - 01364 is a zip code in Orange, Massachusetts


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is south of Massachusetts

      - However, for east-west positioning, I need to consider their locations within
      their states


      ## Step 3: Analyze specific locations

      - Portsmouth, VA (23702) is a coastal city in southeastern Virginia, located
      on the Atlantic coast

      - Orange, MA (01364) is in north-central Massachusetts, in the interior part
      of the state


      ## Step 4: Compare longitudes

      - Portsmouth, VA is very close to the Atlantic Ocean on Virginia''s eastern
      shore

      - Orange, MA is in western/central Massachusetts, further from the Atlantic
      coast

      is located east of 24201, VA (Virginia), I need to find the geographic locations
      of these zip codes and compare their east-west positions.


      First, let me consider 61801, IL. This is a zip code in Illinois. Illinois is
      in the Midwest region of the United States. Specifically, 61801 is the zip code
      for Urbana, Illinois.


      Next, I''ll consider 24201, VA. This is a zip code in Virginia. Virginia is
      in the eastern part of the United States, specifically in the Mid-Atlantic region.
      24201 is the zip code for Bristol, Virginia.


      To determine which is more easterly, I need to compare their relative positions.
      The United States generally has locations further east with higher longitude
      values (more positive) when using the standard coordinate system where east
      is positive and west is negative longitude.


      Virginia is on the east coast of the United States, while Illinois is in the
      Midwest. Generally speaking, states on the east coast are east of states in
      the Midwest. Therefore, Virginia (including Bristol, VA with zip code 24201)
      would be east of Illinois (including Urbana, IL with zip code 61801).


      So 61801, IL is NOT located east of 24201, VA. Rather, 24201, VA is east of
      61801, IL.</think># Is 61801, IL located east of 24201, VA?


      I need to identify the locations of these zip codes and compare their east-west

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 61801 is a zip code in Urbana, Illinois

      - 24201 is a zip code in Bristol, Virginia


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - States on the East Coast (like Virginia) are generally east of Midwestern
      states (like Illinois)

      - Virginia''s position is further east in the country compared to Illinois

      - Moving from Illinois to Virginia requires traveling eastward


      ## Conclusion

      NO. 61801, IL (Urbana, Illinois) is NOT located east of 24201, VA (Bristol,

      61801 is a zip code in Illinois (IL). Let me think about where in Illinois this
      might be. Illinois is in the Midwest. Specifically, 61801 is in Urbana, Illinois,
      which is in the eastern part of the state.


      24201 is a zip code in Virginia (VA). Virginia is on the east coast of the US.
      Specifically, 24201 is in Bristol, Virginia, which is in the southwestern part

      Now I need to determine whether Urbana, IL (61801) is east of Bristol, VA (24201).


      The US generally has states arranged with the eastern states along the Atlantic

      Since 61801 is in Illinois and 24201 is in Virginia, it''s likely that 61801
      is WEST of 24201, not east.

      First, let me think about the relative positions of Arizona and Oklahoma in
      the US:

      - Arizona is in the southwestern part of the US

      - Oklahoma is more centrally located in the US, but somewhat south


      Generally speaking, Oklahoma is east of Arizona. US geography has Arizona west
      of Oklahoma.


      Now, to be more precise, I should consider the specific locations of these zip

      - 85621 is a zip code in Arizona, likely in the southern part of the state based
      on the numbering

      - 73505 is a zip code in Oklahoma, probably in the southern part as well


      However, the general geographic relationship between the states would still
      hold - even the easternmost part of Arizona would be west of the westernmost

      States.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Oklahoma is located more centrally in the United States


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states to each other.

      - Arizona lies to the west of Oklahoma

      - Oklahoma lies to the east of Arizona


      Step 3: Consider if specific zip codes might change this relationship.

      - Even though specific zip codes might be in different parts of their respective
      states, the overall geographic relationship between Arizona and Oklahoma remains
      the same.

      - No zip code in Arizona can be east of any zip code in Oklahoma because the
      entire state of Arizona is west of Oklahoma.

      73505 is a zip code in Oklahoma (OK).

      - 8 and 9 are for western states (including Arizona)


      Since 85621 starts with 8 (Arizona), and 73505 starts with 7 (Oklahoma), this
      suggests that 85621 is located west of 73505, not east.


      Looking at a US map confirms this: Arizona is located west of Oklahoma. So 85621,
      AZ would be west of 73505, OK, not east.</think>I need to determine the geographic
      relationship between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 85621 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 73505 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, while Oklahoma is in the
      south-central United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Oklahoma is clearly east of Arizona.
      In fact, Arizona is about two states west of Oklahoma.


      Step 4: Confirm with zip code patterns.

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower first digits are in the
      east, and higher first digits are in the west. The "8" in 85621 (Arizona) indicates
      a more western location than the "7" in 73505 (Oklahoma).

      whether the US zip code 85621 in Arizona (AZ) is located east of the zip code
      73505 in Oklahoma (OK).


      To answer this, I need to:

      1. Determine the general locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their relative east-west positions (longitude)


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern United States

      - Oklahoma (OK) is in the south-central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, Oklahoma is generally east of Arizona. The
      entire state of Arizona is west of Oklahoma.


      Now, specific zip codes might have unusual patterns, but generally:

      - Arizona zip codes (like 85621) will be west of Oklahoma zip codes (like 73505)

      - This is because longitude decreases as you move west in North America


      So 85621, AZ would be WEST of 73505, OK - not east.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think>To determine whether 85621, AZ is located
      east of 73505, OK, I need to compare the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 85621 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 73505 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Looking at a US map, Arizona is positioned entirely to the west of Oklahoma

      - States become more western as you move from east to west across the US

      - Oklahoma is significantly east of Arizona


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 85621 is in Arizona, it must be west of any location in Oklahoma

      - Since 73505 is in Oklahoma, it must be east of any location in Arizona


      Therefore, 85621, AZ is NOT located east of 73505, OK, but rather west of it.

      To approach this, I need to understand the geographical relationship between
      these locations. I''ll follow these steps:


      1. First, think about the general geographical relationship between Arizona
      and Oklahoma.

      2. Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, while Oklahoma is in
      the south-central part.

      3. Arizona is generally west of Oklahoma on a map of the United States.


      Since Arizona is west of Oklahoma, a zip code in Arizona (like 85621) would
      typically be west of a zip code in Oklahoma (like 73505), not east of it.


      While specific zip codes might sometimes break regional patterns if they''re

      Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern part of the United States.

      Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central part of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positioning of these states.

      Looking at a map of the US, Arizona is positioned to the west of Oklahoma. The
      entire state of Arizona lies west of Oklahoma.


      Step 3: Since zip code 85621 is in Arizona and zip code 73505 is in Oklahoma,
      their relative positions follow their states'' positions.

      In the US zip code system:

      - The first digit generally represents a group of states from east to west

      - 0 is the easternmost region (e.g., Maine, New York)

      - 9 is the westernmost region (e.g., California, Washington)

      (AZ)

      - 73505 starts with 7, which typically covers central states including Oklahoma
      (OK)


      Since 8 is a higher first digit than 7, and these digits generally increase

      Specifically, is the first zip code (in PA) located east of the second zip code
      (in MA)?


      To solve this, I need to determine the geographic positions of these zip codes.
      In general, on the US East Coast:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is in the Northeast

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is southwest of Massachusetts


      The general east-west relationship between these states is that Massachusetts
      is east of Pennsylvania. But I need to look at the specific zip codes to be
      precise.


      Zip code 18218 is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts.

      Zip code 01908 is in Massachusetts, and Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania.


      So the likely answer is NO, 18218 PA is NOT east of 01908 MA.

      - 18218 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 01908 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      On the US East Coast, Massachusetts is located in the Northeast, while Pennsylvania

      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 18218 is in Pennsylvania and 01908 is in Massachusetts, and Massachusetts

      The zip code 01908 is in Massachusetts, and zip codes starting with "01" are
      in the eastern part of Massachusetts.


      The zip code 18218 is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts.


      So generally speaking, any location in Pennsylvania would be west of Massachusetts,

      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Mississippi is significantly west of New Jersey


      Since we''re asking if MS is east of NJ, and I know that Mississippi is actually
      west of New Jersey, the answer would be NO.


      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 38834 is in Mississippi, which is definitively west of New Jersey

      - 08628 is in New Jersey, which is east of Mississippi


      Therefore, 38834, MS is NOT east of 08628, NJ. Instead, it is west of it.</think>To
      determine if 38834, MS is located east of 08628, NJ, I need to consider the
      geographic positions of Mississippi and New Jersey.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations within the United States.

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States, along the Gulf
      Coast.

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - States in the eastern United States have higher longitude values (closer to
      the Atlantic Ocean).

      - New Jersey is significantly further east than Mississippi on the U.S. map.


      Step 3: Conclude based on geographic positioning.

      - Since Mississippi is west of New Jersey, any location in MS (including zip
      code 38834) would be west of locations in NJ (including zip code 08628).


      NO, 38834, MS is not located east of 08628, NJ. It is located west of it.'

      1. The question is asking whether the location with zip code 38834 in Mississippi
      (MS) is located east of the location with zip code 08628 in New Jersey (NJ).


      2. To determine this, I need to know the relative positions of these locations
      within the United States.


      3. Broadly speaking, New Jersey (NJ) is on the east coast of the United States,
      while Mississippi (MS) is in the southeastern part of the country, but more
      inland and west of New Jersey.


      4. The specific zip codes might refer to specific locations within these states,
      but the general geographic relationship between Mississippi and New Jersey is
      that New Jersey is east of Mississippi.


      5. Therefore, it''s not the case that 38834, MS is east of 08628, NJ. Rather,
      38834, MS would be west of 08628, NJ.</think>To determine if 38834, MS is located

      - 38834 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 08628 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States, but significantly
      west of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Compare relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Mississippi is clearly west of
      New Jersey.

      - Any location in Mississippi (including zip code 38834) would be west of locations
      in New Jersey (including zip code 08628).


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since Mississippi is west of New Jersey, zip code 38834 in MS cannot be east

      east of another, I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip
      codes and compare their longitudes. In the US, locations further east have lower
      (more negative) longitude values.


      Let me identify the locations:

      - 38834, MS: This is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)

      - 08628, NJ: This is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      In general, New Jersey is on the east coast of the United States, while Mississippi
      is in the southern part of the country, more toward the central-southeast region.
      If we think about the geography of the US, New Jersey is definitely east of
      Mississippi.


      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - Mississippi zip codes (including 38834) would be approximately around the
      longitude of -88 to -90 degrees

      - New Jersey zip codes (including 08628) would be approximately around the longitude
      of -74 to -75 degrees


      Since lower (more negative) longitude values are further west, and higher (less
      negative) values are further east, New Jersey (with longitude around -74 to
      -75) is east of Mississippi (with longitude around -88 to -90).

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 38834 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 08628 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern part of the United States

      - New Jersey is located on the East Coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast, near the eastern edge of the continental
      US

      - Mississippi is several states inland from the Atlantic coast

      - When looking at a US map, New Jersey is clearly to the east of Mississippi


      ## Step 4: Determine the relative position

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Mississippi is in the south-central part of the US

      - New Jersey is on the east coast


      In terms of east-west positioning, New Jersey is definitely further east than
      Mississippi. The entire east coast (including New Jersey) is east of Mississippi.

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 38834 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 08628 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Mississippi is located in the southern part of the United States, along the
      Gulf Coast

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern part of the
      United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitude (east-west position).

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Mississippi is much further west, in what would be considered the southeastern/south-central
      region


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the relative positions.

      Since New Jersey is on the East Coast and Mississippi is significantly further
      west, zip code 38834, MS is NOT east of 08628, NJ. It is actually west of it.

      Let me think about this:


      - 38834 is a zip code in Mississippi (MS)

      - 08628 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Now, I need to recall the geographical positions of these states in the US:

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the
      Gulf of Mexico

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      When comparing east-west positioning in the US, we typically consider longitude,
      where lower numbers (more negative) are further west and higher numbers (less
      negative or positive) are further east.


      New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast, one of the easternmost states in the continental
      US. Mississippi is located in the southeastern US, but it''s definitely west

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast, in the eastern part of the United
      States.

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States, but significantly
      west of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      - States on the East Coast (like New Jersey) are generally easternmost in the
      continental US.

      - Mississippi is positioned considerably west of New Jersey on any US map.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - When comparing east-west positions, locations with more easterly longitudes
      are "east of" locations with more westerly longitudes.

      - Since New Jersey is east of Mississippi, the zip code in Mississippi cannot
      be east of the zip code in New Jersey.

      First, let me recall the general geographic positions of these states:

      - Missouri (MO) is in the central United States

      - Michigan (MI) is in the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region


      To determine if one location is east of another, I need to compare their longitudes.

      to determine the geographical locations of two zip codes and compare them:

      1. 63670, MO (Missouri)

      2. 48624, MI (Michigan)


      I need to determine if the Missouri zip code is east of the Michigan zip code.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - Missouri is generally located in the central United States

      - Michigan is in the north-central/Great Lakes region


      When comparing east-west positioning, I need to remember that:

      - Lower longitude numbers represent more western locations in the US

      - Higher longitude numbers represent more eastern locations in the US


      In terms of general state positions:

      - Missouri is west of Michigan

      - Michigan is east of Missouri


      Therefore, a zip code in Missouri (63670) would generally be west of a zip code
      in Michigan (48624), not east of it.

      First, let me identify the states:

      - 63670 is in Missouri (MO)

      Now I need to consider the geographical positions of these states:

      - Missouri is located in the central United States

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region of the eastern Midwest


      Looking at their positions on a map, Missouri is west of Michigan. The entire
      state of Missouri lies to the west of Michigan.


      Since 63670 is in Missouri and 48624 is in Michigan, the Missouri zip code must
      be west of the Michigan zip code, not east of it.

      The first one is 63670, MO (which means it''s in Missouri).

      The second one is 48624, MI (which means it''s in Michigan).


      I need to determine if the location in Missouri is east of the location in Michigan.


      Looking at a US map, Michigan is in the north-central part of the US, bordering
      the Great Lakes, while Missouri is further south and west of Michigan.


      Generally speaking, Missouri is west of Michigan, not east of it. Michigan is
      more easterly located than Missouri.


      However, I need to be careful because we''re talking about specific ZIP codes,

      Missouri is positioned south and somewhat west of Michigan on a US map. The
      eastern border of Missouri is still generally west of Michigan''s western border.
      This means that even the easternmost parts of Missouri would typically be west

      Let me identify these locations:


      44095 is a zip code in Ohio (OH). Specifically, it''s in Eastlake, OH, which
      is in the northeastern part of Ohio, likely near Lake Erie.


      19363 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA). I''m not immediately certain of the
      specific town, but Pennsylvania is generally east of Ohio (OH is west of PA).


      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, and these zip codes are in their respective
      states, the typical assumption would be that the Ohio zip code (44095) is west
      of the Pennsylvania zip code (19363).


      However, I need to be careful here because zip codes don''t always follow a
      perfect west-to-east progression, and Ohio and Pennsylvania share a border where
      some parts of Ohio could potentially be east of some parts of western Pennsylvania.

      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 44095 is in Eastlake, Ohio, which is in the northeastern part of Ohio near
      Lake Erie.

      - 19363 is in Oxford, Pennsylvania, located in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.

      2. Figure out where 19363, PA is located

      3. Determine if the Ohio location is east of the Pennsylvania location


      Let''s think about the geography of these states. Generally:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located east of Ohio (OH)

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania on Pennsylvania''s western border


      Since Pennsylvania is generally east of Ohio, most places in Ohio would be west

      1. 44095 is in Ohio (OH)

      44095 appears to be for Eastlake, Ohio, which is in the northeastern part of
      Ohio, near Lake Erie.

      19363 appears to be in southeastern Pennsylvania.


      Looking at their relative positions on a mental map:

      - Ohio ZIP codes generally start with 4, and Pennsylvania ZIP codes generally
      start with 1

      - 44095 being in northeastern Ohio means it''s quite far east within Ohio

      - 19363 being in southeastern Pennsylvania puts it in the eastern portion of
      Pennsylvania


      Since Pennsylvania is east of Ohio, and 19363 is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania
      while 44095 is in the eastern part of Ohio, 19363 should be east of 44095.

      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship of these states

      Pennsylvania is located directly east of Ohio on a map of the United States.


      ## Step 3: Consider ZIP code patterns

      - ZIP codes in the eastern United States generally have lower first digits

      - Pennsylvania ZIP codes start with 1, while Ohio ZIP codes start with 4

      east of 19363, PA, I need to:


      1. Find the approximate geographic locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their east-west positions (longitude)


      44095 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      19363 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Generally, Pennsylvania is east of Ohio, since Ohio is in the Midwest while
      Pennsylvania is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region. So my initial guess would
      be that 19363, PA is east of 44095, OH.


      But let me reason more precisely:


      44095 appears to be in northeastern Ohio, likely near Lake Erie

      19363 appears to be in southeastern Pennsylvania


      Even though 44095 is in eastern Ohio, and 19363 might be in western Pennsylvania,
      Pennsylvania as a whole is east of Ohio. So the PA zip code should still be
      east of the OH zip code.

      Is 44095, OH located east of 19363, PA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions

      - 44095 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Pennsylvania is generally located east of Ohio on the US map


      ## Step 2: Consider specific zip code locations

      - 44095 appears to be in northeastern Ohio (likely in the Lake Erie region)

      - 19363 is in southeastern Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Compare positions

      Even though 44095 is in eastern Ohio, and 19363 might not be at the easternmost
      part of Pennsylvania, the geographic arrangement of these states means that
      Pennsylvania zip codes are almost always east of Ohio zip codes.

      1. I need to determine the locations of two zip codes: 44095, OH and 19363,
      PA.


      2. 44095 is a zip code in Ohio (OH). Let me recall the general geography - Ohio
      is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      3. 19363 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is located east of
      Ohio.


      4. If we look at a US map, Pennsylvania is east of Ohio. So generally speaking,
      locations in Pennsylvania tend to be east of locations in Ohio.


      5. However, I need to be careful here. Since I''m looking at specific zip codes,
      I need to consider their precise locations. If 44095 is in the far eastern part
      of Ohio and 19363 is in the far western part of Pennsylvania, then my general
      geographic knowledge might not be sufficient.


      6. Let me think about the zip code numbering system. Generally, zip codes increase
      as you go from east to west in the US. Lower numbers tend to be in the eastern
      US.


      7. 19363 is a much lower number than 44095, which suggests that 19363 is likely

      - 44095 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 19363 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship of these states

      Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio on the US map. Ohio borders Pennsylvania
      on Pennsylvania''s western side.


      ## Step 3: Check zip code patterns

      The US zip code system generally assigns lower numbers to the eastern regions
      of the country and higher numbers as you move west. The fact that the Pennsylvania
      zip code (19363) has a lower number than the Ohio zip code (44095) supports
      the standard geographic arrangement.


      ## Step 4: Specific locations

      44095 appears to be for Eastlake, Ohio, which is in the northeastern part of
      Ohio.

      19363 appears to be in southeastern Pennsylvania.


      Even though 44095 is in the eastern part of Ohio, it still lies west of Pennsylvania

      - New Jersey borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side

      - Ohio is further inland, west of Pennsylvania which itself is west of New Jersey


      Therefore, New Jersey is east of Ohio. Since 07052 is in New Jersey and 44012
      is in Ohio, the zip code 07052, NJ is east of 44012, OH.

      ## Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      Since 73801 is in Oklahoma and 39367 is in Mississippi, and Mississippi is east

      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to think about the relative
      positions of these states. Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of
      the United States, while Mississippi is in the southeastern United States.


      Generally speaking, Mississippi is east of Oklahoma, as Oklahoma borders Texas
      to its west and Arkansas to its east, while Mississippi is further east, bordering
      Alabama to its east and Louisiana to its west.


      So if I consider the standard geographical positions of these states, a zip

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of the United States, while

      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Mississippi lies east of Oklahoma on the US map. Oklahoma borders Texas to its
      west and Arkansas to its east, while Mississippi is further east (bordering
      Alabama to its east and Louisiana to its west).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Oklahoma is west of Mississippi, a zip code in Oklahoma (73801) would
      be west of a zip code in Mississippi (39367), not east of it.

      To solve this, I need to know the relative positions of these zip codes or at
      least the general geographic relationship between Oklahoma and Mississippi.


      The United States is organized with states generally arranged from west to east
      as you move from the Pacific Coast to the Atlantic Coast. Let me think about

      - Oklahoma is located in the central-southern part of the United States

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern part of the United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico


      In terms of relative east-west positioning, Mississippi is generally east of
      Oklahoma. This means that locations in Mississippi would typically be east of
      locations in Oklahoma.


      So without even needing the specific zip codes, I can reasonably conclude that

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Mississippi is significantly east of Oklahoma on the US map

      - Oklahoma is closer to the central part of the country

      - Mississippi is closer to the Atlantic coast

      North Carolina is a state on the east coast of the US, but it''s south of New
      York. New York is also on the east coast.


      Generally speaking, the east coast of the US runs from northeast to southwest,

      - New York is north of North Carolina

      - The US east coast runs northeast to southwest


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - Oceanside, NY (11572) is located on Long Island, which extends eastward into
      the Atlantic Ocean

      - Raleigh, NC (27604) is located inland in central North Carolina

      - Long Island''s position makes it one of the easternmost points in the continental

    1fbba6b5-219c-4b60-98e8-40e3f4b815f0: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative east-west positioning of two zip codes:

      - 15139 in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 07432 in New Jersey (NJ)


      First, I''ll need to recall the general geographic positioning of Pennsylvania
      and New Jersey:

      - Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard

      - Pennsylvania is inland, to the west of New Jersey


      In the US ZIP code system:

      - New Jersey ZIP codes typically start with 07, 08, or 09

      - Pennsylvania ZIP codes typically start with 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19


      Since 15139 is in Pennsylvania and 07432 is in New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
      is generally west of New Jersey, 15139 PA would generally be WEST of 07432 NJ,
      not east.


      So the answer would be NO, 15139 PA is not located east of 07432 NJ. It''s located
      to the west.</think>I need to determine if ZIP code 15139 in Pennsylvania is
      east of ZIP code 07432 in New Jersey.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic locations of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

      Pennsylvania is located west of New Jersey. New Jersey borders the Atlantic
      Ocean on the east coast, while Pennsylvania is inland.


      Step 2: Consider the ZIP code numbering system.

      Lower ZIP code numbers generally (though not always) correspond to areas in
      the eastern United States, with numbers increasing as you move westward.


      Step 3: Compare the specific ZIP codes.

      07432 is in New Jersey with a lower number (starting with 07)

      15139 is in Pennsylvania with a higher number (starting with 15)


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, and these particular ZIP codes follow
      the general east-to-west pattern, ZIP code 15139 in PA would be located west
      of ZIP code 07432 in NJ, not east.

      1) 15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      2) 07432 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)

      3) I need to determine if the PA location is east of the NJ location


      This is an interesting question because generally speaking, Pennsylvania is
      west of New Jersey. NJ borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while PA is more
      inland. In fact, NJ forms part of PA''s eastern border.


      In terms of general geography:

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is immediately to the west of New Jersey


      Based on the zip code patterns:

      - New Jersey zip codes typically start with 07, 08, or 09

      - Pennsylvania zip codes often start with 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19


      The zip code 15139 appears to be in western Pennsylvania (since PA zip codes
      starting with 15 are typically in the western part of the state), while 07432
      would be in northeastern New Jersey.


      Given the general geography of these states, a location in Pennsylvania would
      almost certainly be west of a location in New Jersey, not east of it.


      Therefore, 15139, PA is most likely west of 07432, NJ, not east of it.</think>#

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 15139 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 07432 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between PA and NJ

      Pennsylvania is located to the west of New Jersey. New Jersey borders the Atlantic
      Ocean on its eastern side, while Pennsylvania is inland and shares part of New
      Jersey''s western border.


      ## Step 3: Examine the specific zip codes

      - PA zip codes beginning with 15 are typically in the western part of Pennsylvania

      - NJ zip codes beginning with 07 are in the northern part of New Jersey


      ## Step 4: Draw a conclusion

      Since Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey geographically, and 15139 is in western
      PA, this location must be west of any point in New Jersey, including 07432.

      First, let me think about the geography of these two states. New Jersey is on
      the east coast of the United States, while Pennsylvania is directly to the west

      it.


      To be more precise:

      - ZIP code 15139 is in Pennsylvania

      - ZIP code 07432 is in New Jersey

      - 15139 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 07432 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is located inland, to the west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the specific zip codes.

      - Since Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, locations in Pennsylvania (including
      15139) are generally west of locations in New Jersey (including 07432)

      - Being west means it cannot be east


      Based on this analysis, 15139, PA is located west of 07432, NJ, not east of

    f84f9995-9a85-41df-bb7c-1fc5b68f5441: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west position of two zip codes:

      - 15139, PA (Pennsylvania)

      - 07432, NJ (New Jersey)


      First, let me think about the general geographic relationship between Pennsylvania
      and New Jersey. New Jersey is located east of Pennsylvania, as Pennsylvania
      is in the middle of the eastern US, while New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast.


      Now, I need to consider the specific zip codes. US zip codes generally start
      with lower numbers in the northeast and increase as you go west and south. So:

      - Zip codes starting with 07 would be in northern/northeastern NJ

      - Zip codes starting with 15 would be in western PA (Pittsburgh area)


      Since 07432 is in New Jersey, which is entirely east of Pennsylvania, and 15139
      is in Pennsylvania (likely western PA based on the first two digits), the answer
      would be NO - 15139, PA is NOT located east of 07432, NJ. Instead, it''s located
      west of 07432, NJ.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare the geographic
      locations of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their relative positions.

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located west of New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey borders the
      Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Pennsylvania is inland.


      Step 2: Analyze the zip code patterns.

      US zip codes follow geographic patterns. Lower numbers in the first digits generally
      indicate more eastern locations:

      - 07xxx zip codes are in northern New Jersey

      - 15xxx zip codes are in western Pennsylvania (around Pittsburgh area)


      Step 3: Compare the specific zip codes.

      Zip code 07432 is in New Jersey, which is entirely east of Pennsylvania.

      Zip code 15139 is in Pennsylvania, specifically in western Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since 15139 is in western Pennsylvania, and 07432 is in New Jersey, and New
      Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, 15139 cannot be east of 07432.

      if the zip code 32129, FL is located east of zip code 10162, NY.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify the approximate locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their positions on an east-west axis


      Let me think about the US geography:

      - Florida (FL) is in the southeastern United States

      - New York (NY) is in the northeastern United States


      When we think about east-west positioning:

      - Florida is generally south of New York

      - But the question is about east-west positioning, not north-south


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - The eastern coast of the US curves, with Florida extending eastward into the
      Atlantic

      - New York is also on the eastern coast


      Let me consider the more specific locations:

      - 32129 is a zip code in Florida, likely in central/eastern Florida

      - 10162 is a zip code in New York, likely in New York City area


      The east coast of the US has Florida extending more eastward than New York.
      While both states are on the eastern seaboard, Florida''s eastern coastline
      generally extends further east than New York''s.

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 32129 is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States

      - 10162 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of the US eastern coast

      The US eastern coastline curves, with Florida extending further east into the
      Atlantic Ocean than New York. While New York is further north, Florida''s coastline
      is actually further east in terms of longitude.


      ## Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      - Florida zip code 32129 is in the Daytona Beach/Port Orange area, on Florida''s
      Atlantic coast

      - New York zip code 10162 is in Manhattan, New York City


      ## Step 4: Draw the conclusion

      The eastern coast of Florida (where 32129 is located) is further east in terms
      of longitude than Manhattan in New York (where 10162 is located).

      77045 in Texas is located east of ZIP code 44116 in Ohio.


      To solve this problem, I need to know the geographic locations of these ZIP
      codes:

      1. 77045, TX

      2. 44116, OH


      Then I need to determine which one is further east.


      In the United States:

      - Ohio (OH) is in the eastern/midwestern part of the country

      - Texas (TX) is in the southern/southwestern part of the country


      Generally speaking, Ohio is east of Texas. That means that points in Ohio tend
      to be east of points in Texas.


      So 44116, OH is likely east of 77045, TX, not the other way around.


      To be certain, I would need the exact longitudes, but based on general U.S.
      geography, we can be confident that Ohio is east of Texas, meaning 77045, TX
      is NOT located east of 44116, OH.</think>To determine if 77045, TX is located
      east of 44116, OH, I need to compare the relative geographic positions of these
      two ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Consider the states where these ZIP codes are located.

      - 77045 is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern/southwestern United States.

      - 44116 is in Ohio (OH), which is in the eastern/midwestern United States.


      Step 2: Determine the general east-west relationship between these states.

      - On a U.S. map, Ohio is positioned significantly east of Texas.

      - States in the Midwest (like Ohio) are east of states in the Southwest (like
      Texas).


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on geographic positions.

      - Since Ohio is east of Texas, ZIP code 44116 in Ohio would be east of ZIP code
      77045 in Texas.

      - Therefore, 77045 in Texas cannot be east of 44116 in Ohio; it must be west
      of it.

      TX is located east of 44116, OH. To solve this, I''ll need to figure out where
      these zip codes are located and compare their positions.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 77045 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 44116 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)


      In the United States, states in the eastern part of the country have lower numbers
      in their zip codes, while states in the western part have higher numbers.


      However, the first digit of zip codes generally indicates a geographical region:

      - 0-1: Northeast

      - 2-3: Mid-Atlantic and Southeast

      - 4-5: Midwest/Great Lakes

      - 6-7: South/Southwest

      - 8-9: West/Pacific


      So 44116 (Ohio) starts with 4, placing it in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.

      And 77045 (Texas) starts with 7, placing it in the South/Southwest region.


      Ohio is generally located in the eastern half of the US, while Texas is in the
      south-central part of the US. Geographically, Texas is west of Ohio.


      So if 77045 is in Texas, and Texas is west of Ohio (where 44116 is), then 77045,
      TX is west of 44116, OH, not east.</think>To determine if 77045, TX is located
      east of 44116, OH, I need to consider the geographical locations of these zip
      codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 77045 is in Texas (TX)

      - 44116 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States, while
      Texas is in the South/Southwest region.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      Looking at a US map, Ohio is significantly east of Texas. The entire state of
      Ohio is east of Texas.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes

      Since 77045 is in Texas and 44116 is in Ohio, and Texas is west of Ohio, the
      zip code 77045 must be west (not east) of 44116.

      To solve this, I need to understand the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      97229 is in Oregon (OR). Oregon is a state on the west coast of the United States,
      north of California.

      90650 is in California (CA). California is also on the west coast of the United
      States, south of Oregon.


      In the United States, when comparing states on the same coast (west coast in
      this case), the state that is further north (Oregon) is generally not east of
      the state that is further south (California). The west coast runs roughly north-south,
      with a slight northwest to southeast tilt.


      So generally speaking, Oregon is north of California, not east of it.


      But to be more precise, I should consider the specific locations of these zip
      codes:


      97229 is in the Portland area of Oregon, in the northwestern part of the state.

      90650 is the zip code for Norwalk, CA, which is in the Los Angeles area in southern
      California.


      Looking at their positions, Portland is northwest of Los Angeles. This means
      that 97229 (Portland area, OR) is northwest of 90650 (Norwalk, CA) - not east
      of it.


      Therefore, 97229, OR is NOT located east of 90650, CA.</think># Is 97229, OR
      located east of 90650, CA?


      To determine this, I need to identify the geographic locations of these zip
      codes and compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 97229 is in Oregon (OR), specifically in the Portland metropolitan area in
      the northwestern part of the state.

      - 90650 is in California (CA), specifically in Norwalk, which is in the Los
      Angeles area of southern California.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Oregon and California.

      - Oregon is located north of California along the west coast of the United States.

      - The west coast generally runs north-south, with both states bordering the
      Pacific Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - California extends further east than Oregon along most of their respective
      territories.

      - Portland (97229) is located in the western portion of Oregon.

      - Norwalk (90650) is located in the western portion of southern California.

      - When comparing these specific locations, Portland is actually northwest of
      Norwalk, not east of it.

      97229 is a zip code in the Portland, Oregon area, which is in the northwest

      90650 appears to be a zip code in southern California, likely in the Los Angeles

      Portland, Oregon is definitely west of Los Angeles, California. Oregon is along

      1. Identify the locations of both zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me work through this:


      33715 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      01107 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA)


      In the United States, states on the east coast generally follow this arrangement
      from north to south:

      - Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York,
      New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
      Florida


      Massachusetts is much further north than Florida, but the question is about
      east/west positioning.


      The east coast of the US generally curves, with Massachusetts being further
      east than Florida. The Atlantic coastline runs roughly northeast to southwest
      as you go from Massachusetts down to Florida.


      That means Massachusetts (including 01107) would typically be east of Florida
      (including 33715).


      So 33715, FL would NOT be east of 01107, MA. Instead, it would be west of (and
      south of) the Massachusetts zip code.</think># Is 33715, FL located east of
      01107, MA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 33715 is in Florida (FL)

      - 01107 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the US east coast.

      The US eastern seaboard curves from northeast to southwest. Massachusetts is
      located in the Northeast, while Florida is in the Southeast.


      Step 3: Compare their longitude positions.

      Massachusetts is positioned further east than Florida on the map. The Atlantic
      coastline angles inward as you move south from Massachusetts to Florida.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on relative positioning.

      Since Massachusetts (including 01107) is further east than Florida (including
      33715), the Florida zip code cannot be east of the Massachusetts zip code.

      33715 in Florida is located east of zip code 01107 in Massachusetts.


      First, let me identify where each zip code is located:

      - 33715 is in Florida (FL)

      - 01107 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Now, I need to think about the general geographic positioning of these states:

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States


      In the United States, east-west position is determined by longitude. Lower longitude
      numbers represent more eastern locations.


      Generally speaking, Massachusetts is east of Florida. The entire eastern coast
      of the US curves so that the Northeast (including Massachusetts) is typically
      east of the Southeast (including Florida).


      So without knowing the exact zip codes, the general answer would be NO, since
      Massachusetts is typically east of Florida.


      Let me be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 33715 appears to be in the St. Petersburg area of Florida, which is on the
      Gulf Coast (western side of Florida)

      - 01107 is likely in the Springfield area of Massachusetts, which is in the
      western part of Massachusetts


      Even though 01107 is in western Massachusetts, Massachusetts as a whole is far
      enough east that even western Massachusetts is likely east of western Florida.


      So my reasoning leads me to believe that 01107, MA is east of 33715, FL, not
      the other way around.</think># Is 33715, FL located east of 01107, MA?


      I need to determine the geographical positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 33715 is in Florida (FL), specifically in the St. Petersburg area on the Gulf
      Coast

      - 01107 is in Massachusetts (MA), likely in the Springfield area


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States

      - In the US, longitude determines east-west positioning (lower longitude numbers
      = more eastern)


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      - Even though Florida is south of Massachusetts, Massachusetts is generally
      east of Florida

      - The entire US eastern seaboard curves, putting the Northeast (including Massachusetts)
      east of the Southeast (including Florida)

      - Western Massachusetts (where 01107 is located) is still east of the Gulf Coast
      of Florida (where 33715 is located)


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 33715, FL is NOT located east of 01107, MA. It''s the opposite: 01107,
      MA is east of 33715, FL.'

      60136 is in Illinois (IL).

      25701 is in West Virginia (WV).


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of these states. The United

      - Eastern states are along the Atlantic coast

      - Western states are along the Pacific coast

      - Midwestern states are in the middle


      Illinois is in the Midwest, while West Virginia is in the Appalachian region

      Geographically:

      - Illinois is west of West Virginia

      - West Virginia is east of Illinois


      Since 60136 is in Illinois, and 25701 is in West Virginia, and Illinois is west

      First, let me identify what states IL and WV refer to:

      - WV is the abbreviation for West Virginia


      Now I need to think about the geographical locations of these states:

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - West Virginia is in the Appalachian region in the eastern part of the United

      To be more specific about the zip codes:

      - 60136 is a zip code in Illinois

      - 25701 is a zip code in West Virginia

      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship

      On a U.S. map, West Virginia is clearly positioned to the east of Illinois.
      Moving from Illinois to West Virginia, you would generally travel eastward,
      passing through Indiana and Ohio.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      When we think about the geographic layout of the US, Massachusetts is generally
      east of Pennsylvania. This is because Massachusetts is on the Atlantic coast,
      while Pennsylvania is more inland.


      So in general, locations in Massachusetts would be east of locations in Pennsylvania,
      not the other way around.


      Therefore, 15690, PA would be WEST of 02452, MA, not east of it.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these
      two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify what states these zip codes are in.

      - 15690 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 02452 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      Pennsylvania is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, while Massachusetts is in
      New England on the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Massachusetts is positioned to the
      east of Pennsylvania. Massachusetts sits directly on the Atlantic coast, while
      Pennsylvania is more inland.


      Step 4: Apply this geographic relationship to the zip codes.

      Since 15690 is in Pennsylvania and 02452 is in Massachusetts, the Pennsylvania
      zip code must be west of the Massachusetts zip code, not east of it.

      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two ZIP codes:

      - 29388, SC (South Carolina)

      - 08062, NJ (New Jersey)


      To figure out whether 29388, SC is east of 08062, NJ, I need to consider the
      geographic locations of these states and their ZIP codes.


      First, let''s recall the general geographic positions of South Carolina and
      New Jersey on the US East Coast:

      - New Jersey is in the northeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast

      - South Carolina is in the southeastern United States, also on the Atlantic
      coast


      In terms of east-west positioning, locations along the US East Coast generally
      follow this pattern: places with lower longitudes (more negative numbers) are
      further east.


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is east of South Carolina. The Atlantic coast
      runs in a northeast-southwest direction, so states further north on the East
      Coast tend to be further east than states further south.


      Since 29388 is in South Carolina, and 08062 is in New Jersey, it''s very likely
      that the New Jersey ZIP code is east of the South Carolina ZIP code.</think>#

      ## Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - New Jersey is located on the northeastern Atlantic coast

      - South Carolina is located on the southeastern Atlantic coast


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      - The US East Coast runs in a northeast to southwest direction

      - New Jersey, being further northeast, is generally east of South Carolina

      - ZIP codes follow this general state positioning


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since New Jersey is east of South Carolina, ZIP code 08062 in NJ is east of
      ZIP code 29388 in SC.

      east of 08062, NJ, I need to compare their relative east-west positions on a
      map of the United States.


      Let me first identify the locations:

      - 29388 is a ZIP code in South Carolina (SC)

      - 08062 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)


      In the United States, locations on the East Coast are generally more eastern
      than inland locations. New Jersey is on the East Coast, while South Carolina
      is also on the East Coast but further south.


      When comparing east-west positions, I need to think about longitudes. Lower
      longitude numbers in the US represent more eastern locations (since the US is
      in the Western Hemisphere where longitudes are negative numbers, but we typically
      drop the negative sign when discussing them).


      New Jersey is in the northeastern part of the US, while South Carolina is in
      the southeastern part. Generally speaking, New Jersey is slightly more east
      than South Carolina.


      So 08062, NJ is likely east of 29388, SC. This means 29388, SC is NOT east of
      08062, NJ.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      New Jersey is located on the northeastern Atlantic coast of the United States,
      while South Carolina is located on the southeastern Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions (longitudes)

      Although both states are on the East Coast, New Jersey is positioned further
      east than South Carolina. The eastern edge of New Jersey extends further into
      the Atlantic Ocean than South Carolina does.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion

      Since New Jersey is east of South Carolina, ZIP code 08062 in NJ would be east
      of ZIP code 29388 in SC. Therefore, 29388 is NOT east of 08062, but rather west

      (South Carolina) is located east of 08062, NJ (New Jersey).


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - NJ (New Jersey) is a state on the eastern coast of the United States

      - SC (South Carolina) is also on the eastern coast, but further south than New
      Jersey


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is roughly around the eastern edge of the United States

      - South Carolina is slightly more inland/western than New Jersey


      The question is specifically about whether the South Carolina zip code is east
      of the New Jersey zip code. Since New Jersey is generally more eastern than
      South Carolina on a map of the United States, the SC zip code is likely to be
      west of the NJ zip code, not east.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      - South Carolina is also on the Atlantic coast, but further south


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - New Jersey is positioned further east along the Atlantic coastline

      - South Carolina is positioned more westward (or inland) relative to New Jersey


      Step 4: Make the determination

      - When comparing locations on the east coast of the US, places further inland
      are westward, not eastward

      - Since South Carolina is west of New Jersey in terms of longitude, the SC zip
      code would be west of the NJ zip code


      NO - 29388, SC is not located east of 08062, NJ. It is located west of it.'

      29388 is in South Carolina (SC)

      08062 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      In the continental US, New Jersey is located on the East Coast, while South
      Carolina is also on the East Coast but further south.


      When we consider east-west positioning, we need to think about longitude. Eastern
      locations have higher longitude values than western locations.


      New Jersey is generally located east of South Carolina. The US East Coast curves
      so that northeastern states like NJ are typically east of southeastern states
      like SC.


      So generally speaking, 08062, NJ would be east of 29388, SC, not the other way
      around.


      Let me be more precise by trying to identify the specific locations:

      - 29388 appears to be in the Spartanburg/Wellford area of SC, in the western

      - 08062 appears to be in Mullica Hill, NJ, in the western part of NJ


      Even with both being in the western parts of their respective states, NJ as
      a whole is east of SC. So 08062, NJ would be east of 29388, SC.


      Therefore, 29388, SC is NOT located east of 08062, NJ. Rather, it''s the opposite

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 08062 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - New Jersey is located on the northeastern Atlantic coast

      - South Carolina is located on the southeastern Atlantic coast

      - The US East Coast curves so that northeastern states like NJ are positioned
      east of southeastern states like SC


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudes

      - New Jersey (including 08062) is farther east in longitude than South Carolina
      (including 29388)

      - Specifically, 29388 (Wellford, SC) is in western South Carolina

      - 08062 (Mullica Hill, NJ) is in western New Jersey, but even western NJ is
      still east of SC


      ## Conclusion

      NO. 29388, SC is NOT located east of 08062, NJ. It''s actually the reverse -

      To answer this, I need to know the geographical positions of these two locations
      relative to each other, particularly their east-west positioning.


      Let''s think about the geography of the United States:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - South Carolina (SC) is also on the East Coast, but further south than New

      - This is because the US East Coast curves, with the northern states (like NJ)
      being further east than southern states (like SC)


      So if New Jersey is east of South Carolina, then a zip code in NJ (08062) would

      First, let me identify the states:

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 08062 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      In the United States, New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard, while South Carolina
      is also on the eastern seaboard but further south.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      - South Carolina is located in the southeastern part of the United States


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is located further east than South Carolina.
      The easternmost point of NJ extends further out into the Atlantic Ocean than
      the easternmost point of SC.

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 29388 is in South Carolina (SC)

      - 08062 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - New Jersey is located on the northeastern Atlantic coast of the US

      - South Carolina is located on the southeastern Atlantic coast of the US


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - While both states are on the eastern seaboard, New Jersey extends further

      First, I need to identify the two locations:

      - 85255 is a zip code in Arizona (AZ)

      - 80130 is a zip code in Colorado (CO)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.
      In the US, lower longitude numbers indicate locations further east (since longitudes
      in the US are negative numbers, with the east coast having values around -70
      to -75 and the west coast having values around -120 to -125).


      Generally speaking:

      - Arizona is in the southwestern US

      - Colorado is in the central-western part of the US


      Geographically, Colorado is east of Arizona. This means that locations in Colorado
      typically have a more eastern (less negative) longitude than locations in Arizona.


      So 80130, CO would generally be east of 85255, AZ.


      Therefore, 85255, AZ is NOT east of 80130, CO. It''s the other way around -
      80130, CO is east of 85255, AZ.</think>I need to determine if 85255, AZ is east
      of 80130, CO by comparing their relative geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 85255 is in Arizona (AZ)

      - 80130 is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, while Colorado is located
      in the west-central part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Colorado sits to the east of Arizona.
      The entire state of Arizona is west of Colorado.


      Step 4: Therefore, any zip code in Arizona (including 85255) would be west of
      Colorado, not east of it.


      NO'

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Colorado is located in the western/central United States


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Colorado is generally east of
      Arizona. If you look at a map of the US, Arizona is to the west of Colorado.


      To be even more precise, I should consider the specific zip codes:

      - 85255 is in Scottsdale, Arizona

      - 80130 is in Highlands Ranch, Colorado


      But the general geographical relationship between the states holds for most
      locations within them. Colorado is east of Arizona, which means that 80130,
      CO is generally east of 85255, AZ.


      Therefore, 85255, AZ is NOT located east of 80130, CO. Rather, it''s located
      WEST of 80130, CO.</think>To determine if 85255, AZ is located east of 80130,

      - 85255 is in Scottsdale, Arizona

      - 80130 is in Highlands Ranch, Colorado


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Arizona and Colorado.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, while Colorado is located
      directly to the east of Arizona.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since Colorado is east of Arizona geographically, locations in Colorado (including
      80130) will generally be east of locations in Arizona (including 85255).


      Step 4: Confirm the relationship.

      If we were to look at a map, we would see that Scottsdale, AZ (85255) is west
      of Highlands Ranch, CO (80130), not east of it.

      36107 is a ZIP code in Alabama (AL)

      44030 is a ZIP code in Ohio (OH)

      - Locations further east have lower (more negative) longitude values in the

      - Alabama (AL) is a southeastern state

      - Ohio (OH) is a midwestern/eastern state


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Alabama is located south and east of Ohio

      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. To do this, I''ll

      Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States.

      Ohio (OH) is located in the midwestern/northeastern United States.


      Generally speaking, Ohio is east of most states in the Midwest, but Alabama
      is even further east since it''s part of the Southeast.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Alabama is approximately in line with the eastern part of Tennessee and western
      Georgia

      - Ohio is north of Kentucky and West Virginia, east of Indiana


      If you look at the US map, Alabama is indeed east of Ohio. Alabama is closer

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the midwestern/eastern United States

      Looking at a US map, Alabama sits significantly to the east of Ohio. Ohio borders
      Pennsylvania to its east, while Alabama is much closer to the Atlantic coast,
      bordering Georgia to its east.


      Step 3: While specific zip codes might vary somewhat within their states, the
      overall state positions determine that Alabama zip codes are generally east

      NO


      Actually, I made an error in my analysis. Looking more carefully at the US map,
      Ohio is actually EAST of Alabama. Ohio borders the eastern states of Pennsylvania
      and West Virginia, while Alabama is further west in the Southeast region. Therefore,

      east-west positions (longitudes).


      First, some context:

      - In the US, lower longitude numbers indicate more eastern locations (since
      US longitudes are negative numbers, with the East Coast having values around
      -70 to -80, and the West Coast having values around -120 to -130)

      - Texas (TX) is generally west of Louisiana (LA), but I need to check the specific
      ZIP codes


      76008 is a ZIP code in Texas, likely in the eastern part of the state.

      70712 is a ZIP code in Louisiana, likely in the western part of the state.


      Since Texas is generally west of Louisiana, it''s likely that 76008, TX is west
      of 70712, LA. But I need to be certain based on the specific locations.


      Texas is west of Louisiana, so generally speaking, locations in Texas have higher
      (more western) longitude values than locations in Louisiana. This means Texas
      locations are typically west of Louisiana locations, not east.</think># Determining
      if 76008, TX is east of 70712, LA


      I need to analyze the geographic positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      Texas (TX) is located west of Louisiana (LA) in the United States. The entire
      state of Louisiana is east of most of Texas.


      ## Step 2: Analyze the specific ZIP codes

      - 76008 is a ZIP code in Texas, likely in the north-central part of the state

      - 70712 is a ZIP code in Louisiana, likely in the western part of Louisiana


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      Since Louisiana borders Texas on Texas''s eastern side, and all of Louisiana
      is east of most of Texas, a ZIP code in Louisiana (70712) would be east of a
      ZIP code in Texas (76008).


      This means 76008, TX is NOT east of 70712, LA. Rather, it''s the opposite -
      70712, LA is east of 76008, TX.

      east of 70712, LA, I need to understand the relative positions of these zip
      codes on a map.


      First, I know that TX is Texas and LA is Louisiana. Geographically speaking,
      Louisiana is generally east of Texas (Louisiana is on the Gulf Coast to the
      east of Texas).


      The zip codes themselves also give some information. In the US zip code system:

      - The first digit generally indicates a broad geographical region

      - 7xxxx zip codes cover the central south region of the US


      But to be more specific:

      - 76xxx zip codes are in north central Texas

      - 70xxx zip codes are in Louisiana


      Given that Louisiana is east of Texas, and these zip codes follow the standard
      geographical patterns, 76008 (TX) would be west of 70712 (LA).


      Therefore, 76008, TX is NOT located east of 70712, LA. It''s located west of
      it.</think># Is 76008, TX located east of 70712, LA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      Texas is located to the west of Louisiana on the US map. Louisiana borders Texas
      on Texas''s eastern side.


      ## Step 3: Consider the zip codes

      In the US postal system, zip codes within the same first digit (7 in this case)
      are in the same general region, but the specific locations follow state boundaries.
      Since these zip codes are in different states, their relative position follows
      the states'' relative position.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Texas is west of Louisiana, a zip code in Texas (76008) would be west
      of a zip code in Louisiana (70712), not east of it.

      First, I should recall the general geography of Texas (TX) and Louisiana (LA).
      Texas is located west of Louisiana. That is, Louisiana is east of Texas.


      Since 76008 is in Texas and 70712 is in Louisiana, the general rule would be
      that the Texas location is west of the Louisiana location, not east of it.


      However, I should be careful - zip codes don''t perfectly follow state boundaries,

      be west of most of Louisiana.


      So, 76008, TX should be west of 70712, LA, not east of it.</think>To determine
      if 76008, TX is located east of 70712, LA, I need to consider the geographic

      - 76008 is in Texas (TX)

      - 70712 is in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Louisiana is located directly east of Texas

      - Texas is located to the west of Louisiana


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the zip codes.

      Since 76008 is in Texas and 70712 is in Louisiana, and Texas is west of Louisiana,
      it follows that 76008, TX must be west of 70712, LA - not east of it.

      In the US, zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers tend to
      be in the eastern parts of the country and higher numbers tend to be in the
      western parts. The first digit of the zip code normally indicates a geographical
      region, with 0 being the farthest east (New England) and 9 being the farthest
      west (West Coast).


      Here we have:

      - 76008 in Texas (first digit 7)

      - 70712 in Louisiana (first digit 7)


      Since both have the same first digit (7), I need to look more closely. Within

      code is east of the New Jersey zip code by comparing their relative positions.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of these states.

      Michigan (MI) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      New Jersey (NJ) is located on the East Coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states relative to each other.

      The East Coast (where New Jersey is located) is, as the name suggests, on the
      eastern side of the United States.

      The Midwest region (where Michigan is located) is west of the East Coast.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific zip codes.

      Since 48085 is in Michigan and 08750 is in New Jersey, and New Jersey is east
      of Michigan, it follows that 08750, NJ would be east of 48085, MI - not the

      48085 is a zip code in Michigan (MI). Michigan is in the Midwest region of the
      US.

      08750 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is on the East Coast of the

      Generally, locations on the East Coast of the US are east of locations in the
      Midwest. The East Coast, including New Jersey, is further east than Michigan.


      So in general, we would expect a New Jersey zip code to be east of a Michigan
      zip code. This means the New Jersey zip code 08750 is likely east of the Michigan
      zip code 48085.


      Therefore, 48085, MI is NOT east of 08750, NJ. Rather, it''s the opposite -

      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general locations.

      - 48085 is in Michigan (MI), which is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - 08750 is in New Jersey (NJ), which is on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States

      - Michigan is located further west, around the Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Consider their east-west positioning.

      - States on the East Coast (like New Jersey) are generally east of Midwestern
      states (like Michigan)

      - The longitude of New Jersey locations is generally further east than Michigan
      locations


      Therefore, 48085, MI is NOT east of 08750, NJ. Rather, 08750, NJ is east of

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 48085 is a ZIP code in Michigan (MI)

      - 08750 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the relative geographical positions of Michigan and New Jersey

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      In the United States, locations are generally considered "east" or "west" based
      on their longitude. The East Coast states like New Jersey are generally east
      of Midwestern states like Michigan.


      Therefore, New Jersey (including 08750) would be east of Michigan (including

      of 08750, NJ


      I need to check the relative geographical positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 48085 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 08750 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New Jersey
      is located on the East Coast.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      When looking at a map of the United States, New Jersey is clearly located to
      the east of Michigan. The East Coast (where NJ is) is east of the Midwest (where
      MI is).


      ## Conclusion

      Since New Jersey is east of Michigan, ZIP code 08750, NJ is east of ZIP code
      48085, MI, not the other way around.

      PA is located east of 11563, NY.


      To determine this, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located geographically,
      and then determine their east-west positioning relative to each other.


      First, let me think about what I know about zip codes in the US:

      - Zip codes generally start with lower numbers in the east and higher numbers
      in the west

      - The first digit typically indicates a broad region (0-1 for Northeast, etc.)


      17202 is in PA (Pennsylvania), which is in the eastern US

      11563 is in NY (New York), which is also in the eastern US


      Based on the zip code patterns:

      - 11xxx zip codes are typically in New York

      - 17xxx zip codes are typically in Pennsylvania


      In general, New York is east of Pennsylvania. So if we''re comparing standard
      geographical positions, a NY zip code would typically be east of a PA zip code.


      So 11563, NY would likely be east of 17202, PA, not the other way around.


      Therefore, 17202, PA is NOT located east of 11563, NY.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip codes
      and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the regions for these zip codes.

      - 11563 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographical relationship between these states.

      - New York is located to the east of Pennsylvania on the US map.


      Step 3: While specific zip codes within states can sometimes create exceptions
      to general state positioning, the zip code numbering system generally follows
      regional patterns.

      - The 115xx series indicates Long Island/NYC area in New York

      - The 172xx series indicates south-central Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Based on the standard locations of these zip codes, 11563 NY (likely
      in Long Island) would be east of 17202 PA (in south-central Pennsylvania).


      NO, 17202 PA is not located east of 11563 NY. It''s actually located west of
      it.'

      17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).

      11563 is a zip code in New York (NY).


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Pennsylvania on a map of the United
      States. Pennsylvania is west of New York.


      To be more precise:

      - 17202 appears to be a zip code in the south-central part of Pennsylvania,
      likely in the Chambersburg area.

      - 11563 appears to be a zip code in Long Island, New York.


      Long Island is definitely on the eastern side of New York state, and New York
      state is east of Pennsylvania. So 11563, NY would be east of 17202, PA.


      Therefore, 17202, PA is NOT east of 11563, NY. Rather, it''s the opposite -
      11563, NY is east of 17202, PA.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 11563 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - New York state is generally located to the east of Pennsylvania on a US map.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - 17202 is in south-central Pennsylvania (likely Chambersburg area)

      - 11563 is in Long Island, New York, which is on the eastern part of New York


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positions.

      is located east of 11563, NY. For this, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      For US zip codes:

      - First digit represents a group of states (generally from east to west)

      - 0xx-1xx tends to be northeast

      - 1xx is often more central-east

      - Higher numbers tend to be further west


      Let''s analyze:

      - 17202 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 11563 is in New York (NY)


      Based on the first digits:

      - 1xxxx zip codes are generally in the eastern US

      - Both start with 1, but 11xxx is typically further east than 17xxx


      New York is generally east of Pennsylvania. The first two digits (11 vs 17)
      suggest that the NY zip code is further east.


      To be more precise, 11xxx zip codes are typically in the NYC area or Long Island,
      which is definitely east of central PA where 17xxx zip codes are located (likely
      around Harrisburg area).

      - 17202 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 11563 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Analyze their relative positions.

      - 11xxx zip codes typically cover Long Island and parts of New York City

      - 17xxx zip codes typically cover central Pennsylvania, around Harrisburg


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      - New York (especially Long Island/NYC area) is located east of Pennsylvania

      - Specifically, zip code 11563 is in the Long Island area of NY

      - 17202 is in central Pennsylvania, which is west of Long Island


      Step 4: Compare positions.

      Since 11563, NY (on Long Island) is east of 17202, PA (in central Pennsylvania),
      the Pennsylvania location is NOT east of the New York location.

      To solve this problem, I need to consider the geographic locations of these
      zip codes.


      Step 1: I need to understand the general geographic relationship between Missouri
      (MO) and Kentucky (KY).

      Missouri is generally located to the west of Kentucky in the United States.


      Step 2: Now let''s consider the specific zip codes.

      64701 is in Missouri (MO)

      40175 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 3: Since Missouri is west of Kentucky, and these zip codes are in their
      respective states, it''s very likely that 64701, MO is west of 40175, KY, not
      east.


      This is the general geographic relationship, though there could be exceptions
      if these zip codes were at the extreme borders of their states. However, typical
      zip code patterns follow the general east-west orientation of the states.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 64701 is in Missouri (MO)

      - 40175 is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Missouri and Kentucky are both in the central eastern part of the United States.
      Looking at a map of the US, Missouri is positioned to the west of Kentucky.
      The entire state of Missouri lies west of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Determine the relative position of the zip codes.

      Since 64701 is in Missouri and 40175 is in Kentucky, and Missouri is west of
      Kentucky, it follows that 64701, MO must be west (not east) of 40175, KY.


      NO'

      east-west positioning:

      1. 64701, MO (Missouri)

      2. 40175, KY (Kentucky)


      First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of Missouri and Kentucky.
      Missouri is generally west of Kentucky in the US.


      Missouri is located in the Midwest region, while Kentucky is in the East South
      Central region. On a US map, Kentucky is positioned east of Missouri.


      So generally, locations in Missouri tend to be west of locations in Kentucky.
      But I need to be careful, since states have irregular shapes and border areas
      might not follow this general pattern.


      Given zip code 64701 is in Missouri and 40175 is in Kentucky, and the general
      geographic relationship between these states, I can reasonably conclude that
      64701, MO would be west of 40175, KY - not east.</think># Is 64701, MO located

      ## Step 1: Geographic location of the states

      - Missouri (MO) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the East South Central region of the United States

      - Looking at the US map, Kentucky is positioned to the east of Missouri


      ## Step 2: Zip code locations

      - 64701 is a zip code in Missouri

      - 40175 is a zip code in Kentucky


      ## Step 3: East-west orientation

      Since Missouri is west of Kentucky on the US map, and these zip codes are within
      their respective states, 64701 in Missouri would be west of 40175 in Kentucky
      - not east of it.

      east of 40175, KY, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located and
      compare their geographical positions.


      Let me think about US zip codes:

      - Generally, lower numbers are in the eastern US and higher numbers in the western
      US

      - First digit of zip codes roughly divides the country from east to west

      - 0-1 are Northeast

      - 2-3 are Mid-Atlantic and Southeast

      - 4-5 are Midwest and South

      - 6-7 are Central and Southwest

      - 8-9 are West and Northwest


      So just from the first digits:

      - 64701 has first digit 6, which is in the Central region

      - 40175 has first digit 4, which is in the Midwest/South region


      Since eastern regions have lower first digits in zip codes, and 4 is lower than
      6, this suggests that 40175, KY is east of 64701, MO.


      Also, Missouri (MO) is generally west of Kentucky (KY) geographically, which
      aligns with this conclusion.</think># Is 64701, MO located east of 40175, KY?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Understand the zip code system

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are in the eastern
      US and higher numbers are in the western US. The first digit is particularly
      important for general geographic location.


      ## Step 2: Analyze the first digits

      - 64701 starts with "6" (Missouri) - this belongs to the Central region

      - 40175 starts with "4" (Kentucky) - this belongs to the Midwest/South region


      ## Step 3: Compare geographical locations

      Since lower first digits indicate more eastern locations in the zip code system,
      and 4 is lower than 6, this suggests Kentucky is east of Missouri.


      Additionally, looking at their state locations, Kentucky is indeed east of Missouri
      on the US map.

      70444 is a ZIP code in Louisiana (LA).

      22936 is a ZIP code in Virginia (VA).


      In the United States, locations in the eastern states are generally east of
      locations in more central or western states. Virginia (VA) is on the east coast
      of the United States, while Louisiana (LA) is in the southern part of the country,
      closer to the central region.


      Geographically speaking, Virginia is located east of Louisiana. This means that
      locations in Virginia would generally be east of locations in Louisiana.


      Therefore, 22936, VA would be east of 70444, LA - not the other way around.</think>#
      Is 70444, LA located east of 22936, VA?


      Let me work through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: 70444 is in Louisiana (LA) and 22936
      is in Virginia (VA).


      2) Looking at a map of the United States, Louisiana is located in the southeastern
      part of the country along the Gulf of Mexico.


      3) Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, along the
      Atlantic Ocean.


      4) When comparing their positions, Virginia is clearly east of Louisiana on
      a map of the United States.


      5) Since ZIP code 22936 is in Virginia, and ZIP code 70444 is in Louisiana,
      the Virginia ZIP code must be east of the Louisiana ZIP code.


      Therefore, 70444, LA is NOT located east of 22936, VA. The correct relationship
      is that 22936, VA is east of 70444, LA.

      First, I''ll think about the general geographic locations of these states:

      - Louisiana (LA) is located in the southern part of the United States, along
      the Gulf of Mexico

      - Virginia (VA) is located on the east coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Virginia is on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Louisiana is much further west than Virginia


      Generally, locations in Virginia will be east of locations in Louisiana. Since
      we''re comparing whether 70444, LA is east of 22936, VA, I need to determine
      if the Louisiana zip code is east of the Virginia zip code, which would be unusual
      given the states'' positions.


      Since Virginia is on the east coast and Louisiana is much further west, it''s

      in the southern part of the country along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: When comparing east-west positions, states along the east coast (like
      Virginia) are generally east of states in the south-central region (like Louisiana).


      Step 3: Looking at a US map, all of Louisiana is west of Virginia. Even the
      easternmost point of Louisiana would be west of the westernmost point of Virginia.


      Step 4: Therefore, zip code 70444 in Louisiana must be west of zip code 22936

      the relative positions of two ZIP codes: 40109 in Kentucky (KY) and 05677 in
      Vermont (VT).


      To answer this, I need to determine whether Kentucky is east of Vermont.


      The United States is generally oriented with the East Coast on the right (east)
      side and the West Coast on the left (west) side when looking at a map. Vermont
      (VT) is located in the northeastern part of the United States, specifically
      in the New England region along the East Coast. Kentucky (KY) is located in
      the south-central/southeastern part of the United States.


      Comparing their locations:

      - Vermont is far to the northeast

      - Kentucky is more south and central


      In terms of east-west positioning, Vermont is actually farther east than Kentucky.
      The eastern states along the Atlantic Ocean (including Vermont) are generally
      farther east than inland states like Kentucky.


      So, no, 40109, KY is NOT located east of 05677, VT. Kentucky is west of Vermont.</think>#
      Is 40109, KY located east of 05677, VT?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these zip codes in Kentucky
      and Vermont.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) First, I need to identify the general geographic positions of Kentucky (KY)
      and Vermont (VT) within the United States.


      2) Vermont is located in the northeastern part of the United States, specifically
      in the New England region along the East Coast.


      3) Kentucky is located in the south-central/southeastern part of the United
      States, significantly inland from the East Coast.


      4) When considering longitude (east-west positioning), Vermont lies further
      east than Kentucky.


      5) All of Vermont, including zip code 05677, is east of all of Kentucky, including
      zip code 40109.


      6) Therefore, Kentucky (including 40109) is west of Vermont (including 05677),
      not east of it.


      NO'

      step.


      First, I need to identify the locations of these ZIP codes:

      - 40109 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 05677 is in Vermont (VT)


      Now I need to determine their relative positions east/west of each other.


      Kentucky is in the eastern half of the United States, but it''s in the southeast/central-east
      region.

      Vermont is in the northeast of the United States, specifically in New England.


      When comparing east/west positions in the US, we need to compare longitudes.
      The further east a location is, the lower (more negative) its longitude number.


      Generally speaking, Vermont is further east than Kentucky. Vermont borders New
      Hampshire and is close to the Atlantic Ocean, while Kentucky is more inland
      and west of the Appalachian Mountains.


      So 40109, KY would be west of 05677, VT, not east of it.</think># Is 40109,
      KY located east of 05677, VT?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 40109 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 05677 is in Vermont (VT)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Vermont (VT) is located in the northeastern United States, in the New England
      region

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the eastern-central United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      Looking at a US map, Vermont is clearly further east than Kentucky. Vermont
      borders New Hampshire and is near the Atlantic Ocean, while Kentucky is significantly
      further west in the country.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 40109, KY is NOT located east of 05677, VT. Kentucky is west of Vermont.'

      1. I need to determine if zip code 40109 in Kentucky (KY) is located east of
      zip code 05677 in Vermont (VT)

      2. To solve this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of these
      locations


      First, let''s consider the general geographic locations of these states:

      - Vermont (VT) is in the northeastern United States, near the Canadian border

      - Kentucky (KY) is in the southeastern/east-central United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Vermont is definitely in the eastern part of the United States

      - Kentucky is also in the eastern half of the US, but generally west of Vermont


      To be more precise, I need to think about the longitude (east-west positioning)
      of these locations. East would mean further right on a US map, or a higher longitude
      value.


      Vermont is one of the easternmost states, while Kentucky is more central/south.
      Based on general US geography, Vermont would be east of Kentucky, not the other
      way around.


      So zip code 40109 in KY would be WEST of zip code 05677 in VT, not east of it.</think>#

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. The zip code 40109 is in Kentucky (KY), which is located in the east-central
      part of the United States.

      2. The zip code 05677 is in Vermont (VT), which is located in the northeastern
      United States.

      3. When looking at a map of the United States, Vermont is positioned further
      east than Kentucky.

      4. This means that locations in Vermont generally have a more easterly longitude
      than locations in Kentucky.

      5. Therefore, 40109 (KY) would be west of 05677 (VT), not east of it.

      - Kentucky is situated further inland and west of Vermont


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - US states generally follow a pattern where lower zip codes are in the eastern
      parts of the country and higher zip codes in the western parts

      - Vermont (05677) has a lower zip code than Kentucky (40109), consistent with
      Vermont being further east

      - On a map, Vermont is clearly east of Kentucky, not the other way around


      NO, 40109, KY is not located east of 05677, VT. Kentucky is west of Vermont.'

      First, let''s identify these locations:

      - 48219 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      - 06379 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)


      In the United States, states on the east coast are generally farther east than

      is generally east of Michigan.


      If Connecticut is east of Michigan, then a ZIP code in Connecticut (06379) would
      be east of a ZIP code in Michigan (48219).


      Therefore, 48219, MI would be WEST of 06379, CT - not east of it.</think>To
      determine if 48219, MI is located east of 06379, CT, I need to consider the
      geographic locations of Michigan and Connecticut.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations in the US.

      - Connecticut (CT) is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions.

      - Connecticut is significantly further east than Michigan.

      - The entire state of Connecticut lies east of Michigan.


      Step 3: Apply this to specific ZIP codes.

      - ZIP code 06379 is in Connecticut.

      - ZIP code 48219 is in Michigan.

      - Since Connecticut is east of Michigan, any Connecticut ZIP code (including
      06379) would be east of any Michigan ZIP code (including 48219).


      Step 4: Determine the answer to the specific question.

      - The question asks if 48219, MI is east of 06379, CT.

      - Since Michigan is west of Connecticut, 48219 must be west (not east) of 06379.

      Let me break down the information:

      - 48219 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      - 06379 is a zip code in Connecticut (CT)


      To answer whether one location is east of another in the US, I need to compare
      their longitudes. Lower (more negative) longitude values are further west, while
      higher (less negative) longitude values are further east.


      Let me think about the general geographic positions:

      - Connecticut (CT) is on the east coast of the United States, part of the New
      England region

      - Michigan (MI) is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Generally speaking, Connecticut is east of Michigan in the United States. So
      without knowing the exact coordinates, I would expect the CT zip code to be
      east of the MI zip code.


      Therefore, 48219, MI would NOT be east of 06379, CT. Instead, 06379, CT would

      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - Connecticut is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      Connecticut is significantly east of Michigan in the United States. This is
      true regardless of the specific locations within each state.


      Step 4: Make the determination about the specific zip codes

      Since Connecticut is east of Michigan, zip code 06379 in CT must be east of
      zip code 48219 in MI.

      The question is asking whether the Michigan zip code location is east of the

      In the United States, Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania. This
      means that locations in Pennsylvania are typically west of locations in Massachusetts.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since 15468 is in Pennsylvania and 01810 is in Massachusetts, the Pennsylvania
      zip code would be west of the Massachusetts zip code, not east of it.

    c79cea67-3bb1-46b4-955a-a4a3a74df874: '<think>Alright, to determine if one location
      is east of another location in the US, I need to first identify what these zip
      codes correspond to, and then determine their relative positions.


      15468 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA).

      01810 is a zip code in Massachusetts (MA).


      Now I need to determine which one is further east. In the US, the east coast
      is on the Atlantic Ocean, and as you move west, you move toward the Pacific
      Ocean. Generally speaking:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is in the northeastern United States, part of the New England
      region

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the northeastern/mid-Atlantic United States, but is
      west of Massachusetts


      The longitude decreases as you move east in the northern hemisphere. So a location
      further east will have a smaller longitude value.


      Based on the general geography of the US, Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania.
      Therefore, 01810, MA (in Massachusetts) should be east of 15468, PA (in Pennsylvania).


      So if the question is "Is 15468, PA located east of 01810, MA?", the answer
      would be NO - it''s the opposite; 01810, MA is east of 15468, PA.</think># Is
      15468, PA located east of 01810, MA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 15468 is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - 01810 is in Massachusetts (MA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States (New England region)

      - Pennsylvania is located in the mid-Atlantic region


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      Looking at a map of the United States, Massachusetts is clearly located to the
      east of Pennsylvania. The entire state of Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania''s
      eastern border.


      ## Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 15468 is in Pennsylvania and 01810 is in Massachusetts, the zip code in
      Massachusetts must be east of the zip code in Pennsylvania, not the other way
      around.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - South Carolina is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The East Coast states (including South Carolina) are generally east of the
      Midwest states (including Illinois)

      - On a map of the United States, South Carolina is clearly east of Illinois


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since the zip codes follow the geographic positions of their respective states,
      60626 (Illinois) is west of 29405 (South Carolina), not east of it.

      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 76001 is in Texas (TX)

      - 45449 is in Ohio (OH)


      On a United States map, Ohio is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the country,
      while Texas is in the South/Southwest part.


      Looking at their relative positions, Ohio is clearly east of Texas. The entire
      state of Ohio is east of Texas.


      If Ohio is east of Texas, then 45449, OH must be east of 76001, TX. This means
      that 76001, TX is NOT east of 45449, OH, but rather west of it.</think>To determine
      if 76001, TX is located east of 45449, OH, I need to consider the geographic

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 76001 is in Texas (TX)

      - 45449 is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Ohio

      - On a US map, Texas is located in the southern/southwestern region of the United
      States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/eastern region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions

      - Ohio is significantly east of Texas on the map

      - All of Ohio lies east of all of Texas


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      - Since 45449 is in Ohio, and 76001 is in Texas, the Ohio zip code must be east
      of the Texas zip code

      - Therefore, 76001, TX is west of 45449, OH (not east)

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/eastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Ohio is clearly east of Texas.

      - Moving from Texas to Ohio requires traveling eastward.

      - This means that a location in Texas (like 76001) would be west of a location

      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 76001, TX is a ZIP code in Texas

      - 45449, OH is a ZIP code in Ohio


      To determine if one location is east of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      East corresponds to moving toward lower longitude numbers in the US (since longitude
      decreases as you move eastward in the US).


      Texas is generally west of Ohio in the United States. This means that locations
      in Texas typically have higher longitude values (more westward) than locations
      in Ohio.


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I can conclude that:

      - Texas is west of Ohio

      - Therefore, a ZIP code in Texas (76001) would be west of a ZIP code in Ohio
      (45449)

      - 76001 is in Texas (TX)

      - 45449 is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      In the United States, Ohio is located in the Midwest/Eastern region, while Texas
      is located in the South/Southwest region. On a map of the US, Ohio is positioned
      significantly east of Texas.


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 76001 is in Texas and 45449 is in Ohio, the Texas zip code must be west

      not east of it.</think># Is 68152, NE located east of 34224, FL?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) 68152 is a zip code in Nebraska (NE)

      2) 34224 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      3) In the United States, states are positioned with the East Coast on the Atlantic
      Ocean and the West Coast on the Pacific Ocean

      4) Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States along the
      Atlantic Ocean

      5) Nebraska is a midwestern state located in the central part of the country

      6) Moving from east to west in the US, you would encounter Florida before Nebraska

      7) Therefore, Nebraska is west of Florida, not east of it

      The United States generally has a west-to-east orientation in terms of zip codes,
      with lower numbers in the east and higher numbers in the west. However, there
      are many exceptions to this pattern, so I can''t rely solely on the zip code
      numbers.


      Instead, I need to think about the geographic locations of Nebraska and Florida:

      States

      - Florida is a Southeastern state, located along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf
      of Mexico in the eastern/southeastern part of the United States


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Nebraska is further west than Florida

      - Florida is further east than Nebraska


      Since 68152 is in Nebraska, and 34224 is in Florida, and Florida is east of

      - 47834 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic position of these states.

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Indiana is positioned further east in the country than Oklahoma

      - On a standard map of the US, Indiana is clearly east of Oklahoma


      Step 4: Since these states are not adjacent and are significantly separated,
      the relative positions of the specific zip codes will generally follow the positions
      of their states.


      NO. 73701, OK is not located east of 47834, IN. Instead, 47834, IN is located
      east of 73701, OK.'

      to determine if the zip code 73701 in Oklahoma (OK) is located east of zip code
      47834 in Indiana (IN).


      First, let me think about the geographic locations of Oklahoma and Indiana within
      the United States:

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central part of the US

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Indiana is generally located east of Oklahoma in the United States


      Since the question is asking if 73701, OK is east of 47834, IN, I need to determine
      if Oklahoma is east of Indiana, which it is not. Oklahoma is west of Indiana.


      Therefore, 73701, OK (a zip code in Oklahoma) should be west of 47834, IN (a
      zip code in Indiana).</think># Is 73701, OK located east of 47834, IN?

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central region of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning

      When looking at a map of the United States, Indiana is clearly positioned to
      the east of Oklahoma. The entire state of Indiana lies east of Oklahoma.


      ## Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes

      Since 73701 is in Oklahoma and 47834 is in Indiana, and Oklahoma is west of
      Indiana, it follows that 73701 is west of 47834 (not east).

      73701 in Oklahoma (OK) is located east of the zip code 47834 in Indiana (IN).


      To solve this, I''ll need to know the relative geographical positions of these
      two zip codes.


      In the US, the general pattern for zipcodes is that they increase from east
      to west. The east coast typically has lower zip codes (starting around 0xxxx
      and 1xxxx) and they increase as you go westward, with the west coast having
      higher zip codes (9xxxx).


      Let''s analyze:

      - 47834 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 73701 is in Oklahoma (OK)


      The first digits are important:

      - 4xxxx codes are typically in the eastern part of the Midwest

      - 7xxxx codes are typically in the central-south area


      Geographically, Indiana is located in the eastern part of the Midwest, while
      Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States.


      On a map of the US, Indiana is definitely east of Oklahoma. So if I''m asked
      if Oklahoma (73701) is east of Indiana (47834), the answer would be NO. Oklahoma
      is west of Indiana, not east of it.</think>To determine if 73701, OK is located

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 73701 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 47834 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of the United States, while
      Indiana is in the Midwest region, specifically in the eastern part of the Midwest.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      When looking at a US map, Indiana is clearly positioned to the east of Oklahoma.
      Moving from Oklahoma to Indiana would require traveling eastward.


      Since Oklahoma is west of Indiana (not east), zip code 73701 in Oklahoma cannot
      be east of zip code 47834 in Indiana.

      Now I need to consider the geographic positions of these states. In the US:

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Oklahoma (OK) is located in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Consider their east-west positioning.

      - Indiana is significantly east of Oklahoma

      - On a map of the United States, Indiana is closer to the East Coast, while
      Oklahoma is closer to the center of the country


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      Since Indiana is east of Oklahoma, a zip code in Oklahoma (73701) cannot be

      if 79331, TX is located east of 60137, IL.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify where 79331, TX is located in Texas

      2. Identify where 60137, IL is located in Illinois

      3. Compare their relative east-west positions (longitudes)


      I know that generally:

      - Texas is located in the southern central part of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the midwest/north-central United States


      Generally speaking, Illinois is east of Texas on a map of the United States.
      This would suggest that 60137, IL would be east of 79331, TX.


      So the answer would be: No, 79331, TX is NOT located east of 60137, IL. Rather,

      - The "7" prefix for 79331 indicates Texas, in the south-central region


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudes

      States in the Midwest (like Illinois) are positioned east of south-central states
      (like Texas). The zip code 60137 in Illinois would be east of 79331 in Texas.

      Let me break this down:

      1. 22407 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      2. 11239 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Now I need to think about the general geographic positions of these states and
      these specific zip codes.


      Virginia is generally south of New York. On an east-west axis:

      - New York is in the northeastern US

      - Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic region


      To be more precise:

      - 22407 appears to be in the Fredericksburg area of Virginia

      - 11239 appears to be in Brooklyn, New York City


      Fredericksburg, VA is west of the Atlantic coast, but not as far east as New
      York City which is right on the Atlantic.


      NYC (including Brooklyn where 11239 is) is further east than most of Virginia,

      - 22407 is a zip code in Fredericksburg area, Virginia (VA)

      - 11239 is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York City, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these locations.

      - New York City, including Brooklyn, is located on the Atlantic coast in the
      northeastern United States.

      - Fredericksburg, Virginia is located in the mid-Atlantic region, inland from
      the coast.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New York City is further east than Fredericksburg, Virginia.

      - On a map of the United States, 11239 (Brooklyn) would be positioned to the
      right (east) of 22407 (Fredericksburg).

      First, let me identify these zip codes:

      - 22407 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 11239 is in New York (NY)


      To determine which is further east, I need to know their relative geographic
      positions. In the United States:

      - Virginia is south of New York

      - The eastern seaboard runs roughly northeast to southwest

      - New York is generally northeast of Virginia


      Looking at the general geography of the US east coast:

      Therefore, a zip code in NY (11239) is likely to be east of a zip code in VA
      (22407).


      To be more specific:

      - 11239 is likely in New York City area (NYC zip codes often start with 10,

      of 22150, VA, I need to find the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)


      In terms of the general geography of the United States:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Virginia is also in the eastern United States, but more northeastern compared
      to Georgia


      While both states are on the eastern seaboard, Virginia is generally north of
      Georgia. However, the question asks about east/west positioning, not north/south.


      Looking at the map of the eastern United States, Virginia is generally positioned
      to the east of Georgia. Georgia''s eastern border is the Atlantic Ocean, but
      most of the state is inland. Virginia also borders the Atlantic Ocean, and its
      eastern portions extend further east than Georgia does.


      So generally speaking, locations in Virginia tend to be east of locations in
      Georgia, not the other way around.


      Without specific coordinates for these zip codes, I can make the general assessment
      that 31210 in GA is likely WEST of 22150 in VA, not east of it.</think># Is
      31210, GA located east of 22150, VA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 31210 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 22150 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Virginia is also on the east coast, but positioned northeast of Georgia


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Although both states border the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia generally extends
      further east than Georgia.

      - On a map of the United States, Virginia is positioned to the east of Georgia.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Virginia is east of Georgia on the U.S. map, a zip code in Georgia would
      be west of a zip code in Virginia, not east.


      NO'

      31210 is a zip code in Georgia (GA).

      22150 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).


      Now I need to think about the relative positions of these states:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Virginia is also in the eastern United States, but it''s located northeast
      of Georgia


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - Virginia is along the Atlantic coast, roughly in the middle of the East Coast

      - Georgia is also along the Atlantic coast, but further south


      When comparing east-west positioning:

      - Georgia is generally west of Virginia

      - Virginia is generally east of Georgia


      So if 31210 is in Georgia and 22150 is in Virginia, then 31210, GA is likely
      WEST of 22150, VA (not east).


      To be more specific:

      - 31210 appears to be in Macon, Georgia, which is in central Georgia

      - 22150 appears to be in Springfield, Virginia, which is in northern Virginia
      near Washington DC


      Looking at their positions on a map, Macon, GA is definitely west of Springfield,
      VA. Georgia''s eastern border with the Atlantic Ocean is still west of most
      of Virginia.</think># Is 31210, GA located east of 22150, VA?

      - 31210 is a zip code in Georgia (GA), specifically in the Macon area in central
      Georgia

      - 22150 is a zip code in Virginia (VA), in the Springfield area near Washington
      D.C.


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Georgia is also on the eastern seaboard, but further south

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Virginia is generally east of Georgia

      - Even the easternmost parts of Georgia are typically west of northern Virginia


      ## Step 3: Make the comparison

      - Macon, GA (31210) is in central Georgia

      - Springfield, VA (22150) is in northern Virginia near the Atlantic coast

      - When looking at a map, Macon is clearly west of Springfield

      To determine this, I need to consider the geographical locations of these zip
      codes.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - IA is Iowa, which is in the Midwest

      - MI is Michigan, which is also in the Midwest


      In general, Michigan is east of Iowa. Michigan borders Lake Michigan on its
      western side, while Iowa is further west, bordering the Mississippi River on
      its eastern side.


      Since we''re comparing specific zip codes, I should be careful, but the general

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Iowa is located in the Midwest region, while Michigan is also in the Midwest
      but positioned to the east of Iowa. Iowa borders the Mississippi River on its
      eastern side, while Michigan surrounds parts of the Great Lakes.


      Step 3: Determine relative positioning

      When looking at a US map, Michigan is positioned to the east of Iowa. All zip

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Michigan is also in the Midwest, but positioned to the east of Iowa


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Iowa sits to the west of Michigan

      - Therefore, any location in Iowa would generally be west of locations in Michigan

      - Since 50703 is in Iowa and 49453 is in Michigan, the Iowa zip code would be

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 50703 is in Iowa (IA)

      - 49453 is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Iowa is located in the central Midwest region of the United States, while Michigan
      is in the eastern Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      Michigan is located east of Iowa on the US map. Iowa borders the Mississippi
      River on its east side, while Michigan is further east, bordering the Great
      Lakes.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the zip codes.

      Since Iowa is west of Michigan, zip code 50703 in Iowa must be west of zip code
      49453 in Michigan, not east of it.

      2) To determine this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of these

      4) However, more importantly, I need to consider the states themselves. Iowa
      (IA) is west of Michigan (MI). Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the
      eastern part of the Midwest, while Iowa is further west in the Midwest.


      5) Since Iowa is west of Michigan, it would be unusual for a zip code in Iowa
      to be east of a zip code in Michigan. In fact, it''s geographically impossible
      for any part of Iowa to be east of any part of Michigan.

      Step 3: Analyze the geographic relationship

      - All of Iowa is located west of Michigan

      - Since 50703 is in Iowa and 49453 is in Michigan, the Iowa zip code must be
      west of the Michigan zip code

      - It''s geographically impossible for any point in Iowa to be east of any point

      is east of 49453, MI (Michigan), I need to think about the geographic locations
      of these two zip codes.


      First, I need to recall the general geographic positions of Iowa and Michigan:

      - Iowa is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle of the United States

      - Michigan is also in the Midwest, but it''s further east than Iowa


      In general, Michigan is east of Iowa. However, I should be more precise about
      these specific zip codes.


      The zip code system in the US generally follows a pattern where codes increase
      as you go from east to west. The lowest zip codes (00xxx-19xxx) are in the eastern
      US, and the highest (90xxx-99xxx) are in the western US and territories.


      So, 50703 (in Iowa) is a higher number than 49453 (in Michigan). This suggests
      that 50703 is west of 49453, not east of it.


      Therefore, 50703, IA is likely NOT east of 49453, MI. It would be west of it,
      following the general pattern of US zip codes and the known geographic relationship
      between Iowa and Michigan.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic
      positions of these two zip codes.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - Iowa is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Michigan is also in the Midwest, but positioned to the east of Iowa


      Step 3: Check if there are any unusual geographic patterns to consider.

      - The main body of Michigan is entirely east of Iowa

      - There are no portions of Iowa that extend east of Michigan


      Step 4: While ZIP codes don''t perfectly align with east-west positioning, the
      general geographic relationship between these states is clear. Iowa is west
      of Michigan, which means a ZIP code in Iowa would be west of a ZIP code in Michigan.

      First, let''s think about the geography of these two states:

      - Iowa is located west of Michigan

      - Michigan is east of Iowa


      But that''s just the general state positions. I need to check the specific zip
      codes.


      Let''s think about this logically:

      - ZIP codes in the US generally follow patterns where codes increase as you
      go from east to west

      - The first digit of ZIP codes generally indicates a large geographic region

      - ZIP codes starting with 4 are generally in the eastern/central part of the
      US

      - ZIP codes starting with 5 are generally west of those starting with 4


      The ZIP code 49453 in Michigan starts with 4, while 50703 in Iowa starts with
      5. This generally indicates that the Iowa ZIP code is west of the Michigan ZIP
      code, not east of it.


      Additionally, we know that Iowa as a state is positioned west of Michigan. So
      a ZIP code in Iowa would typically be west of a ZIP code in Michigan.


      Based on this reasoning, 50703, IA would be west of 49453, MI, not east of it.</think>I

      - Michigan is located in the Great Lakes region in the eastern portion of the
      Midwest

      - Iowa is located west of Michigan in the central United States


      Step 3: Examine the overall pattern of US zip codes.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where numbers increase as you move

      - Zip codes beginning with 4 (like 49453) are assigned to areas further east

      - Zip codes beginning with 5 (like 50703) are assigned to areas further west


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes.

      Since the Iowa zip code (50703) starts with 5 and the Michigan zip code (49453)
      starts with 4, and because Iowa is geographically west of Michigan, the Iowa
      zip code must be west of the Michigan zip code, not east of it.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the US

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast of the US


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      When looking at a US map, Virginia is positioned to the east of Ohio. The entire
      state of Ohio is west of Virginia.


      ## Step 4: Make conclusion about the ZIP codes

      east of 23834, VA, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and compare
      their east-west positions.


      First, let me think about the general geography of Ohio (OH) and Virginia (VA):

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Virginia is on the East Coast


      In general, Virginia is east of Ohio. The eastern states in the US are closer
      to the Atlantic Ocean, and as you move west, you encounter the Midwest states
      (including Ohio), then the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and finally the West
      Coast.


      So 45439, OH (an Ohio zip code) should be west of 23834, VA (a Virginia zip
      code).


      To answer the specific question: "Is 45439, OH located east of 23834, VA?"

      The answer should be NO, because Ohio is west of Virginia, not east of it.</think>I
      need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 45439 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 23834 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean and is generally considered part of the
      Eastern Seaboard

      - Ohio is further inland and west of the Appalachian Mountains

      - Geographically, Virginia is east of Ohio


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      Since 45439 is in Ohio and 23834 is in Virginia, and Ohio is west of Virginia
      (not east), the Ohio zip code cannot be east of the Virginia zip code.


      NO'

      First, I need to understand the geographical relationship between Ohio and Virginia:

      - Ohio is located in the midwest of the United States

      - Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States


      Generally speaking, Virginia is east of Ohio. This means that locations in Virginia
      would typically be east of locations in Ohio.


      Since 45439 is in Ohio and 23834 is in Virginia, we can reasonably conclude
      that 45439, OH is NOT east of 23834, VA. Rather, 45439, OH would be west of
      23834, VA.


      So the answer should be NO.</think>I need to determine the relative positions

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 45439 is in Ohio (OH)

      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Establish their relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Virginia is clearly east of Ohio

      - This means that zip codes in Virginia are generally east of zip codes in Ohio


      Since 45439 is in Ohio and 23834 is in Virginia, and Virginia is east of Ohio,
      the Ohio zip code cannot be east of the Virginia zip code.

      an east-west basis.


      Let me identify the locations:

      - 45439, OH (Ohio)

      - 23834, VA (Virginia)


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Ohio is generally west of Virginia

      - Virginia is on the east coast

      - Ohio is more in the midwest/eastern central US


      Let me be more specific about these particular zip codes:

      - 45439 appears to be in the Dayton area of Ohio, which is in western Ohio

      - 23834 appears to be in the Petersburg area of Virginia, which is in central/southern
      Virginia


      Given the general geographic layout of the US, locations in Ohio are generally
      west of locations in Virginia. Even the easternmost parts of Ohio would typically
      be west of most of Virginia.


      So 45439, OH would be west of 23834, VA.

      be NO.</think># Is 45439, OH located east of 23834, VA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 23834 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their longitude positions

      - Looking at the US map, Virginia lies to the east of Ohio

      - Ohio''s eastern border doesn''t extend beyond Virginia''s western border

      - All of Ohio (including zip code 45439) is west of central Virginia (where
      23834 would be)


      ## Step 4: Specific zip code locations

      - 45439 is in the Dayton area in western Ohio

      - 23834 is in the Petersburg area in eastern Virginia


      Since Ohio is west of Virginia, and specifically zip code 45439 (Dayton area)
      would be west of zip code 23834 (Petersburg area), not east of it.

      I''ll determine the relative locations of Ohio and Virginia. Generally speaking:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the US

      - Virginia is on the East Coast


      Looking at their relative positions, Virginia is typically east of Ohio. Ohio
      borders Pennsylvania to its east, and then beyond Pennsylvania is Virginia and
      other East Coast states.


      But I need to be more specific about these particular zip codes.


      45439 appears to be in the Dayton area of Ohio, which is in the western part
      of Ohio.

      23834 appears to be somewhere in Virginia.


      Since Virginia as a whole is east of Ohio, and 45439 is in western Ohio, it''s
      highly likely that 23834 in Virginia is east of 45439 in Ohio.


      So my answer would be NO - 45439, OH is NOT located east of 23834, VA. Instead,
      23834, VA is east of 45439, OH.</think>To determine if 45439, OH is located
      east of 23834, VA, I need to consider the geographic positions of these zip

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Virginia
      (VA) is on the East Coast.


      Step 2: Understand the general east-west relationship.

      Virginia is generally east of Ohio, as the East Coast is east of the Midwest.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      45439 is in the Dayton area of western Ohio.

      23834 is in the Petersburg area of Virginia.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Virginia is east of Ohio, and these specific zip codes don''t change this
      general geographic relationship (they aren''t in unusual border areas that might
      reverse the typical state positions), 23834 in Virginia would be east of 45439
      in Ohio.


      NO - 45439, OH is NOT located east of 23834, VA. The Virginia zip code is east

      Let me work this through step by step:


      1. 45439 is in Ohio (OH)

      2. 23834 is in Virginia (VA)


      Now I need to think about the geographic relationship between these states and
      specific zip codes.


      Ohio is generally located to the west of Virginia in the United States. Ohio
      borders Pennsylvania, which then borders Virginia to the west.


      The general geographic relationship is:

      - Ohio is west of Virginia

      - Therefore, locations in Ohio would typically be west of locations in Virginia


      Since 45439 is in Ohio and 23834 is in Virginia, based on the general state
      positions, 45439 would be west of 23834, not east.


      However, I should be careful here - specific zip codes could potentially be
      positioned differently than the general state relationship if they''re near
      borders. But in this case, 45439 (in Ohio) is very likely to be west of 23834
      (in Virginia) given the overall geographic orientation of these states.</think>I

      Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Virginia
      (VA) is on the East Coast.


      Step 2: Determine the general east-west relationship.

      Looking at a US map, Virginia is positioned to the east of Ohio. The entire
      state of Ohio lies west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider specific zip codes.

      While specific zip codes could potentially change this relationship if they
      were in unusual border areas, zip code 45439 is in the Dayton area of Ohio,
      which is firmly in the western portion of the state. Zip code 23834 is in the
      eastern part of Virginia.


      Step 4: Make the east-west determination.

      Since Ohio is west of Virginia, and these particular zip codes maintain this
      general state relationship, 45439 in Ohio must be west (not east) of 23834 in
      Virginia.

      1) First, I need to identify where 34994, FL is located. I know that 34994 is
      a ZIP code in Florida, likely in the eastern part of the state since Florida''s
      east coast faces the Atlantic Ocean.


      2) Next, I need to identify where 08620, NJ is located. This is a ZIP code in
      New Jersey, which is on the eastern seaboard of the United States.


      3) To determine if one location is east of another, I need to compare their
      longitudes. Lower (more negative) longitude numbers in the Western Hemisphere
      indicate more westerly locations.


      4) Florida is generally south of New Jersey. However, the question asks specifically
      about east/west positioning, not north/south.


      5) The east coast of the US curves, with New Jersey actually being further east
      than most of Florida. This is because the Atlantic coastline angles southwestward
      as it runs from New Jersey down to Florida.


      6) I know that the easternmost points of the US mainland (excluding Alaska and
      Hawaii) are in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states, not in Florida.


      Therefore, 34994, FL (which is in Florida) is likely WEST of 08620, NJ (which
      is in New Jersey), not east of it.</think># Is 34994, FL located east of 08620,
      NJ?


      Let me solve this step by step:


      1) ZIP code 34994 is in Stuart, Florida, which is on the Atlantic coast of Florida.


      2) ZIP code 08620 is in Trenton, New Jersey, which is also on the eastern seaboard
      of the United States.


      3) To determine which is further east, I need to consider their relative longitudes.
      On a map of the United States, lower longitude numbers (more negative in the
      Western Hemisphere) indicate locations further east.


      4) Although Florida is south of New Jersey, the eastern coastline of the United
      States curves significantly, with the Northeast extending further east into
      the Atlantic than Florida does.


      5) New Jersey''s position on this curved coastline places it further east than
      Florida''s east coast.


      6) Therefore, 34994 (Florida) is actually located WEST of 08620 (New Jersey),
      not east of it.

    fa1942b8-5659-4f2c-a231-ff66c6afb8cd: '<think>Alright, I''m being asked about
      the relative positions of two ZIP codes: 34994, FL and 08620, NJ.


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to know their geographical
      coordinates (specifically, their longitudes). In the geographic coordinate system,
      places further east have higher longitude values, and places further west have
      lower longitude values.


      Let me think about where these ZIP codes are:


      34994 is in Florida (FL). Florida is a state on the southeastern coast of the
      United States.

      08620 is in New Jersey (NJ). New Jersey is a state on the northeastern coast
      of the United States.


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is located northeast of Florida. But the question
      is specifically about east-west positioning, so I need to consider if NJ is
      east of FL.


      The east coast of the United States, while generally running north-south, actually
      curves, with the northeast coast being further east than the southeast coast.
      New Jersey is on the northeast coast, which is typically further east than Florida.


      So, 08620, NJ is likely east of 34994, FL. That means the answer would be "NO"
      to the question "Is 34994, FL located east of 08620, NJ?"


      However, let me be cautious and consider the specific locations of these ZIP
      codes, as the east coast has some irregularities and Florida does extend quite
      far east into the Atlantic.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if 34994, FL is east of 08620, NJ, I need to compare their geographic
      locations, specifically their longitudes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 34994 is a ZIP code in Florida (FL), which is on the southeastern coast of
      the United States

      - 08620 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ), which is on the northeastern coast


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of the US east coast

      The east coast of the United States curves, with the northeastern states generally
      positioned further east than the southeastern states. This is because the coastline
      angles northeast-southwest rather than running directly north-south.


      ## Step 3: Compare typical longitudes

      - New Jersey is typically around 74-75 degrees west longitude

      - Florida''s east coast is typically around 80-81 degrees west longitude


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      Since lower western longitude numbers indicate more easterly positions, and
      New Jersey has lower longitude numbers than Florida, New Jersey is east of Florida.


      # Answer: NO

      First, let''s recall the relative positions of California and Utah in the United
      States:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is inland, to the east of California


      Generally speaking, locations in California are west of locations in Utah. However,

      The zip code 91360 is in California (CA). California is on the west coast of
      the US.

      The zip code 84056 is in Utah (UT). Utah is east of California.


      Since California is west of Utah, a location in California (91360) would be

      In the US, locations further east have higher longitude values. However, that''s
      not quite right - locations further east have lower longitude values because
      longitude in the western hemisphere is measured in negative degrees from the

      Actually, I need to think about this differently. Let me reason about the general
      geography of the United States:


      Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      New York (NY) is in the Northeast region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Ohio. The entire state of New York is
      east of the entire state of Ohio.


      So a zip code in Ohio (45342) would be west of a zip code in New York (11768),

      The United States is generally oriented with the East Coast on the right side
      of the map and the West Coast on the left. New York is an East Coast state,
      while Ohio is located in the Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Ohio is situated west of New York. All of Ohio is geographically west of New
      York state.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since Ohio is west of New York, it follows that any zip code in Ohio (including
      45342) must be west of any zip code in New York (including 11768).

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 45342 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      - 11768 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      In the United States, the general geographical layout has:

      - East Coast states like New York are toward the east

      - Midwest states like Ohio are more central/western compared to New York


      Ohio is located west of New York state. Since 45342 is in Ohio and 11768 is
      in New York, regardless of the specific locations within those states, the Ohio

      30346 is a zip code in Georgia (GA). Georgia is a state in the southeastern

      based on their longitude. Eastern locations have higher longitude values than
      western locations.


      Generally speaking, Georgia is located south and west of New York. The eastern
      seaboard of the US runs roughly northeast to southwest, with New York being

      First, I should consider the general geography of the United States:

      - Georgia (GA) is a southeastern state

      - New York (NY) is a northeastern state


      In the United States, longitude determines east-west positioning, with smaller

      to southwest, with New York being more northeast and Georgia being more southeast.


      Without looking up the specific longitudes of these zip codes, I can say with

      - 10918 is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - On a map of the United States, New York is positioned significantly to the
      east compared to most states.

      - The Atlantic coast runs roughly northeast to southwest.

      - New York is in the Northeast, while Georgia is in the Southeast.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Eastern locations have smaller longitude numbers in the Western Hemisphere.

      - New York state is generally positioned further east than Georgia.

      - Even the easternmost parts of Georgia would typically be west of most of New
      York.

      2. 10918, NY - This is a zip code in New York (NY).


      In the United States, New York is on the east coast, while Georgia is in the
      southeastern part of the country. In terms of east-west positioning, New York

      99207 is a zip code in Washington state (WA).

      82609 is a zip code in Wyoming state (WY).


      In the United States, states farther west generally have higher zip code numbers,
      and states farther east have lower zip code numbers. However, this is not a
      perfect rule, so I need to look at the actual locations.


      Washington state is on the west coast of the United States, while Wyoming is
      in the interior west. Geographically, Wyoming is east of Washington.


      Since 99207 is in Washington and 82609 is in Wyoming, and Washington is west
      of Wyoming, that means 99207, WA is west of 82609, WY (not east).


      Therefore, 99207, WA is NOT located east of 82609, WY.</think># Is 99207, WA
      located east of 82609, WY?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 99207 is in Washington state (WA)

      - 82609 is in Wyoming state (WY)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states

      - Washington is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Wyoming is located in the interior west, but east of Washington


      ## Step 3: Compare the locations

      Washington state is west of Wyoming state on a map of the United States. Since
      99207 is in Washington and 82609 is in Wyoming, the Washington zip code must
      be west of the Wyoming zip code, not east of it.

      numbers in the east and higher numbers in the west.


      99207 is in Washington state (WA), which is on the west coast.

      82609 is in Wyoming (WY), which is in the mountain west region.


      Washington is generally west of Wyoming on a US map. So a location in Washington
      would typically be west of a location in Wyoming, not east.


      Let me double-check this by thinking about the general patterns of zip codes:

      - First digit 0-1: East Coast

      - First digit 2-3: South Atlantic states

      - First digit 4-5: Midwest and South

      - First digit 6-7: Central states

      - First digit 8: Mountain West states (including Wyoming)

      - First digit 9: West Coast and Pacific states (including Washington)

      - 99207 is in Washington (WA)

      - 82609 is in Wyoming (WY)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Washington state is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Wyoming is located in the mountain west region, east of Washington


      ## Step 3: Verify with zip code patterns

      - US zip codes follow a general west-to-east pattern

      - Codes starting with 9 (like 99207) are typically west coast states

      - Codes starting with 8 (like 82609) are typically mountain west states

      - This confirms Washington is west of Wyoming


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Washington is west of Wyoming, the zip code 99207, WA must be west of

      I need to determine the relative locations of two zip codes:

      1. 99207, WA (Washington state)

      2. 82609, WY (Wyoming state)


      First, I need to understand the general geographic relationship of these states.
      Washington is in the Pacific Northwest, on the west coast. Wyoming is in the
      Mountain West region, east of Washington but not on the coast.


      Looking at the continental US from west to east, the ordering would be:

      Pacific Ocean -> Washington -> Idaho -> Wyoming -> (states further east)


      So generally, Washington is west of Wyoming, not east of it.


      Therefore, 99207, WA should be west of 82609, WY, not east of it.</think>To
      determine if 99207, WA is east of 82609, WY, I need to consider the geographic
      positions of Washington state and Wyoming state.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Washington (WA) is located in the Pacific Northwest, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      Wyoming (WY) is located in the Mountain West region, inland from the Pacific
      coast.


      Step 2: Determine their east-west relationship.

      If we look at a map of the United States, Washington state is positioned to
      the west of Wyoming. Moving from the Pacific Ocean eastward, you would encounter
      Washington before Wyoming.


      Step 3: Apply this relationship to the specific zip codes.

      Since 99207 is in Washington and 82609 is in Wyoming, and Washington is west
      of Wyoming, it follows that 99207 is west of 82609, not east of it.

      ZIP code 58501 is in North Dakota, which is in the northern central part of
      the United States.

      ZIP code 77362 is in Texas, which is in the south-central part of the United

      position). Something further east would have a more eastern longitude.


      North Dakota is generally located to the north of Texas, but the question is
      specifically asking about east-west positioning. North Dakota is in the central
      northern US while Texas extends from the central southern US toward the southeast.


      In general, North Dakota is farther west than the eastern parts of Texas, but
      Texas is a large state that extends quite far west as well. So I need to consider
      the specific ZIP codes.


      ZIP code 58501 appears to be in or around Bismarck, which is in central North
      Dakota.

      ZIP code 77362 appears to be in southeastern Texas, likely in the greater Houston
      area.


      Given these locations, 58501 in North Dakota is likely WEST of 77362 in Texas,
      not east. Texas extends further east than North Dakota, especially in its eastern

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - North Dakota is in the northern central part of the United States

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States


      Step 3: Check the specific zip code locations.

      - 58501 is in Bismarck, which is in central North Dakota

      - 77362 is in Magnolia, which is in southeastern Texas (near Houston)


      Step 4: Compare east-west positioning (longitude).

      - North Dakota, including Bismarck, sits farther west in the country

      - Southeast Texas, where Magnolia is located, is considerably further east

      - New York (NY) is located west of New Hampshire


      ## Step 3: Looking more specifically at the ZIP codes

      - 14206 appears to be in Buffalo, which is in the western part of New York state

      - 03784 is in New Hampshire, which lies entirely east of New York state


      ## Step 4: Draw a conclusion about relative position

      Since New Hampshire is east of New York (and particularly east of Buffalo),
      ZIP code 03784 in NH is east of ZIP code 14206 in NY - not the other way around.


      NO'
    a08e4731-b97a-4b5f-b37a-037b3b7382a2: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative positions of two US zip codes:

      1. 14206 in New York (NY)

      2. 03784 in New Hampshire (NH)


      I need to figure out which one is further east. In the US, locations further
      east have higher longitude values (moving west to east increases longitude).


      Let''s think about the general locations:

      - New York state is west of New Hampshire state in general

      - NH is in New England, which is in the northeastern corner of the US

      - NY is directly west of the New England states


      Without knowing the exact coordinates of these zip codes, I can make a general
      assessment:

      - New Hampshire as a state is entirely east of New York state

      - This means that virtually any location in NH would be east of any location
      in NY


      So zip code 03784 in NH should be east of zip code 14206 in NY.


      Since the question asks if "14206, NY located east of 03784, NH", the answer
      would be NO - it''s the opposite. The NY zip code is west of the NH zip code.</think>I
      need to determine if 14206, NY is east of 03784, NH by considering the geographical
      positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      New Hampshire (NH) is located in New England, in the northeastern part of the
      United States. New York (NY) is located west of New Hampshire.


      Step 2: Consider state boundaries.

      The entirety of New Hampshire lies east of New York state. The eastern border
      of New York does not extend further east than the western border of New Hampshire.


      Step 3: Analyze specific zip codes.

      14206 is in New York (specifically in the Buffalo area in western NY), while
      03784 is in New Hampshire. Given the states'' positions, any location in New
      Hampshire will be east of any location in New York.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion.

      Since 14206, NY is in New York, and 03784, NH is in New Hampshire, the NY zip
      code must be west of (not east of) the NH zip code.

      is east of 91748, CA (California), I need to find the locations of these zip
      codes and compare their longitudes. In the US map, east-west positioning is
      determined by longitude - places further east have lower longitude values.


      Let me think through this:


      1. 97527 is a zip code in Oregon (OR)

      2. 91748 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Generally speaking, Oregon is north of California, but that doesn''t tell us
      the east-west relationship. I need to consider their specific locations.


      Oregon is typically to the north and west of California, with Oregon being on
      the Pacific coast. California is also on the Pacific coast but extends further
      south.


      Most of Oregon is west of most of California, but there could be exceptions
      depending on the specific locations of these zip codes. California extends quite
      far to the east in its southern portions, while Oregon has a more rectangular
      shape along the west coast.


      Without the exact longitude values, I can make an educated guess: Oregon zip
      codes (97xxx) are generally in the western part of the state along the Pacific,
      while the 91xxx series for California is typically in southern California. Southern
      California extends further east than western Oregon.


      So most likely 97527, OR is WEST of 91748, CA, not east. But let me be more
      precise about this.</think># Is 97527, OR located east of 91748, CA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes
      by examining their geographic locations.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) 97527 is a zip code in Oregon (OR), which is located in the Pacific Northwest
      region of the United States

      2) 91748 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in the Los Angeles area
      in Southern California

      3) Oregon is generally positioned directly north of California on the US west
      coast

      4) Both states border the Pacific Ocean on their western edges

      5) On a US map, Oregon sits to the north of California, not to the east

      6) More specifically, 97527 (Grants Pass area in Oregon) is in western Oregon

      7) 91748 (City of Industry/La Puente area) is in eastern Los Angeles County

      8) When comparing their longitudinal positions, Oregon''s 97527 is actually
      west of California''s 91748


      Therefore, 97527, OR is NOT located east of 91748, CA. It is located to the
      north and west.

      \ California codes (91xxx)\n\n4) Geographically, most of California actually\

      In the United States, locations further east have higher longitude values, and
      locations further west have lower longitude values.


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Oregon is a state on the west coast of the United States

      - California is also a state on the west coast of the United States

      - Generally, Oregon is north of California

      - But the question is about east-west positioning, not north-south


      I need to know more specifically where these zip codes are located:


      97527, OR - This is a zip code in Oregon

      91748, CA - This is a zip code in California


      In general, Oregon is to the west and north of most of California. However,
      the eastern parts of Oregon could potentially be east of some western parts
      of California.


      But given that these are both likely to be in the western portions of their
      respective states (as indicated by the first digits 9), and California extends
      further east than Oregon, it''s very unlikely that the Oregon zip code would
      be east of the California one.


      Actually, that''s not necessarily true. Let me just focus on the specific zip
      codes.


      97527, OR is likely in western Oregon, and 91748, CA is likely in western California.
      Since Oregon is generally north of California but both states share the Pacific
      coast, the Oregon zip code is more likely to be west or at most at a similar

      ## Step 3: Compare approximate longitudes

      - Grants Pass, OR (97527) is in western Oregon, relatively close to the coast

      between the states determines the relationship between the zip codes. Even the
      easternmost point of Minnesota would be west of the westernmost point of Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, 55388, MN is located WEST of 15062, PA, not east of it.

      55388 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN)

      15062 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      In the United States, states are positioned such that:

      - Minnesota (MN) is in the Midwest region

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the Northeast region


      Looking at the relative positions, Minnesota is located to the west of Pennsylvania.
      That means that any location in Minnesota would generally be west of any location

      - 15062 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      - Minnesota is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Northeast region

      - When looking at a US map, Minnesota is positioned to the west of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Make the comparison

      - Since Minnesota is west of Pennsylvania, any zip code in Minnesota (including
      55388) would be west of any zip code in Pennsylvania (including 15062)

      is located east of 20121, VA.


      First, let me recall the geographic positions of Georgia (GA) and Virginia (VA)
      relative to each other. Georgia is located south of Virginia, but the question
      is about east/west positioning.


      Generally:

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States

      - Virginia is also in the eastern United States, but further north than Georgia


      To determine if 30534, GA is east of 20121, VA, I need to compare their longitudes.
      Lower longitude numbers indicate more eastern locations in the US.


      Let me think about what these zip codes might represent:

      - 30534 is a zip code in Georgia

      - 20121 is a zip code in Virginia


      Georgia is generally southwest of Virginia. While Georgia is south of Virginia,
      Virginia tends to be more east than Georgia. So most Georgia locations would
      be west of Virginia locations.


      US zip codes roughly follow geographic patterns, with lower numbers generally
      in the eastern US and higher numbers in the western US. Between these two:

      - 20121 (VA) has a lower first digit (2) than 30534 (GA) which starts with 3

      - This suggests that 20121 is likely further east than 30534


      Based on the zip code patterns, 30534 in Georgia is likely west of 20121 in
      Virginia, not east.</think># Determining if 30534, GA is east of 20121, VA


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Understand the geographic relationship between GA and VA

      Georgia (GA) is located south of Virginia (VA), but in terms of east-west positioning,
      Virginia is generally east of Georgia. Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean along
      most of its eastern edge, while Georgia is more inland except for its southeastern
      corner.


      ## Step 2: Consider zip code patterns

      US zip codes have some geographic correlation. The first digit of zip codes
      generally increases as you move west across the country. Here:

      - 20121 (VA) starts with "2"

      - 30534 (GA) starts with "3"

      This pattern suggests that the Georgia zip code is likely further west.


      ## Step 3: Specific locations

      30534 is in north Georgia (likely in the Appalachian region)

      20121 is in northern Virginia (in the DC metropolitan area)

      Northern Virginia is positioned east of northern Georgia.


      Therefore, 30534, GA is located WEST (not east) of 20121, VA.

      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Virginia is positioned to the northeast
      of Georgia. Specifically, Virginia lies along the Atlantic coast, while Georgia
      is further inland and to the southwest of Virginia.


      Step 4: Determine east-west relationship.

      In terms of longitude (east-west position), Virginia is generally east of Georgia.
      Therefore, a zip code in Georgia would be west of a zip code in Virginia, not
      east.

      is located east of 20121, VA.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 30534 is a zip code in Georgia (GA)

      - 20121 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Georgia is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Virginia is a state on the east coast, but generally north of Georgia


      Step 3: Think about east-west positioning.

      When considering whether one location is east of another, we need to compare
      their longitudes. The farther east a location is, the smaller (more negative)
      its longitude value.


      However, I don''t have the specific longitude coordinates for these zip codes.
      But I can use general geographical knowledge:

      - Virginia is on the east coast

      - Georgia is also on the east coast, but slightly more west than Virginia


      In general, locations in Virginia tend to be east of locations in Georgia. This
      is because Virginia extends further east along the Atlantic coast than Georgia
      does.</think># Is 30534, GA located east of 20121, VA?


      I need to examine the geographic relationship between these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider relative positions of these states

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, while Virginia is also
      in the eastern US but positioned northeast of Georgia.


      ## Step 3: Analyze east-west positioning

      When comparing eastern positions, we need to consider longitude:

      - Virginia''s eastern portions border the Atlantic Ocean

      - Georgia also borders the Atlantic, but Virginia generally extends further
      east than Georgia

      - Additionally, since Virginia is northeast of Georgia, locations in Virginia
      tend to be east of locations in Georgia


      ## Step 4: Specific zip codes

      30534 is in northern Georgia, while 20121 is in northern Virginia. Following
      the general geographic relationship between these states, a location in Virginia
      would typically be east of a location in Georgia.

    cfd9afcf-4411-4004-8fbf-bd6eefb5e8d2: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative locations of two ZIP codes: 30534, GA and 20121, VA.


      First, let''s think about the general geographic positions of Georgia (GA) and
      Virginia (VA) in the United States:

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States

      - Virginia is on the east coast, north of Georgia


      In general, Georgia is south of Virginia, but the question is asking about east/west
      positioning, not north/south.


      To be more precise, I need to consider that:

      - ZIP codes in the eastern US generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      tend to be in the northeast and higher numbers in the southeast and southwest

      - The first digit of 30534 is 3, which corresponds to areas in the southeastern
      US (including Georgia)

      - The first digit of 20121 is 2, which corresponds to areas in the mid-Atlantic
      region (including Virginia)


      However, this high-level pattern isn''t enough to determine the precise east-west
      relationship. I need to consider the specific locations.


      Georgia is generally west of the Atlantic Ocean coastline of Virginia. While
      both states are on the eastern side of the US, Virginia extends further east
      since it''s directly on the Atlantic coast, while Georgia is somewhat set back
      from the coast (with its eastern border partially coastal and partially bordered
      by South Carolina).


      ZIP code 30534 appears to be in northern Georgia, likely in the northern inland
      part of the state.

      ZIP code 20121 is in Virginia, likely in the northern Virginia area near Washington
      DC.


      Northern Virginia, particularly the areas near DC, is in the eastern part of
      Virginia, which would place it further east than most of Georgia.</think># Is
      30534, GA located east of 20121, VA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 30534 is in Georgia (GA)

      - 20121 is in Virginia (VA)


      ## Step 2: Consider general geographic positions

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic east coast, northeast of Georgia


      ## Step 3: Analyze east-west positioning

      - Virginia is positioned along the Atlantic coast

      - Georgia is positioned inland from the Atlantic, with only its southeastern
      corner touching the ocean

      - Virginia extends further east than Georgia does


      ## Step 4: Examine specific ZIP codes

      - ZIP code 30534 is in northern Georgia (likely in the mountainous region)

      - ZIP code 20121 is in northern Virginia (Centreville area, near Washington
      DC)

      - Northern Virginia is in the eastern portion of Virginia, which is generally
      east of any part of northern Georgia

      2. Figure out where 20121, VA is located in Virginia

      3. Compare their relative east-west positions (longitude)


      Generally speaking:

      - Lower longitude numbers indicate more eastern locations in the US

      Zip code 30534 is in Georgia (GA), which is generally southwest of Virginia.

      Zip code 20121 is in Virginia (VA), which is northeast of Georgia.

      GA located east of 20121, VA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states

      Georgia (GA) and Virginia (VA) are both eastern states, but their relative positions
      matter:

      - Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic coast

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the US


      ## Step 2: General geographic orientation

      Virginia is generally northeast of Georgia. On a west-to-east axis, Virginia
      is positioned more to the east than most of Georgia.


      ## Step 3: Specific zip codes

      - 30534 is in northern Georgia

      - 20121 is in northern Virginia (likely in the DC metropolitan area)


      ## Step 4: Longitude comparison

      Northern Georgia is west of northern Virginia. Georgia''s eastern border doesn''t
      extend as far east as Virginia''s location on the Atlantic coast.

      - Virginia is positioned on the Atlantic coast.

      - Georgia is also a coastal state, but generally lies west of Virginia when
      comparing the bulk of both states.


      Step 3: While specific zip codes can sometimes create exceptions to general

      - Zip code 30534 is in northern Georgia

      - Zip code 20121 is in northern Virginia (near Manassas)


      Step 4: Looking at the longitude (east-west position), Virginia zip codes (including

      First, let''s think about the general locations:

      - 60060 is in Illinois (IL)

      - 07092 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      In terms of US geography, Illinois is in the Midwest while New Jersey is on
      the East Coast.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - Illinois is west of New Jersey

      - New Jersey is east of Illinois


      Therefore, if 60060 is in Illinois and 07092 is in New Jersey, then 60060 (IL)

      is located east of 70065, LA. Let me think about how to approach this.


      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 78380, TX: This is a zip code in Texas

      - 70065, LA: This is a zip code in Louisiana


      To determine if one location is east of another, I need to consider their relative
      geographic positions. Louisiana is generally east of Texas in the United States.
      The eastern part of Texas borders the western part of Louisiana.


      Let''s consider more precisely:

      - Texas zip codes starting with 78xxx are typically in the south-central part
      of Texas

      - Louisiana zip codes starting with 70xxx are typically in the southern part
      of Louisiana


      Since Louisiana is east of Texas geographically, and these appear to be standard
      zip codes in their respective states (not unusual outliers), the zip code in
      Louisiana (70065) would be east of the zip code in Texas (78380).


      This means that 78380, TX would NOT be east of 70065, LA. Instead, 70065, LA
      would be east of 78380, TX.</think># Is 78380, TX located east of 70065, LA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 78380 is in Texas (TX)

      - 70065 is in Louisiana (LA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of these states

      - Louisiana is located to the east of Texas on the US map

      - This is a general geographic fact - Texas borders Louisiana on Louisiana''s
      western border


      ## Step 3: Check the specific zip codes

      - Texas zip codes beginning with 78xxx are typically in south-central Texas

      - Louisiana zip codes beginning with 70xxx are generally in southern Louisiana


      ## Step 4: Determine relative position

      Since Louisiana lies east of Texas geographically, and these zip codes appear
      to be in the standard regions of their respective states, the Louisiana zip
      code (70065) must be east of the Texas zip code (78380).

      78380 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      70065 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      I need to recall the general geographic positioning of Texas and Louisiana in
      the United States. Louisiana is located to the east of Texas along the Gulf
      Coast. In general, locations in Louisiana would be east of locations in Texas.


      However, I should verify this for these specific zip codes since border areas
      could have exceptions.


      78380 appears to be a zip code in Texas. Based on its prefix "783", this is
      likely in southern Texas, possibly near the Gulf Coast.


      70065 appears to be a zip code in Louisiana. Based on its prefix "700", this
      would be in the southeastern part of Louisiana.


      Given that Louisiana is east of Texas, and these zip codes appear to be in the
      main parts of their respective states (not unusual border areas), the Louisiana
      zip code should be east of the Texas one.</think>I need to determine the relative

      Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between Texas and Louisiana.

      Louisiana is located to the east of Texas along the Gulf Coast of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      - The 783xx prefix indicates southern Texas

      - The 700xx prefix indicates southeastern Louisiana (likely in the New Orleans
      area)


      Step 4: Determine relative positioning.

      Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these zip codes are in the standard parts
      of their respective states (not in unusual border areas), the Louisiana zip
      code (70065) would be east of the Texas zip code (78380).

      So 70065, LA would be east of 78380, TX, not the other way around.

      Texas (TX) is located west of Louisiana (LA) on the US map.


      Step 2: Consider the specific zip codes.

      78380 is a zip code in Texas, likely in the coastal region based on the numbering.

      70065 is a zip code in Louisiana, likely in the southeastern part of the state.


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions.

      Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these zip codes don''t appear to be in
      unusual border areas that might create exceptions, the Louisiana zip code (70065)
      would be east of the Texas zip code (78380).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the question asked.

      Generally speaking, Louisiana is east of Texas in the United States. But I need
      to be more precise since we''re talking about specific zip codes that could

      Let me reason about this in terms of geography:

      - Texas is west of Louisiana (Louisiana borders Texas on Texas''s eastern border)

      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Louisiana

      Looking at a US map, Louisiana is located directly east of Texas. The entire
      state of Louisiana is positioned to the east of Texas.


      ## Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the zip codes

      Since 78380 is in Texas and 70065 is in Louisiana, and Louisiana is east of

      78380 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is generally west of Louisiana (LA).

      70065 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA).


      Looking at a map of the United States, Louisiana is east of Texas. This means

      Since 78380 is in Texas and 70065 is in Louisiana, and Louisiana is east of
      Texas, it would follow that 78380, TX is NOT east of 70065, LA. Rather, 78380,

      - 78380, TX is a zip code in Texas

      - 70065, LA is a zip code in Louisiana


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Texas and Louisiana in
      the United States.

      Louisiana is located directly east of Texas on the US map. Texas borders the
      western side of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Since zip codes within a state generally follow geographic patterns,

      respective states.


      Zip code 78380 appears to be in the southern coastal region of Texas.

      Zip code 70065 appears to be in southeastern Louisiana.


      Step 4: Compare the positions.

      Since Louisiana is east of Texas, and these zip codes appear to be in standard
      locations within their states (not at unusual border areas that might create
      exceptions), a zip code in Texas would generally be west of a zip code in Louisiana.

      of Louisiana lies east of most of Texas.

      is east of 06770, CT (Connecticut), I need to think about the relative geographic
      positions of these states and zip codes.


      First, let''s consider the general geographic positions of Ohio and Connecticut:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Connecticut is in the Northeast/New England region of the United States


      On a west-to-east basis, Connecticut is generally east of Ohio. In the United
      States, states in the Northeast like Connecticut are east of Midwestern states
      like Ohio.


      To be more precise, I should consider the specific zip codes:

      - 45204 is in Ohio

      - 06770 is in Connecticut


      Since Connecticut as a whole is east of Ohio, and these zip codes are within
      their respective states, 45204, OH would generally be west of 06770, CT, not
      east of it.

      - 06770 is in Connecticut (CT)


      ## Step 2: Determine the general geographic positions

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Connecticut is located in the Northeast/New England region


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      Looking at a US map, Connecticut is positioned on the eastern seaboard, while
      Ohio is further inland and to the west. The entirety of Connecticut lies east
      of Ohio geographically.


      ## Step 4: Conclude based on the zip codes'' states

      Since 45204 is in Ohio and 06770 is in Connecticut, and Connecticut is east
      of Ohio, then 45204 (OH) must be west of 06770 (CT), not east of it.

      To answer this, I''ll need to determine the relative locations of these two
      zip codes (or at least their states) on a US map.


      US states are generally oriented with the east coast on the right (east) side
      of the map and the west coast on the left (west) side.


      Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      Connecticut (CT) is located in the Northeast region of the United States, specifically
      in New England.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Connecticut is positioned on the east coast

      - Ohio is more inland, to the west of Connecticut


      Therefore, Ohio (and zip code 45204) would be WEST of Connecticut (and zip code

      - 45204 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 06770 is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - Connecticut is located on the east coast of the United States, in the New
      England region.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, inland from the east coast.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - When looking at a US map, Connecticut is positioned to the east of Ohio.

      - This means Ohio (including zip code 45204) is west of Connecticut (including
      zip code 06770).


      NO, 45204, OH is not located east of 06770, CT. It is located west of it.'

      33901 is a zip code in Fort Myers, Florida

      10973 is a zip code in New York


      In the United States, locations on the east coast (like New York) are generally
      east of locations in Florida. East-west positioning is determined by longitude
      - with lower (more negative) longitude numbers indicating more western locations
      and higher (less negative) longitude numbers indicating more eastern locations
      in the US.


      Since New York is on the northeast coast and Florida is in the southeast, New
      York should be east of Florida. Therefore, 10973, NY should be east of 33901,
      FL, not the other way around.


      So the answer should be NO - 33901, FL is not located east of 10973, NY. Instead,

      - 33901 is a zip code in Fort Myers, Florida

      - 10973 is a zip code in New York state


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare longitudes (east-west positioning).

      - States on the east coast of the US, like New York, are generally further east
      than Florida

      - New York state is positioned to the east of Florida on a map of the United
      States


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since New York is east of Florida, zip code 10973 in NY is east of zip code
      33901 in FL

      - This means 33901, FL is WEST of 10973, NY (not east)


      NO - 33901, FL is not located east of 10973, NY.'

      eastern locations having a higher longitude than western locations.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Identify where 21209, MD is located

      2. Identify where 03303, NH is located

      3. Compare their relative east-west positions


      Maryland (MD) is a state on the eastern seaboard of the US, roughly in the mid-Atlantic
      region.

      New Hampshire (NH) is also on the eastern seaboard, but in the New England region,
      which is north of the mid-Atlantic.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Hampshire is generally positioned to the northeast of Maryland

      - When comparing east-west positions specifically, New Hampshire is generally
      to the east of Maryland


      Let me check if this holds for these specific zip codes:

      - 21209 is a zip code in Baltimore, Maryland

      - 03303 appears to be a zip code near Concord, New Hampshire


      Looking at the geography of the eastern US, New Hampshire is indeed east of
      Maryland. So 03303, NH would be east of 21209, MD.</think># Determining if 21209,
      MD is east of 03303, NH


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 21209 is a zip code in Baltimore, Maryland

      - 03303 is a zip code near Concord, New Hampshire


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of the Eastern United States

      Looking at the US map, New Hampshire is located in the New England region, which
      is in the northeastern part of the country. Maryland is in the Mid-Atlantic
      region, which is south of New England.


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      Even though New Hampshire is north of Maryland, what matters for this question
      is their east-west positioning.


      New Hampshire is positioned further east than Maryland on the Atlantic coast.
      The eastern edge of New Hampshire is closer to the Atlantic Ocean than Maryland''s
      eastern edge.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 21209, MD is NOT located east of 03303, NH. It''s actually the opposite
      - New Hampshire is east of Maryland.'

      21209 is a zip code in Maryland (MD).

      03303 is a zip code in New Hampshire (NH).


      Now, I need to think about the geographic positions of these states. The eastern
      United States, from west to east along the Atlantic coast, generally follows
      this order:

      - Maine (furthest northeast)

      - New Hampshire

      - Massachusetts

      - Rhode Island

      - Connecticut

      - New York

      Maryland is closer to the middle of the eastern seaboard, while New Hampshire
      is part of the northeastern corner.

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 21209 is in Maryland (MD)

      - 03303 is in New Hampshire (NH)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic positions

      Maryland is in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, while New Hampshire

      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 76210, TX (Texas)

      - 61611, IL (Illinois)


      To determine if one location is east of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      In the US, eastern locations have higher (less negative) longitude values than
      western locations.


      I know generally that:

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest region

      - Texas (TX) is in the South/Southwest region


      Generally, Illinois is east of Texas. But let me be more specific about these
      particular zip codes.


      76210 is in Texas, likely in the eastern part of Texas, but Texas as a whole
      is west of Illinois.

      61611 is in Illinois, which is east of Texas but west of states like Ohio, Pennsylvania,
      etc.


      Based on the general geography of the US, Illinois is east of Texas. Therefore,
      76210, TX would NOT be east of 61611, IL. Rather, it would be WEST of the Illinois
      zip code.


      So the answer would be NO, 76210, TX is not located east of 61611, IL.</think>To
      determine if 76210, TX is located east of 61611, IL, I need to compare their

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 76210 is in Texas (TX)

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states on the US map.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is located in the South/Southwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions in terms of east-west orientation.

      Looking at a US map, Illinois is positioned to the east of Texas. Even the easternmost
      parts of Texas are generally west of Illinois.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since Illinois is east of Texas geographically, zip code 61611 in Illinois would
      be east of zip code 76210 in Texas.


      NO, 76210, TX is not located east of 61611, IL. It is located west of it.'

      1) 76210 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      2) 61611 is a zip code in Illinois (IL)

      3) I need to determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Generally speaking, US states are organized with lower numbers in the northeast,
      and higher numbers in the southwest and west. So the zip code numbers alone
      suggest that 76210 would be southwest of 61611, but I shouldn''t rely solely
      on that pattern.


      Let me think about the states themselves:

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Illinois (IL) is located in the midwestern United States


      Geographically, Illinois is east of Texas. However, the question is asking if
      76210, TX is east of 61611, IL. Since Texas is west of Illinois, places in Texas
      would generally be west (not east) of places in Illinois.

      - 76210 is in Texas (TX)

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      Texas is located in the south-central United States, while Illinois is in the
      Midwest region.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      On a map of the United States, Illinois is positioned east of Texas. Texas is
      significantly west of Illinois.


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are in their respective states, 76210 (being in

      I need to determine if 76210, TX is east of 61611, IL.

      So if Illinois is east of Texas, then the zip code in Texas (76210) cannot be
      east of the zip code in Illinois (61611). Instead, the Texas zip code would

      - Texas (TX) is located in the South/Southwest region of the United States


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      - Illinois is generally positioned to the northeast of Texas

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to consider their geographical
      positions. In the US, states are generally positioned as follows:

      - Texas is in the southern central part of the US

      - Illinois is in the Midwest, roughly in the central part of the US


      Generally speaking, Illinois is east of Texas. The western border of Illinois

      In general, Texas is located west of Illinois in the United States. Texas typically
      has longitudes around -95 to -106 degrees, while Illinois typically has longitudes
      around -87 to -91 degrees.


      Based on this general knowledge, I would expect that 76210, TX is west of 61611,
      IL, not east of it. However, to be certain, I should consider the specific locations
      of these zip codes if I had more precise information.


      Since Texas is generally west of Illinois on the US map, and there are no unusual
      geographic anomalies that would place parts of Texas east of Illinois, I can
      conclude that 76210, TX is west of 61611, IL, not east of it.</think># Is 76210,
      TX located east of 61611, IL?


      To answer this question, I need to analyze the geographic positions of these
      zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 76210 is in Texas (TX)

      - 61611 is in Illinois (IL)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      The United States is generally oriented with the East Coast on the right side
      of the map and the West Coast on the left. Illinois is in the Midwest region,
      while Texas is in the South/Southwest region.


      ## Step 3: Compare the relative positions

      Illinois is positioned significantly east of Texas on the US map. All parts
      of Texas lie west of Illinois geographically.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion for the specific zip codes

      Since 76210 is in Texas and 61611 is in Illinois, and Texas is entirely west
      of Illinois, it follows that the Texas zip code must be west (not east) of the
      Illinois zip code.

      Zip Code 70062 is in Louisiana (LA), which is in the southern United States
      along the Gulf of Mexico.

      Zip Code 17970 is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the northeastern United

      - 70062 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 17970 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern part of the United States along the Gulf

      if 70062, LA is east of 17970, PA


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes
      by examining their states'' geographic locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 70062 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 17970 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Louisiana is located in the southern part of the United States along the Gulf
      of Mexico. Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States.


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis

      On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is positioned significantly to the
      east of Louisiana. Pennsylvania borders the mid-Atlantic region, while Louisiana
      is in the south-central part of the country.


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      Since Pennsylvania is east of Louisiana, zip code 17970, PA is east of zip code
      70062, LA - not the other way around.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 70062, LA is NOT located east of 17970, PA. It is located west of it.'

      location with zip code 48069 in Michigan (MI) is east of the location with zip
      code 11218 in New York (NY).


      To determine this, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located and
      compare their longitudinal positions. Locations that are more east have lower
      longitude values in the Western Hemisphere.


      Zip code 48069 is in Michigan. Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United
      States.

      Zip code 11218 is in New York. New York is in the Northeast region of the United
      States.


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Michigan. This would mean that a location
      in Michigan would typically be west of a location in New York, not east of it.


      Let me be more specific:

      - Zip code 48069 appears to be in Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, which is near Detroit
      in the southeastern part of Michigan.

      - Zip code 11218 appears to be in Brooklyn, New York City, which is in the southeastern
      part of New York state.


      Even though these are both in the eastern parts of their respective states,
      New York is still east of Michigan on the US map. So a zip code in Michigan
      would be west of (not east of) a zip code in New York.</think># Determining

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 48069 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      - 11218 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States

      - On a map of the US, New York is east of Michigan


      ## Step 3: More specifically for these zip codes

      - 48069 is in the Pleasant Ridge/Royal Oak area of Michigan (near Detroit)

      - 11218 is in the Brooklyn area of New York City


      ## Step 4: Compare longitudes

      Even though both zip codes are in the eastern parts of their respective states,
      New York is significantly east of Michigan on the US map.


      Therefore, 48069 in Michigan is WEST of (not east of) 11218 in New York.

      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 48069 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      - 11218 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Now, looking at the geography of the United States:

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region, specifically around the Great Lakes


      In terms of east-west positioning, New York is generally east of Michigan. The
      eastern edge of the United States is the Atlantic Ocean, and New York borders
      this ocean, while Michigan is more inland.


      So generally speaking, locations in New York would be east of locations in Michigan,
      not the other way around.


      Therefore, 48069, MI would NOT be east of 11218, NY. Rather, 11218, NY would

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region, situated around the Great Lakes


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - New York state is significantly east of Michigan

      - All New York zip codes are geographically east of Michigan zip codes


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since New York is east of Michigan, zip code 11218 in NY must be east of zip

      this question regarding the relative locations of two zip codes.


      I need to determine if 77340, TX is located east of 30342, GA.


      Step 1: Let me identify where these zip codes are located.

      - 77340 is in Texas (TX)

      - 30342 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Texas is in the southwestern/south-central part of the United States

      - Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United States


      Step 3: When comparing east-west positions in the US, we need to consider longitude.
      Lower longitude numbers are further east in the US.

      - TX generally has higher longitude values (more western) than GA

      - GA is generally east of TX


      Step 4: Without knowing the exact longitude coordinates of these specific zip
      codes, I can rely on the general geographic relationship between these states.
      Georgia is entirely east of Texas on the US map.


      Therefore, 77340, TX would be west of 30342, GA, not east of it.</think>To determine
      if 77340, TX is located east of 30342, GA, I need to consider the geographic
      positions of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of these states.

      Texas (TX) is located in the south-central part of the United States.

      Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      On a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned entirely east of Texas.
      The easternmost part of Texas is still west of the westernmost part of Georgia.


      Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes.

      While specific zip codes might be in different parts of their respective states,
      the entire state of Georgia (including zip code 30342) lies east of the entire
      state of Texas (including zip code 77340).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geographic reality.

      Since Georgia is east of Texas, zip code 30342 in GA must be east of zip code
      77340 in TX. This means that 77340, TX cannot be east of 30342, GA - it must
      be west of it.

      if one is east of the other.


      77340 is a ZIP code in Texas (TX)

      30342 is a ZIP code in Georgia (GA)


      Generally, when looking at the US map:

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the US

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern US


      Texas is generally west of Georgia. So a ZIP code in Texas would typically be
      west of a ZIP code in Georgia, not east.


      To be more precise about these specific ZIP codes:

      - 77340 appears to be in Huntsville, Texas (based on my knowledge)

      - 30342 appears to be in Atlanta, Georgia (based on my knowledge)


      Huntsville, TX is definitely west of Atlanta, GA. So 77340 would be west of

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      On a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas. Since
      these ZIP codes are in their respective states, 77340 (TX) would be west of
      30342 (GA), not east.

      3. Compare their east-west positions (longitude)


      77340 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is generally in the central/western
      part of the United States.


      30342 is a zip code in Georgia (GA). Georgia is located in the southeastern
      United States.


      Geographically, Georgia is east of Texas. This is because:

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US

      - Georgia is on the eastern seaboard, much closer to the Atlantic Ocean


      Since Georgia is east of Texas, any location in Georgia (including 30342) would
      be east of any location in Texas (including 77340).


      Therefore, 77340, TX is NOT located east of 30342, GA. It''s the opposite -

      Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      Georgia is positioned along the Atlantic coast in the eastern part of the country.

      Texas is much further west, bordering the Gulf of Mexico but extending far inland.


      Step 3: Determine the directional relationship.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Georgia is clearly east of Texas.

      Since 77340 is in Texas and 30342 is in Georgia, the zip code in Georgia would
      be east of the zip code in Texas.


      NO, 77340, TX is NOT located east of 30342, GA. It''s the opposite - the Georgia

      First, let me identify where these ZIP codes are:

      - 77340 is in Texas (TX)

      - 30342 is in Georgia (GA)


      Broadly speaking, Georgia is on the eastern coast of the US, while Texas is

      east of Texas.


      So generally, a ZIP code in Georgia would be east of a ZIP code in Texas. This
      means that 77340, TX would be west of 30342, GA, not east of it.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States on the Atlantic coast,
      while Texas is in the south-central part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions east-west.

      Georgia is significantly east of Texas on the US map. The entire state of Georgia
      is east of Texas.


      Step 4: Therefore, any location in Georgia (including 30342) would be east of

      is east of Nebraska, 68147 NE would NOT be east of 30575 GA. Instead, it would
      be WEST of it.


      So the answer would be NO.</think>To determine if 68147, NE is located east
      of 30575, GA, I need to consider the geographic positions of these states.


      Step 1: Identify the states involved.

      - 68147 is in Nebraska (NE)

      - 30575 is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on the US map.

      - Nebraska is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Georgia is located in the Southeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Georgia is positioned significantly east of Nebraska on the US map

      - All locations in Georgia are east of all locations in Nebraska


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Since 68147 is in Nebraska and 30575 is in Georgia, and Georgia is east of Nebraska,
      then 68147, NE must be west of 30575, GA (not east).

      if 72114, AR (Arkansas) is located east of 27009, NC (North Carolina).


      To answer this, I need to compare the geographic locations of these two zip
      codes.


      First, let''s think about the general geographic locations of the states:

      - Arkansas (AR) is located in the south-central United States

      - North Carolina (NC) is located on the east coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, North Carolina is generally east of Arkansas.
      The entire state of North Carolina lies east of Arkansas.


      So without even looking at the specific zip codes, I can say that a zip code
      in Arkansas would NOT be east of a zip code in North Carolina. Rather, it would
      be west of North Carolina.


      Therefore, 72114, AR is NOT located east of 27009, NC. It is located west of
      it.</think>To determine if 72114, AR is located east of 27009, NC, I need to
      consider the geographic positions of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 27009 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Arkansas is positioned to the west of North Carolina

      - Generally, all of Arkansas lies west of North Carolina


      Step 4: Make the determination about the specific zip codes.

      Since Arkansas is entirely west of North Carolina, any zip code in Arkansas
      (including 72114) must be west of any zip code in North Carolina (including
      27009).

      zip code 72114 in Arkansas (AR) is located east of the zip code 27009 in North
      Carolina (NC).


      To solve this problem, I need to consider the geographical locations of these
      two zip codes, specifically whether AR is east of NC or vice versa.


      In the United States:

      - Arkansas (AR) is located in the south-central region

      - North Carolina (NC) is located on the east coast


      Looking at a map of the United States, North Carolina is definitely east of
      Arkansas. Arkansas borders the Mississippi River to the east, while North Carolina
      borders the Atlantic Ocean.


      So if 72114 is in AR and 27009 is in NC, then 72114 is west of 27009, not east
      of it.


      The answer would be NO, 72114, AR is not located east of 27009, NC. It''s located
      west of it.</think># Is 72114, AR located east of 27009, NC?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 72114 is in Arkansas (AR)

      - 27009 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - North Carolina is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas

      - Arkansas is west of North Carolina


      Since the zip code 72114 in Arkansas must be west of zip code 27009 in North
      Carolina (not east of it), the answer is:


      NO'

      whether 72114, AR (Arkansas) is located east of 27009, NC (North Carolina).


      First, I need to understand the relative positions of Arkansas and North Carolina:

      - Arkansas is in the south-central region of the United States

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Arkansas is generally west of North Carolina

      - States further east have lower longitude numbers (when using negative numbers
      for west longitude) or higher longitude numbers (when using positive numbers
      for east longitude)


      Since Arkansas is west of North Carolina, a zip code in Arkansas (72114) would
      be west of a zip code in North Carolina (27009), not east of it.

      it.</think>I need to determine if a zip code in Arkansas is east of a zip code
      in North Carolina.


      Step 1: Let me consider the geographic positions of these states. Arkansas (AR)
      is located in the south-central United States, while North Carolina (NC) is
      on the eastern seaboard.


      Step 2: Looking at their relative positions, North Carolina is significantly
      east of Arkansas. In fact, North Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on its
      eastern side, while Arkansas is several states inland to the west.


      Step 3: Since the states themselves have this clear east-west relationship,
      zip codes within these states would maintain the same general relationship.
      A zip code in Arkansas (72114) would be west of a zip code in North Carolina
      (27009).


      Step 4: To be "east of" something means to be positioned further toward the
      eastern direction. Since Arkansas is west of North Carolina, an Arkansas zip
      code cannot be east of a North Carolina zip code.

      (NC) - specifically whether the Michigan zip code is east of the North Carolina
      zip code.


      To solve this, I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these
      locations.


      First, let''s recall that in the continental US:

      - East Coast states are on the eastern side

      - Midwest states like Michigan are more toward the center

      - North Carolina is on the eastern side of the country


      Michigan is generally in the upper Midwest, while North Carolina is on the Atlantic
      coast in the southeastern part of the country. Geographically, North Carolina
      is east of Michigan.


      Michigan''s longitude coordinates are generally around 82-87 degrees West.

      North Carolina''s longitude coordinates are generally around 75-84 degrees West.


      Lower longitude numbers (less negative or smaller West values) indicate more
      eastern positions.


      So based on the general locations of these states, 49337 in Michigan would be
      WEST of 28607 in North Carolina, not east of it.


      Therefore, 49337, MI is NOT located east of 28607, NC.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general locations.

      - 49337 is in Michigan (MI), which is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - 28607 is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the Atlantic Coast in the Southeast


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Michigan is situated around the Great Lakes region

      - North Carolina is positioned along the eastern seaboard


      Step 3: Consider their longitude (east-west position).

      - States on the Atlantic Coast (like North Carolina) are generally further east
      than Midwest states

      - Michigan is west of North Carolina when looking at a map of the United States


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Michigan is west of North Carolina, zip code 49337 in MI would be west
      (not east) of zip code 28607 in NC.

      49337 is a zip code in Michigan (MI).

      28607 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC).


      To determine which is more easterly, I need to know their approximate longitudes.
      In the United States, lower longitude numbers represent more easterly locations
      (since longitude decreases as you move east in the US).


      Michigan is generally in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, while North Carolina
      is on the East Coast. Based on this general knowledge, North Carolina should
      be east of Michigan.


      Let me be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 49337 appears to be in the western part of Michigan

      - 28607 appears to be in western North Carolina


      Even though 28607 is in western North Carolina, North Carolina as a whole is
      still significantly east of Michigan. So I would expect 28607, NC to be east
      of 49337, MI.

      - 49337 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 28607 is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region in the north-central/midwest United

      1. 75150, TX - This is a zip code in Texas

      2. 33703, FL - This is a zip code in Florida


      Generally, Texas is west of Florida in the United States. However, I need to
      be more precise about these specific zip codes.


      Let me think about the general geography:

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic Ocean
      and the Gulf of Mexico

      - Texas is in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico


      So in general, Florida is east of Texas. That means that a zip code in Florida
      would generally be east of a zip code in Texas.


      So 33703, FL would be east of 75150, TX, not the other way around.


      Therefore, 75150, TX is NOT located east of 33703, FL. It''s located west of
      33703, FL.</think># Analyzing ZIP Code Locations


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 75150 is in Texas (TX)

      - 33703 is in Florida (FL)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      Texas is located in the south-central United States, while Florida is in the
      southeastern United States. On a map of the United States, Florida is positioned
      to the east of Texas.


      ## Step 3: Verify relative positions

      Since these ZIP codes are in their respective states (TX and FL), they maintain
      the same general east-west relationship. Even without knowing the exact locations
      within each state, the geography of the United States makes it clear that any
      location in Texas will be west of any location in Florida.


      NO, 75150, TX is not located east of 33703, FL. It is located west of it.'

      Let me think about the general locations:

      1. Texas is in the south-central part of the United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico.

      2. Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States, also bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico.


      Generally speaking, Florida is east of Texas. But I need to check the specific
      locations of these zip codes.


      75150 is a zip code in TX. I believe this is in the Dallas area or eastern Texas.

      33703 is a zip code in FL. I believe this is in the Tampa Bay area or central-western
      Florida.


      To determine if 75150, TX is east of 33703, FL, I need to know which location
      has the larger longitude (being further east means having a smaller longitude
      number in the US, since longitude decreases as you go eastward in the US).


      Given the general geography of the United States, it''s extremely unlikely that
      any part of Texas would be east of any part of Florida. Florida is the easternmost
      state in that part of the country, while Texas is much further west.


      So, 75150, TX is almost certainly west of 33703, FL, not east of it.</think>#
      Is 75150, TX located east of 33703, FL?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the general geographic positions of Texas and Florida
      within the United States.


      2) Texas is located in the south-central region of the US, while Florida is
      in the southeastern corner of the country.


      3) Looking at a US map, Florida is positioned to the east of Texas, with several
      states (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama) between them.


      4) All of Texas, including any zip code in Texas, is west of all of Florida.


      5) Therefore, zip code 75150 in Texas must be west of zip code 33703 in Florida,

      75150 is a zip code in Texas (TX).

      33703 is a zip code in Florida (FL).


      Now, I need to think about the geographic layout of the United States:

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the US


      Generally speaking, Florida is east of Texas. This means that locations in Florida
      tend to be east of locations in Texas.


      Since 75150 is in Texas and 33703 is in Florida, the most likely answer is that
      75150 is NOT east of 33703. Instead, 33703 would be east of 75150.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Florida is positioned to the east of Texas on the US map

      - This means locations in Florida are generally east of locations in Texas


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 33703 is in Florida and 75150 is in Texas, zip code 33703 is east of

      ZIP code 33703 is in Florida. Florida is in the southeastern United States.


      In the US, eastern locations have lower longitude numbers than western locations.
      Florida is significantly east of Texas.


      So without even looking up the exact coordinates, I can determine that 75150,

      \ is on the west coast of the US, and Oregon is directly north of California,\
      \ also on the west coast.\n3. In the US, locations generally get more eastern\
      \ as you move from west to east.\n\nNow, given that both states are on the west\
      \ coast, I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these specific\
      \ zip codes.\n\n97331 appears to be a zip code in Oregon. Oregon is north of\
      \ California, but that doesn't tell us about east-west positioning.\n\n90043\
      \ appears to be a zip code in California. \n\nWithout specific knowledge of\
      \ these zip codes, I can use general knowledge about US geography. In general,\
      \ the coastline of the western US (including California and Oregon) runs northwest\
      \ to southeast. This means that as you go north along the coast (from California\
      \ to Oregon), you also tend to go slightly west.\n\nBased on this general pattern,\
      \ locations in Oregon would typically be slightly west of locations in California\
      \ at similar distances from the coast. However, this is a generalization and\
      \ specific zip codes could vary.\n\nGiven that both states are large and have\
      \ varying east-west extents, and without specific data on these zip codes, I\
      \ would need to check the actual coordinates. But if I'm going by general geography\
      \ principles, Oregon locations tend to be west of California locations (not\
      \ east).\n\nLet me make an educated guess based on the numbering system of zip\
      \ codes. In the US postal system, zip codes generally increase from east to\
      \ west. The first digit of a zip code typically represents a group of states,\
      \ with lower numbers in the east and higher numbers in the west.\n\n97331 (in\
      \ OR) starts with 9, and 90043 (in CA) also starts with 9, which suggests they're\
      \ in the same general region (the west coast). But within that region, the second\
      \ digit of 7 for Oregon versus 0 for California might suggest that the Oregon\
      \ zip code is further west (not east).\n\nHowever, this is a simplification,\
      \ and the actual zip code assignments can be complex and not strictly follow\
      \ geographical patterns.\n\nBased on general geography and the zip code pattern,\

      states (like AL)

      - New Jersey is significantly east of Alabama on a map of the United States

      - This means Alabama has a more western longitude than New Jersey


      Step 4: Make the determination based on longitudes.

      - Since Alabama is west of New Jersey, zip code 35954 in Alabama would be west
      of zip code 07440 in New Jersey

      - Therefore, 35954 is NOT east of 07440

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the eastern seaboard/Atlantic coast


      Looking at a mental map of the US, New Jersey is positioned on the East Coast,

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located in the northeastern United States


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is east of Alabama. On a map of the United States,

      - 53209 is a zip code in WI (Wisconsin)

      - The question is asking whether the TX zip code is east of the WI zip code


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographical locations of Texas
      and Wisconsin within the United States.


      Texas is located in the southern part of the United States, extending from the
      south-central region toward the Gulf of Mexico. Wisconsin is located in the
      northern part of the Midwest region of the United States, bordering Lake Michigan.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Texas is generally west of Wisconsin. The
      continental United States has states arranged roughly with the East Coast states
      being the easternmost, then moving westward through the Midwest (including Wisconsin),
      then to the central states, and finally to the western states. Texas is more
      central/southern, while Wisconsin is more central/eastern.

      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States, while Wisconsin
      is in the upper Midwest.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Looking at a US map, Wisconsin is positioned significantly further east than
      Texas. Wisconsin borders Lake Michigan on its eastern side, while Texas is much
      further west in the country.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Texas is west of Wisconsin on a map of the United States, a zip code in

      longitude values are further west, while higher (less negative or more positive)

      - 76155 is in Texas (TX), which is generally in the southern central part of
      the US

      - 53209 is in Wisconsin (WI), which is in the upper Midwest


      Based on general US geography, Texas is typically west of Wisconsin. Texas is
      in the central/southern part of the country, while Wisconsin is further east

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions

      Step 1: Identify the general locations.

      - 76155 is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern central United States

      - 53209 is in Wisconsin (WI), which is in the upper Midwest


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the central-southern part of the country

      - Wisconsin is located in the upper Midwest, significantly east of Texas


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - On a map of the United States, Wisconsin is positioned to the east of Texas

      - This means Texas (including zip code 76155) is west of Wisconsin (including
      zip code 53209)

      - If something is west of another location, it cannot be east of it

      Since 55404 is in Minnesota and 67037 is in Kansas, and Minnesota is east of
      Kansas, the Kansas zip code cannot be east of the Minnesota zip code.

      - Zip codes starting with 5 (like 55404 in Minnesota) are generally in the upper
      Midwest

      - Zip codes starting with 6 (like 67037 in Kansas) are generally in the central
      part of the country


      Since the Minnesota zip code starts with 55 and the Kansas zip code starts with
      67, this supports the idea that the Kansas location is further west (not east)
      of the Minnesota location.


      So 67037, KS is west of 55404, MN, not east of it.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 67037 is in Kansas (KS)

      - 55404 is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      Kansas is located in the central United States, while Minnesota is in the upper
      Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Minnesota is positioned to the east
      of Kansas. The Mississippi River roughly serves as part of the eastern border
      of Minnesota, while Kansas is further west in the Great Plains region.


      Step 4: Consider the zip code numbering system.

      The U.S. postal zip code system generally assigns lower numbers to the eastern
      parts of the country and higher numbers as you move westward. The fact that
      Kansas has a zip code starting with 67, while Minnesota''s starts with 55, further
      confirms that Kansas is west (not east) of Minnesota.


      NO, 67037, KS is not located east of 55404, MN. It is located west of it.'

      whether the zip code 67037 in Kansas (KS) is located east of zip code 55404
      in Minnesota (MN).


      To answer this, I need to know the relative positions of these states and zip
      codes:


      1. First, let''s consider the states: Kansas (KS) and Minnesota (MN). In terms
      of US geography, Minnesota is north and east of Kansas. Minnesota borders Canada
      to the north and is part of the Upper Midwest, while Kansas is in the central
      Great Plains region.


      2. Now let''s think about east-west positioning specifically. Minnesota is generally
      positioned east of Kansas on a US map.


      3. Zip codes within states can vary in their precise locations, but the general
      relationship between the states will give us the primary answer.


      4. 67037 is a zip code in Kansas, and 55404 is a zip code in Minnesota.


      Since Minnesota as a state is east of Kansas, zip code 55404 in Minnesota should
      be east of zip code 67037 in Kansas. Therefore, 67037, KS is NOT located east
      of 55404, MN. Rather, it''s located west of the Minnesota zip code.</think>#
      Is 67037, KS located east of 55404, MN?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify where these states are located relative to each
      other on the US map.

      2) Kansas (KS) is located in the central part of the United States.

      3) Minnesota (MN) is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States.

      4) When comparing their east-west positions, Minnesota is EAST of Kansas.

      5) Since zip code 67037 is in Kansas and 55404 is in Minnesota, the Kansas zip
      code would be WEST of the Minnesota zip code.

      6) Therefore, 67037, KS is NOT located east of 55404, MN - it''s located west

      OH. It''s located west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 77008 is a zip code in Houston, Texas

      - 45801 is a zip code in Lima, Ohio


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Ohio in the United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the eastern Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      45801 is a ZIP code in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest/eastern part of the United States.

      - 77008 is a zip code in Texas (TX), specifically in the Houston area

      - 45801 is a zip code in Ohio (OH), likely in the Lima area


      ## Step 2: Consider US geography

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/eastern part of the United States

      77008 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is in the south-central United States,
      extending from the central part of the country toward the west.


      45801 is a zip code in Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region
      of the United States, in the eastern half of the country.


      Generally speaking, Ohio is east of Texas. The continental United States has
      its eastern states along the Atlantic Ocean and western states along the Pacific
      Ocean. Moving from east to west, we typically have:

      - East Coast states (like New York, Massachusetts)

      - Mid-Atlantic/Great Lakes states (including Ohio)

      - Midwestern states

      - Central/Plains states

      - Mountain states

      - West Coast states


      Ohio is in the eastern half while Texas is more central and extending westward.


      Since Ohio is generally east of Texas, 45801, OH would be east of 77008, TX,
      not the other way around. Therefore, 77008, TX is NOT east of 45801, OH - it''s
      west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two zip codes by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 77008 is a zip code in Houston, Texas

      - 45801 is a zip code in Lima, Ohio


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Ohio within the United
      States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positions).

      - Ohio is significantly east of Texas on the U.S. map

      - States generally progress from east (Atlantic coast) to west (Pacific coast)

      - Ohio is much closer to the Atlantic coast than Texas is


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Ohio is east of Texas on the map of the United States, 77008 (Houston,
      TX) is west of 45801 (Lima, OH), not east of it.


      NO'
    ca751d79-acb7-40ab-b321-8a89bf317b1b: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      if the zip code 77008 in Texas is located east of the zip code 45801 in Ohio.


      To determine this, I need to know the approximate geographical positions of
      these zip codes.


      77008 is in Texas. Texas is in the southwestern part of the United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico on its southeast.


      45801 is in Ohio. Ohio is in the midwestern region of the United States, bordering
      Lake Erie to the north.


      When considering east-west positions in the US, generally speaking, states further
      east have higher longitude values (they''re closer to the Prime Meridian). States
      further west have lower longitude values.


      Ohio is generally considered to be in the eastern half of the US, while Texas
      is more central/western. So Ohio (45801) is likely to be east of Texas (77008).


      Therefore, 77008, TX is NOT east of 45801, OH. Instead, it''s west of it.</think>I
      need to determine if zip code 77008 in Texas is located east of zip code 45801
      in Ohio.


      Step 1: Let me consider the general geographic locations of Texas and Ohio in
      the United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 2: Looking at the relative east-west positioning of these states:

      - Ohio is much further east in the continental US than Texas

      - States in the eastern US have higher longitude values than western states


      Step 3: More specifically, zip code 77008 is in Houston, Texas, while 45801
      is in Lima, Ohio.

      - Houston is located in southeastern Texas

      - Lima is located in northwestern Ohio

      - Even though Houston is in the eastern part of Texas, Ohio as a whole is still
      significantly east of Texas


      Therefore, 77008, TX is located WEST of 45801, OH, not east of it.

      2. 45801, OH (in Ohio)


      I need to determine if the Texas zip code is located east of the Ohio zip code.


      In the United States, the general geographic layout is that:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/eastern part of the country

      - Texas is in the South/southwestern part of the country


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Ohio is definitely east of Texas. This means
      that Texas (where 77008 is located) is WEST of Ohio (where 45801 is located),
      not east.


      So 77008, TX is NOT east of 45801, OH. It is west of it.</think>I''ll solve
      this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 77008 is a zip code in Houston, Texas

      - 45801 is a zip code in Lima, Ohio


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Ohio in the United States.

      - Texas is located in the southern/southwestern region of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/eastern region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - When looking at a US map, Ohio is clearly east of Texas

      - This means Texas is west of Ohio, not east


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 77008 is in Texas and 45801 is in Ohio, the Texas zip code must be west
      of the Ohio zip code


      NO (77008, TX is not east of 45801, OH; it is west of it)'

      77008 is a zip code in Houston, Texas.

      45801 is a zip code in Lima, Ohio.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions. In the United States, Texas
      is located in the south-central part of the country, while Ohio is in the Midwest/Great
      Lakes region.


      Looking at the geographic orientation:

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the continental US

      - Texas is more central/southern and west of Ohio


      So if we''re talking about east-west positioning, Ohio (45801) would generally
      be EAST of Texas (77008), not the other way around.


      Therefore, 77008, TX is NOT east of 45801, OH. It''s actually west of it.</think>#
      Is 77008, TX located east of 45801, OH?

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 77008 is a zip code in Houston, Texas

      - 45801 is a zip code in Lima, Ohio


      ## Step 2: Compare their positions on a map

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States

      - Looking at the continental US from west to east, Texas is generally west of
      Ohio


      ## Step 3: Determine relative position

      - When considering longitude (east-west positioning), Ohio is further east than
      Texas

      - Therefore, Houston (77008, TX) is west of Lima (45801, OH), not east of it

      75025 is a zip code in Plano, Texas, which is in the northern part of Texas.

      55043 is a zip code in Minnesota.


      In terms of US geography, Minnesota is located in the northern central part
      of the country, while Texas is in the south central part.


      To determine which is more easterly, I need to consider their relative longitudes.
      The United States has longitudes that generally decrease (become more negative)
      as you move west. So the more eastern location will have the higher (less negative)
      longitude.


      Generally speaking:

      - Minnesota is north and east of Texas

      - Texas is south and west of Minnesota


      So 75025, TX would typically be west of 55043, MN, not east.


      Therefore, 75025, TX is NOT located east of 55043, MN.</think>I''ll solve this
      step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 75025 is a zip code in Plano, Texas

      - 55043 is a zip code in Minnesota


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Minnesota within the
      United States.

      - Minnesota is located in the north-central part of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions (longitude).

      - Minnesota is generally positioned to the east of Texas on the map

      - Looking at their longitudinal coordinates, Minnesota locations typically have
      smaller (less negative) longitude values than Texas locations


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Minnesota is positioned to the east of Texas geographically, 75025 (TX)
      would be WEST of 55043 (MN), not east.


      NO, 75025, TX is not located east of 55043, MN.'

      east of 55043, MN, I need to find the approximate locations of these zip codes
      and compare their geographic positions.


      75025 is a zip code in Texas (TX). Texas is located in the south-central part
      of the United States.

      55043 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN). Minnesota is located in the northern
      central part of the United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - Minnesota is in the upper Midwest, roughly in the middle of the country from
      east to west

      - Texas is generally west of Minnesota, though Texas is large and spans a significant
      distance


      To be more precise, I should think about where specifically in each state these
      zip codes are located:

      - 75025 appears to be in Plano, TX, which is in the northeastern part of Texas

      - 55043 appears to be in Lakeland, MN, which is in the eastern part of Minnesota
      near the Wisconsin border


      Even though 75025 is in northeastern Texas, Texas as a whole is west of Minnesota.
      But I need to be careful here, as the eastern edge of Texas could potentially
      be east of the western edge of Minnesota.


      Since 55043 is in eastern Minnesota (near the Wisconsin border), and 75025 is
      in northeastern Texas, it''s very likely that 75025 is west of 55043.</think>#
      Is 75025, TX located east of 55043, MN?


      Let me determine this by examining the geographic positions of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 75025 is a zip code in Plano, Texas, which is in the northeastern part of
      Texas.

      - 55043 is a zip code in Minnesota, likely in the eastern portion of the state.


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of Texas and Minnesota

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States.

      - Texas is located in the South-Central region of the United States.

      - When looking at a US map, Minnesota is positioned north and east of Texas.


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions

      - Minnesota, including its eastern areas, is generally positioned to the east
      of Texas.

      - Even though Plano is in northeastern Texas, it still lies west of most of
      Minnesota.

      - Eastern Minnesota (where 55043 is located) would be further east than northeastern
      Texas.

      located east of 88048, NM, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and
      compare their longitudes. In the United States, eastern locations have a lower
      longitude value than western locations.


      91352 is a zip code in California (CA). California is on the west coast of the
      United States.

      88048 is a zip code in New Mexico (NM). New Mexico is in the southwestern United
      States, but is east of California.


      More specifically:

      - 91352 appears to be in the Los Angeles area of California

      - 88048 appears to be in southern New Mexico


      Given the geography of the United States, locations in California are generally
      west of locations in New Mexico. This means that 91352, CA would be west of
      88048, NM, not east of it.


      So 91352, CA is NOT located east of 88048, NM; rather, it''s located west of
      it.</think>I need to determine if 91352, CA is located east of 88048, NM by

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 91352 is a zip code in Sun Valley, Los Angeles area, California

      - 88048 is a zip code in Sunland Park area, New Mexico


      Step 2: Consider the geographic arrangement of US states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, but east of California


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - States become increasingly eastern as you move from California eastward through
      Arizona to New Mexico

      - California zip codes will generally have a more western (not eastern) position
      than New Mexico zip codes


      Step 4: Make the determination based on longitude.

      - Since California is west of New Mexico, zip code 91352 (CA) must be west of
      zip code 88048 (NM), not east of it

      91352 is in California (CA)

      88048 is in New Mexico (NM)


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - California is on the west coast of the US

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern US, but east of California


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), California is generally west
      of New Mexico. This means that locations in California are typically west of
      locations in New Mexico, not east.


      So a zip code in California would generally be west of a zip code in New Mexico,
      not east of it.


      Therefore, 91352, CA is likely west of 88048, NM, not east of it.</think>I need

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New Mexico is in the southwestern United States, but significantly east of
      California


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - All of California is west of New Mexico

      - Moving east from California, you would need to cross Nevada and Arizona before
      reaching New Mexico


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the relative positions.

      - Since California is entirely west of New Mexico, any zip code in California
      (including 91352) must be west of any zip code in New Mexico (including 88048),
      not east.

      First, let''s identify the states:

      - 45371 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 06076 is in Connecticut (CT)


      Geographically in the US:

      - Connecticut is one of the easternmost states, located in New England in the

      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 45371 is in OH (Ohio)

      - 06076 is in CT (Connecticut)


      Now I need to determine their relative positions on a map of the US. In terms
      of US geography:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region

      - Connecticut is in the Northeast region


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Connecticut is on the east coast of the United States

      - Ohio is inland, west of Connecticut


      So if we''re asking whether Ohio is east of Connecticut, that would be incorrect.
      Connecticut is east of Ohio.


      Therefore, 45371, OH is NOT located east of 06076, CT. Rather, it''s located
      west of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 45371 is in Ohio (OH)

      - 06076 is in Connecticut (CT)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical positions of these states.

      - Connecticut (CT) is located in the northeastern United States, on the Atlantic
      coast.

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the midwestern United States, west of Connecticut.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - States on the East Coast (like Connecticut) are generally east of midwestern
      states (like Ohio).

      - Connecticut is positioned further east than Ohio on the US map.


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since Connecticut is east of Ohio, zip code 06076 in CT is east of zip code
      45371 in OH. This means that 45371, OH is west of 06076, CT, not east of it.

      46222 is a zip code in Indiana (IN)

      19043 is a zip code in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the midwestern part of the United States


      Specifically, Pennsylvania is east of Indiana. On a west-to-east orientation
      across the United States, Indiana comes before Pennsylvania.


      Since 46222 is in Indiana, and 19043 is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is

      - Since 46222 (IN) is in a state that is west of Pennsylvania, and 19043 is
      in Pennsylvania, the Indiana zip code cannot be east of the Pennsylvania zip
      code.

      to determine whether ZIP code 42431 in Kentucky is located east of ZIP code
      18951 in Pennsylvania.


      First, let me think about the geographical locations of Kentucky (KY) and Pennsylvania
      (PA) in the United States:

      - Kentucky is generally located in the east-central part of the US

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern part of the US


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky. On a map of the US, Pennsylvania
      is closer to the Atlantic coast, while Kentucky is more inland.


      Now for the specific ZIP codes:

      - 42431 is in Kentucky

      - 18951 is in Pennsylvania


      Since Pennsylvania is east of Kentucky, it''s likely that any location in Pennsylvania
      (including 18951) would be east of a location in Kentucky (including 42431).


      So, 42431, KY is likely NOT east of 18951, PA. Instead, 42431, KY is likely
      WEST of 18951, PA.</think># Is 42431, KY located east of 18951, PA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two ZIP codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 42431 is in Kentucky (KY)

      - 18951 is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions on the map

      Pennsylvania is significantly east of Kentucky. The eastern border of Kentucky
      is west of Pennsylvania''s western border.


      ## Step 4: Apply this to the specific ZIP codes

      Since 42431 is in Kentucky and 18951 is in Pennsylvania, the Kentucky ZIP code
      must be west of the Pennsylvania ZIP code, not east.

      First, let''s think about the geographic locations of Kentucky and Pennsylvania
      in the United States:


      Kentucky is generally located in the east-central part of the United States.

      Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern part of the United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Pennsylvania is generally east of Kentucky.
      When we look at a US map, Pennsylvania is closer to the Atlantic coast, while
      Kentucky is more inland and west of Pennsylvania.


      So if we''re asking if Kentucky is east of Pennsylvania, the general answer
      would be no - Kentucky is west of Pennsylvania.


      Now, let''s verify this with the specific zip codes:

      - 42431 is in Kentucky

      - 18951 is in Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania is further east, closer to the Atlantic coast.

      - Kentucky is more inland and is positioned to the west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Since zip codes generally follow the geographic positioning of their
      states, I can conclude that zip code 42431 in Kentucky would be located to the

      Pennsylvania (PA) is located in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Examine the east-west relationship.

      On a U.S. map, Pennsylvania lies to the east of Kentucky. Pennsylvania is an
      eastern state bordering the Atlantic region, while Kentucky is further inland
      and west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific zip codes.

      Since 42431 is in Kentucky and 18951 is in Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania is
      east of Kentucky, it follows that 18951, PA would be east of 42431, KY - not

      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 74105, OK (Oklahoma)

      - 32603, FL (Florida)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to know their relative positions
      on a map of the United States.


      Looking at the US map, Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United
      States, while Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States.


      Geographically speaking, Florida is east of Oklahoma. That means that locations
      in Florida would generally be east of locations in Oklahoma.


      So 32603, FL would be east of 74105, OK - not the other way around.


      Therefore, 74105, OK is NOT east of 32603, FL. In fact, it''s the opposite -
      32603, FL is east of 74105, OK.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic

      Oklahoma is located in the central part of the United States.

      Florida is located in the southeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Looking at a US map, Florida is clearly east of Oklahoma. The entire state of
      Florida is geographically east of Oklahoma.


      Step 4: Since 74105 is in Oklahoma and 32603 is in Florida, and Florida is east

      2. 32603, FL - This is a zip code in Florida (FL)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to consider their general geographic

      if a zip code in Colorado (80237) is located east of a zip code in Texas (76114).


      Step 1: I need to identify where these zip codes are located.

      - 80237 is in Colorado (CO)

      - 76114 is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Think about the general geographic relationship between Colorado and
      Texas.

      Colorado is located to the northwest of Texas. Colorado is in the mountain west
      region of the US, while Texas is in the south-central region. Generally speaking,
      Colorado is west of Texas.


      Step 3: However, I need to look at the specific zip codes. Colorado is a rectangular
      state and is mostly west of Texas, but there could be exceptions depending on
      the exact locations.


      Step 4: Let me think about zip code geography. Generally, in the US postal system:

      - Lower zip codes tend to be in the eastern part of the country

      - Higher zip codes tend to be in the western part of the country


      80237 (Colorado) is a higher number than 76114 (Texas), which suggests the Colorado
      location is farther west.


      Step 5: More specifically, I know that:

      - ZIP codes starting with 8 are generally in the Mountain West region (including
      Colorado)

      - ZIP codes starting with 7 are generally in the South Central region (including
      Texas)


      Based on the standard ZIP code geography, locations with ZIP codes beginning
      with 8 are generally west of locations with ZIP codes beginning with 7.


      So based on the general geographic relationship between the states and the ZIP
      code numbering system, I can conclude that 80237, CO is most likely west of

      - 76114 is in Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Colorado and Texas

      Colorado is located in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States,
      while Texas is in the south-central region. Generally speaking, Colorado sits
      to the northwest of Texas.


      ## Step 3: Analyze the zip code patterns

      In the US zip code system:

      - Codes beginning with 8 (like 80237) are typically assigned to the Mountain
      West region

      - Codes beginning with 7 (like 76114) are typically assigned to the South Central
      region

      - ZIP codes generally increase as you move westward across the country

      Looking at a map, Colorado is positioned entirely west of Texas. Even the easternmost
      parts of Colorado are still west of Texas.

    8bb362d4-6859-4688-bb44-62b7261ba88e: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of the two zip codes and then compare their east-west
      positions.


      First, let me identify where these zip codes are:


      1. 80237, CO - This is a zip code in Colorado (CO)

      2. 76114, TX - This is a zip code in Texas (TX)


      Now, I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the US, locations
      are generally measured by longitude, where lower (more negative) longitude values
      are further west, and higher (less negative) longitude values are further east.


      Colorado is generally west of Texas in the United States. Colorado is in the
      Mountain Time Zone, while Texas is mostly in the Central Time Zone (with a small
      part in Mountain Time). Going from west to east in the continental US, we have:

      Pacific Time -> Mountain Time -> Central Time -> Eastern Time


      Since Colorado (80237) is in Mountain Time and Texas (76114) is likely in Central
      Time, Colorado would generally be west of Texas, not east of it.


      Therefore, 80237, CO would NOT be located east of 76114, TX.</think>I need to
      determine if 80237 in Colorado is east of 76114 in Texas by comparing their
      geographical positions.


      Step 1: Consider the general locations of Colorado and Texas in the United States.

      Colorado is located in the western/central part of the United States, in the
      Mountain region.

      Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west).

      Colorado is generally positioned to the west of Texas on a US map.

      Moving from west to east across the US, you would typically encounter Colorado
      before Texas.


      Step 3: While specific zip codes might have unusual positions relative to their
      states, this doesn''t override the general geographical relationship between
      Colorado and Texas.

      80237 is in Denver, Colorado.

      76114 is in Fort Worth, Texas.


      Step 4: Denver, Colorado is clearly west of Fort Worth, Texas.


      NO (80237, CO is not located east of 76114, TX - it''s located west of it)'
    9958b4d7-47a0-4806-ae9e-9a6ed0a43d64: '<think>I need to determine the locations
      of these zip codes and then figure out if one is east of the other.


      80237 is in Colorado (CO).

      76114 is in Texas (TX).


      To determine if one location is east of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      East-west position is determined by longitude, where:

      - Lower (more negative) longitude numbers are further west

      - Higher (less negative or more positive) longitude numbers are further east


      So I need to find the approximate longitude for each zip code:


      80237, CO is likely in the Denver metro area of Colorado.

      76114, TX is likely in the Fort Worth area of Texas.


      Geographically speaking, Colorado is west of Texas in the United States. Denver
      is in the eastern part of Colorado, but Texas as a whole is east of Colorado.


      So generally, a location in Colorado would be west of a location in Texas, meaning
      80237, CO would be west of 76114, TX. If 80237, CO is west of 76114, TX, then
      76114, TX is east of 80237, CO.


      Therefore, 80237, CO is NOT located east of 76114, TX. It would be west of it.</think>To
      answer whether 80237, CO is located east of 76114, TX, I need to determine the
      relative geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 80237 is in Colorado (CO), likely in the Denver metro area.

      - 76114 is in Texas (TX), likely in the Fort Worth area.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Colorado and Texas.

      - Colorado is located west of Texas in the United States.

      - Denver (eastern Colorado) is still west of Fort Worth, Texas.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Locations in Colorado generally have a lower (more negative) longitude than
      locations in Texas.

      - Even though Denver is in eastern Colorado, it''s still west of locations in
      Texas.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Colorado is west of Texas, 80237 (CO) must be west of 76114 (TX).

      - If 80237 is west of 76114, then it cannot be east of it.

      To determine this, I need to think about the relative geographical positions
      of these locations.


      Generally speaking, in the United States:

      - New York (NY) is in the northeastern part of the country

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest, west of New York


      So generally, locations in New York would be east of locations in Ohio. But
      let me think more specifically about these zip codes.


      43160 is a zip code in Ohio. Without looking up the exact location, I know that
      Ohio is west of New York state.


      12549 is a zip code in New York. New York state is east of Ohio.


      So if 43160 is in Ohio and 12549 is in New York, then 43160 would be west of
      12549, not east of it.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - On a U.S. map, New York is positioned to the east of Ohio

      - This means Ohio is to the west of New York


      Step 4: Apply this relationship to the specific zip codes.

      Generally speaking:

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - Ohio is in the midwestern United States, west of New York


      The longitude generally decreases as you move east in the United States (i.e.,

      Based on the general geography of the United States:

      - New York (12549) should be further east than Ohio (43160)

      Let me double-check my geographic knowledge:

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania to its east

      - New York is east of Pennsylvania

      - This confirms that New York is indeed east of Ohio

      On a U.S. map, New York is positioned to the east of Ohio. The eastern border

      1. First, let''s think about Ohio (OH) and New York (NY) in terms of their east-west
      positioning.

      2. In the US, New York state is located on the east coast, while Ohio is in
      the Midwest.

      3. Generally speaking, New York is east of Ohio on a map of the United States.

      4. If New York is east of Ohio, then locations in New York would generally be
      east of locations in Ohio.

      5. Since 43160 is in Ohio and 12549 is in New York, the New York zip code would
      generally be east of the Ohio zip code.


      So 43160, OH is likely NOT east of 12549, NY. Instead, 43160, OH would be west

      Ohio (OH) is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York

      ## Step 2: Compare the general east-west positioning

      New York is positioned east of Ohio on the US map. The entire state of New York
      lies to the east of the entire state of Ohio.


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific zip codes

      Since 43160 is in Ohio and 12549 is in New York, the Ohio zip code must be west

      First, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located:

      - 73142, OK is a zip code in Oklahoma

      - 39530, MS is a zip code in Mississippi


      Now, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of these two states.
      The United States is generally laid out with:

      - West Coast states on the left (west)

      - East Coast states on the right (east)

      - Oklahoma is in the central part of the US

      - Mississippi is in the southeastern US


      Let me visualize the map of the US. Going from west to east in the relevant
      region, we have:

      - Oklahoma

      - Arkansas

      - Mississippi


      So Mississippi is east of Oklahoma. This means that zip code 39530 in Mississippi
      would be east of zip code 73142 in Oklahoma.


      Since the question asks if 73142, OK is east of 39530, MS, the answer would
      be NO - it''s actually the opposite. Oklahoma is west of Mississippi, not east
      of it.</think>To determine if 73142, OK is located east of 39530, MS, I need

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 73142 is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - 39530 is in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states

      Oklahoma is located in the south-central region of the United States, while
      Mississippi is in the southeastern region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning

      Looking at a US map, Mississippi is positioned to the east of Oklahoma. The
      states between them (moving west to east) would include Arkansas and possibly
      parts of Tennessee.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion

      Since Mississippi (MS) is east of Oklahoma (OK), zip code 39530 in MS would
      be east of zip code 73142 in OK - not the other way around.

      east of 08080, NJ, I need to:


      1. Identify where each zip code is located

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions (longitude)


      Let''s start by identifying the locations:


      28107 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC), which is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      08080 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ), which is also on the east coast of the
      United States.


      Now, to determine which is further east, I need to consider their geographical
      positions. On the east coast of the US, the states follow roughly this order
      from north to south: Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
      New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
      Georgia, Florida.


      New Jersey is north of North Carolina. But being north doesn''t tell us about
      east-west positioning. What matters is longitude.


      Generally, the east coast of the US curves such that the northern states (like
      New Jersey) tend to be slightly more eastward than southern states (like North
      Carolina). New Jersey is typically more eastward (lower longitude number) than
      North Carolina.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 28107 is in North Carolina (NC)

      - 08080 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      Both states are on the eastern seaboard of the United States, but New Jersey
      is located northeast of North Carolina.


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudes

      The east coast of the US curves, with New Jersey extending further east into
      the Atlantic Ocean than North Carolina. Looking at their geographic positioning:

      - New Jersey (08080) has a more easterly longitude

      - North Carolina (28107) has a more westerly longitude

      To solve this, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located and compare
      their positions on an east-west axis.


      In the United States, locations further east have higher longitude values (when
      using negative numbers for western hemisphere).


      Zip code 28107 is in North Carolina, which is on the east coast of the United

      The specific zip code 28107 appears to be in the Midland area of North Carolina.

      The specific zip code 08080 appears to be in the Sewell area of New Jersey.


      New Jersey is generally east of North Carolina on a map of the United States.
      The entire state of New Jersey lies east of North Carolina.

      Step 1: Let me consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      North Carolina and New Jersey are both on the East Coast of the United States,
      but New Jersey is positioned further northeast compared to North Carolina.


      Step 2: In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), New Jersey lies east
      of North Carolina. On a map of the United States, you would need to look to
      the right (east) from North Carolina to find New Jersey.


      Step 3: While specific zip codes within states can sometimes create exceptions
      to general state positions, this is not the case here. Zip code 28107 is in
      Midland, NC, which is in the central part of North Carolina. Zip code 08080
      is in Sewell, NJ, in the southern part of New Jersey.


      Step 4: Even the easternmost parts of North Carolina are still west of the westernmost
      parts of New Jersey, so zip code 28107 in NC must be west of zip code 08080

      - 28107 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 08080 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Now, I need to think about their general geographic positions. On the US east

      Since New Jersey (08080) is located in the northeast, and North Carolina (28107)
      is located in the southeast, New Jersey would typically be east of North Carolina.

      - 08080 is in New Jersey (NJ), which is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the shape of the US East Coast.

      The US East Coast runs in a northeast to southwest direction. This means that
      as you move north along the coast, you generally also move eastward.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      Since New Jersey is further north than North Carolina on the East Coast, New
      Jersey is generally positioned further east than North Carolina.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since 08080, NJ is likely positioned further east than 28107, NC, the NC location

      - New Jersey is in the northeastern region of the US

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern region of the US

      - When looking at a map, New Jersey is positioned northeast of North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider the coastal orientation

      - The US East Coast curves, with northeastern states (like NJ) generally being
      further east than southeastern states (like NC)

      - New Jersey''s eastern shoreline extends further into the Atlantic Ocean than
      North Carolina''s shoreline

      western locations.


      28107 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC).

      08080 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ).


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States,
      while North Carolina is also on the eastern seaboard but further south.


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude):

      - New Jersey is typically more east than North Carolina

      - The eastern coast of the US curves, with NJ being further east than NC


      Without specific coordinates, I can use my general knowledge that New Jersey
      is east of North Carolina. Therefore, 08080, NJ would be east of 28107, NC.


      So 28107, NC is NOT located east of 08080, NJ. Rather, 08080, NJ is east of
      28107, NC.</think>Let me solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both ZIP codes.

      - 28107 is a ZIP code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 08080 is a ZIP code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the northeastern Atlantic coast of the United States

      - North Carolina is also on the Atlantic coast, but further south


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning (longitude).

      - The Atlantic coastline curves, with New Jersey extending further east than
      North Carolina

      - New Jersey is generally positioned to the east of North Carolina on a map


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since New Jersey is east of North Carolina, ZIP code 08080 in NJ would be
      east of ZIP code 28107 in NC


      NO, 28107, NC is not located east of 08080, NJ. It''s the opposite - the New
      Jersey ZIP code is east of the North Carolina ZIP code.'

      28107 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      08080 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Looking at the relative positions of these states:

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - North Carolina is also on the eastern seaboard, but further south than New
      Jersey


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally located to the east of North Carolina

      - The eastern parts of NC are on the Atlantic coast, as is NJ, but NJ extends
      further east into the Atlantic Ocean


      So generally speaking, locations in New Jersey would be east of locations in
      North Carolina. However, to be certain, I''d need to know the specific longitude
      coordinates of these zip codes.


      Based on the general geographic positioning of these states, 28107, NC would
      be WEST of 08080, NJ, not east of it.


      So the answer is NO.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 28107 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 08080 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states on a map of the United
      States.

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - North Carolina is also on the eastern seaboard, but is positioned to the south
      and west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - States on the US eastern coast generally follow a northeast to southwest orientation

      - New Jersey is more northeasterly positioned compared to North Carolina

      - This means New Jersey is generally east of North Carolina in terms of longitude


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since 08080 is in New Jersey and 28107 is in North Carolina, the NJ zip code
      would be east of the NC zip code, not the other way around


      NO'

      28107 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC).

      08080 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).


      Geographically in the United States:

      - New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard (Atlantic coast)

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions


      Let me think about US geography:

      - WV is West Virginia, which is generally west of New Jersey (NJ)

      - Zip code 26041 is in West Virginia

      - Zip code 07070 is in New Jersey


      In the United States, locations further east have lower zip codes, and locations
      further west have higher zip codes. This is a general pattern, though there
      are exceptions.

      - 07070 (NJ) starts with "0", indicating it''s in the easternmost region of
      the US

      - 26041 (WV) starts with "2", indicating it''s further west than areas with
      "0" zip codes


      Beyond the general pattern, I know that New Jersey is on the Atlantic coast

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States

      - West Virginia is an inland state located west of New Jersey


      ## Step 3: Check zip code patterns

      - US zip codes generally follow an east-to-west pattern where lower numbers
      (especially those starting with 0) are furthest east

      - The 07xxx codes are used for northern New Jersey

      - The 26xxx codes are used for northern West Virginia

      - West Virginia is an inland state located to the west of New Jersey


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - States on the east coast (like New Jersey) are generally further east than

      - Moving from New Jersey to West Virginia means traveling westward

      - Therefore, any location in New Jersey would be east of a location in West

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      - New Jersey is located on the east coast of the United States

      - West Virginia is located inland, to the west of New Jersey

      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 26041, WV refers to a zip code in West Virginia (WV)

      - 07070, NJ refers to a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      Now I need to determine their relative positions. The question asks if the West
      Virginia location is east of the New Jersey location.


      Generally speaking, West Virginia is located to the west of New Jersey. The
      entire state of New Jersey is east of West Virginia on a US map.


      Since 26041 is in West Virginia and 07070 is in New Jersey, the West Virginia
      zip code would be west of the New Jersey zip code, not east of it.


      So the answer would be NO, 26041, WV is not located east of 07070, NJ. It''s
      actually located west of it.</think>To determine if 26041, WV is located east

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states.

      On a map of the United States, New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard,
      while West Virginia is inland and southwest of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      New Jersey is east of West Virginia. This means that locations in West Virginia
      (including ZIP code 26041) are generally west of locations in New Jersey (including
      ZIP code 07070).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since West Virginia is west of New Jersey, ZIP code 26041 in WV cannot be east
      of ZIP code 07070 in NJ.

      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 26041 is in West Virginia (WV)

      - 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the United States,
      states that are further east have lower longitude values, and states further
      west have higher longitude values.


      Geographically, New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United
      States, while West Virginia is inland and to the west of New Jersey.


      So in terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is further east

      - West Virginia (WV) is further west


      Therefore, 26041, WV is NOT located east of 07070, NJ. Rather, it''s located

      - 07070 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while West
      Virginia is inland and to the west of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Analyze the directional relationship.

      When looking at a US map, New Jersey is clearly east of West Virginia. This
      means that any location in West Virginia (including zip code 26041) would be
      west of locations in New Jersey (including zip code 07070).

      To answer this, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these
      two locations. The US states are generally arranged with eastern states like
      Maine, New Hampshire, etc. on the east coast, and then as you go west, you encounter
      states like New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, etc.


      New Jersey (NJ) is an east coast state, located on the Atlantic Ocean.

      West Virginia (WV) is located inland, to the west of states like Maryland, Pennsylvania,
      and Virginia.


      In terms of geography, New Jersey is located to the east of West Virginia. Therefore,
      a zip code in WV would be located WEST of a zip code in NJ, not east.

      - New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - West Virginia is an inland state, positioned to the west of states like Maryland
      and Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      - New Jersey is further east in the United States compared to West Virginia.

      - Any location in New Jersey would generally be east of locations in West Virginia.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 07070 is in New Jersey and 26041 is in West Virginia, 07070 must be
      east of 26041.

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 75033 is a ZIP code in Texas (TX)

      - 72023 is a ZIP code in Arkansas (AR)


      To determine which is further east, I need to understand the rough geographic
      locations of these ZIP codes.


      Generally speaking:

      - Arkansas (AR) is located east of Texas (TX)

      - Texas is in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Arkansas is in the south-central part of the United States, bordering Texas

      - 7xxxx ZIP codes generally cover central/southern states

      - 75xxx would be in eastern/northeastern Texas

      - 72xxx would be in central/western Arkansas


      Since Arkansas is generally east of Texas, and the specific ZIP code in Texas
      (75033) is in eastern Texas while the ZIP code in Arkansas (72023) is in western/central
      Arkansas, it''s possible they could be close in longitude. However, the general

      Step 2: Consider the specific ZIP codes.

      - 75033 is in Texas, specifically in Collin County in the northeastern part
      of Texas.

      - 72023 is in Arkansas, in the central part of the state.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - Even though 75033 is in northeastern Texas (which puts it closer to Arkansas),
      the entire state of Arkansas still lies east of this part of Texas.

      - ZIP code 72023 (Arkansas) is further east than ZIP code 75033 (Texas).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on relative positions.

    e2b537fe-b043-4c2e-b574-287b895714a6: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographic locations of the two zip codes and then determine
      if one is east of the other.


      Zip code 75033 is in Texas (TX).

      Zip code 72023 is in Arkansas (AR).


      I need to consider the general geographic layout of the United States. Texas
      is generally to the west of Arkansas. Arkansas borders the eastern side of Texas.


      Given the standard organization of zip codes in the US:

      - First digit: Represents a group of states, with lower numbers generally in
      the northeast and higher numbers in the west

      - 7xxxx codes cover states in the central US

      - The "75" prefix indicates north/central Texas

      - The "72" prefix indicates central Arkansas


      Since the first two digits (75 vs 72) don''t tell us enough (since they represent
      different states), I need to consider the actual geography.


      Arkansas is positioned to the east of Texas in the US map. Since 75033 is in
      Texas and 72023 is in Arkansas, the Texas zip code would be west of the Arkansas
      zip code, not east of it.</think># Is 75033, TX located east of 72023, AR?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 75033 is a zip code in Texas (TX)

      - 72023 is a zip code in Arkansas (AR)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - Arkansas is located to the east of Texas

      - Texas shares its eastern border with Arkansas (among other states)


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific zip codes

      - The "75" prefix in 75033 indicates it''s in north/central Texas

      - The "72" prefix in 72023 indicates it''s in central Arkansas

      - Even considering their specific locations within their respective states,
      the state boundary relationship is determinative here


      ## Conclusion

      Since Arkansas is east of Texas, and 72023 is in Arkansas while 75033 is in
      Texas, 75033 is located WEST of 72023, not east.


      NO'

      east of 72023, AR, I need to find the geographic locations of these zip codes
      and compare them.


      75033 is a zip code in Texas (TX).

      72023 is a zip code in Arkansas (AR).


      In general, Texas is to the west of Arkansas in the United States. Arkansas
      borders Texas on Texas''s eastern border. So typically, locations in Arkansas
      would be east of locations in Texas.


      However, I need to be more precise since these are specific zip codes that could
      be in different parts of their respective states.


      Let me think about where these might be:

      - 75033 is likely in eastern Texas since it''s a 750XX zip code (higher zip
      codes in Texas tend to be in the eastern part)

      - 72023 is likely in central or western Arkansas


      The general geography is that Arkansas is east of Texas. So unless these are
      very unusual locations within their states (like 75033 being at the easternmost
      edge of Texas and 72023 being at the westernmost edge of Arkansas), the Arkansas
      zip code should be east of the Texas zip code.


      Given that Texas is west of Arkansas, and these zip codes don''t seem to be
      in unusual positions within their states, 75033 in TX is likely WEST of 72023
      in AR, not east.


      Therefore, 75033, TX is NOT located east of 72023, AR.</think>I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 75033 is a zip code in Frisco, Texas (TX)

      - 72023 is a zip code in Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the geography of these states.

      Arkansas is positioned to the east of Texas. The entire state of Arkansas lies
      east of most of Texas.


      Step 3: Look at the specific locations.

      - Texas zip codes generally increase as you move east, with 75xxx series being
      in the northeastern part of Texas.

      - Arkansas zip codes (72xxx) are still east of even the northeastern parts of
      Texas.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Even though 75033 is in the eastern portion of Texas, it''s still west of Arkansas.
      Since 72023 is in Arkansas, it must be east of 75033.


      NO, 75033, TX is not located east of 72023, AR. It''s located west of it.'

      1) First, I need to understand what''s being asked. The question is asking if
      27705, NC (North Carolina) is located east of 10958, NY (New York).


      2) To determine this, I need to compare the geographical locations of these
      zip codes. In the US, generally speaking, states on the east coast run from
      north to south, with northern states like New York being in the northeast and
      southern states like North Carolina being in the southeast.


      3) North Carolina (NC) is located in the southeastern United States, while New
      York (NY) is located in the northeastern United States.


      4) When determining east vs. west in US geography, we''re comparing longitudes
      (how far east or west something is). Lower longitude numbers represent more
      eastern locations within the continental US.


      5) Both NC and NY are on the east coast, but NY is north of NC. However, being
      north doesn''t necessarily determine east/west positioning.


      6) The east coast of the US curves, with New York being more to the east than
      North Carolina. So generally, locations in NY would be east of locations in
      NC.


      Therefore, 27705, NC would NOT be east of 10958, NY. Rather, NY would be east
      of NC.</think>To determine if 27705, NC is located east of 10958, NY, I need
      to consider their geographic positions:


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 27705 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)

      - 10958 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Both states are on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - New York is in the northeastern US, while North Carolina is in the southeastern
      US.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning (longitude).

      - The east coast of the US curves, with New York actually being further east
      than North Carolina.

      - New York state generally lies east of North Carolina on a map.

      - Specific zip codes in these states follow this general pattern.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on longitude.

      - 10958 (NY) is positioned further east than 27705 (NC).

      of locations in the Midwest (like Michigan).


      To be more precise:

      - Michigan is west of Washington DC

      - Therefore, 49009, MI would be west of 20032, DC

      - If 49009, MI is west of 20032, DC, then it is NOT east of 20032, DC


      So the answer should be NO.</think>I need to determine the geographic relationship
      between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 49009 is in Michigan (MI)

      - 20032 is in Washington, District of Columbia (DC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states/regions within the
      US.

      - Washington DC is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - The eastern seaboard (including DC) is further east than the Midwest (including
      Michigan)

      - Washington DC is east of Michigan


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 49009 is in Michigan and 20032 is in DC, 49009 is west of 20032

      - If 49009 is west of 20032, then 49009 is NOT east of 20032

      MI is east of 20032, DC. To do this, I need to determine their geographical
      locations and compare them.


      Let me think about US geography:

      - 49009 is a zip code in Michigan (MI)

      - 20032 is a zip code in Washington, DC (District of Columbia)


      Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Washington DC
      is on the East Coast.


      Generally speaking, locations in Michigan are west of locations in DC, since
      Michigan is further inland and DC is on the eastern seaboard.


      So if we''re comparing their east-west positioning (longitude):

      - Michigan locations are generally further west (have a larger negative longitude
      value)

      - DC locations are generally further east (have a smaller negative longitude
      value)


      This means that 49009, MI would be WEST of 20032, DC - not east of it.

      Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while Washington
      DC is on the East Coast.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      On a map of the United States, Washington DC is significantly farther east than
      Michigan. DC is located near the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern seaboard, while
      Michigan is inland and westward.


      ## Step 4: Make the determination

      Since Michigan is west of Washington DC, it means that 49009, MI is west of

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 38611 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 24073 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Mississippi is in the southeastern United States, but is positioned to the
      west of Virginia


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Virginia is further east than Mississippi

      - Therefore, a location in Mississippi would be west of a location in Virginia,
      not east of it


      NO, 38611, MS is not located east of 24073, VA. It is located west of it.'

      (Mississippi) is located east of 24073, VA (Virginia).


      First, let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Virginia (VA) is on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Mississippi (MS) is in the southern part of the US, along the Mississippi
      River


      In terms of east-west positioning, Virginia is generally east of Mississippi.
      That''s because Virginia is on the Atlantic coast, while Mississippi is several
      states inland from the Atlantic.


      To be more precise about these specific zip codes:

      - 38611 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 24073 is in Virginia (VA)


      Since Mississippi is west of Virginia, 38611, MS would be located west of 24073,
      VA - not east.


      So the answer should be NO, 38611, MS is not located east of 24073, VA.</think>To
      determine if 38611, MS is located east of 24073, VA, I need to consider the

      - 38611 is in Mississippi (MS)

      - 24073 is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Mississippi
      is in the southern central part of the country, bordering the Mississippi River.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      Virginia is significantly farther east than Mississippi in the United States.
      On a map, Virginia is several states east of Mississippi.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since Virginia (where 24073 is located) is east of Mississippi (where 38611
      is located), it follows that 38611, MS must be west of 24073, VA - not east
      of it.

      - The Atlantic coast (like New York) is in the east

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US

      - Illinois is in the midwest/north-central part of the US

      1. I need to determine if 76247, TX is east of 60652, IL.

      Let''s first identify where each zip code is located:

      - 76247 is in Texas (TX)

      - 60652 is in Illinois (IL)


      Generally, in the United States:

      - Texas is located southwest of Illinois

      - Illinois is east of Texas


      Looking at a US map, Illinois is definitely east of Texas. Since the zip codes
      are in these respective states, 76247 in TX is west of 60652 in IL, not east
      of it.


      Therefore, 76247, TX is NOT located east of 60652, IL.</think>I need to determine
      if 76247, TX is located east of 60652, IL.


      Step 1: Let me identify the states.

      - 76247 is in Texas (TX)

      - 60652 is in Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is in the South/Southwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - On a US map, Illinois is positioned to the northeast of Texas

      - Illinois is significantly east of Texas


      Step 4: Since these zip codes are in their respective states, their relative
      east-west positioning follows the same pattern.

      - 60652 (Illinois) is east of 76247 (Texas)

      - Therefore, 76247 (Texas) is west of 60652 (Illinois)

    26520111-d2aa-4a49-be93-3967376e2802: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      the relative geographical positions of two zip codes:

      1. 24354, VA (Virginia)

      2. 28457, NC (North Carolina)


      I need to determine if the first zip code is east of the second one.


      First, let me think about the general geographic relationship between Virginia
      and North Carolina. Virginia is generally north and slightly east of North Carolina.
      However, the exact locations of specific zip codes matter more than the general
      state positions, since both states span some distance east-to-west.


      ZIP codes in the US follow some geographic patterns:

      - Lower ZIP codes tend to be in the eastern US

      - Higher ZIP codes tend to be in the western US


      So ZIP code 24354 (a lower number) is likely east of ZIP code 28457 (a higher
      number).


      But there are exceptions to this pattern, especially within regions. Let me
      think about the first digits:

      - 2xxxx ZIP codes are generally in the mid-Atlantic region

      - ZIP codes starting with 24xxx are in western Virginia

      - ZIP codes starting with 28xxx are in North Carolina


      Based on these patterns, 24354 is likely in western Virginia, while 28457 is
      somewhere in North Carolina.


      Western Virginia is generally west of most of North Carolina. So despite the
      lower ZIP code number (which would typically suggest a more eastern location),
      in this specific case, 24354 in western VA is likely WEST of 28457 in NC.


      Actually, let me be more careful. Without specific knowledge of these exact
      ZIP codes, I should consider that North Carolina''s coast extends quite far
      east along the Atlantic, while western Virginia is more inland. It''s more likely
      that a western Virginia ZIP code is west of a North Carolina ZIP code.</think>#
      Is 24354, VA located east of 28457, NC?


      I need to determine the relative geographical positions of these zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Analyze the zip code patterns

      In the US postal system, lower zip codes generally correspond to more eastern
      locations, while higher zip codes tend to be more western. Here, 24354 (Virginia)
      has a lower number than 28457 (North Carolina).


      ## Step 2: Consider state geography

      Virginia is north of North Carolina. The eastern parts of both states touch
      the Atlantic Ocean, while their western regions are inland.


      ## Step 3: Examine specific zip code regions

      - Zip codes beginning with 243xx are in southwestern Virginia

      - Zip codes beginning with 284xx are in south-central North Carolina


      ## Step 4: Determine relative positions

      24354 (Wytheville area, VA) is in the western part of Virginia, near the West
      Virginia and Tennessee borders.

      28457 (Misenheimer area, NC) is in south-central North Carolina.


      When comparing these specific locations, 24354 is actually west of 28457, not
      east.

      24354 is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      28457 is a zip code in North Carolina (NC)


      Geographically, Virginia is generally north and east of North Carolina. The

      VA extends further east than NC along the Atlantic coast, but the western parts
      of VA are further west than some parts of NC.


      Without knowing the exact locations of these specific zip codes, I need to be
      careful about making assumptions. However, given that:


      - 24354 is likely in the southwestern part of Virginia (lower zip codes in VA
      tend to be in the western/southern parts)

      - 28457 is likely in the central or eastern part of North Carolina (higher zip
      codes in NC tend to be further east)


      Based on this pattern, 24354 in VA is probably in southwestern VA, while 28457
      in NC is probably in central or eastern NC. This would mean 24354, VA is likely
      WEST of 28457, NC.

      further east than North Carolina along the Atlantic coast, but these particular
      zip codes could be in the western parts of their respective states.


      Let me reason through this more specifically:

      - 24354 (VA) appears to be in the southwestern part of Virginia

      - 28457 (NC) appears to be in the central or western part of North Carolina


      Based on the general geography, 24354 in VA is likely to be northwest of 28457
      in NC, not east of it. But let me be more precise in my final answer.</think>#
      Is 24354, VA located east of 28457, NC?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes
      by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 24354 is in southwestern Virginia (VA)

      - 28457 is in central/western North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geography of these states.

      Virginia is generally north of North Carolina. While eastern Virginia is east
      of eastern North Carolina, the western portions of Virginia actually lie to
      the west of many parts of North Carolina due to the states'' shapes.


      Step 3: Analyze these specific zip codes.

      Zip code 24354 is in the southwestern region of Virginia, placing it in the
      Appalachian Mountain region.

      Zip code 28457 is in central/western North Carolina.


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      Based on their locations, zip code 24354 in Virginia is actually west of zip
      code 28457 in North Carolina. The southwestern part of Virginia extends westward,
      while this North Carolina zip code is further east.

      - Texas (TX) is in the South/Southwest region of the United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Indiana is generally east of Texas. Since
      longitude decreases as you move east in the United States (with the east coast
      having lower longitude values than the west coast), Indiana would have a lower

      - Indiana (IN) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Texas (TX) is located in the southern/southwestern region of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Indiana is generally east of
      Texas. The entire state of Indiana is east of Texas on a map of the United States.


      Therefore, a zip code in Texas (78229, TX) would be WEST of a zip code in Indiana

      Texas is in the South/Southwest region of the United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Indiana is generally east of Texas. The Continental

      is northeast of Texas. This means that 46567, IN would be east of 78229, TX.


      Actually, let me double-check. East-west positioning is about longitude. Texas
      is further west (has a larger negative longitude value in the Western Hemisphere)
      than Indiana. So 46567, IN would be east of 78229, TX.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 78229 is in Texas (TX)

      - 46567 is in Indiana (IN)


      Step 2: Determine their geographical positions.

      Texas is located in the south-central United States, while Indiana is in the
      Midwest region.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions (longitude).

      The United States is oriented so that the east coast is toward the Atlantic
      Ocean and the west coast is toward the Pacific Ocean. Looking at the map of
      the country, Indiana is positioned significantly to the east of Texas.


      Texas is west of the Mississippi River, while Indiana is east of it. Indiana
      is much closer to the East Coast than Texas is. Generally, all of Indiana is
      east of all of Texas.


      Therefore, 78229, TX is NOT located east of 46567, IN. Rather, it''s the opposite
      - 46567, IN is east of 78229, TX.

      First, I need to recall the general geographic layout of these states:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest

      - New York is in the Northeast


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Ohio. That means that locations in Ohio
      would typically be west of locations in New York, not east.


      Let me double-check by thinking about the relative positions:

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania to its east

      - New York is east of Pennsylvania

      - So Ohio is definitely west of New York

      - New York is positioned to the east of Ohio

      - Ohio is to the west of New York


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 43207 is in Ohio, it must be west of any location in New York

      - Since 10598 is in New York, it must be east of any location in Ohio


      NO, 43207, OH is not located east of 10598, NY. It is located west of it.'

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region

      - New York is in the Northeast region


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Ohio. So on a broad state level, locations

      Let me think about this:


      1. 43207 is a zip code in Ohio (OH).

      2. 10598 is a zip code in New York (NY).


      Generally speaking, Ohio is west of New York state. This is because the United
      States runs roughly with the Pacific coast on the west and the Atlantic coast
      on the east. Ohio is more inland and closer to the center of the country, while
      New York is on the eastern coast.


      To be more specific:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region

      - New York is in the Northeast region


      Since Ohio is west of New York, and 43207 is in Ohio, while 10598 is in New
      York, it''s very likely that 43207, OH is WEST of 10598, NY, not east.


      To confirm, I''d normally want to look up the exact longitude coordinates of
      these specific zip codes, but based on the general geography of US states, I
      can be confident that an Ohio zip code is going to be west of a New York zip
      code.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      First, I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip codes:


      1) 43207 is a zip code in Ohio (OH)

      2) 10598 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - New York is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New York


      When comparing east/west positions in the US, I need to consider longitude:

      - States further east have higher longitude values

      - New York is consistently east of Ohio on the map


      Since 43207 is in Ohio and 10598 is in New York, and Ohio is west of New York,
      the Ohio zip code would be west of the New York zip code, not east of it.

      to determine whether 24486, VA (Virginia) is located east of 08221, NJ (New
      Jersey).


      First, let me consider the general geographic locations of Virginia and New
      Jersey:

      - New Jersey is on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Virginia is south of New Jersey, also on the eastern coast but extending more
      inland


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally east of Virginia


      Now, I should check the specific zip codes:

      - 24486 is in Virginia, likely in the western or central part of the state

      - 08221 is in New Jersey, likely in the eastern part of the state since many
      NJ zip codes starting with 08 are near the Atlantic coast


      Given the general geography of the US East Coast, New Jersey is east of Virginia.
      So a location in Virginia (24486) would generally be west of a location in New
      Jersey (08221), not east of it.


      Therefore, 24486, VA is likely NOT located east of 08221, NJ. It would be west
      of it.</think>I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the states and their general geographic relationship.

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic position of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is located south of New Jersey, also on the Atlantic coast but extending
      further inland to the west


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      - New Jersey is generally positioned to the east of Virginia on a map of the
      United States

      - Even the easternmost parts of Virginia are typically not east of New Jersey

      - 24486 is in Virginia, most likely in the central or western part of the state

      - 08221 is in New Jersey, likely in the eastern part near the Atlantic coast

    37fb1b8b-b140-4a50-ad0d-b70cd7a07ad4: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of these two zip codes, and then compare their relative
      east-west positioning.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 24486, VA is a zip code in Virginia (VA)

      - 08221, NJ is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ)


      In the United States, New Jersey is located on the East Coast, while Virginia
      is also an East Coast state but is located south of New Jersey.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally east of Virginia on a map

      - This means Virginia zip codes tend to be west of New Jersey zip codes


      So generally, a Virginia zip code (24486) would be west of a New Jersey zip
      code (08221), not east of it.


      To be completely certain, I should check the specific longitude coordinates
      of these zip codes, but based on the general geographic positions of these states,
      I can reasonably conclude that 24486, VA is located west of 08221, NJ, not east
      of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states these zip codes are in.

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States.

      - Virginia is also an East Coast state, but is positioned southwest of New Jersey.


      Step 3: Determine east-west relationship.

      - On a map of the United States, New Jersey is positioned to the east of Virginia.

      - Therefore, locations in New Jersey (including zip code 08221) are generally
      east of locations in Virginia (including zip code 24486).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      - Since New Jersey is east of Virginia, zip code 08221 in NJ is east of zip
      code 24486 in VA.

      - This means 24486, VA is west of 08221, NJ, not east of it.

    4afad2f2-7ff0-41cc-a81f-354b5d854f39: '<think>I need to determine whether zip
      code 24486, VA (Virginia) is located east of zip code 08221, NJ (New Jersey).


      First, let me think about the geographic locations of Virginia and New Jersey
      in the United States:

      - Virginia is a state located on the east coast of the US

      - New Jersey is also a state located on the east coast of the US

      - New Jersey is generally located north and east of Virginia


      Since we''re asking specifically about these zip codes, let me consider their
      likely locations within their respective states:

      - 24486 is a zip code in Virginia. Virginia zip codes generally start with 22,
      23, or 24, with higher numbers typically being more western in the state.

      - 08221 is a zip code in New Jersey. New Jersey zip codes generally start with
      07, 08, or 09.


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, New Jersey is east of Virginia. Even
      the easternmost parts of Virginia would generally be west of most parts of New
      Jersey.


      So my reasoning suggests that 24486, VA is NOT east of 08221, NJ. Rather, it
      would be west of the New Jersey zip code.</think>To determine whether 24486,
      VA is located east of 08221, NJ, I need to think about the geographic positions
      of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Virginia and New Jersey are both on the East Coast of the United States. However,
      New Jersey is positioned northeast of Virginia on the map.


      Step 3: Consider compass directions.

      When we talk about "east," we''re referring to positions further toward the
      Atlantic Ocean along the same latitude. Since New Jersey lies to the northeast
      of Virginia, most of New Jersey (including its coastal areas) is east of most
      of Virginia.


      Step 4: Consider specific zip codes.

      The zip code 24486 in Virginia is likely in the western or central part of Virginia
      (as VA zip codes starting with 24 tend to be in western parts of the state).
      The zip code 08221 in New Jersey is likely along the Atlantic coast of NJ.

      the relative geographic locations of two zip codes: 24486, VA and 08221, NJ.


      To determine whether 24486, VA is east of 08221, NJ, I need to know the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.


      First, the states:

      - VA stands for Virginia, which is on the east coast of the US

      - NJ stands for New Jersey, which is also on the east coast of the US


      In general, New Jersey is east of Virginia. New Jersey is directly on the Atlantic
      coast, while Virginia is south of New Jersey and also touches the Atlantic,
      but most of Virginia is further inland than New Jersey.


      Looking at specific zip codes:

      - 24486 is in Virginia. Virginia zip codes generally start with 22, 23, or 24,
      with 24xxx typically being in the western part of the state.

      - 08221 is in New Jersey. New Jersey zip codes generally start with 07, 08,
      or 09, with 08xxx typically being in the southern part of the state.


      Given that New Jersey as a whole is east of Virginia, and that the zip code
      24486 appears to be in western Virginia (based on the 24xxx prefix), it''s very
      likely that 24486, VA is NOT east of 08221, NJ. In fact, it would be west of
      the New Jersey zip code.</think># Is 24486, VA located east of 08221, NJ?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States,
      while Virginia is located south of New Jersey, also on the Atlantic coast but
      extending farther inland to the west.


      ## Step 3: Analyze the specific zip codes

      - Virginia zip codes starting with "244" are typically in the western/central
      part of Virginia

      - New Jersey zip codes starting with "082" are generally in the eastern/coastal
      areas of New Jersey


      ## Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship

      Given that New Jersey is already east of Virginia, and that this specific Virginia
      zip code is in the western part of the state, 24486 VA must be west (not east)
      of 08221 NJ.

      24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).

      08221 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).


      Generally speaking, New Jersey is located on the eastern seaboard of the United

      1) We need to determine if 24486, VA is located east of 08221, NJ.

      2) First, I need to identify the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      24486 is a zip code in Virginia (VA).

      08221 is a zip code in New Jersey (NJ).


      Now, to determine if one location is east of another, I need to consider their
      relative positions on a map of the United States.


      Generally speaking, on the US East Coast:

      - New Jersey (NJ) is located on the Atlantic coast

      - Virginia (VA) is south of New Jersey, but also extends inland (west) from
      the coast


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New Jersey is generally further east than Virginia

      - The easternmost parts of New Jersey are on the Atlantic Ocean


      Since 08221 is in New Jersey and 24486 is in Virginia, it''s highly likely that
      the New Jersey location is further east. Let me confirm this with my geographical
      knowledge.


      08221 appears to be in the Cape May area of New Jersey, which is on the Atlantic
      coast.

      24486 is somewhere in Virginia, which would be southwest of New Jersey.

      - 24486 is in Virginia (VA)

      - 08221 is in New Jersey (NJ)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      New Jersey is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States,
      while Virginia is located south of New Jersey. When comparing east-west positioning:


      - New Jersey (particularly coastal areas) is generally further east

      24486 is in western/central Virginia, which is inland and west of the New Jersey
      coast.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - 24486, VA is not located east of 08221, NJ. In fact, the opposite is true:

      55904 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN).

      32579 is a zip code in Florida (FL).


      In the US, east-west position is measured by longitude. Lower (more negative)
      longitude numbers represent locations further west, while higher (less negative
      or positive) numbers represent locations further east.


      Minnesota is generally in the northern central part of the US, while Florida
      is in the southeastern part.


      The general geographic knowledge suggests that Minnesota is west of Florida.
      This is because Minnesota borders North and South Dakota to its west, and Wisconsin
      and the Great Lakes to its east. Florida is on the eastern seaboard of the US.


      So based on general geography, 55904, MN should be west of 32579, FL, not east.
      This means the answer would be "NO".


      However, I should note that some zip codes might have unusual locations, so
      it''s best to verify with the specific longitudes of these zip codes if possible.
      But given standard US geography, Minnesota is west of Florida, so a Minnesota
      zip code would typically be west of (not east of) a Florida zip code.</think>#
      Is 55904, MN located east of 32579, FL?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two zip codes by considering their geographic locations.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 55904 is a zip code in Rochester, Minnesota (MN)

      2) 32579 is a zip code in the Florida (FL) panhandle area

      3) The continental United States generally runs with Pacific states in the west
      and Atlantic states in the east

      4) Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region

      5) Florida is located in the Southeast region along the Atlantic Ocean

      6) On a map of the United States, Minnesota is positioned west of Florida


      Looking at the longitude coordinates, Minnesota locations (including Rochester)
      have more westerly longitudes than Florida locations, meaning Minnesota is west
      of Florida, not east.
