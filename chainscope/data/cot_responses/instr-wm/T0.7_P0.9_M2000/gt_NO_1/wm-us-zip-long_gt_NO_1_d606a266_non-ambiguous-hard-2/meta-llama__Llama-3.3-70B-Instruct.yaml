      \ of 43952, OH, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the States**:\
      \ First, identify the states associated with the zip codes. 60087 is in Illinois\
      \ (IL), and 43952 is in Ohio (OH).\n\n2. **General Geographic Location**: Next,\
      \ consider the general geographic locations of Illinois and Ohio. Illinois is\
      \ located west of Ohio.\n\n3. **Specific Zip Code Locations**: Now, consider\
      \ the specific locations within these states. The zip code 60087 is associated\
      \ with the area around Hoffman Estates, IL, which is in the northeastern part\
      \ of Illinois. The zip code 43952 is associated with the area around Steubenville,\
      \ OH, which is in the eastern part of Ohio.\n\n4. **Comparative Longitudes**:\
      \ To determine if 60087, IL is east of 43952, OH, we need to compare their longitudes.\
      \ Generally, as you move east in the United States, the longitude increases\
      \ (becomes more positive). \n\n5. **Final Determination**: Given the general\
      \ west-to-east arrangement of the states and knowing that 60087, IL is in the\
      \ northeastern part of Illinois and 43952, OH is in the eastern part of Ohio,\
      \ we must consider the longitude of these specific locations. Illinois' eastern\
      \ border is at approximately 91.5\xB0 W longitude, while Ohio's western border\
      \ is at approximately 80.5\xB0 W longitude. This means that even the easternmost\
      \ part of Illinois is west of the westernmost part of Ohio.\n\nBased on these\
      \ steps, since Illinois as a whole is west of Ohio, and considering the specific\

      \ (97229) is at approximately 122.66\xB0 W longitude.\n\nSince Portland, OR\
      \ (97229) is at a higher longitude (more west) than Norwalk, CA (90650), this\
      \ means Portland is west of Norwalk.\n\n**Answer: NO**"

      United States but is northeast of Arizona.


      2. **Understand the zip code system**: US zip codes are generally assigned in
      a way that increases as you move east and north. However, the exact location
      of a zip code within a state can vary, but the first digit of the zip code can

      85255 (AZ) and 80130 (CO), without knowing the exact locations, we can infer
      based on the state locations and general zip code directional trends. Since
      Arizona is southwest of Colorado, any zip code in Arizona would generally be

      3. **Understanding zip code locations**: Zip codes are assigned based on geographic\
      \ locations, with lower numbers generally being assigned to the east and higher\
      \ numbers to the west. However, this is a broad generalization and does not\
      \ always hold true for every specific case. The first digit of a zip code represents\
      \ a group of states, with '2' representing the northeast and '4' representing\
      \ the Midwest, among others.\n4. **Specific zip codes**: \n   - 45439 is in\
      \ Ohio. Given Ohio's location, it is expected to be west of Virginia.\n   -\
      \ 23834 is in Virginia. Given Virginia's location, it is expected to be east\

      any zip code in Washington (like 99207) will be west of any zip code in Wyoming
      (like 82609).


      Therefore, given that 99207, WA is west of 82609, WY, it cannot be east of it.


      The answer is: NO'

      1. **Identify the states**: The first step is to identify the states associated
      with each zip code. The zip code 99207 is located in the state of Washington
      (WA), and the zip code 82609 is located in the state of Wyoming (WY).


      2. **General geographic location of states**: Next, we need to consider the
      general geographic location of these states. Washington is located in the Pacific
      Northwest region of the United States, which is in the far northwest corner
      of the country. Wyoming, on the other hand, is located in the Mountain West
      subregion of the Western United States, east of the Pacific Northwest.


      3. **Relative positions**: Given the locations of Washington and Wyoming, we
      can deduce their relative east-west positions. Washington is generally west
      of Wyoming because it is part of the Pacific Northwest, which is directly adjacent
      to the Pacific Ocean, whereas Wyoming is landlocked and situated further to
      the east.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the states'' general locations, any part of Washington
      (including the area covered by the zip code 99207) would be west of any part
      of Wyoming (including the area covered by the zip code 82609). Therefore, 99207,
      WA is not east of 82609, WY.

      1. **Identify the states**: The first step is to identify the states associated
      with each zip code. The zip code 58501 is located in North Dakota (ND), and
      the zip code 77362 is located in Texas (TX).


      2. **General geographic location of the states**: North Dakota is located in

      of the Midwest or the Great Plains region. Texas, on the other hand, is located
      in the southern United States.


      3. **Determine east-west orientation**: To determine if 58501, ND is east of
      77362, TX, we need to consider the general east-west orientation of these states.
      North Dakota is generally north of Texas. However, we also need to consider

      4. **Compare longitudes**: Without exact longitudes, we know that both states
      are in the eastern United States, but Virginia is generally northeast of Georgia.
      The key is understanding that "east" refers to a direction on a map, and moving
      north can also mean moving slightly east, but in this context, we''re comparing
      the general east-west positioning.


      5. **Conclusion based on geography**: Given that Georgia is to the southwest
      of Virginia, and considering the general east-west line, Virginia (20121) would
      be northeast of Georgia (30534), which means it is indeed east (and also north)
      of Georgia.


      The final answer is: YES'

      \ States, and New York (NY) is in the northeastern United States.\n\n2. **Consider\
      \ the general geography**: Generally, Florida is southeast of New York. However,\

      of 10973, NY, we need to consider the general geography of the United States.


      1. **Identify the states**: 33901 is located in Florida (FL), and 10973 is located
      in New York (NY).

      2. **General geographical location of the states**: Florida is located in the
      southeastern part of the United States, while New York is located in the northeastern
      part.

      3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Since both states are in the eastern
      part of the United States, we need to compare their longitudinal positions.
      Florida is generally at a lower longitude (closer to the eastern edge of the
      country but more south) than New York.

      4. **Determine east-west relationship**: Given that New York is north and east
      of Florida, it means that for two locations to be east of each other in this
      context, the one in New York would typically be east of the one in Florida due
      to the north-south alignment of the eastern seaboard.


      Considering these steps, since 10973, NY is north and east of 33901, FL, it
      implies that 33901, FL is not east of 10973, NY but rather the opposite.

      \ Sierra Nevada in California and the Cascades in Oregon) before reaching the\
      \ central or eastern parts of the United States.\n\n6. **Conclusion based on\
      \ geography:**\n   - Given that both zip codes are in western states and without\
      \ specific longitudinal coordinates, we rely on general geographical knowledge.\
      \ However, knowing that 97331 is in Oregon and 90043 is in California, and considering\
      \ that both are on the West Coast with similar longitudinal positions relative\
      \ to each other (as they are neighboring states), the significant factor is\
      \ their north-south relationship rather than east-west. But since Oregon is\
      \ north of California, and considering the question asks about east-west positioning,\
      \ the key insight is recognizing that both states' western boundaries are the\
      \ Pacific Ocean, and their eastern boundaries are not significantly different\
      \ in terms of being \"east\" of each other in a broad geographical sense.\n\n\
      7. **Final consideration for east-west comparison:**\n   - To be \"east\" of\
      \ another location in this context means to be more towards the eastern part\
      \ of the United States than the other. Given the proximity of these states to\
      \ each other and their shared western boundary (the Pacific Ocean), and without\
      \ precise longitudinal data, the question simplifies to understanding the relative\
      \ positions of Oregon and California.\n\nGiven these steps and understanding\
      \ the general geography of the United States, the answer to whether 97331, OR\
      \ is located east of 90043, CA is **NO**. This conclusion is based on the understanding\
      \ that both locations are on the West Coast, and their relative positions north-south\
      \ do not significantly impact their east-west relationship in the context of\
      \ the entire United States."

      1. **Identify the states and their general locations**: Kansas (KS) is located
      in the central United States, and Minnesota (MN) is located in the north-central
      United States.


      2. **Consider the general geography of the U.S.**: Moving from west to east
      across the United States, one would generally move from the Pacific coast through
      the central states and towards the Atlantic coast.


      3. **Determine the relative east-west positions of Kansas and Minnesota**: Both
      Kansas and Minnesota are considered to be in the central part of the United
      States but Minnesota is farther east than Kansas. This is because Minnesota
      borders the Great Lakes to the east, particularly Lake Superior, which is closer
      to the eastern part of the continent.


      4. **Conclusion based on state locations**: Given that Minnesota is to the east
      of Kansas in terms of their positions within the United States, any zip code
      within Minnesota would be east of any zip code within Kansas.


      Therefore, considering the locations of the states, 67037, KS is **NO**, not
      located east of 55404, MN.'

      of 18951, PA, we need to consider the general geographic locations of Kentucky
      (KY) and Pennsylvania (PA) in relation to each other.


      1. **Identify State Locations**: Kentucky is located in the eastern United States,
      more specifically in the region known as the South-Central United States. Pennsylvania
      is located in the northeastern United States.


      2. **Relative Positions of States**: Generally, Kentucky is southwest of Pennsylvania.
      This means that Kentucky is both south and west of Pennsylvania.


      3. **Consider Longitude**: Since we''re comparing east-west positions, we look
      at longitude. Places east have a higher longitude. Without exact longitudes,
      we know Kentucky is west of Pennsylvania based on their positions within the
      United States.


      4. **Apply to Zip Codes**: The zip codes 42431 (KY) and 18951 (PA) represent
      specific locations within Kentucky and Pennsylvania, respectively. However,
      the general rule that Kentucky is west and south of Pennsylvania applies. Therefore,
      any location in Kentucky, including the area represented by 42431, would be
      west (and possibly slightly south) of any location in Pennsylvania, including
      18951.

    0695ac69-a1e8-4803-8341-24616a9c1619: 'To determine if 55904, MN is located east
      of 32579, FL, we need to consider the general geographic locations of Minnesota
      and Florida.


      1. Minnesota (MN) is located in the northern United States, considered part
      of the Midwest region.

      2. Florida (FL) is located in the southeastern United States.

      3. Generally, the Midwest is north of the Southeast, but in terms of east-west
      positioning, the Midwest (where MN is) is west of the Southeast (where FL is).


      Given this information, since Minnesota is west of Florida, 55904, MN would
      be west of 32579, FL, not east.
