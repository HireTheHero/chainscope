      Step 1: Find when Benedict Stattler died.

      Benedict Stattler was a German Catholic theologian and philosopher who lived
      from 1728 to 1797.


      Step 2: Find when Wolfgang Glaeser died.

      Looking for information about Wolfgang Glaeser, I don''t have specific definitive
      information about this historical figure in my knowledge base. There are several
      historical figures with similar names, but without more context, I cannot determine
      his death date with certainty.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Since I don''t have reliable information about Wolfgang Glaeser''s death date,
      I cannot make a proper comparison to determine if Benedict Stattler died later.


      Without complete information about both individuals, I cannot provide a definitive
      YES or NO answer to whether Benedict Stattler died at a later date than Wolfgang
      Glaeser.'

      Step 1: Identify who Benedict Stattler was and when he died.

      Benedict Stattler was a German Catholic theologian and philosopher who lived
      in the 18th century. He was born in 1728 and died on August 21, 1797.


      Step 2: Identify who Wolfgang Glaeser was and when he died.

      This is more challenging as Wolfgang Glaeser is not as well-known a historical
      figure. Without specific information about Wolfgang Glaeser''s death date in
      my knowledge base, I cannot make a definitive comparison.


      Step 3: Consider what can be determined from available information.

      Since I don''t have reliable information about Wolfgang Glaeser''s death date,
      I cannot determine whether Benedict Stattler died at a later date than him.

      Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg died, then compare those dates.


      Step 1: Identify Imam Birgivi.

      Imam Birgivi (also known as Muhammad Birgivi or Birgili Mehmed Efendi) was an
      Ottoman Islamic scholar who lived in the 16th century. He died in 1573 during
      a plague epidemic.


      Step 2: Identify Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg.

      This is trickier because there were multiple Duke Adolf Friedrichs of Mecklenburg.
      The most notable ones include:

      - Adolf Friedrich I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1588-1658)

      - Adolf Friedrich II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1658-1708)

      - Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1873-1969), who was also an
      explorer


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Even the earliest Duke Adolf Friedrich I died in 1658, which is later than Imam
      Birgivi''s death in 1573.

      The later Duke Adolf Friedrichs died even later (1708 and 1969 respectively).


      Therefore, Imam Birgivi did NOT die at a later date than any of the Duke Adolf
      Friedrichs of Mecklenburg. Imam Birgivi died earlier.

      determine whether Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland died at a later date

      Step 1: Identify when Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland died.

      Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, was an English nobleman who died on
      May 29, 1461, at the Battle of Towton during the Wars of the Roses.


      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      This is more challenging because there are multiple possibilities:

      - If referring to the American actor Pierre Raymond (stage name Roger Pierre),
      he died in 2010.

      - If referring to another historical Roger Pierre, I would need to identify
      which specific person is meant.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Since Henry Percy died in 1461, and the most notable Roger Pierre (the actor)
      died in 2010, Henry Percy died approximately 549 years before Roger Pierre.


      Step 4: Determine if Henry Percy died at a later date than Roger Pierre.

      Based on the information available, Henry Percy (1461) died before Roger Pierre
      (2010).


      NO, Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did not die at a later date than
      Roger Pierre.'

      Step 1: Identify when Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland died.

      Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, was an English nobleman who died on
      May 29, 1461, at the Battle of Towton during the Wars of the Roses.


      Step 2: Identify who Roger Pierre was and when he died.

      This is more challenging as "Roger Pierre" is not a widely known historical
      figure in the same way as the Earl of Northumberland. There are a few possibilities:

      - If referring to the American actor/comedian Roger Pierre (sometimes spelled
      Pierre), he lived in the 20th century (1923-2010)

      - If referring to another historical Roger Pierre, I don''t have specific information
      about such a person from medieval times


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      If referring to the 20th century entertainer Roger Pierre, he died in 2010,
      which is much later than 1461.

      If referring to another Roger Pierre who might have been a medieval figure,
      I don''t have definitive information, but most likely such a person would have
      been from a similar time period or earlier than the 15th century.


      Based on the most likely interpretation (that Roger Pierre refers to the 20th
      century entertainer), the answer is:


      NO (Henry Percy did not die at a later date than Roger Pierre)'

      Step 1: Identify Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland.

      Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, was an English nobleman who lived in
      the 15th century. He died on May 29, 1461, during the Wars of the Roses at the
      Battle of Towton.


      Step 2: Identify Roger Pierre.

      This is more challenging as "Roger Pierre" is not a well-known historical figure
      comparable to the Earl of Northumberland. There is no prominent historical figure
      with this exact name who appears in standard historical records. Without clear
      historical documentation about a specific Roger Pierre, I cannot establish his
      death date with certainty.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Since I cannot establish when Roger Pierre died (or even confirm his historical
      existence as a notable figure), I cannot make a definitive comparison between
      the two death dates.


      Given the lack of historical information about Roger Pierre, I cannot provide
      a clear YES or NO answer to whether Henry Percy died at a later date than Roger
      Pierre. The question requires information that is not available in reliable
      historical records.'

      May 29, 1461, during the Wars of the Roses at the Battle of Towton.


      Step 2: Identify when Roger Pierre died.

      This is challenging because there isn''t a prominent historical figure named
      Roger Pierre who is widely documented in historical records. There was a French-American
      actor named Pierre-Marie-Roger Baron (known as Roger Pierre) who lived from
      1923 to 2010. If this is the Roger Pierre being referenced, he died in 2010.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      If referring to the actor Roger Pierre (1923-2010), then he died in 2010, which
      is much later than 1461 when Henry Percy died.


      If referring to another Roger Pierre who is not well-documented or is fictional,
      I cannot make a definitive comparison without knowing his death date.


      Based on the most likely interpretation using the known Roger Pierre (the actor),
      the answer is:


      NO - Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland did not die at a later date than
      Roger Pierre. In fact, Roger Pierre died approximately 549 years after Henry
      Percy.'

      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Henry Percy died in 1461. If referring to the actor Roger Pierre who died in

      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Based on the information available, Henry Percy (1461) died before Roger Pierre
      (assuming the 20th century figure). Even if referring to another Roger Pierre
      from history, it''s highly unlikely he would have died before 1461 without being
