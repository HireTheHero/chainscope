      bin Awf.


      1. **Poppaea Sabina**: She was a Roman empress and is believed to have died
      in 65 AD, likely due to complications from pregnancy or possibly due to foul
      play.


      2. **Abdur Rahman bin Awf**: He was a prominent companion of the Prophet Muhammad
      and an early Islamic leader. He is generally believed to have died around 652
      AD.

      - Poppaea Sabina died in 65 AD.

      - Abdur Rahman bin Awf died in approximately 652 AD.

      - Jeanne d''Albret: June 9, 1572

      - Verena Holmes: June 4, 1965


      Since 1572 is earlier than 1965, we can conclude that Jeanne d''Albret died
      before Verena Holmes.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Did Jeanne d''Albret die at a later date
      than Verena Holmes?" is:


      NO.'

      \ the dates of death for both Jeanne d'Albret and Verena Holmes.\n\n1. **Jeanne\
      \ d'Albret**: She was born on January 16, 1528, and died on June 9, 1572.\n\n\
      2. **Verena Holmes**: I could not find a widely recognized historical figure\
      \ named Verena Holmes, so it's necessary to clarify who she is or to find her\
      \ date of death.\n\nAssuming Verena Holmes is not a well-known historical figure\
      \ or is less documented, and without further information, it's impossible to\
      \ accurately compare their dates of death.\n\nGiven that Jeanne d'Albret died\
      \ in 1572 and we lack a specific date for Verena Holmes, the answer to the question\
      \ cannot be definitively determined. \n\nHowever, if we assume Verena Holmes\
      \ is someone who died before 1572, then the answer would be YES. If she died\
      \ after or in 1572, then the answer would be NO. \n\nSince the question asks\
