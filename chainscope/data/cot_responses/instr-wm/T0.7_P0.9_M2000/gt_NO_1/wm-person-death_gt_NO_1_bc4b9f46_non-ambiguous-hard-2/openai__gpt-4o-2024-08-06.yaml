      1. **Adam de Darlington**: There is limited historical information available
      about Adam de Darlington, but he was a 13th-century English monk and scholar.
      The exact date of his death is not well-documented, but it is generally believed
      that he died around the late 13th century.

      and painter, best known for his work during the reign of Frederick the Great.
      He was born in 1699 and died in 1753.


      Now, comparing these two:


      - Adam de Darlington likely died in the late 1200s.

      - Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff died in 1753.


      Since 1753 is later than the late 1200s, Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff died

      He was an English Franciscan friar and scholar who lived during the 13th century.

      2. **Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff**: He was a Prussian painter and architect

      died at a later date than Paul Weidmann, we need to establish the death dates
      of both individuals.


      1. **Jacques of Botron**: Historical records regarding Jacques of Botron are
      limited, and his exact death date is not widely documented. However, he was
      a figure associated with the Crusades in the 13th century.


      2. **Paul Weidmann**: Paul Weidmann, also known as Paul Wiedmann, was a German
      criminal executed in 1581.


      Given the information available:


      - Jacques of Botron was active in the 13th century, and while his exact death
      date is unclear, it is reasonable to assume he died in that century.

      - Paul Weidmann died in 1581.


      Since the 13th century precedes the 16th century, it is likely that Jacques
      of Botron died before Paul Weidmann.

      1. **Jacques of Botron**: Jacques of Botron was a character mentioned in historical

      Templar and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. However, specific historical records about
      his death are not widely available or detailed in prominent historical texts.


      2. **Paul Weidmann**: Paul Weidmann, also known as Paulus Weidmann, was a German
      executioner who lived during the 16th century. Historical records indicate that
      he was executed in 1588.


      Given this information, we can establish that Paul Weidmann died in 1588. Without
      specific records or widely recognized historical documentation about the death
      of Jacques of Botron, it becomes challenging to compare the two dates directly.


      In the absence of precise information about Jacques of Botron''s death, it is
      difficult to provide a definitive YES or NO answer. However, if we assume that
      Jacques of Botron lived during the Crusades and was active in the 12th to 13th
