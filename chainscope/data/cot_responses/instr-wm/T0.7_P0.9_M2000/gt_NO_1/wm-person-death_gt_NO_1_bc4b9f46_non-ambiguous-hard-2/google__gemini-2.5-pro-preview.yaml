    007064a2-b08a-412c-aa47-6161a92dee30: 'Okay, let''s break this down step-by-step:


      1.  **Identify Johannes Tapissier''s death date:** Johannes Tapissier (also
      Jean Tapissier) was a composer of the late Medieval/early Renaissance period.
      He died in August 1410.

      2.  **Identify Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck''s death date:** Friedrich von
      Hefner-Alteneck was a German electrical engineer. He died on January 7, 1904.

      3.  **Compare the dates:** 1410 is much earlier than 1904.

      4.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Tapissier died *later* than
      Hefner-Alteneck. Since 1410 is *earlier* than 1904, Tapissier did not die later.

    0d037221-c377-4d67-9b3d-528bf6f5393d: 'Okay, let''s break this down step-by-step:


      1.  **Identify Johannes Tapissier''s death date:** Johannes Tapissier (also
      known as Jean de Noyers) was a French composer. Historical records indicate
      he died in August 1409 (some sources might suggest c. 1410, but 1409 is common).

      2.  **Identify Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck''s death date:** Friedrich von
      Hefner-Alteneck was a German electrical engineer. He died on January 7, 1904.

      3.  **Compare the dates:** Compare 1409 (Tapissier) with 1904 (Hefner-Alteneck).

      4.  **Determine which date is later:** 1904 is a later date than 1409.

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Tapissier died *later*
      than Hefner-Alteneck. Since Tapissier died in 1409 and Hefner-Alteneck died
      in 1904, Tapissier died *earlier*, not later.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      around **1380**. Another later Margaret Graham, daughter of Malise Graham, 3rd
      Earl of Menteith, died around **1490/1491**.

      2.  **Find the death date of Christian Gottlob Neefe:** He was a German composer,
      organist, and conductor, known for being Beethoven''s teacher. He died on January
      26, **1798**.

      3.  **Compare the dates:** Both c. 1380 and c. 1490/1491 are significantly earlier

      4.  **Conclusion:** Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith (whichever prominent

      in **1573**.

      2.  **Identify Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg''s death date:** There were
      several Dukes named Adolf Friedrich in the House of Mecklenburg. The most prominent
      early one is Adolf Friedrich I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He lived from
      1588 to **1658**. Other Dukes Adolf Friedrich died even later (e.g., 1708, 1752,
      1794, 1914, 1918, 1969).

      3.  **Compare the dates:** Imam Birgivi died in 1573. Duke Adolf Friedrich I
      died in 1658.

      4.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Imam Birgivi died *later*
      than Duke Adolf Friedrich. Since 1573 is *earlier* than 1658 (and earlier than
      the death dates of all other Dukes Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg), Imam Birgivi

      2.  **Identify the death date of Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg:** There

      1.  **Identify the death date of Petrus Alphonsi:** Petrus Alphonsi was a Spanish
      Jewish physician, writer, astronomer, and polemicist who converted to Christianity.
      His exact death date is uncertain, but he is generally believed to have died

      his death around **c. 1110** or shortly thereafter.

      Ralph Neville was a prominent English nobleman. His dates are well-documented.
      He died on **21 October 1425**.

      1.  **Identify Pierre Moulu''s death date:** Pierre Moulu was a Franco-Flemish
      composer of the Renaissance. His exact dates are uncertain, but he was active
      roughly between 1500 and 1522. His death date is unknown but is presumed to
      be *after* 1522, possibly around the mid-16th century (e.g., c. 1550 according
      to some older estimates, though "after 1522" is the most reliable information).

      2.  **Identify Karl Joseph Eberth''s death date:** Karl Joseph Eberth was a
      German pathologist and bacteriologist. He lived from 1835 to 1926. His death
      date is 1926.

      3.  **Compare the death dates:** Pierre Moulu died sometime after 1522 (likely
      mid-16th century). Karl Joseph Eberth died in 1926.

      4.  **Conclusion:** 1926 is significantly later than any estimated death date
