      Benedict Stattler was a German Jesuit theologian and philosopher, born in 1728

      Step 2: Identify who Wolfgang Glaeser was.

      Wolfgang Glaeser is not a widely known historical figure, and there may be multiple

      there is no prominent historical figure named Wolfgang Glaeser known to have
      died before or after 1797. If Wolfgang Glaeser is a lesser-known or fictional
      individual, or the name is potentially misremembered or incorrect, we cannot
      definitively determine his death date without more context.


      However, if we assume that "Wolfgang Glaeser" refers to the contemporary German
      author born in 1944 (Wolfgang Jeschke Glaeser), then he would have died after
      1797 (or may still be alive depending on the current date).

      examine the historical dates associated with each figure.


      **Step 1: Identify the death date of Philip II, Margrave of Baden-Baden.**


      - Philip II of Baden-Baden was born in 1559 and died in 1588.


      **Step 2: Identify the death date of Stephan II, Count of Sponheim.**


      - Stephan II, Count of Sponheim, lived in the earlier medieval period. Sources

      **Step 3: Compare the two dates.**


      - Stephan II died circa 1096.

      - Philip II died in 1588.


      Since 1588 is obviously later than 1096, Stephan II died much earlier than Philip
      II.

      at a later date than Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg, we need to establish
      the death dates of both individuals.


      Step 1: Identify when Imam Birgivi died.

      - Imam Birgivi was an Ottoman Islamic scholar and moralist.

      - He lived during the 16th century.

      - His death year is recorded as 1573.


      Step 2: Identify when Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg died.

      - There were several persons with the name Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg, but
      the most prominent is Adolf Friedrich I, Duke of Mecklenburg.

      - Adolf Friedrich I lived in the 17th century.

      - He died in 1658.


      Step 3: Compare the two death dates.

      - Imam Birgivi: died in 1573.

      - Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg: died in 1658.


      Since 1658 is later than 1573, Imam Birgivi did not die at a later date.


      Final answer: NO.'

      at a later date than Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg, we need to:


      1. Identify who Imam Birgivi was and when he died.

      2. Identify which Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg is being referred to,
      as there were several individuals with that name, and determine his date of
      death.

      3. Compare the two death dates.


      Step 1: Imam Birgivi was an Ottoman scholar and moralist. His full name was
      Imam Birgivi (Imam Mehmed Birgivi), and he lived during the 16th century. He
      died in the year 1573.


      Step 2: There were several Dukes named Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg. The most
      well-known is Adolf Friedrich I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who lived from
      1588 to 1658. Another is Adolf Friedrich VI, who died in 1918. Since the question
      does not specify which Adolf Friedrich, but all known Dukes with that name lived
      after 1573, we can reasonably conclude that any Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg
      died after Imam Birgivi.


      Step 3: Compare the dates:

      - Imam Birgivi died in 1573.

      - The earliest known Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg (Adolf Friedrich I)
      died in 1658.


      Therefore, Imam Birgivi died before Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg.

      - Her period of influence was in the mid-11th century.

      - She likely died around the late 11th century, approximately around 1087 CE.


      Step 2: Identify who Rosina von Graben von Rain was.

      - Rosina von Graben von Rain was an Austrian noblewoman.

      - She lived during the 16th century.

      - Historical records indicate that she died around 1534 CE.


      Step 3: Compare the death dates.

      3. Compare their death dates.


      **Step 1: Sigebert III**

      - Sigebert III was a Merovingian king of Austrasia.

      - He reigned from 634 to his death.

      - Historical records indicate he died in the year 656.

      - Sigebert III died in 656.

      - If Yu Cong died in 658, then he died later.

      - If Yu Cong died in 656, then they died in the same year.

      Step 1: Identify who Sigebert III was.

      Sigebert III was a Merovingian king of Austrasia. He is known to have ruled
      in the 7th century.


      Historical records indicate that Sigebert III died in the year 656 AD.

      Yu Cong was a Chinese official and politician during the Tang dynasty. He lived

      Step 3: Compare the death dates.

      - Sigebert III died in 656.

      - Yu Cong died in 665.


      Since 665 is later than 656, Yu Cong died after Sigebert III.


      Final answer: NO.'
    bbaf4ef1-e846-4292-ab32-5382b8b4f634: 'To determine whether Sigebert III died
      at a later date than Yu Cong, we need to:


      1. Identify the death date of Sigebert III.

      2. Identify the death date of Yu Cong.

      3. Compare the two dates to determine who died later.


      **Step 1: Sigebert III**

      Sigebert III was a Merovingian king of Austrasia. He was born in 630 and died
      in 656.


      **Step 2: Yu Cong**

      Yu Cong was a Chinese official during the Tang Dynasty. He died in 656 as well.


      **Step 3: Compare the Dates**

      Both Sigebert III and Yu Cong died in the same year, 656. Therefore, to determine
      who died later, we would need specific dates within that year. However, historical
      records often lack precise day and month for deaths in that era, especially
      for less prominent figures.


      In the case of Sigebert III, sources often cite his death as occurring on February
      1, 656. For Yu Cong, precise death date is less commonly known or documented.


      Therefore, if Yu Cong died anytime after February 1, 656, he would have died
      later than Sigebert III. But without a specific date for Yu Cong, we cannot
      confirm that.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since both died in 656 and we only have a specific death date (February 1) for
      Sigebert III, and not for Yu Cong, we cannot definitively say that Sigebert
      III died later.

      Now, compare the years: 1260 (Mary) is earlier than 1415 (Heinrich).


      **Conclusion:**


      Mary of Lusignan died before Heinrich von Lazan.

      \ the death date of Joaquim de Siena.\n2. Determine the death date of Alonso\
      \ de Ribera.\n3. Compare the two dates.\n\nStep 1: Joaquim de Siena is not a\
      \ widely known historical figure, and there is limited or no documented historical\
      \ record of a person by that exact name in mainstream historical sources. It\
      \ is possible he is a less-known or fictionalized figure, or the name may be\
      \ misremembered or misrepresented.\n\nStep 2: Alonso de Ribera was a Spanish\
      \ soldier and colonial administrator who became the Royal Governor of Chile.\
      \ He died in 1617.\n\nStep 3: Since we have Alonso de Ribera's death date (1617),\
      \ but we cannot confirm a death date for Joaquim de Siena due to lack of reliable\
      \ historical data, we cannot definitively compare the two.\n\nHowever, if we\
      \ assume that Joaquim de Siena is a real person and lived after 1617 (which\
      \ is likely given that many historical figures lived after that period), then\
      \ it's possible he died later.\n\nBut based solely on historically verifiable\
      \ information, we cannot confirm Joaquim de Siena's death date.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ based on available historical data:\n\n**NO** \u2013 We cannot confirm that\
      \ Joaquim de Siena died at a later date than Alonso de Ribera."
