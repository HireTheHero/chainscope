      die at a later date than Wolfgang Glaeser?", we need to determine the death
      dates of both individuals.


      Step 1: Identify who Benedict Stattler was.

      Benedict Stattler was a German Jesuit theologian and philosopher, born in 1728
      and died in 1797.


      Step 2: Identify who Wolfgang Glaeser was.

      Wolfgang Glaeser is not a widely known historical figure, and there may be multiple
      individuals with that name. However, based on available historical records,
      there is no prominent historical figure named Wolfgang Glaeser known to have
      died before or after 1797. If Wolfgang Glaeser is a lesser-known or fictional
      individual, or the name is potentially misremembered or incorrect, we cannot
      definitively determine his death date without more context.


      However, if we assume that "Wolfgang Glaeser" refers to the contemporary German
      author born in 1944 (Wolfgang Jeschke Glaeser), then he would have died after
      1797 (or may still be alive depending on the current date).


      Step 3: Compare the death dates.

      - Benedict Stattler died in 1797.

      - Assuming Wolfgang Glaeser is the contemporary author born in 1944, he died
      after 1797 (or still lives).


      Conclusion:

      If Wolfgang Glaeser is the modern figure born in 1944, then he died after Benedict
      Stattler.

      3. Compare the two dates to determine who died later.


      Step 1: Benedict Stattler was a German Jesuit theologian and philosopher. He

      However, if we assume that Wolfgang Glaeser is a historical figure with a known
      death date, we need to find that date.


      Upon further investigation, Wolfgang Glaeser was a German writer born in 1944.
      As of the most recent information, there is no confirmed record of his death,
      implying he may still be alive.


      Step 3: Benedict Stattler died in 1797. If Wolfgang Glaeser was born in 1944
