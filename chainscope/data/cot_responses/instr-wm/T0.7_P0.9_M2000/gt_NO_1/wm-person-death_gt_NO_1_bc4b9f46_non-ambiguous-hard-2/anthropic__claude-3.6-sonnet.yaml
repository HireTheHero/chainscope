      1. Jan Sokol z Lamberka was a Czech military commander who died on September
      28, 1410 during the Battle of Tannenberg.


      2. Hans Jeschonnek was a German Luftwaffe Chief of Staff during World War II
      who died by suicide on August 18, 1943.


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Jan Sokol z Lamberka: 1410

    abbd400e-af62-43f8-9ba3-813776d9ae4f: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to find when Benedict Stattler died

      - Benedict Stattler died in 1797


      2. Next, I need to find when Wolfgang Glaeser died

      - I''m not able to find a reliable death date for Wolfgang Glaeser


      3. Without knowing Glaeser''s death date, I cannot make a direct comparison
      to determine who died later


      4. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer whether Stattler died at a later
      date than Glaeser


      Answer: I cannot provide a YES or NO answer due to insufficient information
      about Wolfgang Glaeser''s death date.'

      1801.


      3. Comparing the death dates:

      - Jacques of Botron: 1277

      - Paul Weidmann: 1801


      4. 1277 comes before 1801, therefore Jacques of Botron died earlier than Paul
      Weidmann.
