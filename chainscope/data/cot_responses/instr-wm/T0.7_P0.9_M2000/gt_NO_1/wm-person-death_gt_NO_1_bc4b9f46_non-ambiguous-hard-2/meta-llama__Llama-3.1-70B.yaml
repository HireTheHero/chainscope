      a member of the Babenberg dynasty and a duchess of Austria.


      2. **Identify Abraham Trembley**: Abraham Trembley (1710-1784) was a Swiss naturalist
      and zoologist known for his studies on freshwater polyps.


      3. **Compare Death Dates**: To determine if Constance of Babenberg died at a
      later date than Abraham Trembley, we need to compare their death years. Constance
      of Babenberg died in 1243, and Abraham Trembley died in 1784.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 1243 is earlier than 1784, Constance of Babenberg did
      not die at a later date than Abraham Trembley.


      Based on the comparison of their death dates, the answer to the question is:
      **NO**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Marie of Valois, Duchess of Calabria**: Marie of Valois, Duchess
      of Calabria (1309-1332), was a French princess and the Duchess of Calabria.
      She was the daughter of Charles of Valois and Catherine of Courtenay, and she
      married Charles, Duke of Calabria.


      2. **Identify Johannes Crellius**: Johannes Crellius (1590-1633), also known
      as Johannes Crell, was a Polish theologian and philosopher. He was a prominent
      figure in the Socinian movement, which emphasized rationalism and religious
      tolerance.


      3. **Determine their lifespans**: Marie of Valois, Duchess of Calabria, lived
      from 1309 to 1332. Johannes Crellius lived from 1590 to 1633.


      4. **Compare their death dates**: To determine if Marie of Valois, Duchess of

    62788951-580c-4b60-b18d-fb7dbf148105: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the dates of death for both Gerard I of Toul and John VI Kantakouzenos.


      1. **Identify Gerard I of Toul**: Gerard I of Toul, also known as Gerard I of
      Toul, was a historical figure. Unfortunately, there is limited information available
      on a historical figure by this name, which suggests that Gerard I of Toul might
      not be a widely recognized historical figure or there might be a mistake in
      the name. Without a clear date of birth or death, it''s challenging to proceed
      with the comparison.


      2. **Identify John VI Kantakouzenos**: John VI Kantakouzenos was a Byzantine
      emperor who lived from approximately 1292 to 1383. He reigned from 1347 to 1354.


      3. **Determine Dates of Death**: The crucial step is to find the dates of death
      for both individuals. We have established that John VI Kantakouzenos died in
      1383. However, without specific information on Gerard I of Toul, including a
      date of death, we cannot directly compare their dates of death.


      Given the information available and the steps outlined, since we lack specific
      details about Gerard I of Toul, including his date of death, we cannot accurately
      answer whether Gerard I of Toul died at a later date than John VI Kantakouzenos.


      However, based on the requirement for a YES or NO answer and the process of
      reasoning we''ve undertaken, the question cannot be definitively answered due
      to the lack of information on Gerard I of Toul. Thus, the appropriate response,
      considering the constraints, would be to acknowledge the inability to confirm
      or deny based on available data. But since I must choose between YES or NO:


      NO'

      who these historical figures are. After research, it appears that Muhammad al-Khushani
      (died in 971) was an Andalusian historian, while Costanzo Festa (c. 1485 - 1545)
      was an Italian composer.


      2. **Determine their lifespans**: We know that Muhammad al-Khushani died in
      971, and Costanzo Festa lived from approximately 1485 to 1545.


      3. **Compare their death dates**: To determine if Muhammad al-Khushani died
      at a later date than Costanzo Festa, we need to compare their death years. Muhammad
      al-Khushani died in 971, while Costanzo Festa died in 1545.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 971 is earlier than 1545, we can conclude that Muhammad

      of Northumberland (1421-1461) was an English nobleman and a prominent figure
      during the Wars of the Roses.


      2. **Identify Roger Pierre**: Roger Pierre (1923-2010) was a French actor and
      comedian.


      3. **Determine their lifespans**: Henry Percy lived from 1421 to 1461, while
      Roger Pierre lived from 1923 to 2010.


      4. **Compare their death dates**: To determine if Henry Percy died at a later

      in 1461, and Roger Pierre died in 2010.

      2. **Identify Anna of Oldenburg**: Next, we need to identify Anna of Oldenburg.
      Unfortunately, there is limited information available on a historical figure
      by this name, which suggests that Anna of Oldenburg might not be a widely recognized
      historical figure or there might be a mistake in the name. Without a clear date
      of birth or death, it''s challenging to proceed with the comparison.


      3. **Determine Dates of Death**: The crucial step is to find the dates of death
      for both individuals. We have established that Herbert II, Count of Maine died
      in 1062. However, without specific information on Anna of Oldenburg, including
      a date of death, we cannot directly compare their dates of death.


      Given the information available and the steps outlined, since we lack specific
      details about Anna of Oldenburg, including her date of death, we cannot accurately
      answer whether Herbert II, Count of Maine died at a later date than Anna of
      Oldenburg.


      However, based on the requirement for a YES or NO answer and the process of
      reasoning we''ve undertaken, the question cannot be definitively answered due
      to the lack of information on Anna of Oldenburg. Thus, the appropriate response,
      considering the constraints, would be to acknowledge the inability to confirm
      or deny based on available data. But since I must choose between YES or NO:


      NO'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify Paolo da Firenze**: Paolo da Firenze, also known as Paolo Tenorista
      or Magister Dominus Paulus Abbas de Florentia, was an Italian composer and music
      theorist active in the late 14th century. He was a significant figure in the
      musical transition between the medieval and Renaissance periods.


      2. **Identify Carl Barks**: Carl Barks was an American cartoonist and comic
      book creator, best known for his work on the Donald Duck comic book series.
      He was born on March 27, 1901, and passed away on August 25, 2000.


      3. **Determine Dates of Death**: The crucial step is to find the dates of death
      for both individuals. While Paolo da Firenze''s exact date of death is not well-documented,
      it is believed to have occurred around 1425. Carl Barks, on the other hand,
      passed away on August 25, 2000.


      4. **Compare Dates of Death**: To answer the question, we need to compare the
      dates of death. Since Paolo da Firenze died around 1425, and Carl Barks passed
      away in 2000, it is clear that Paolo da Firenze died much earlier than Carl
      Barks.

      details about Heinrich von Lazan, including his date of death, we cannot accurately
      answer whether Mary of Lusignan, Countess of Brienne, died at a later date than
      Heinrich von Lazan.


      However, based on the requirement for a YES or NO answer and the process of
      reasoning we''ve undertaken, the question cannot be definitively answered due
      to the lack of information on Heinrich von Lazan. Thus, the appropriate response,

      the dates of death for both Mary of Lusignan, Countess of Brienne and Heinrich
      von Lazan.


      1. **Identify Mary of Lusignan, Countess of Brienne**: Mary of Lusignan, Countess
      of Brienne, was a member of the Lusignan family and the Countess of Brienne.
      Unfortunately, there is limited information available about her specific date
      of death, which suggests that it might not be widely known or there might be
      a mistake in the name.


      2. **Identify Heinrich von Lazan**: Heinrich von Lazan was a German nobleman.
      Unfortunately, there is limited information available about his specific date
      of death, which suggests that it might not be widely known or there might be
      a mistake in the name.


      3. **Determine Dates of Death**: The crucial step is to find the dates of death
      for both individuals. We have established that Mary of Lusignan, Countess of
      Brienne, had a specific date of death, while Heinrich von Lazan had a specific
      date of death. However, without specific information on either individual, including
      their dates of death, we cannot directly compare their death dates.
