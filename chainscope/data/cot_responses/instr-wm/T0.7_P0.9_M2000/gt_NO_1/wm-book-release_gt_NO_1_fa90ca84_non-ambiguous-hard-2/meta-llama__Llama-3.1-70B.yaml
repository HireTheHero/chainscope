      2. **Will Self''s "The Butt":** This novel by Will Self was published in 2008.
      It''s a satirical take on modern culture and globalization.


      Now, we can compare the publication dates:

      1. Harry Turtledove''s "Worldwar: Upsetting the Balance" was released in 1996.
      It''s the third book in the Worldwar series.


      2. David Mitchell''s "The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet" was released in
      2010. It''s a historical fiction novel set in 18th century Japan.


      Given these release dates, we can conclude that "Worldwar: Upsetting the Balance"

      \ YES.\n   - If \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" was released before\
      \ or at the same time as \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\", the answer\

      \ \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" could be related to these works.\
      \ However, without a specific publication date, we must consider general knowledge\
      \ about Sion Sono's career and notable works. Sion Sono is a Japanese filmmaker,\
      \ and \"Suicide Club\" (the film) was released in 2001. If we consider the novel\
      \ or any complete edition related to this work, it's reasonable to assume any\
      \ publication would be around or after this time.\n\n- Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri's\
      \ \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\" was published in 2010. This fatwa\
      \ is well-documented and its publication date is clear.\n\nGiven these points:\n\
      - \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\" was published in 2010.\n- Assuming\
      \ \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" would be related to works around\
      \ or after 2001, but without a precise date, it's a bit speculative. However,\
      \ considering the general timeline and the fact that Sion Sono's most related\
      \ work (the film) was in 2001, it's plausible that any complete edition or related\
      \ novel would not have been published significantly later than 2010, or at least\
      \ not without being well after 2010.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nWithout the exact publication\
      \ date of \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\", we can't definitively conclude.\
      \ However, assuming it was published sometime after the film's release in 2001\
      \ and considering the publication of \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\"\
      \ in 2010, if \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" was indeed published\

      \ Edition\"**: The publication date of \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\"\
      \ is not provided in the question, so we need to find it. After searching, I\
      \ found that \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" is a novel by Sion Sono,\
      \ which was first published in 2002. This novel is based on Sono's film \"Suicide\
      \ Club\" (2001).\n\n2. **Identify the publication date of Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri's\
      \ \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\"**: The publication date of \"\
      Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\" is not provided in the question, so\
      \ we need to find it. After searching, I found that \"Fatwa on Terrorism and\
      \ Suicide Bombings\" is a book by Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, which was published\
      \ in 2010.\n\n3. **Compare the publication dates**: \n   - \"Suicide Circle:\

      \ 2010, \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" was published before \"Fatwa\

      \ down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the publication dates of both books**:\n\
      \   - Sion Sono's \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" publication date\
      \ needs to be found.\n   - Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri's \"Fatwa on Terrorism and\
      \ Suicide Bombings\" publication date needs to be found.\n\n2. **Compare the\
      \ publication dates**:\n   - Once we have both publication dates, we can compare\
      \ them to determine which book was released later.\n\n3. **Determine the answer\
      \ based on the comparison**:\n   - If \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\"\
      \ was released after \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\", the answer\
      \ is YES.\n   - If \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" was released before\
      \ or at the same time as \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\", the answer\
      \ is NO.\n\nGiven the information and steps above, let's proceed with what is\
      \ known:\n\n- Sion Sono's work \"Suicide Circle\" (original title \"Jisatsu\
      \ saakuru\") is known, and it has connections to a novel and a film. The novel\
      \ \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" could be related to these works.\
      \ However, without a specific publication date, we must consider general knowledge\
      \ about Sion Sono's career and notable works. Sion Sono is a Japanese filmmaker,\
      \ and \"Suicide Club\" (the film) was released in 2001. If we consider the novel\
      \ or any complete edition related to this work, it's reasonable to assume any\
      \ publication would be around or after this time.\n\n- Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri's\
      \ \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\" was published in 2010. This fatwa\
      \ is well-documented and its publication date is clear.\n\nGiven these points:\n\
      - \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\" was published in 2010.\n- Assuming\
      \ \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" would be related to works around\
      \ or after 2001, but without a precise date, it's a bit speculative. However,\
      \ considering the general timeline and the fact that Sion Sono's most related\
      \ work (the film) was in 2001, it's plausible that any complete edition or related\
      \ novel would not have been published significantly later than 2010, or at least\
      \ not without being well after 2010.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nWithout the exact publication\
      \ date of \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\", we can't definitively conclude.\
      \ However, assuming it was published sometime after the film's release in 2001\
      \ and considering the publication of \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\"\
      \ in 2010, if \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" was indeed published\
      \ after 2010, the answer would be YES. But given the speculative nature of the\
      \ publication date for \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\" and the clear\
      \ date for \"Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings\", a cautious approach\
      \ based on available data suggests that without a specific publication date\
      \ for \"Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition\", we lean towards the possibility\
      \ that it could have been released around or before 2010, given the original\
      \ work's release in 2001.\n\nTherefore, based on the information and steps considered,\
      \ and the need for a clear YES or NO answer without further details on \"Suicide\
      \ Circle: The Complete Edition\"'s publication date, the answer would lean towards\
      \ NO, considering the original work's release and the speculative nature of\
      \ the question. \n\n**Answer: NO**\n\n"

      \ above, let's proceed with what is known:\n\n- Macaulay Culkin is primarily\
      \ known as an actor, and \"Junior\" could refer to a book or other work related\
      \ to his acting career or personal life. However, without a specific publication\
      \ date, we must consider general knowledge about Macaulay Culkin's career and\
      \ notable works. Macaulay Culkin's most famous role is in the 1990 film \"Home\
      \ Alone\", and he has been active in the entertainment industry since the late\
      \ 1980s. If we consider any book related to his career or personal life, it's\
      \ reasonable to assume any publication would be around or after this time.\n\
      \n- Robert Harris's \"Lustrum\" was published in 2009. This is a historical\
      \ fiction novel, and its publication date is clear.\n\nGiven these points:\n\
      - \"Lustrum\" was published in 2009.\n- Assuming \"Junior\" would be related\
      \ to works around or after the late 1980s, but without a precise date, it's\
      \ a bit speculative. However, considering the general timeline and the fact\
      \ that Macaulay Culkin's most famous role was in 1990, it's plausible that any\
      \ book related to his career or personal life would not have been published\
      \ significantly later than 2009, or at least not without being well after 2009.\n\
      \n**Conclusion**:\nWithout the exact publication date of \"Junior\", we can't\
      \ definitively conclude. However, assuming it was published sometime after Macaulay\
      \ Culkin's rise to fame in the late 1980s and considering the publication of\
      \ \"Lustrum\" in 2009, if \"Junior\" was indeed published after 2009, the answer\

      - "Junior" by Macaulay Culkin was published in 2006.

      - "Lustrum" by Robert Harris was published in 2009.


      Since 2009 is later than 2006, "Lustrum" was published later than "Junior".


      Therefore, the answer to whether Macaulay Culkin''s "Junior" was released later
      than Robert Harris''s "Lustrum" is: NO.
