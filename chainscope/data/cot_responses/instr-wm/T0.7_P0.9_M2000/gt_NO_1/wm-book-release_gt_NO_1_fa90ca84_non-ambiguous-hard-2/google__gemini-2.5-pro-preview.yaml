      1.  **Identify Book 1:** *Tanequil* by Terry Brooks.

      2.  **Find the publication date for Book 1:** *Tanequil* was first published
      in **2004**.

      3.  **Identify Book 2:** *A Field Guide to the Senses* by Daniel Chamovitz.

      4.  **Find the publication date for Book 2:** Searching for a book titled *A
      Field Guide to the Senses* by Daniel Chamovitz doesn''t yield a clear result;
      he is better known for *What a Plant Knows* (2012). However, a very well-known
      book titled *A Natural History of the Senses* (often referred to in similar
      contexts or potentially misremembered as "Field Guide") is by Diane Ackerman,
      published in **1990**. If the user intended Diane Ackerman''s book, the date
      is 1990. If there *is* a lesser-known book by Chamovitz with that exact title,
      finding its date is difficult, but his known major works are later than *Tanequil*.
      *Assuming the most likely intended comparison is with the well-known Ackerman
      book due to title similarity and subject matter:* The publication date is **1990**.

      5.  **Compare the dates:** *Tanequil* (2004) vs. *A Field Guide to the Senses*
      (Diane Ackerman, 1990).

      6.  **Determine if *Tanequil*''s date (2004) is later than *A Field Guide to
      the Senses*''s date (1990):** Yes, 2004 is later than 1990.


      **YES**'

      and appear to have been released very close together (around April/May).

      4.  **Answer the question:** Was *The Story of Martha* released *later* than
      *Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital*? Since they were released in
      the same year and extremely close together (potentially even the same month
      depending on the specific edition/region), it is not accurate to say *The Story
      of Martha* was released *later*. They were released contemporaneously.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      **NO**'
