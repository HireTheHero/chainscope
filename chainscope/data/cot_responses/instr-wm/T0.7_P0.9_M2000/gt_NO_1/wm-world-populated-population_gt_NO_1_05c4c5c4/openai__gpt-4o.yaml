      populous than Vhembe District Municipality, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Find the Population of Katni District:** According to the 2011 Census of
      India, Katni district in the state of Madhya Pradesh had a population of approximately
      1.3 million people. More recent estimates or census data may vary, but this
      gives a general idea.


      2. **Find the Population of Vhembe District Municipality:** According to the
      2011 Census in South Africa, Vhembe District Municipality, located in the Limpopo
      province, had a population of approximately 1.3 million people. Similar to Katni,
      more recent data might vary slightly.


      3. **Compare the Population Figures:** Both Katni district and Vhembe District
      Municipality had similar populations according to their respective 2011 census
      data. However, given the general growth trends and the slight variances that
      can occur in such data, it is not straightforward to definitively say one is
      more populous without the most recent figures.


      4. **Conclusion:** Based on the 2011 data, both regions have comparable populations,
      and without more current data, it''s challenging to give a definitive answer.
      However, if forced to choose based on the last available data, they are approximately
      equal in population.


      Given the information available and the potential for small changes over time,
      the answer is: NO, Katni district is not clearly more populous than Vhembe District
      Municipality based on the last comparable data.'
    27e938eb-ff1b-445b-905f-7c27693c4bfe: 'To determine whether Katni district is

      According to the 2011 Census of India, Katni district had a population of approximately
      1.29 million people. This number might have changed slightly due to population
      growth over the years, but it gives us a good baseline.


      2. **Vhembe District Municipality**: Vhembe is a district located in the Limpopo
      province of South Africa. According to the 2011 Census of South Africa, Vhembe
      District had a population of approximately 1.29 million people. Like Katni,
      this number may have changed slightly due to population growth.


      Both regions had similar populations in 2011, but without more recent and specific
      data, it is challenging to definitively say which is more populous today. However,
      generally speaking, India''s population growth rate tends to be higher than
      South Africa''s, which might suggest a higher growth rate for Katni compared
      to Vhembe.


      Based on available data and typical growth patterns, it is plausible that Katni
      district could be more populous than Vhembe District Municipality today. However,
      this is speculative without current data to confirm.


      Thus, without more recent and precise population figures, the best answer with
      available information would be uncertain. However, given the typical growth
      trends, a reasoned guess could lean towards YES, but it is not definitive.

      2. **Bari, India**: It seems there might be a misunderstanding here, as Bari
      is a city in Italy, not India. Bari, Italy, has a population of about 320,000
      people. However, if we are considering a place called "Bari" in India, it might
      be a smaller locality or town not widely recognized on an international scale.
      Therefore, it is likely to have a smaller population than Bari, Italy.


      Assuming there might be a smaller locality named Bari in India, it is likely
      that Bossier City, Louisiana, would be more populous than a smaller, lesser-known
      Bari in India.


      Based on this reasoning:

      - If comparing Bossier City to Bari, Italy, NO, Bossier City is not more populous.

      - If comparing Bossier City to a lesser-known Bari in India, YES, Bossier City

      Population figures for Namsai district from the 2011 Census of India are typically

      Nadu. Maardis, however, is not a well-known location and does not appear in

      widely recognized.


      2. **Population data**: Since Maardis might not be a real or recognized place,

      fictional or hypothetical, we lack concrete data for comparison.


      3. **Known population**: Vanavasi, being a town in India, can have a population
      ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands, depending on its size and
      classification. Without specific data, any figure would be speculative.

      1. **Gharm**: Gharm is a town in Tajikistan. It was historically larger, but
      its population has fluctuated due to various factors, including political and
      economic changes. As of the latest data, Gharm is a relatively small town.


      2. **Aveley**: Aveley is a town in Essex, England. It is part of the Thurrock
      borough and is considered a suburban area with a moderate population size compared
      to larger cities in the UK.


      To compare the population sizes, we need specific population figures:


      - Gharm, based on available information and estimates, has a population of around
      10,000-20,000 people.

      - Aveley, being part of a developed region in the UK, has a population that
      likely exceeds that of Gharm, typically estimated to be over 10,000 as well,
      often closer to 20,000 or more, depending on the specific boundaries considered
      for Aveley.


      Given these estimates, it''s likely that Aveley is more populous than Gharm,

      1. **Punakha District, Bhutan**: Punakha is a district in Bhutan. Bhutan''s
      districts generally have smaller populations, with Punakha being one of the
      more populous districts due to its historical and administrative significance.
      However, the population is still relatively small compared to urban areas in
      larger countries.


      2. **Belur, Karnataka, India**: Belur is a town in the state of Karnataka, India.
      India, being a highly populated country, tends to have towns with relatively
      larger populations even if they are not major urban centers. Belur, while not
      one of the largest towns in Karnataka, is likely to have a population comparable
      to or exceeding that of a district in Bhutan.

      - Corning, being an established city, has a population in the several thousands,
      which is typically higher than that of a suburban area like Toton.


      Therefore, based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      **NO**, Toton is not more populous than Corning, California.'

      England. It is not a city or town on its own, but rather a part of the larger
      Nottingham urban area.


      2. **Population of Toton:** Because Toton is part of a larger urban area, specific
      population data for just Toton might not be readily available. However, it is
      generally considered a small suburban area.


      3. **Identify Corning, California:** Corning is a city located in Tehama County,
      California, USA.


      4. **Population of Corning, California:** According to recent data, Corning
      has a population of approximately 7,500 people.


      5. **Comparison:** Toton, being a suburban area, likely has a population that
      is not officially separate from the larger Nottingham area, but it is generally
      considered to be smaller than a typical city like Corning.


      Based on these steps, Toton, as a suburban area, is likely less populous than

      1. **Waterford, Queensland:** Waterford is a suburb in the City of Logan, Queensland,
      Australia. As a suburb, its population is relatively small compared to major
      cities. According to recent estimates, Waterford has a population of around
      5,000 to 10,000 people.


      2. **Balerno:** Balerno is a suburb of Edinburgh, Scotland. It is also a small
      community, and its population is similar to that of other suburban areas. Balerno''s
      population is generally estimated to be around 5,000 to 7,000 people.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - Waterford''s population is estimated to be in the range of 5,000 to 10,000
      people.

      - Balerno''s population is estimated to be around 5,000 to 7,000 people.


      Based on these estimates, Waterford, Queensland is likely more populous than
      Balerno.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      2. **Identify Balerno**: Balerno is a suburb of Edinburgh, Scotland.


      3. **Population of Waterford, Queensland**: As a suburb of Logan, Waterford''s
      population is relatively small compared to major cities. According to recent
      data, Waterford has a population of a few thousand people.


      4. **Population of Balerno**: Balerno, being a suburb on the outskirts of Edinburgh,
      also has a population in the range of a few thousand people.


      5. **Comparison**: Both Waterford and Balerno have relatively small populations,
      typical of suburbs rather than major urban centers.


      Given the nature of the question, without exact current population figures for
      both locations, it''s challenging to definitively state which is more populous.
      However, general knowledge suggests that suburbs like Waterford and Balerno
      have similar population sizes, typically in the range of low to mid-thousands.


      **Conclusion**: Based on the typical population sizes of these suburbs and without
      exact figures, it is reasonable to conclude that Waterford, Queensland is **not
      more populous** than Balerno.
