      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Kalahandi district, being part of the state of Odisha, is likely to have a

      - Nizamabad district, while a notable district in Telangana, might not have

      Tioga County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York, and Gosen is
      a town located in Niigata Prefecture, Japan.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both

      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Tioga County, New York, is part of the United States, a country known for
      having a large and diverse population. Counties in the U.S. often have significant
      populations.

      - Gosen, Niigata, is a town in Japan, which has a reputation for having a dense
      population in urban areas but also having many smaller towns and villages.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - The United States, and specifically New York state, has a substantial population,
      and counties within the state can have significant populations.

      - Japan, while having a high population density overall, also has many small
      towns and villages. Gosen, being a town, might have a smaller population compared
      to a U.S. county.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Tioga County, New York,

    c714576b-5eb6-41a1-afb1-db5605f9f40e: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the places in question.
      Tioga County is a county in the state of New York, United States. Gosen is a
      town located in Niigata Prefecture, Japan.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      locations. As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available,
      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which location is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Tioga County, being part of the larger New York state, is likely to have a
      significant population due to its inclusion in one of the most populous states
      in the United States.

      - Gosen, while a notable town in Niigata Prefecture, is not part of a metropolitan
      area as large as Tioga County''s.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - New York state has a high population density and a significant number of residents
      compared to many other states in the United States.

      - Japan, while having significant cities, does not match the population scale
      of many larger counties in the United States.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Tioga County, being part
      of a much larger and more populous state, would be more populous than Gosen,
      a town in Japan.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      India. India is known for having a high population density, especially in rural
      areas.

      - Hougang is a residential town in Singapore, which is a highly urbanized and
      densely populated country.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - India''s rural areas, especially in states like West Bengal, tend to have
      high population densities.

      - Singapore, being a small and urbanized country, has a very high population
      density in its residential areas.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s reasonable to infer that Basirhat II, being part
      of a densely populated rural area in India, would likely have a larger population
      than Hougang, a residential town in Singapore, which, while densely populated,
      is part of a much smaller and more urbanized country.

    0848df37-a7c4-4ab5-bb48-a90fb686e7dd: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: Bheemunipatnam is a town in Visakhapatnam district,
      Andhra Pradesh, India. Columbus County is a county located in the U.S. state
      of North Carolina.


      2. **Find Population Data**: We need to find the population data for both Bheemunipatnam
      and Columbus County. As of my last update, specific population figures might
      not be available, but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Bheemunipatnam, being a town in India, is likely to have a significant population
      due to the country''s large population.

      - Columbus County, being a county in the United States, could have a varying
      population depending on its size and location.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - India, with its large population, is likely to have more populous towns than
      a county in the United States.

      - North Carolina, while having significant cities, does not match the population
      scale of major Indian towns or metropolitan areas.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Bheemunipatnam, being
      part of a much larger and more densely populated country, would be more populous
      than Columbus County, North Carolina.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

    9bf94b21-4ed8-478d-86d7-a99de19ee0ae: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the places in question.
      Lincoln Park is a borough in Morris County, New Jersey, USA, while Washita County
      is a county in the state of Oklahoma, USA.


      2. **Understand Population Types**: It''s important to note that Lincoln Park
      is a borough, which is a type of local government unit in the United States,
      typically smaller in population than a county. Washita County, on the other
      hand, is a county, which is a larger administrative division within a state.


      3. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      locations. As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available,
      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      4. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which location is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Lincoln Park, being a borough, is likely to have a smaller population compared
      to Washita County, which is a county.

      - Counties in the United States generally have larger populations compared to
      boroughs, as they cover a larger geographic area and include multiple municipalities.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Boroughs are smaller administrative units compared to counties, and they are
      typically part of a larger metropolitan area.

      - Counties can vary significantly in population size, but they often have a
      larger population compared to smaller boroughs.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Washita County, being
      a county, would be more populous than Lincoln Park, a borough, due to the typical
      population differences between these types of administrative divisions.


      The final answer is: **NO**'

      - Wadi al Hayaa District is a large district in Libya, and while specific population
      data might not be readily available, it''s reasonable to assume that it has
      a significant population.

      - Grecia (canton) is a canton in Costa Rica, and while it''s part of a larger
      metropolitan area, it''s likely to have a smaller population compared to the
      entire district of Wadi al Hayaa.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Libya is a large country, and districts like Wadi al Hayaa might have substantial
      populations.

      - Costa Rica, while having significant cities, does not match the population
      scale of major districts in Libya.

    1a049d8c-542c-4e0e-b1c9-641738a98421: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the places**: Yuli County is a county in Xinjiang, China, and
      Daviess County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kentucky.


      2. **Find population data**: We need to find the most recent population data
      for both places.


      3. **Compare population sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the information provided, and without specific population data, we can
      make a reasoned guess:


      - Yuli County is located in Xinjiang, China, which is a vast region with a significant
      population. Many counties in China have populations in the hundreds of thousands
      or even millions.

      - Daviess County, Kentucky is located in the United States, which has a population
      of around 330 million people as of my last update. Counties in the U.S. vary
      widely in population, but many have populations in the tens or hundreds of thousands.


      Without exact numbers, it''s difficult to make a precise comparison. However,
      based on the general population sizes of counties in China and the United States,
      it''s plausible to infer that Yuli County, being part of a region with a large
      population, might have a larger population than Daviess County, Kentucky.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      populous than Daviess County, Kentucky, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify the places in question.
      Yuli County is a county in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. Daviess
      County is a county in the U.S. state of Kentucky.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      places. As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available,
      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Yuli County is located in the Xinjiang region of China, which has a relatively
      sparse population compared to other parts of the country.

      - Daviess County, Kentucky, is part of the United States, which has a larger
      overall population than China, but the distribution varies across different
      states and counties.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - China''s population is significantly larger than that of the United States,
      but population distribution within China is not uniform, with some regions being
      more densely populated than others.

      - Kentucky, while not the most populous state in the U.S., is not the least
      populous either. It has a moderate population size compared to other U.S. states.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Daviess County, Kentucky
      might have a larger population than Yuli County in China, but without exact
      numbers, this is a reasoned guess rather than a definitive answer.

      in the Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia.


      2. **Find Population Data**: We need to find the population data for both locations.
      This might require searching for recent census data or other reliable sources.

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:


      - Turweston, being a small village in England, is likely to have a relatively
      small population.

      - Barmedman, being a small town in Australia, is also likely to have a modest

      1. **Identify the districts**: Pathankot district is located in Punjab, India,
      while Tando Muhammad Khan District is in Sindh, Pakistan.


      2. **Find population data**: The latest population data for both districts might
      not be readily available in the question, so we need to find relevant information
      or estimates.


      3. **Compare the populations**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which district is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Pathankot district is part of Punjab, India, which is a populous state with
      a significant urban population.

      - Tando Muhammad Khan District is located in Sindh, Pakistan, which is also
      a densely populated region.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Punjab, India, has a large population due to its agricultural and industrial
      significance.

      - Sindh, Pakistan, is one of the most populous provinces in the country, with
      a substantial urban population.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Pathankot district, being
      part of a more populous Indian state, would be more populous than Tando Muhammad
      Khan District in Pakistan.

      population due to the overall population density in the region.

      - Tando Muhammad Khan District, being part of Sindh, is also likely to have
      a significant population, as Sindh is one of the more populous regions in Pakistan.

      Kannada is more populous than Nambla, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations mentioned.
      Siddapura is a town in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, India. Nambla
      is a village in the Budgam district of Jammu and Kashmir, India.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      locations. This can be done through various sources like census data, government
      websites, or other reliable sources.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which location has a higher population.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Siddapura is a town in Uttara Kannada district, which is part of the larger
      state of Karnataka, known for its significant population.

      - Nambla is a village in Budgam district, which is part of the state of Jammu
      and Kashmir, known for having a relatively smaller population compared to larger
      towns and cities in India.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Towns in Karnataka, especially those in larger districts like Uttara Kannada,
      tend to have higher populations compared to villages in Jammu and Kashmir, which
      are known for their rural and mountainous character.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Siddapura, Uttara Kannada
      is likely more populous than Nambla, considering the general population patterns
      in these regions.

      2. **Find population data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Namsai district, being part of the northeastern region of India, is likely
      to have a significant population due to the high population density in the region.

      - Mong, as a town in the Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan, might have a smaller
      population compared to a district in India.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - India, and specifically the northeastern region, has a relatively high population
      density and population numbers.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the places**: First, we need to understand what Hosdurg taluk
      and Loja Province are. Hosdurg taluk is an administrative division in the Kasaragod
      district of Kerala, India. Loja Province is a province in southern Ecuador.


      2. **Population data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both places.

      we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Comparison**: Once we have the population figures, we can compare them
      to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Hosdurg taluk is part of a larger district in Kerala, India, which is a densely
      populated region. It''s reasonable to assume that the taluk has a substantial
      population.

      - Loja Province is in Ecuador, a country with a diverse population. While it''s
      a province, it might not be as densely populated as the urban areas of India.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - India, and specifically Kerala, has one of the highest population densities

    066a5776-0fab-4fa6-aa2a-1397bd354ca3: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: Texas, Queensland is a town in Queensland, Australia,
      while Crescent Beach is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Johns County,
      Florida, United States.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      places. As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available,
      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Texas, Queensland, being a town in Australia, might have a population in the
      thousands.

      - Crescent Beach, Florida, being a census-designated place, could have a population
      in the hundreds or thousands, depending on the size of the area and its development.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Towns in Australia can vary widely in population, but they are generally smaller
      than cities.

      - Census-designated places in the United States can also have a wide range of
      populations, depending on their size and development.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Texas, Queensland, being
      a town in Australia, might have a population comparable to or slightly larger
      than Crescent Beach, Florida, a census-designated place in the United States.

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s

      - Texas, Queensland is a small town in Australia, and while it might have grown
      since my last update, it''s likely to have a relatively small population compared
      to larger cities or towns.

      - Crescent Beach, St. Johns County, Florida, being part of a larger county and
      state in the United States, might have a larger population, especially considering
      that Florida is known for its population growth and urbanization.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Australia has a smaller population compared to the United States, and small
      towns in Australia tend to have lower populations compared to urban areas in
      the United States.

      - Florida, in particular, has seen significant population growth and urbanization
      in recent years, and St. Johns County might reflect this trend.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Crescent Beach, St. Johns

      in the question. Daultala is a town in the Rawalpindi District of Punjab province
      in Pakistan. San Severo is a city in the province of Foggia, Apulia region,
      southern Italy.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both

      1. **Identify the Places**: Kavaratti is an island and the capital of the Lakshadweep
      union territory of India. Bommidi is a town in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil
      Nadu, India.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both

      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Kavaratti is the capital of a small island union territory, which typically
      has a relatively smaller population compared to larger cities or towns.

      - Bommidi, while not a major city, is a town in a larger district, suggesting
      it might have a larger population compared to a small island capital.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Island capitals, especially in relatively remote areas like Lakshadweep, often
      have smaller populations due to limited resources and space.

      - Towns in larger districts like Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu are likely to have
      more residents due to the presence of various amenities and services.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Bommidi, being a town
      in a larger district, would be more populous than Kavaratti, the capital of

      Burton upon Trent is a town in Staffordshire, England.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both

      Novo Mesto is more populous than Truganina, Victoria, we need to follow these
      steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: City Municipality of Novo Mesto is a municipality
      in southeastern Slovenia, and Truganina is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria,
      Australia.


      2. **Find Population Data**: We need to find the population data for both locations.
      As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available, but
      we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which location is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Novo Mesto is the seventh-largest city in Slovenia, and it''s part of a municipality
      that includes other settlements. This indicates that it might have a significant
      population.

      - Truganina is a suburb of Melbourne, one of the largest cities in Australia.
      While it''s part of a major urban area, the population of individual suburbs
      can vary.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Slovenia, with a total population of around 2 million, is a relatively small
      country. Novo Mesto, as one of its larger cities, might have a population in
      the tens of thousands.

      - Melbourne, as a major Australian city, has a population of several million.
      Truganina, as a suburb, could have a population ranging from a few thousand
      to tens of thousands.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Novo Mesto, as a city
      in a relatively small country, might have a smaller population compared to Truganina,
      which is part of a major metropolitan area in a larger country like Australia.


      The final answer is: **NO**'

      Clark County is located in the U.S. state of Ohio, while Sunyani West District
      is located in the Bono Region of Ghana.

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Clark County, Ohio is part of a larger metropolitan area, which typically

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Gharm, being a town in Tajikistan, is likely to have a population in the thousands
      or tens of thousands, given typical town sizes in the region.

      - Aveley, being a town in England, is also likely to have a population in the
      thousands or tens of thousands, given typical town sizes in the UK.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Tajikistan, while having urban centers, is not as densely populated as many
      Western European countries.

      - England, being part of the UK, has a higher population density compared to
      Tajikistan.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Aveley, being part of
      a more densely populated region, might be more populous than Gharm, a town in
      a less densely populated country.

      a series of steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Maharagama is a suburb of Colombo, Sri Lanka,
      and Riffa is a city in Bahrain.


      2. **Population data**: We need to find the population data for both Maharagama

      or reputable online sources.


      3. **Compare the populations**: Once we have the population data, we can compare
      the two locations to determine which is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Maharagama, being a suburb of Colombo, is likely to have a significant population
      due to its proximity to the capital city of Sri Lanka.

      - Riffa is a city in Bahrain, and while Bahrain is a small country, Riffa is
      one of its larger urban areas.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Sri Lanka, and specifically the Colombo metropolitan area, has a significant
      population.

      - Bahrain, while having notable cities, is a small country with a smaller overall
      population compared to Sri Lanka.

      - Beerwah, Queensland, is a town in Australia, and towns in Australia typically
      have smaller populations compared to cities in India.

      - Govindgarh, Rajasthan, is a city in India, and cities in India generally have
      larger populations compared to towns in Australia.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Australia, and specifically Queensland, has a much lower population density
      compared to India.

      - India, with its large population, has numerous cities with substantial populations,
      including Govindgarh.

      more populous than Bobbio, let''s follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Bronkhorstspruit is a town in the Gauteng province
      of South Africa, while Bobbio is a town in the province of Piacenza in Emilia-Romagna,
      Italy.


      2. **Research Population Data**: We need to find the most recent population
      data for both locations. As of my last update, specific population figures might
      not be available, but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which town is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Bronkhorstspruit is a town in South Africa, which is a country with a relatively
      high population density.

      - Bobbio is a town in Italy, which is also a country with a relatively high
      population density.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - South Africa has a larger population than Italy, so it''s reasonable to assume
      that a town in South Africa might have a larger population compared to a town
      in Italy.

      - However, population distribution can vary significantly within countries,
      so it''s not a guarantee.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Bronkhorstspruit might
      have a larger population compared to Bobbio, but without exact figures, this
      is a reasoned guess rather than a definitive answer.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      Conception Bay South is a town located on the Avalon Peninsula in the Canadian
      province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Varadero is a resort town located on
      the Hicacos Peninsula, in the province of Matanzas, Cuba.

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s

      - Conception Bay South is a town in Canada, which is a country with a relatively
      small population compared to some larger countries.

      - Varadero is a resort town in Cuba, which is an island nation with a moderate

      is more populous than Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify the places in question.
      Hulu Perak District is a district in the Malaysian state of Perak. Cruzeiro
      do Sul is a municipality in the state of Acre, Brazil.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both

      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Hulu Perak District is part of Malaysia, which has a significant population.

      - Cruzeiro do Sul is a municipality in the state of Acre, Brazil. Brazil is
      a large country with a substantial population.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Malaysia, while not as populous as some other countries, has a significant
      population, and its districts tend to have substantial populations.

      - Cruzeiro do Sul, being a municipality in Brazil, is likely to have a significant
      population, considering the overall population of Brazil.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Hulu Perak District,

      population compared to Cruzeiro do Sul, a municipality in Brazil.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the places**: First, we need to identify what Aungban and Maspeth,
      Queens are. Aungban is a town in Shan State, Myanmar. Maspeth is a neighborhood
      in the borough of Queens in New York City, USA.


      2. **Find population data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      places. As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available,
      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare population sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Aungban, being a town in Myanmar, is likely to have a smaller population compared
      to a neighborhood in New York City.

      - Maspeth, Queens is part of one of the most populous cities in the world, New
      York City, which has a population of millions.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Myanmar, while having significant cities, does not match the population scale
      of major cities like New York.

      - New York City, and specifically Queens, has a high population density and
      a large number of residents.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Maspeth, Queens, being
      part of a much larger and more densely populated metropolitan area, would be
      more populous than Aungban.

      is more populous than Defiance County, Ohio, let''s follow these steps:


      1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks about the population comparison
      between two counties in different states.


      2. **Identify the Locations**: Pontotoc County is located in Oklahoma, and Defiance
      County is located in Ohio.


      3. **Research Population Data**: We need to find the most recent population
      data for both counties. The United States Census Bureau is a reliable source
      for this information.


      4. **Compare the Populations**: Once we have the population data for both counties,
      we can compare them to determine which county is more populous.


      Given these steps and without specific population data provided, we can make
      an educated guess based on general knowledge and understanding of U.S. demographics:

      - Oklahoma has a smaller population than Ohio as a whole.

      - Counties in Oklahoma might generally have smaller populations compared to
      counties in Ohio, depending on various factors like urbanization, economic development,
      and historical trends.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s likely that Defiance County, Ohio might be more
      populous than Pontotoc County, Oklahoma. However, without specific data, this
      is a reasoned guess rather than a definitive answer.


      Therefore, based on the available information and general knowledge, the answer
      leans towards **NO**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the places in question.
      Ziro is a town located in the Lower Subansiri district in the Indian state of
      Arunachal Pradesh. Qabala is a city and the capital of the Qabala Rayon of Azerbaijan.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      locations. As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available,
      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which location is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Ziro, being part of a state in India, might have a relatively larger population
      due to India''s high population density.

      - Qabala, being the capital of a region in Azerbaijan, could also have a significant
      population.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - India, with its large population, has many cities and towns with substantial
      populations.

      - Azerbaijan, while not as populous as India, still has significant cities,
      especially regional capitals.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s challenging to make a definitive comparison without
      exact numbers. However, considering the contexts, it''s plausible that both
      locations could have comparable populations, with Ziro potentially having a
      slightly larger population due to India''s overall population size.

      than Gama, Federal District, let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify what Cisarua and Gama,
      Federal District are. Cisarua is a district in the Bogor Regency of West Java,
      Indonesia. Gama, Federal District is a city located in the Federal District
      of Brazil.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both

      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which location is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Cisarua is a district in Indonesia, which is known for its high population
      density. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world.

      - Gama, Federal District is a city in Brazil. Brazil is the sixth most populous
      country in the world, but the Federal District is not one of the most densely
      populated regions in Brazil.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Indonesia, being one of the most populous countries, likely has higher population
      densities in its districts compared to cities in Brazil''s Federal District.

      - The Federal District of Brazil is not known for having the highest population
      densities compared to other regions in Brazil.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Cisarua, being part of

      Bayla is a village in the Punjab province of Pakistan.


      2. **Population of Belle Glade, Florida**: We need to find the population of
      Belle Glade, Florida. According to the 2020 United States Census, the population
      of Belle Glade is approximately 16,698.


      3. **Population of Bayla**: Next, we need to find the population of Bayla. Finding

    2fa8b5c8-a905-4d2c-9990-4441a299f71d: 'To determine whether Hale County, Texas
      is more populous than Mateur, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to know what Hale County, Texas
      and Mateur are. Hale County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas,
      while Mateur is a town in northern Tunisia.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      Hale County and Mateur. As of my last update, specific population figures might
      not be available, but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which location is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Hale County, Texas, being part of the United States, is likely to have a significant
      population due to the overall population density of the country.

      - Mateur, while a town in Tunisia, is not part of a metropolitan area as large
      as some in the United States.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - The United States, and specifically Texas, has a higher population density
      and number compared to Tunisia.

      - Tunisia''s population is concentrated in urban areas, but it''s not as densely
      populated as the United States.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Hale County, Texas, being
      part of a much larger and more densely populated country, would be more populous
      than Mateur, Tunisia.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      Texas. Mateur is a town located in northern Tunisia.


      2. **Understand Population Concepts**: It''s important to understand that counties
      and towns can have varying population sizes. Counties are generally larger administrative
      divisions that contain multiple towns and other settlements. Towns, on the other
      hand, are smaller settlements within counties.


      3. **Research Population Data**: To determine whether Hale County, Texas is
      more populous than Mateur, we need to find the population data for both locations.
      For Hale County, Texas, we can look up the population statistics for the county.
      For Mateur, we need to find the population of the town.


      4. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population data, we can compare
      the populations of Hale County, Texas and Mateur. If the population of Hale
      County, Texas is greater than the population of Mateur, then the answer would
      be "YES." If the population of Mateur is greater, the answer would be "NO."

    ed627319-2283-47d3-85d1-73e250e21722: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify the places in question.
      Uppingham is a market town in the county of Rutland, England. Ghandruk is a
      village in the Annapurna region of Nepal.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      places. As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available,
      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Uppingham, being a market town in England, is likely to have a moderate population,
      as market towns in England are typically smaller in size compared to larger
      cities.

      - Ghandruk, being a village in the Annapurna region of Nepal, is likely to have
      a smaller population, as villages in Nepal are generally smaller in size compared
      to towns or cities.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - England has a relatively high population density, and market towns like Uppingham
      are likely to have a larger population compared to villages in Nepal.

      - Nepal has a lower population density, and villages like Ghandruk are likely
      to have a smaller population compared to towns or cities in England.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Uppingham, being a market
      town in England, would be more populous than Ghandruk, a village in Nepal.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      - Barrie, being a city in Canada, is likely to have a significant population,
      especially considering Canada''s population density.

      - Calama, being a city in Chile, might have a different population scale due
      to Chile''s population distribution.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Canada, while having a large land area, has a relatively low population density

    98664455-2a62-4cdd-a782-701c0ebbea1b: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: Chibombo District is a district of Zambia, located
      in Central Province. Zurmi is a town and local government area in Zamfara State,
      Nigeria.


      2. **Find Population Data**: We need to find the population data for both places.
      As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available, but
      we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Chibombo District, being part of Zambia, is likely to have a significant population
      due to Zambia''s overall population size and the district''s inclusion in Central
      Province.

      - Zurmi, while a notable town in Nigeria, is not part of a metropolitan area
      as large as Zambia''s major cities.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Zambia, as a country, has a substantial population compared to many other
      African countries.

      - Nigeria, while having significant cities, does not match the population scale
      of major African countries like Zambia.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Chibombo District, being
      part of a larger and more populous African country, would be more populous than
      Zurmi, a town in Nigeria.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      is more populous than Badi, Raisen, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: Ribera is a town located in the province of Agrigento,
      Sicily, Italy, while Badi is a village in the Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh,
      India.


      2. **Research Population Data**: We need to find reliable sources that provide
      recent population data for both locations. The most accurate and up-to-date
      data would come from official census data or local government sources.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population data for both Ribera
      and Badi, we can compare them to determine which location is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific population data in the question, let''s proceed with
      general knowledge:

      - Ribera is a town in Sicily, Italy, which is a relatively densely populated
      region of Europe.

      - Badi is a village in Madhya Pradesh, India, a country known for its large
      population.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Italy, and specifically Sicily, has a significant population, although it''s
      not as densely populated as some other European countries.

      - India, on the other hand, is the second most populous country in the world,
      and villages in India can vary greatly in size.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Ribera, being a town
      in Italy, might have a larger population compared to Badi, a village in India.
      However, without exact numbers, this is a reasoned guess rather than a definitive
      answer.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      in the question. Ribera is a town in the province of Agrigento, Sicily, Italy.
      Badi is a town in the Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh, India.

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s

      - Ribera is a relatively small town in Italy, known for its agricultural products
      and natural beauty.

      - Badi is also a small town in India, with a population that may vary depending
      on the most recent census data.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Italy is a country with a relatively high population density, and even small
      towns can have significant populations.

      - India is a country with a very high population, and even small towns can have
      substantial populations.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s difficult to make a definitive comparison without
      exact population figures. However, considering the general patterns of population
      distribution in Italy and India, it''s plausible to infer that Badi, being located

      4. **Comparison**: Without the exact population of Mollendo, it''s difficult

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Comacchio is a town in Italy, which typically has smaller populations compared
      to larger cities.

      - Clifton is a suburb of Bristol, a major city in the UK, which might have a
      larger population due to its urban setting.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Italy is known for having a mix of small towns and larger cities, with varying
      population densities.

      - The UK, particularly urban areas like Bristol, tends to have higher population
      densities, especially in suburbs.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Clifton, being part of
      a larger urban area, would be more populous than Comacchio, which is a smaller
      town.

      - Comacchio is a town in Italy, which is known for its historic center and natural
      surroundings. While it might not be a major city, it''s reasonable to expect
      it to have a significant population compared to a suburb like Clifton.

      - Clifton is a suburb of Bristol, England, which is a city with a substantial
      population. However, the population of Clifton alone might not be as large as
      the entire town of Comacchio.


      Considering the general information about the two places:

      - Comacchio, as a town in Italy, is likely to have a population in the thousands
      or tens of thousands.

      - Clifton, as a suburb of Bristol, is likely to have a population that''s a
      fraction of the city''s total population.

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify the places in question.
      Attunga is a small town in New South Wales, Australia, and Coral Bay is a settlement
      in the U.S. Virgin Islands.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      places. As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available,
      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Attunga, being a small town in New South Wales, is likely to have a small
      population.

      - Coral Bay, while a settlement in the U.S. Virgin Islands, is not part of a
      major metropolitan area.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Australia, while having significant cities, does not match the population
      scale of major urban areas in the United States.

      - The U.S. Virgin Islands, while having some notable settlements, does not have
      the same population density as many parts of Australia.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Attunga, being part of
      a less densely populated region, would be less populous than Coral Bay.


      The final answer is: **NO**'

    c2f1e50d-9e05-4311-b035-736dac1906e6: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify the places in question.
      Suyeong District is a district in Busan, South Korea. Vanderburgh County is
      a county in Indiana, United States.


      2. **Find Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both
      places. As of my last update, specific population figures might not be available,
      but we can look for the most recent estimates or census data.


      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which place is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Suyeong District, being part of the city of Busan, is likely to have a significant
      population due to its inclusion in one of South Korea''s major urban centers.

      - Vanderburgh County, while a notable county in Indiana, is not part of a metropolitan
      area as large as Busan''s.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - South Korea, and specifically the city of Busan, has one of the highest population
      densities and numbers in the world.

      - Indiana, while having significant cities, does not match the population scale
      of major South Korean cities or metropolitan areas.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Suyeong District, being
      part of a much larger and more densely populated metropolitan area, would be
      more populous than Vanderburgh County.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Morrelganj Upazila, being part of a populous country like Bangladesh, is likely
      to have a significant population.

      - The Province of Ragusa, while being a notable province in Italy, is not as
      densely populated as some other regions.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Bangladesh is a highly populous country with a high population density.

      - Italy, while having significant population centers, does not match the population
      scale of Bangladesh.


      Based on this reasoning, it''s plausible to infer that Morrelganj Upazila, being
      part of a much larger and more densely populated country, would be more populous
      than the Province of Ragusa.


      The final answer is: **YES**'

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to understand what places we are
      comparing. Waterford is a suburb of Logan City in Queensland, Australia, and
      Balerno is a suburb of Edinburgh, Scotland.


      2. **Population Data**: Next, we need to find the population data for both locations.

      3. **Compare Population Sizes**: Once we have the population figures, we can
      compare them to determine which location is more populous.


      Given the lack of specific, up-to-date population figures in the question, let''s
      proceed with general knowledge:

      - Waterford, being a suburb in a larger city (Logan City), is likely to have
      a significant population due to its inclusion in an urban area.

      - Balerno, while part of the Edinburgh urban area, is not as central or as densely
      populated as the city center.


      Without exact figures but considering the contexts:

      - Australia, and specifically Queensland, has a smaller population compared
      to Scotland. However, urban areas in Australia can be more spread out.

      - Scotland, while having a smaller overall population, has a more concentrated
      population in its urban centers.
