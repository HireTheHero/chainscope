      3. Comparing the two:

      - Safety Beach has a confirmed population of about 4,849

      - Nala is likely smaller as it''s a minor town in Nepal

      - Even without exact numbers for Nala, Safety Beach appears to be larger


      Therefore: NO, Nala, Nepal is not more populous than Safety Beach, Victoria.'

      enough to have reliable population data

      - There might be small villages called Bari in India, but they would be very
      small


      3. Reasoning:

      - Since Bossier City has a documented population of around 63,000

      - And any Bari in India would be a very small village (if it exists)

      - Bossier City would almost certainly be larger

      - I need to note that I''m not certain about a city called Bari in India

      - If it exists, it would likely be a small town or village

      - Major cities in India typically have much larger populations than 62,000

      - Given that Bossier City is a known quantity, and "Bari, India" appears to

      NO - Bossier City, Louisiana is not more populous than Bari, India, because

      YES, Cranwell is more populous than Crest, California.'
    db008c72-c780-41b6-9c8f-ec0dbbed1de2: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify both places:

      - Cranwell is a village in Lincolnshire, England

      - Crest is an unincorporated community in California, USA


      2) Let me check what I know about their populations:

      - Cranwell is a small village, known mainly for its RAF college

      - Crest is a very small unincorporated community in San Bernardino County


      3) While exact population figures may be hard to find for both places:

      - Cranwell, being a proper village with a RAF base, likely has at least several
      hundred residents

      - Crest appears to be an extremely small settlement with likely just a handful
      of residents


      4) Based on this reasoning, even though both are small places, Cranwell with
      its RAF base and village status is almost certainly larger.


      Answer: YES (Cranwell is more populous than Crest, California)'
    ddc930d1-c519-418f-9adc-ed72214776fd: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me try to identify Cranwell:

      - Cranwell is a village in Lincolnshire, England

      - It''s mainly known for RAF Cranwell, a Royal Air Force station

      - It''s a relatively small village with a population of around 3,000 people


      2) Now, let me find information about Crest, California:

      - Crest is an unincorporated community in San Diego County, California

      - It''s a very small rural community

      - Population estimates suggest fewer than 1,000 residents


      3) Comparing the populations:

      - Cranwell: ~3,000

      - Crest: <1,000


      4) Therefore, Cranwell has more people than Crest.

      1) First, I need to identify these places:

      - Siddapura is a town in Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, India

      - Nambla appears to be a small village in Jammu and Kashmir, India


      2) For small towns/villages in India, exact population figures can be hard to
      verify with complete certainty.


      3) However:

      - Siddapura is a relatively significant town and taluka headquarters in Karnataka

      - Nambla is a very small village in a remote area


      4) Based on the relative administrative importance and typical size patterns
      of towns vs villages in India, Siddapura would very likely have a larger population.

    fa105afc-1920-4ab7-a217-d929ceb92eec: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need population data for both places:

      - Siddapura is a town in Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, India

      - Nambla is a small village in Jammu and Kashmir, India


      2) However, I realize I don''t have reliable population figures for either location

      - Siddapura is a town/taluk headquarters

      4) Generally in India, taluk headquarters towns are significantly larger than
      small villages.


      5) While this is not definitive without exact numbers, based on their administrative
      status, Siddapura being a taluk headquarters is very likely to be more populous
      than a small village like Nambla.

      YES

      around 7,500-8,000 inhabitants.

      Smithville is an unincorporated community in Galloway Township, Atlantic County,

      population figures are hard to find, but it''s estimated to have fewer than
      1,000 residents.

      - According to recent data, it has a population of approximately 20,000 people


      2. Next, I need to identify what Puducode is:

      - Puducode appears to be a small village in India

      - As a rural village, it would likely have a population of only a few hundred
      or few thousand people at most


      3. Compare the two:

      - Washington County, Nebraska: ~20,000 people

      - Puducode: Likely under 5,000 people (as a small village)


      4. Make the comparison:

      Since Washington County has a much larger population than what would be expected
      for a small village in India, Washington County must be more populous.
