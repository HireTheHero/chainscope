    6d5db88a-3526-4c10-b001-d69b5c57022b: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to know the population of Kalahandi district in Odisha,
      India.

      2. Then, I''ll need to know the population of Nizamabad district in Telangana,
      India.

      3. I''ll compare these populations to determine which is larger.


      Population research:

      1. Kalahandi district population (as per 2011 census): Approximately 1,572,342

      2. Nizamabad district population (as per 2011 census): Approximately 2,564,644


      Comparing the populations:

      - Kalahandi: 1,572,342

      - Nizamabad: 2,564,644


      2,564,644 is larger than 1,572,342


      Therefore, Nizamabad district is more populous than Kalahandi district.

    b318ff8e-80a9-4c24-b234-3fbe1722f588: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s look at Punakha District:

      - Located in Bhutan

      - A relatively small, rural district

      - Known for its dzong (fortress) and scenic landscapes

      - Has a relatively low population density


      2. Now, let''s examine Belur, Karnataka:

      - Located in Karnataka state, India

      - A small town in Hassan district

      - Known for its historical temples

      - Part of a more densely populated region


      3. Population comparison:

      - Punakha District likely has around 30,000-40,000 people

      - Belur town is likely to have a similar or slightly larger population

      - The surrounding Hassan district of Karnataka has over 1 million people


      4. Specific population check:

      - While exact current figures would require precise census data

      - The indications suggest Belur area is more populous than Punakha District


      5. Reasoning conclusion:

      - Belur and its surrounding region appears to have more inhabitants

      - Punakha District is less populated


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Punakha District is NOT more populous than Belur,
      Karnataka.'

      2. Then, I''ll find the population of Badi, Raisen (in India)

      3. Then I''ll compare the two populations


      Step 1: Ribera population

      - Ribera is a town in the province of Agrigento, Sicily, Italy

      - According to available data, Ribera has around 19,000-20,000 inhabitants


      Step 2: Badi population

      - Badi is a village in Raisen district, Madhya Pradesh, India

      - Small villages like this typically have much smaller populations, often under
      5,000


      Step 3: Comparison

      - Ribera: ~19,000-20,000 people

      - Badi: Likely less than 5,000 people


      Therefore, Ribera is more populous than Badi.

      - This seems to be a small village in Madhya Pradesh, India

      - Population data is not readily available, but it''s likely much smaller than

      Given the available information and the significant size difference between

      has a larger population.

      1. First, I''ll need to find the population of Waterford, Queensland

      - I know this is a suburb in Australia

      - I''ll look up its population statistics


      2. Then I''ll find the population of Balerno

      - Balerno is a suburb of Edinburgh, Scotland

      - I''ll look up its population statistics


      3. After finding both populations, I''ll compare them


      4. Population of Waterford, Queensland (based on available data):

      - Relatively small suburban area

      - Likely has a population of a few thousand


      5. Population of Balerno, Scotland:

      - Also a suburban area

      - Estimated population around 2,000-3,000
