      Power Station is located north of Lake Dukan, we need to:


      1. Identify the location of the Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station.

      2. Identify the location of Lake Dukan.

      3. Compare their relative positions in terms of latitude (north-south positioning).


      **Step 1: Location of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station**

      - The Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is located in Uganda, East Africa.

      - Specifically, it is situated on the Achwa River, in Northern Uganda.


      **Step 2: Location of Lake Dukan**

      - Lake Dukan is located in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

      - It is situated in the northeastern part of Iraq.


      **Step 3: Compare Relative Positions**

      - Uganda is located near the equator, and Northern Uganda is slightly north
      of the equator.

      - Iraq is located substantially north of the equator.

      - The Kurdistan Region (including Lake Dukan) is at a considerably higher latitude
      than Northern Uganda.


      Therefore, Achwa 2 in Uganda is located south of Lake Dukan in Iraq.

      1. **Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim**: This shrine is located in South Korea, specifically
      in the city of Seoul. Saint Andrew Kim Taegon is the first Korean-born Catholic
      priest and is a significant figure in Korean Catholic history. The shrine is
      in the area of Jeoldusan Martyrs'' Shrine in the Mapo District or near the Seoul

      2. **Ryanggang Hotel**: This hotel is located in Pyongyang, North Korea. It
      is situated in the Mangyongdae District of Pyongyang.


      3. **Geographic Reasoning**: Pyongyang (North Korea) is located to the north
      of Seoul (South Korea) since North Korea is geographically above South Korea
      on the Korean peninsula.


      Therefore, if the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is in Seoul (South Korea), and
