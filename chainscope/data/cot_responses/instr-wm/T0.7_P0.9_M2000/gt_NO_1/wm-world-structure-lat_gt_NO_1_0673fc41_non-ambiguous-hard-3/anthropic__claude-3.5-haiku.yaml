      2. NTPC Ramagundam is a power plant located in Ramagundam, Telangana, India.


      3. Arfa Software Technology Park is located in Lahore, Pakistan.


      4. These locations are in different countries - India and Pakistan.


      5. They are separated by a significant distance, with Ramagundam being located
      in southern India and Lahore in northeastern Pakistan.


      6. Given their geographical positions, NTPC Ramagundam would be south of Arfa
