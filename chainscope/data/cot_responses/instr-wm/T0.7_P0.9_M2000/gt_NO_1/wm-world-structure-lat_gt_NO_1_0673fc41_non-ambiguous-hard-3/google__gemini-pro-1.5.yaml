      Matilda House is in Ghana, and the Tomb of the King of Boni is also in Ghana.

      to know where the Palace of the National Military Circle and Riga Castle are
      located.  Both are in Riga, Latvia.


      2. **Determine their relative positions:**  A quick map search shows Riga Castle
      is in Old Town Riga, and the Palace of the National Military Circle (Latvian
      National Defence Academy building) is slightly northeast, across the canal.


      3. **Interpret "north of":**  While slightly east, the Palace of the National
      Military Circle is definitely on a latitude north of Riga Castle.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.
