      **Step 1: Locate Arfa Software Technology Park.**

      Arfa Software Technology Park is located in **Gurugram, Haryana, India**.


      **Step 2: Locate NTPC Ramagundam.**

      NTPC Ramagundam is located in **Ramagundam, Telangana, India**.


      **Step 3: Determine the relative geographical positions.**

      *   Gurugram (Haryana) is in the northern part of India.

      *   Ramagundam (Telangana) is in the southern part of India, specifically south
      of Haryana.


      **Step 4: Compare their latitudes.**

      **Step 1: Locate Kenyir Lake.**

      Kenyir Lake is a man-made lake in Terengganu, Malaysia.


      **Step 2: Locate Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant.**

      The Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is located in Rooppur, Ishwardi Upazila, Pabna
      District, Bangladesh.


      **Step 3: Determine the relative positions.**

      *   Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia, south of Thailand and Vietnam.

      *   Bangladesh is a country in South Asia, bordering India and Myanmar.


      If you visualize a map, Bangladesh (and therefore Rooppur) is significantly
      to the northwest of Malaysia (and therefore Kenyir Lake).


      **Step 4: Compare North/South.**

      Since Bangladesh is to the northwest of Malaysia, Kenyir Lake in Malaysia is
      located **south** of the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant in Bangladesh.


      Therefore, the statement "Is Kenyir Lake located north of Rooppur Nuclear Power

      **Step 2: Address the ambiguity of "Gate Lodge."**

      Since "Gate Lodge" is a generic term and no specific Gate Lodge is associated
      with the Calatagan Solar Farm in a commonly known geographical context, it''s
      impossible to establish a north/south relationship. There could be a Gate Lodge
      anywhere in the world, and without knowing its specific location, we cannot
      compare it to the Calatagan Solar Farm.


      **Step 3: Conclude based on the lack of information.**

      Because the specific location of "Gate Lodge" is unknown and there''s no inherent
      connection to the Calatagan Solar Farm that would make its location universally
      understood, it''s impossible to answer the question with a definitive YES or

      \ *north* of Gate Lodge? This requires knowing the relative locations of both.\n\
      3.  **Initial Search Strategy:** My first instinct is to search for the location\
      \ of \"Calatagan Solar Farm\" and \"Gate Lodge\" separately, and then compare\
      \ their coordinates or general geographical descriptions.\n\n4.  **Execute Search\
      \ 1: Calatagan Solar Farm:**\n    *   A quick search reveals it's located in\

      \  This is where it gets tricky. \"Gate Lodge\" is a very common name for a\

      \ no *single, globally recognized* \"Gate Lodge\" that would naturally be compared\
      \ to a specific solar farm in the Philippines without further context.\n\n6.\
      \  **Re-evaluate the Question's Premise:** The question assumes a specific \"\
      Gate Lodge\" that is geographically relevant to the Calatagan Solar Farm. Since\
      \ a general search for \"Gate Lodge\" doesn't immediately link it to the Philippines\
      \ or the immediate vicinity of the solar farm, this suggests one of two things:\n\
      \    *   The \"Gate Lodge\" being referred to is *extremely obscure* and would\
      \ require highly specialized knowledge.\n    *   The \"Gate Lodge\" is *fictional*\
      \ or non-existent in a publicly mappable sense in relation to the solar farm.\n\
      \    *   It's a trick question, or refers to a very specific local landmark\

      8.  **Conclusion based on lack of information:** Without a specific, identifiable\
      \ \"Gate Lodge\" in the vicinity of, or in relation to, the Calatagan Solar\

      \ or easily discoverable.\n\n9.  **Formulate Answer:** Since I cannot find a\
      \ specific \"Gate Lodge\" that is identifiable and locatable in relation to\
      \ the Calatagan Solar Farm, I cannot determine if the solar farm is north of\
      \ it. Therefore, I cannot answer YES or NO.\n\nHowever, the prompt *demands*\
      \ a YES or NO answer. This implies that the information *should* be knowable,\
      \ or that the lack of information itself leads to a definitive \"no\" because\
      \ the premise cannot be confirmed. Given the strict \"YES/NO\" requirement,\
      \ and the inability to find a specific, relevant \"Gate Lodge,\" the most accurate\
      \ response is that the premise cannot be confirmed. But if forced to choose,\
      \ a lack of evidence for the claim means the claim isn't proven true.\n\nLet's\
      \ re-frame: If I cannot find a Gate Lodge that *is* south of the farm (or any\
      \ Gate Lodge at all in a relevant context), then I cannot confirm the farm is\
      \ north of it. If I cannot confirm it, then the answer is effectively \"no\"\
      \ to the proposition that it *is* north.\n\nHowever, a better interpretation\
      \ for a \"YES/NO\" question when the premise is unconfirmable is to state that\
      \ the question cannot be answered. But the prompt is very strict.\n\nLet's assume\
      \ the question implies there *is* such a Gate Lodge and I simply can't find\
      \ it. If I *cannot find* a Gate Lodge in relation to the solar farm, then I\
      \ cannot affirm that the solar farm is north of *any specific* Gate Lodge.\n\
      \nTherefore, the statement \"Calatagan Solar Farm is located north of Gate Lodge\"\
      \ cannot be confirmed as true.\n\nFinal decision for a strict YES/NO: If I cannot\
      \ find any evidence to support the claim, then the answer to \"Is X north of\

      **Step 1: Locate Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).**

      BMICH is located in Colombo, Sri Lanka.


      **Step 2: Locate Ramganga Dam.**

      Ramganga Dam is located in Uttarakhand, India.


      **Step 3: Determine the relative positions.**

      Sri Lanka is an island nation located south of India. Uttarakhand is a northern
      state in India.


      **Step 4: Compare the latitudes.**

      Colombo, Sri Lanka, is approximately at 6.9 degrees North latitude.

      Ramganga Dam, Uttarakhand, India, is approximately at 29.5 degrees North latitude.


      Since 29.5 degrees North is *further north* than 6.9 degrees North, Ramganga
      Dam is located north of BMICH.


      Therefore, BMICH is *south* of Ramganga Dam.

      Uganda is in East Africa. Iraq is in the Middle East. These two countries are
      thousands of kilometers apart, with Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and other countries
      lying between them.


      **Step 4: Determine if Achwa 2 is north of Lake Dukan.**

      Since Achwa 2 is in Uganda and Lake Dukan is in Iraq, and Iraq is generally
      northeast of Uganda, it is highly unlikely that Achwa 2 (Uganda) would be geographically
      north of Lake Dukan (Iraq). In fact, Lake Dukan is significantly to the northeast
      of Achwa 2''s location.


      **Conclusion:** Achwa 2 is in Uganda, and Lake Dukan is in Iraq. Achwa 2 is
      not north of Lake Dukan.

      \ part. \"Old National Centre\" isn't a widely recognized geographical feature\
      \ or town name. It sounds more like an old building or a historical name for\
      \ a specific site within a city.\n\n5.  **Hypothesize about \"Old National Centre\"\
      :**\n    *   Could it be a former name for a major building in Ottawa (Canada's\
      \ capital, which is a \"national centre\")?\n    *   Could it be a specific\
      \ building in Winnipeg (Manitoba's capital)?\n    *   Could it be a misremembered\
      \ name for something else entirely?\n\n6.  **Search for \"Old National Centre\"\
      \ + \"Manitoba\" or \"Canada\":**\n    *   If you search for \"Old National\
      \ Centre Canada,\" you might find references to the \"National Arts Centre\"\
      \ in Ottawa, which is relatively new (1960s). It's not \"old\" in the sense\
      \ of being a significant historical landmark that would predate modern mapping.\n\
      \    *   If you search for \"Old National Centre Manitoba,\" you're unlikely\
      \ to find a major geographical feature or town by that name.\n\n7.  **Re-evaluate\
      \ \"Old National Centre\":** The term \"Old National Centre\" does not correspond\
      \ to a known, significant geographical place (like a town, mountain, or large\
      \ building complex) that would be plotted on a map in relation to a large reservoir\
      \ like Shellmouth. It's not a standard geographic name.\n\n8.  **Formulate Conclusion\
      \ based on lack of evidence:** Since \"Old National Centre\" does not appear\
      \ to be a defined, universally recognized geographical location that can be\
      \ pinpointed on a map in relation to Shellmouth Reservoir, a direct comparison\
      \ of their north/south position is impossible. The premise of the question is\
      \ flawed because one of the locations is not a standard geographical entity.\n\
      \nTherefore, the question cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO because\
      \ \"Old National Centre\" is not a recognized geographical landmark that can\
      \ be located on a map relative to Shellmouth Reservoir.\n\nHowever, the question\
      \ *demands* a YES or NO answer. In cases where a premise is flawed, the most\
      \ accurate *direct* answer is often \"No\" because you cannot affirm the statement.\
      \ If \"Old National Centre\" doesn't exist as a place that can be north of anything,\
      \ then it's not north of Shellmouth Reservoir.\n\n**NO**"

      \ to answer the question:\n\n1.  **Identify \"Old National Centre\":** This\
      \ is a building or facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Specifically, it's\
      \ a former bank building, now often used for events. Its address is 200 Main\
      \ St, Winnipeg, MB.\n\n2.  **Determine the coordinates/location of Old National\
      \ Centre:** Using a map or search engine, locate 200 Main St, Winnipeg, MB.\
      \ It's in downtown Winnipeg.\n\n3.  **Identify \"Shellmouth Reservoir\":** This\
      \ is a large reservoir located on the Assiniboine River in Manitoba, Canada.\n\
      \n4.  **Determine the coordinates/location of Shellmouth Reservoir:** Using\

      \    *   Winnipeg (and thus the Old National Centre) is in the southeastern\
      \ part of Manitoba.\n    *   Shellmouth Reservoir is in the western part of\
      \ Manitoba.\n\n6.  **Formulate the spatial relationship:** Shellmouth Reservoir\
      \ is to the *west* and *northwest* of Winnipeg. Conversely, Winnipeg (and Old\
      \ National Centre) is to the *east* and *southeast* of Shellmouth Reservoir.\n\

      \ north of Shellmouth Reservoir?\" Based on the comparison, Old National Centre\
      \ is clearly *south* and *east* of Shellmouth Reservoir, not north.\n\nThe final\

      or a misspelling.


      Given the lack of a known "Lake Lemon" that would provide a meaningful geographical
      comparison to Sarasota Opera House, I cannot definitively answer the question.
      However, if "Lake Lemon" is a non-existent or extremely obscure geographical
      feature, then the premise of the question is flawed.


      If I had to make an assumption based on the lack of information for "Lake Lemon,"
      the most logical conclusion is that the question is unanswerable as stated,

      Let''s assume for a moment that "Lake Lemon" *does* exist somewhere, but it''s

      *specific, known geographical location*. Without that, the question is unanswerable.

      To give a YES or NO, I need a reference point for "Lake Lemon." Since I don''t
      have one, I can''t answer.


      Let''s re-evaluate. Is there *any* remote possibility of a "Lake Lemon" that
      would put Sarasota Opera House in a north/south relationship? Not globally,
      no.


      Therefore, the question is based on a false premise or a non-existent reference.

      **Step 1: Locate Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim**

      The Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim is a Catholic pilgrimage site in Seoul, South
      Korea.


      **Step 2: Locate Ryanggang Hotel**

      The Ryanggang Hotel is a hotel located in Pyongyang, North Korea.


      **Step 3: Determine the relative geographical positions of Seoul and Pyongyang.**

      Seoul is in South Korea, and Pyongyang is in North Korea. Geographically, North
      Korea is to the north of South Korea. Therefore, Pyongyang is north of Seoul.


      **Step 4: Compare the location of the Shrine (Seoul) to the location of the
      Hotel (Pyongyang).**

      Since the Shrine is in Seoul and the Hotel is in Pyongyang, and Pyongyang is
      north of Seoul, it means the Ryanggang Hotel is north of the Shrine of Saint
      Andrew Kim.


      **Step 5: Answer the original question.**

      The question is: "Is Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim located north of Ryanggang Hotel?"
