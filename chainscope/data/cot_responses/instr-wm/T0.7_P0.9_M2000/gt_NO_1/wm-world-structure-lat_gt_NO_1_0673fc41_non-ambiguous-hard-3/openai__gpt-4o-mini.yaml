      in the Matale District. It is a popular tourist destination known for its scenic
      beauty.


      2. **Locate Azad Pattan Hydropower Project**: The Azad Pattan Hydropower Project

      3. **Comparison of Locations**: Since Sembuwatta Lake is in Sri Lanka and the
      Azad Pattan Hydropower Project is in Pakistan, they are in different countries.
      Geographically, Sri Lanka is located to the south of India and Pakistan.


      4. **Direction**: To determine if Sembuwatta Lake is north of the Azad Pattan
