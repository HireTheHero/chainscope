      Step 1: Let me identify the locations mentioned.

      - Santa Maria della Pace is a church, and there are two notable ones with this
      name - one in Rome, Italy and one in Naples, Italy.

      - East Putney tube station is a London Underground station in southwest London,
      England.


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographical positions.

      - Rome and Naples are both in Italy, which is south of the United Kingdom.

      - London is in the southern part of the UK.

      - Therefore, any location in Italy would be south of London, including any location
      in London such as East Putney tube station.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Santa Maria della Pace (whether the one in Rome or Naples) is in Italy,
      and Italy is south of the UK, the church is located south of East Putney tube
      station, not north.


      NO'

      - Laoag Cathedral (officially St. William''s Cathedral) is located in Laoag
      City, Ilocos Norte, Philippines.

      - Misamis Occidental is in Mindanao, the southernmost major island of the Philippines.

      - Ilocos Norte is in northern Luzon, the northernmost major island of the Philippines.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Locations in Luzon (where Laoag is) are generally much further north than
      locations in Mindanao (where Jimenez is).

      - Laoag City is located in the far north of the Philippines.

      - Jimenez is located in the southern Philippines.

      Step 1: Determine the location of Villa Rothschild.

      Villa Rothschild is a famous villa in France, specifically located in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat
      on the French Riviera in southern France.


      Step 2: Determine the location of St Davids Lifeboat Station.

      St Davids Lifeboat Station is located in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, Wales, in
      the United Kingdom.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine which is further north.

      Southern France (where Villa Rothschild is located) is approximately around
      43-44 degrees north latitude.

      Wales (where St Davids Lifeboat Station is located) is approximately around
      51-52 degrees north latitude.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Wales has a higher latitude than southern France, St Davids Lifeboat Station
      is located further north than Villa Rothschild.


      NO, Villa Rothschild is not located north of St Davids Lifeboat Station. It
      is located south of it.'

      First, I need to identify the locations of both Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power
      Station and Lake Dukan.


      Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is located in northern Uganda, on the Achwa
      River (also called Aswa River) in East Africa.


      Lake Dukan (also spelled Dokan) is a reservoir in the Kurdistan region of northern
      Iraq.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - Uganda is in East Africa

      - Iraq is in the Middle East

      - Geographically, Iraq is north of Uganda


      Since Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is in Uganda, and Lake Dukan is in
      Iraq, the power station must be south of the lake, not north of it.

      Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is located in northern Uganda, on the Achwa
      River (also called Aswa River).


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Dukan.

      Lake Dukan (or Dukan Lake) is a reservoir in the Kurdistan Region of northern
      Iraq.


      Step 3: Compare their geographic positions.

      Uganda is in East Africa, while Iraq is in the Middle East.

      In terms of latitude, northern Uganda is approximately between 2-4 degrees north
      of the equator.

      Northern Iraq, where Lake Dukan is located, is approximately between 35-37 degrees
      north of the equator.


      Step 4: Determine relative north-south positioning.

      Since Iraq (where Lake Dukan is located) is much further north in latitude than
      Uganda (where Achwa 2 is located), Lake Dukan is north of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric

      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Dukan.

      Lake Dukan (also spelled Dokan) is a reservoir located in northeastern Iraq,

      Uganda is located in East Africa, while Iraq is in the Middle East/Western Asia.

      In terms of latitude, northern Uganda is approximately between 2-4 degrees north
      of the equator.

      Kurdistan in northeastern Iraq is approximately between 35-37 degrees north
      of the equator.


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on north-south positioning.

      Since Iraq (where Lake Dukan is located) is much further north than Uganda (where
      Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is located), the power station cannot be
      north of the lake.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Sacred Heart Church, Wimbledon.

      Sacred Heart Church in Wimbledon is located in London, England, UK. Wimbledon
      is in the southwestern part of London, which is in the southeastern part of
      England.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Skaill House.

      Skaill House is a historic manor house located on the west coast of Mainland,
      Orkney, Scotland. The Orkney Islands are located off the northern coast of Scotland.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Scotland is north of England in the United Kingdom. The Orkney Islands, where
      Skaill House is located, are even further north off the Scottish mainland.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      Since Skaill House is in Orkney (Scotland), which is significantly north of

      Step 1: Identify the location of Lewis Smith Lake.

      Lewis Smith Lake is a reservoir located in Alabama, in the southeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral.

      St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the
      northern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Alabama is in the southern part of the United States, while Wisconsin is in
      the northern part. Wisconsin has a higher latitude than Alabama.


      Step 4: Determine their relative north-south positioning.

      Since Milwaukee, Wisconsin is at a higher latitude (further north) than Lewis
      Smith Lake in Alabama, Lewis Smith Lake is south of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox
      Cathedral.

      Step 1: Determine the location of Lewis Smith Lake.

      Lewis Smith Lake is in Alabama, in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Determine the location of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in Milwaukee.

      Milwaukee is a city in Wisconsin, which is in the northern United States.

      Milwaukee is in the northern part of the country, while Alabama is in the southern
      region.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Wisconsin (where Milwaukee and the cathedral are located) is north of
      Alabama (where Lewis Smith Lake is located), Lewis Smith Lake cannot be north
      of the cathedral. Instead, the cathedral is north of the lake.
