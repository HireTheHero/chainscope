      2. **Locate Hardeman County, TN:** Hardeman County is in southwestern Tennessee,
      bordering Mississippi.


      3. **Compare their relative longitude:**  Since longitude increases as you go
      west, Ballard County, being further west, will have a higher longitude than
      Hardeman County.


      4. **East vs. West:**  "East of" means lower longitude.  Since Ballard County
      has a *higher* longitude, it is *west* of Hardeman County.

      Castle County is the northernmost county in Delaware, bordering Pennsylvania
      and Maryland, and situated on the Delaware River/Bay.

      the Delmarva Peninsula, the question is whether New Castle County is further
      east. Looking at a map, it''s clear that Delaware Bay separates New Castle County
      from the rest of the peninsula. Accomack County lies further east, on the Atlantic
      Ocean side.

      3. **East/West Relationship:**  Since both states are on the East Coast, the

      east than Pennsylvania. Generally, the East Coast runs roughly north-south.


      4. **Relative Positions:**  North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania.  Being
      south doesn''t automatically mean east or west.  However, a quick check of a

      3. **East-West Relationship:**  Since North Carolina is generally south of Pennsylvania,

      their longitudinal positions.  Just being south isn''t enough.


      4. **General East Coast Geography:** The eastern coastline of the US tends to
      run roughly north-south. While there are some variations, in general, a location
      in a state further south will be further east than a location in a more northern
      state on the east coast.

      far enough east to be east of Blair County, PA.

      NC is in the central-eastern part of NC. Blair County, PA is in central PA.

      Blair County, PA.


      4. **Account for any potential exceptions (unlikely in this case due to the

      extensions of North Carolina that would place it west of any part of Pennsylvania.
