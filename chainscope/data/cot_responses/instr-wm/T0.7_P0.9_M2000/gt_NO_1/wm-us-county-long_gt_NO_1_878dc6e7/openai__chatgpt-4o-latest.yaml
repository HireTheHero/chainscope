      4. Archuleta County is actually located to the south and slightly west of Gunnison
      County.

      5. Since Archuleta County is not east of Gunnison County, the answer is:


      **NO**.'
    fd66a6bf-e46b-4901-ae80-93599e59d1e4: '1. **Locate Gunnison County, CO**: Gunnison
      County is in central Colorado, west of the Continental Divide. It includes the
      city of Gunnison.


      2. **Locate Archuleta County, CO**: Archuleta County is in southwestern Colorado,
      with Pagosa Springs as its county seat.


      3. **Determine relative positions**: Archuleta County is located to the south
      and slightly west of Gunnison County. Since Gunnison County is farther east
      compared to Archuleta County, Archuleta County is actually west (not east) of
      Gunnison County.


      **Final Answer: NO**'
