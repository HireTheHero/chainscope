      Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Missouri.


      3. **Determine the relative positions of the counties**: Bullitt County is situated
      to the northwest of Metcalfe County. It is located closer to the state capital,
      Frankfort, and is part of the Louisville metropolitan area. Metcalfe County,
      on the other hand, is located in the southern part of the state, near the Tennessee
      border.


      4. **Compare their locations**: Since Bullitt County is northwest of Metcalfe
      County, and since Kentucky is oriented in a roughly north-south direction, it
      follows that Bullitt County is not located east of Metcalfe County. Instead,
      it is located to the west of Metcalfe County.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geography of Kentucky and the relative positions
      of Bullitt County and Metcalfe County, it can be concluded that Bullitt County
      is not located east of Metcalfe County. It is located to the west of Metcalfe
      County.

      3. **Determine the directional relationship**: Since Rockland County is in the
      southeastern part of the state and Albany County is in the eastern part, they
      are both located in the eastern part of New York State.

      4. **Compare the positions**: Given that both counties are in the eastern part
      of the state, we need to consider their specific locations relative to each
      other.

      5. **Conclusion**: Rockland County is located south of Albany County, and while
      it may be slightly eastward due to the curvature of the state''s borders, it
      is not significantly east of Albany County. The two counties are more in the
      same general eastern region of New York State.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Rockland County, NY, is located
      east of Albany County, NY, is: NO

      southern part of the country, while Minnesota is in the northern part. This
      means that Hunt County is generally to the south of Red Lake County.

      3. **Determine the specific locations of the counties**: Red Lake County is
      in the northwestern part of Minnesota, near the border with North Dakota. Hunt
      County is in northeastern Texas, near the border with Oklahoma.

      4. **Compare the relative positions**: Since both counties are in different
      states and at opposite ends of the country, we need to consider their positions
      in relation to the geographic center of the United States.

      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Red Lake County is in the northwestern part of
      Minnesota and Hunt County is in the northeastern part of Texas, Red Lake County
      is not located east of Hunt County. It''s more to the north and west of Hunt
      County.

    b64b54c0-a6e3-4b09-bd80-6d4fd6927ba5: 'To determine if Kingman County, KS is located
      east of Live Oak County, TX, we need to consider the relative positions of these
      two counties:


      1. **Identify the states**: Kingman County is in Kansas (KS), and Live Oak County
      is in Texas (TX).

      2. **General geographic positions**: Kansas is north of Texas in the United
      States.

      3. **Specific county locations**: Kingman County is in southern Kansas, and
      Live Oak County is in southern Texas.

      4. **Compare the positions**: Given that Kansas is north of Texas, and considering
      the specific locations of these counties, we need to determine their relative
      east-west positions.

      5. **Conclusion**: Since Kansas is north of Texas, and Kingman County is in
      southern Kansas while Live Oak County is in southern Texas, Kingman County is
      not east of Live Oak County. Instead, it is likely west or northwest of Live
      Oak County, given the general north-south alignment of the states.

      \ Kemper County's, the answer leans towards George County being more to the\

      3. **Compare the positions**: Since Georgia is north of Florida, we need to
      consider the east-west alignment of these counties relative to each other.

      4. **Specific county locations**: Terrell County is in southwestern Georgia,
      and Wakulla County is in the Florida Panhandle, which is the northwestern part
      of the state.

      5. **Compare the specific locations**: Given that Terrell County is in southwestern
      Georgia and Wakulla County is in the Florida Panhandle, which is more westward
      than eastern Georgia, Terrell County is likely not east of Wakulla County.


      Based on these steps and considering the geography of the United States, the
      answer to whether Terrell County, GA, is located east of Wakulla County, FL,
      is: NO

      1. **Identify the locations**: Cherry County, NE, is located in the state of
      Nebraska, while Rawlins County, KS, is located in the state of Kansas.

      2. **General geographic positions**: Nebraska is generally located in the Midwestern

      in the southeastern part of the United States. West Feliciana Parish is also
      located in Louisiana, to the east of St. Mary Parish.


      2. **Understand the geography of Louisiana**: Louisiana is a state with diverse
      geography, including coastal areas, bayous, and inland regions. It is bordered
      by the Gulf of Mexico to the south.


      3. **Consider the directional relationship**: Since both parishes are located
      in Louisiana, we need to compare their positions relative to each other.


      4. **Analyze the geographical data**: Based on the geographical data, St. Mary
      Parish is located in the southeastern part of Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico.
      West Feliciana Parish is located to the east of St. Mary Parish, near the Mississippi
      River.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical data and the directional relationship
      between St. Mary Parish and West Feliciana Parish, we can conclude that St.
      Mary Parish is located east of West Feliciana Parish.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: YES

      4. **Determine the specific locations of Sargent County and Nueces County**:
      Sargent County is in southeastern North Dakota, and Nueces County is in southern
      Texas.

      5. **Compare their locations**: Since Sargent County is in southeastern North
      Dakota, it''s more to the east than Nueces County, which is in southern Texas.

      6. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geography of the United States and the
      specific locations of Sargent County and Nueces County, Sargent County is indeed
      located east of Nueces County.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES
