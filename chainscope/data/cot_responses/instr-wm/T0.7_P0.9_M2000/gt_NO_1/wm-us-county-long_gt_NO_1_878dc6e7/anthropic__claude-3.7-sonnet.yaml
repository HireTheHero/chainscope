      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Adams County is in Colorado (CO)

      - Eddy County is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Colorado and New Mexico.

      - Colorado is directly north of New Mexico

      - Colorado is generally in the same longitudinal range as New Mexico


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - Adams County is in the north-central part of Colorado, including parts of
      the eastern Denver metropolitan area

      - Eddy County is in the southeastern part of New Mexico, along the border with
      Texas


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Adams County, being in north-central/northeastern Colorado, is roughly aligned
      with the central or western part of New Mexico

      - Eddy County, being in southeastern New Mexico, is on the eastern side of New
      Mexico


      Step 5: Make the final comparison.

      - Given that Eddy County is on the eastern edge of New Mexico, and Adams County
      is more centrally located in Colorado, Adams County would be west of Eddy County,
      not east of it.


      NO, Adams County, CO is not located east of Eddy County, NM.'

      - Red Lake County is in Minnesota, which is in the northern part of the central
      United States.

      - Hunt County is in Texas, which is in the southern part of the central United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of Minnesota and Texas.

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region.

      - Texas is located in the South Central region.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Minnesota is generally positioned east of Texas in terms of longitude.

      - The western edge of Minnesota is still typically east of the eastern parts
      of Texas.


      Step 4: While specific county positions might vary within their states, the
      overall state positions are sufficiently different that Red Lake County, MN
      would be east of Hunt County, TX.


      YES, Red Lake County, MN is located east of Hunt County, TX.'

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both counties.

      - Red Lake County is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Hunt County is in Texas (TX)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Minnesota is in the northern part of the central United States

      - Texas is in the southern part of the central United States


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Minnesota is generally positioned in the north-central part of the country

      - Texas is also in the central part of the country, but extends further east
      than many western states


      Step 4: Compare more precisely.

      - Red Lake County, MN is in northwestern Minnesota

      - Hunt County, TX is in northeastern Texas


      Step 5: Relative to the U.S. map, Minnesota is positioned to the north of Texas,
      but in terms of east-west positioning, both states are in the central part of
      the country. However, Red Lake County in northwestern Minnesota would be west
      of Hunt County in northeastern Texas.


      YES, Red Lake County, MN is located east of Hunt County, TX.


      Wait, I need to double-check my answer. Looking at a U.S. map more carefully:

      - Red Lake County, MN would be in the northwestern part of Minnesota

      - Hunt County, TX would be in the northeastern part of Texas

      - When comparing longitude (east-west position), northeastern Texas is actually
      east of northwestern Minnesota


      Correcting my answer: NO, Red Lake County, MN is NOT located east of Hunt County,
      TX. It is located west of Hunt County, TX.'
    c9b4db78-62f6-405e-8d24-25c230bd52bd: 'To determine if Red Lake County, MN is

      - Minnesota is located in the northern part of the central United States.

      - Texas is located in the southern part of the central United States.

      - Generally, Minnesota is north of Texas, but I need to determine the east-west

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region.

      - Texas is located in the South Central region.

      - Minnesota is generally east of Texas in terms of longitude.


      Step 3: Locate the specific counties.

      - Red Lake County is in Minnesota.

      - Hunt County is in Texas.

      - Since Minnesota is generally east of Texas, it''s likely that Red Lake County
      is east of Hunt County.


      Step 4: To be more precise, Red Lake County is in northwestern Minnesota, while
      Hunt County is in northeastern Texas. Even though both counties are in the eastern

      - George County is located in the southeastern corner of Mississippi, near the
      Gulf Coast and the Alabama border.

      - Kemper County is located in the east-central part of Mississippi, along the
      Alabama border.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - George County is in the southeastern corner of Mississippi.

      - Kemper County is in the east-central part of Mississippi.

      - When comparing counties on the same eastern edge (both border Alabama), the
      one further south (George) would be further east than the one more central (Kemper)
      due to Mississippi''s shape which curves eastward as you go south.


      Step 3: Verify this understanding.

      - George County is one of the easternmost counties in Mississippi, in the southeastern
      corner.

      - Kemper County, while also on the eastern edge, is further north where Mississippi''s
      eastern border is slightly more western compared to the southeastern corner.


      Based on this analysis, George County is indeed east of Kemper County on a map
      of Mississippi.


      NO


      Wait, I need to reconsider. Looking more carefully at Mississippi''s shape,
      the eastern border with Alabama doesn''t curve significantly eastward as you
      move south. Both counties border Alabama, but their east-west positioning depends
      on the exact shape of the border. Let me correct my analysis:


      YES


      George County is located east of Kemper County, MS.'

      - George County is located in the southeastern corner of Mississippi, near the
      Gulf Coast and the Alabama border.

      - Kemper County is located in the east-central part of Mississippi, along the
      Alabama border.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - George County is in the southeastern corner of Mississippi.

      - Kemper County is in the east-central part of Mississippi.

      - When comparing counties along the same eastern border, the one further south
      would be "east" of the one further north due to the curvature of the Alabama-Mississippi
      border, which angles southeast.


      Step 3: Verify their actual positions.

      - George County is indeed at the very southeastern corner of Mississippi.

      - Kemper County is further north but still on the eastern edge of Mississippi.

      - George County is further east than Kemper County due to Mississippi''s shape,
      with the southeastern portion extending further east than the east-central portion.


      NO, George County is not east of Kemper County. They are both on Mississippi''s
      eastern border, but George County is southeast of Kemper County, not directly
      east.


      Wait, I need to correct my answer. Looking more carefully at Mississippi''s
      geography, George County is actually further east than Kemper County because
      the Mississippi-Alabama border angles southeastward. The southeastern corner
      where George County is located extends further east than the east-central portion
      where Kemper County is located.


      YES, George County is located east of Kemper County, MS.'

      - Both counties are along the eastern border of Mississippi, but George County
      is much further south.


      Step 3: Determine if one is east of the other.

      - Since both counties border Alabama to their east, they are roughly aligned
      on the east-west axis along Mississippi''s eastern border.

      - However, George County is not east of Kemper County - they are both at Mississippi''s
      eastern edge, with George County being south of Kemper County.

      both on the eastern edge of the state, but they don''t have a significant east-west
      offset from each other - they''re primarily separated in the north-south direction.

      Arkansas is generally positioned to the west and north of Louisiana, with some
      overlap in longitude.


      Step 3: Locate Yell County within Arkansas.

      Yell County is located in west-central Arkansas.


      Step 4: Locate Calcasieu Parish within Louisiana.

      Calcasieu Parish is located in southwestern Louisiana, near the Texas border.


      Step 5: Compare their east-west positions.

      Since Calcasieu Parish is in the far southwestern part of Louisiana (bordering
      Texas), and Yell County is in west-central Arkansas, Calcasieu Parish is actually
      further west than Yell County.


      Therefore, Yell County, AR is located east of Calcasieu Parish, LA.

      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - Since both counties are on the Lake Michigan shoreline, they are primarily
      arranged in a north-south orientation.

      - Ozaukee County is south of Sheboygan County.

      - Neither county is significantly east or west of the other, as they both border
      Lake Michigan on their eastern sides.

      - If anything, the shoreline curves slightly, but Ozaukee is not east of Sheboygan.

      Step 1: Let me identify the states first.

      - Johnston County is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Blair County is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is also an eastern state, but is located north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning specifically.

      - Pennsylvania is in the Mid-Atlantic region

      - North Carolina is also in the Atlantic region, but generally NC is not significantly
      east or west of PA - they''re roughly aligned on the north-south axis


      Step 4: Look at the specific counties.

      - Johnston County, NC is in the eastern part of North Carolina

      - Blair County, PA is in central Pennsylvania, not on the eastern edge


      Step 5: Comparing their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Johnston County being in eastern NC would be closer to the Atlantic coast

      - Blair County being in central PA would be further from the Atlantic coast


      Therefore, Johnston County, NC is located east of Blair County, PA.

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is further north, also on the eastern side of the US but more
      inland


      Step 3: Consider the relative east-west positioning.

      - North Carolina generally lies to the south of Pennsylvania

      - In terms of east-west positioning, North Carolina extends further east than
      Pennsylvania, especially its eastern portions


      Step 4: Determine the specific locations of these counties within their states.

      - Johnston County, NC is in the east-central part of North Carolina

      - Blair County, PA is in the central part of Pennsylvania


      Step 5: Compare their longitudes.

      - Johnston County, NC is relatively close to the Atlantic coast

      - Blair County, PA is in the interior of Pennsylvania, away from the coast

      - Eastern locations have lower longitude values in the Western Hemisphere


      Based on this analysis, Johnston County, NC would be east of Blair County, PA,
      as North Carolina''s eastern regions extend further east than central Pennsylvania.


      YES, Johnston County, NC is located east of Blair County, PA.'

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is further north, also extending to the Atlantic coast but more
      inland


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of the Atlantic Ocean but east of the Midwest

      - North Carolina''s eastern counties (including coastal ones) are typically
      further east than Pennsylvania counties


      Step 4: Specifically for these counties:

      - New Hanover County is a coastal county in southeastern NC, containing Wilmington

      - Centre County is in central Pennsylvania (as its name suggests), in the interior
      of the state


      Step 5: Make the east-west comparison.

      - Coastal counties in NC are further east than interior counties in PA

      - New Hanover County borders the Atlantic Ocean, placing it very far east

      of the state.

      - Centre County is in Pennsylvania, located in the central part of the state
      (as its name suggests).


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the eastern United States.

      - Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina.

      - Pennsylvania is an inland state, while North Carolina has an Atlantic coastline.

      - The eastern United States generally runs northwest to southeast along the
      coast.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - New Hanover County, being on the coast of North Carolina, is very far east.

      - Centre County, being in central Pennsylvania, is more inland and therefore
      more western than coastal areas.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on longitude.

      - Coastal areas of the eastern United States are further east (lower longitude
      numbers) than inland areas.

      - New Hanover County, on NC''s coast, would have a more eastern longitude than
      Centre County in central PA.

      - Schuylkill County is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Tyrrell County is in North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the eastern United States.

      - Pennsylvania is a northeastern state

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state

      - Both states are on the eastern seaboard of the US


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of North Carolina

      - On the east coast, states that are more northern tend to be more eastward
      due to the shape of the coastline

      - However, the specific counties might not follow this general pattern


      Step 4: Check the specific longitudes.

      - Schuylkill County, PA is located in eastern Pennsylvania

      - Tyrrell County, NC is located on the eastern coast of North Carolina, near
      the Outer Banks

      - Tyrrell County is actually further east than Schuylkill County because it''s
      on the Atlantic coast, while Schuylkill is more inland in Pennsylvania

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the eastern United States.

      - Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina

      - Pennsylvania is generally in the northeastern US

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern US


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning specifically.

      - Pennsylvania is generally to the west of the Atlantic coast compared to North
      Carolina, which juts out more into the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Tyrrell County, NC is located in the eastern part of North Carolina, very
      close to the Atlantic coast.

      - Schuylkill County, PA is in eastern Pennsylvania, but Pennsylvania as a whole
      doesn''t extend as far east as eastern North Carolina.


      Step 4: Looking at the specific counties, Tyrrell County is on the eastern coast
      of North Carolina, while Schuylkill County is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania
      but not on the coast.


      Based on this analysis, Schuylkill County, PA is located to the WEST of Tyrrell
      County, NC, not to the east.

      of Yates County, NY?


      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) Southampton County is in Virginia (VA), which is a state on the eastern seaboard
      of the United States.


      2) Yates County is in New York (NY), which is also on the eastern seaboard but
      further north than Virginia.


      3) When comparing east-west positions of locations in the eastern United States,
      I need to consider their relative longitudes. Eastern locations have lower longitude
      values than western locations.


      4) Virginia is generally southeast of New York. While Virginia is certainly
      south of New York, I need to determine if Southampton County is specifically
      east of Yates County.


      5) Southampton County is in southeastern Virginia, near the Atlantic coast.


      6) Yates County is in the Finger Lakes region of western New York, which is
      in the interior of the state rather than on its eastern edge.


      7) Western New York is further inland (more westerly) than coastal Virginia.


      Based on these geographical positions, Southampton County, VA (being in coastal
      southeastern Virginia) is indeed east of Yates County, NY (being in western
      New York).

      Step 1: Let me identify the states first.

      - Southampton County is in Virginia (VA)

      - Yates County is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States, in the mid-Atlantic
      region.

      - New York is also on the east coast, but further north than Virginia.


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning specifically.

      - New York is generally positioned to the north and somewhat west of Virginia.

      - The eastern part of New York borders Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut,
      while the western part extends toward the Great Lakes.

      - Virginia''s eastern edge includes the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic coastline.


      Step 4: Locate the specific counties.

      - Southampton County is in southeastern Virginia, near the North Carolina border.

      - Yates County is in the Finger Lakes region of western New York, not on New
      York''s eastern edge.


      Step 5: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Western New York (where Yates County is located) is significantly west of
      southeastern Virginia (where Southampton County is located).

      - Southampton County, being near Virginia''s eastern portion, is further east
      than Yates County in western New York.

      - Yates County is in New York (NY), which is also on the eastern seaboard, but
      further north than Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider their east-west positioning.

      - Virginia is generally south of New York.

      - On the east coast, states that are more southern tend to extend further east
      than northern states because of the coastline''s northeast-to-southwest angle.

      - Southampton County is in southeastern Virginia, near the Atlantic coast.

      - Yates County is in western New York state, in the Finger Lakes region, which
      is inland.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Southampton County, VA is very close to the Atlantic Ocean in the southeastern
      part of Virginia.

      - Yates County, NY is in western/central New York, far from the coast and relatively
      western within the state.

      (Vermont''s largest city) and bordering Lake Champlain on its western edge.


      Step 3: Rutland County is in the west-central part of Vermont, south of Chittenden
      County.


      Step 4: When looking at their east-west positioning, Chittenden County is generally
      in the same longitudinal area as Rutland County, but Chittenden is not east
      of Rutland. In fact, parts of Chittenden may be slightly west of Rutland County
      since Chittenden borders Lake Champlain.


      Step 5: For one county to be east of another, it would need to be positioned
      to the right (east) of the other county on a map. Chittenden is not positioned
      to the east of Rutland.

      Since San Joaquin County is in the Central Valley (an inland area) and Monterey
      County is primarily a coastal county, San Joaquin County is located east of
      Monterey County.

      northern portion of the San Joaquin Valley specifically.


      Step 3: Monterey County is located on the central coast of California, bordering
      the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 4: When considering California''s geography, the Pacific Ocean is to the
      west, and as you move eastward, you encounter the coastal regions, then coastal
      mountain ranges, then valleys like the Central Valley, and then the Sierra Nevada
      mountains.


      Step 5: Since Monterey County is on the coast and San Joaquin County is in the
      Central Valley, San Joaquin County must be east of Monterey County.

      Step 1: Recall the location of San Joaquin County.

      San Joaquin County is located in California''s Central Valley, in the northern
      portion of the San Joaquin Valley. Its county seat is Stockton.


      Step 2: Recall the location of Monterey County.

      Monterey County is located on the central coast of California, with its western
      border being the Pacific Ocean. Its county seat is Salinas.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      California''s geography generally runs with the Pacific Ocean on the west, then
      coastal counties, then inland valley counties, then mountain counties to the
      east. Since Monterey County is on the coast, and San Joaquin County is in the
      Central Valley, San Joaquin would be east of Monterey.


      Step 4: Verify this mental map.

      San Joaquin County is indeed inland in the Central Valley, while Monterey County
      borders the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, San Joaquin County must be east of Monterey
      County.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Faribault County is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the northern part of the
      United States.

      - Caddo Parish is in Louisiana (LA), which is in the southern part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their east-west positioning.

      - Minnesota is in the upper Midwest region of the US.

      - Louisiana is also in the central part of the southern US.

      - Both states are roughly in the middle section of the country when considering
      east-west positioning.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes more specifically.

      - Minnesota, while northern, is actually slightly to the west of Louisiana in
      terms of longitude.

      - Louisiana is more southeastern compared to Minnesota.

      - Specifically, Faribault County, MN would be to the west of the longitude line
      passing through Caddo Parish, LA.


      Therefore, Faribault County, MN is NOT located east of Caddo Parish, LA. It
      is located to the west.
