      - Manistee County is in the northwestern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula

      - It is located on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan


      2. Next, let''s locate Etowah County, AL:

      2. Next, locate Yates County, NY on a map

      - Yates County is in western New York

      - It is located in the Finger Lakes region

      - It is west of the center of New York state


      3. Compare their relative geographic positions

      - Southampton County is in the southeastern part of the US

      - Yates County is in the northeastern part of the US

      - Southampton County is significantly south and east of Yates County


      4. Determine east/west relationship

      - Since Southampton County is southeast of Yates County, it is east of Yates
      County


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'
