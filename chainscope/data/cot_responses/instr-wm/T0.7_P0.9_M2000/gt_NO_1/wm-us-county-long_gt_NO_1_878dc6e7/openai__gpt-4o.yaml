      1. **Locate Monongalia County, WV:** Monongalia County is in north-central West
      Virginia, bordering the state of Pennsylvania to the north.


      2. **Locate Salem City, VA:** Salem is an independent city in Virginia, which
      is located in the western part of the state, near Roanoke.


      3. **Compare the longitudes:** Since Salem is in western Virginia and Monongalia
      County is in north-central West Virginia, Salem City, VA is generally located
      further east than Monongalia County, WV.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      **NO**, Salem City, VA is not located east of Monongalia County, WV; it is located
      to the west.'

      Mexico, but we are concerned with the east-west position (longitude). Musselshell
      County, being in central Montana, will have a longitude that needs comparison
      to San Juan County''s longitude in northwestern New Mexico.


      4. **Comparison**: San Juan County, NM is located further west compared to Musselshell
      County, MT due to its position in the northwestern part of New Mexico, which
      is generally more westward than central Montana.


      Based on the above reasoning, Musselshell County, MT is indeed east of San Juan
      County, NM.
