      - New Jersey is roughly oriented north-south

      - The eastern edge of NJ faces the Atlantic Ocean

      - Cape May County is at the southernmost tip of New Jersey

      - Hunterdon County is in west-central New Jersey


      2) Looking at relative positions:

      - Cape May County extends to the eastern coast

      - Hunterdon County is on the western side of the state, bordering Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, Cape May County is actually east of Hunterdon County

      Since Hunterdon County is west of Cape May County (not east of it), the answer

      - Ward County is in North Dakota

      - Haakon County is in South Dakota

      3) Let me check the relative positions:

      - Ward County, ND is in north-central North Dakota

      - Haakon County, SD is in central South Dakota


      4) Most importantly, for east/west positioning:

      - Ward County is roughly in the middle of ND longitudinally

      - Haakon County is also roughly in the middle of SD longitudinally

      - They are fairly well aligned on a north-south axis


      Therefore, since both counties are in approximately the same longitudinal position
      (both in the central parts of their respective states), and not significantly
      offset east or west from each other...


      NO, Ward County is not east of Haakon County. They are roughly aligned north-south.'

      - Haakon County is in South Dakota

      - Ward County is near the middle of North Dakota (longitudinally)

      - Haakon County is also near the middle of South Dakota (longitudinally)

      - Since both are roughly in the middle of their states, and North Dakota and

      1) First, I''ll recall that Minnesota is in the northern part of the US, while
      Texas is in the southern part.


      2) More importantly for this question, Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest,
      while Texas is in the South Central United States.


      3) Red Lake County is in Minnesota, so it follows Minnesota''s general geographic
      position.


      4) Hunt County is in Texas, so it follows Texas''s general geographic position.


      5) When comparing east-west positions, Minnesota is generally to the east of
      Texas.


      6) However, looking more specifically, Red Lake County, MN is actually in the
      western portion of Minnesota, while Hunt County, TX is in the eastern portion
      of Texas.


      7) Even with Red Lake being in western Minnesota and Hunt being in eastern Texas,
      Minnesota is still far enough east of Texas that Red Lake County would be east
      of Hunt County.

      4) Given that Kansas as a whole is east of Texas, and these counties are both
      roughly in the middle portions of their states, Kingman County must be east
      of Live Oak County.

      - Letcher County is on the eastern edge of Kentucky

      - Sanilac County is on the eastern edge of Michigan


      3) Since both counties are on the eastern edges of their respective states,
      and Kentucky and Michigan are roughly aligned east-west (neither state is significantly
      east or west of the other), these counties would be roughly aligned on a north-south
      axis.


      4) Therefore, they are at approximately the same longitude, with Letcher County
      perhaps being very slightly east of Sanilac County.
