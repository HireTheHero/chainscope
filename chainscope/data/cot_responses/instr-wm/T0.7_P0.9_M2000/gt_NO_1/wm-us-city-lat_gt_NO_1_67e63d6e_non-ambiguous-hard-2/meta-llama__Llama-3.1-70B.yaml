      5. When comparing north-south positions, being east of another location does
      not necessarily mean it''s also north of that location. We need to consider
      the specific latitudes of the two locations.


      Without specific latitude information, we can only make a general assumption:


      - Surf City, NC, is likely located south of Boyes Hot Springs, CA, since North
      Carolina is generally south of California.


      However, without exact latitude data, it''s difficult to determine the precise
      north-south relationship between the two locations.

      Springs, CA, is: **NO**'
