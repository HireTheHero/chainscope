      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both Buckhorn, CA and Whitewood,
      SD.

      - Buckhorn, CA is in California, which is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Whitewood, SD is in South Dakota, which is in the northern central part of
      the United States.


      Step 2: I need to compare their latitudes (north-south positions).

      - California generally lies to the south of South Dakota.

      - South Dakota is in the northern part of the country, with its northern border
      at approximately 45-46 degrees North latitude.

      - Buckhorn, CA would typically be located between 32-42 degrees North latitude
      (the approximate range for California).

      - Whitewood, SD would be located in the northern part of South Dakota, likely
      around 44-45 degrees North latitude.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Buckhorn, CA is in California, which is south of South Dakota, and Whitewood,
      SD is in South Dakota, Buckhorn is likely south of Whitewood.

      - This means Buckhorn is NOT north of Whitewood.

      - Las Quintas Fronterizas is likely in southern Texas near the Mexico border
      (based on the name "Fronterizas" suggesting a border location).


      Step 4: Comparing latitudes:

      - Southern Florida (where Ojus is located) is generally around 25-26 degrees
      North latitude.

      - The Texas-Mexico border region (where Las Quintas Fronterizas would be) runs
      roughly along 26-32 degrees North latitude, with the southernmost parts of Texas
      being around 26 degrees North.

      - The southernmost parts of Texas (like the Rio Grande Valley area where border
      communities are located) are typically at a similar latitude to southern Florida
      or slightly north of it.


      Based on this analysis, Ojus, FL is likely at a similar latitude or slightly
      south of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX.


      NO, Ojus, FL is not located north of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX.'

      Step 1: Recall the general geographic positions of Ohio and Wisconsin in the
      United States.

      - Wisconsin is in the northern part of the Midwest, bordering Lake Superior
      and Michigan to the north.

      - Ohio is located to the southeast of Wisconsin, in a more central-eastern position.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship between these states.

      - Wisconsin is generally north of Ohio.

      - Cities in Wisconsin tend to be at higher latitudes (more northerly) than cities
      in Ohio.


      Step 3: While there could be exceptions if we''re looking at cities at the extreme
      northern edge of Ohio and the extreme southern edge of Wisconsin, Barberton
      is not in northern Ohio, and Mole Lake is in northern Wisconsin.

      - Barberton is in northeastern Ohio, near Akron.

      - Mole Lake is in northern Wisconsin, in Forest County.


      Based on this geographic reasoning, Barberton, OH would be south of Mole Lake,
      WI, not north of it.

      Canada.

      - Wyoming is located south of North Dakota, with Montana in between them.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - North Dakota is generally at a higher latitude (more northern) than Wyoming.

      - Cities in North Dakota would typically be north of cities in Wyoming.


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      - Since Hoback is in Wyoming, and Lakota is in North Dakota, and North Dakota
      is north of Wyoming, Hoback would be south of Lakota, not north of it.

      Step 1: I need to determine the approximate locations of both cities by their
      states.

      - Kellyville is in Oklahoma (OK), which is in the central-southern United States.

      - East Prospect is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the northeastern United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of these states.

      - Oklahoma is generally south of Pennsylvania on a map of the United States.

      - Pennsylvania is significantly further north than Oklahoma.


      Step 3: While specific cities within states could sometimes contradict the general
      state positioning, the north-south difference between Oklahoma and Pennsylvania
      is substantial enough that a city in Oklahoma would almost certainly be south
      of a city in Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Kellyville, OK would be located in the southern part of the United States,
      while East Prospect, PA would be in the northern part of the United States.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Norfork, AR is in Arkansas, which is a state in the southern United States.

      - Chillicothe, OH is in Ohio, which is a state in the midwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their approximate geographic positions.

      - Arkansas is located south of Ohio in the United States.

      - Ohio is significantly further north than Arkansas.


      Step 3: More specifically, let''s think about their relative latitudes.

      - Cities in Arkansas are generally at lower latitudes (more southern) than cities
      in Ohio.

      - Chillicothe, OH is located in southern Ohio, but even southern Ohio is north
      of northern Arkansas.

      - Norfork, AR is in north-central Arkansas, but this is still south of Ohio.

      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Bruce is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Larned is in Kansas (KS)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States

      - Kansas is located in the central United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Mississippi is generally south of Kansas on a map of the United States

      - Kansas is considerably further north than Mississippi


      Step 4: Even though specific cities might vary somewhat from the general position
      of their states, the difference between Kansas and Mississippi is significant
      enough that a city in Mississippi (Bruce) would almost certainly be south of
      a city in Kansas (Larned).

      the state.

      - Plain, WI is located in Sauk County, Wisconsin, which is in the southern part
      of Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south relationship between Indiana and Wisconsin.

      - Wisconsin is located directly north of Illinois.

      - Indiana is located east of Illinois.

      - This means Wisconsin is generally north of Indiana.


      Step 3: Looking at more specific locations within these states:

      - Plain, WI is in southern Wisconsin, but Wisconsin as a whole is still north
      of Indiana.

      - Knightsville, IN is in western Indiana, but this east-west position doesn''t
      change the north-south relationship.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the geographic positions.

      - Since Wisconsin is north of Indiana, and Plain is in Wisconsin while Knightsville
      is in Indiana, Plain must be north of Knightsville.

      NO, Mount Auburn, IL is not located north of Kieler, WI. Mount Auburn is south

      Step 1: Let me identify the states. IL is Illinois, and WI is Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Geographically, Wisconsin is located north of Illinois in the United
      States. Wisconsin borders Illinois on Illinois''s northern border.


      Step 3: Since Kieler is in Wisconsin (WI), and Mount Auburn is in Illinois (IL),
      we can generally expect Kieler to be north of Mount Auburn.


      Step 4: However, I should check if there might be any unusual geographic arrangements.
      For example, if Mount Auburn were in the far northern part of Illinois and Kieler
      were in the far southern part of Wisconsin, the answer might be different.


      Step 5: Mount Auburn is in central Illinois, while Kieler is in the southwest
      corner of Wisconsin near the Illinois border. Even in this case, Kieler would
      still be north of Mount Auburn because even the southernmost point of Wisconsin
      is north of central Illinois.
