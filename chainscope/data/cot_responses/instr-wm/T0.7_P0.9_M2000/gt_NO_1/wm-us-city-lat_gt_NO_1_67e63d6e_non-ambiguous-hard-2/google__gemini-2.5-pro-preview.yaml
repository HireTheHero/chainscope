      is located north of South Carolina on a map of the United States.

      4.  **Apply state location to city location:** Since Virginia is north of South
      Carolina, any city in Virginia will generally be north of any city in South
      Carolina. Therefore, Rich Creek, VA must be north of Cash, SC.

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Cash, SC is north
