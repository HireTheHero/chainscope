      on a map.


      2. Michigan is located west of New York state.


      3. Since Michigan is west of New York, any location in Michigan will be west
      of any location in New York.


      4. Therefore, Lake Mitchell (Michigan) is west of Ballston Lake, NY, not east.


      5. The question asks if Lake Mitchell is east of Ballston Lake.

      1. First, locate Geneva Lake, Wisconsin on a map

      - Geneva Lake is in southeastern Wisconsin, in Walworth County

      - It is west of Lake Michigan


      2. Next, locate Skaneateles Lake, New York on a map

      - Skaneateles Lake is in the Finger Lakes region of central New York

      - It is east of Lake Ontario


      3. Compare their relative geographic positions

      - Wisconsin is west of New York

      - Geneva Lake is further west than Skaneateles Lake

      - This means Geneva Lake is WEST of Skaneateles Lake, not east


      4. Therefore, the answer to "Is Geneva Lake, WI located east of Skaneateles
      Lake, NY?" is:


      NO'

    aed31b36-6b6a-4de7-b9c3-625e4d846a3c: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Clear Fork Reservoir in Ohio

      - This reservoir is located in north-central Ohio, in Mansfield, Richland County


      2. Next, locate Gardiners Bay in New York

      - Gardiners Bay is located on the eastern end of Long Island, in Suffolk County,
      New York


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - Clear Fork Reservoir is in central Ohio

      - Gardiners Bay is on Long Island, which is on the eastern coast of New York

      - Ohio is west of New York


      4. Determine the relative east-west positioning

      - Since Clear Fork Reservoir is in Ohio (west of New York), and Gardiners Bay
      is in New York, Clear Fork Reservoir is NOT east of Gardiners Bay


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll locate Gravelly Lake in Washington state

      2. Then, I''ll locate the Wellsville Mountains in Utah

      3. I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Gravelly Lake is located in Pierce County, Washington, near Tacoma,
      in the western part of the state.


      Step 2: The Wellsville Mountains are located in northern Utah, near Logan, in
      the northeastern part of the state.


      Step 3: Comparing their locations:

      - Gravelly Lake is in western Washington

      - Wellsville Mountains are in northern Utah

      - Washington is west of Utah


      Therefore, Gravelly Lake is indeed west of the Wellsville Mountains.


      So the answer is: NO (Gravelly Lake is NOT east of Wellsville Mountains)'

      2. Next, locate Mormon Lake:

      - Mormon Lake is in Arizona, located in the central part of the state

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Washington is north and west of Arizona

      - This means any location in Washington will be north and west of any location
      in Arizona


      4. Therefore, when comparing their east-west positions:

      - Angle Lake (in Washington) is west of Mormon Lake (in Arizona)


      5. The question asks: "Is Angle Lake located east of Mormon Lake?"

      - Since Angle Lake is west of Mormon Lake, the answer is NO.
