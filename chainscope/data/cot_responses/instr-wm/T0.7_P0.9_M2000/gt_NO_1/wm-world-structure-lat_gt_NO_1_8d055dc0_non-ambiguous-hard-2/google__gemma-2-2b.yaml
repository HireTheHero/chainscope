    b03ba8e2-1e17-475d-9f6d-3f37b94fce58: 'I have not read the passage. I can only
      guess, and here is my guess.


      First, let us take a look at the word ''north''. It means ''the direction opposite
      to south''. So, if the passage talks about the location of a place, the ''north''
      part of the word should be placed in the ''north'' direction.


      Now, let us take a look at the word ''Shellmouth Reservoir''. It is a body of
      water. It means a place where water is stored. So, if the passage talks about
      the location of a body of water, the ''north'' part of the word should be placed
      in the ''north'' direction.


      So, based on the above analysis, I can say that the NTPC Ramagundam is located
      north of Shellmouth Reservoir.

      Waco" - it means that the power station is located somewhere on the lake. Now,
      it is not clear where exactly. But it is not necessary to know this. We just
      need to know that the power station is located somewhere on the lake.

      Now, we can eliminate the answer options that do not have "power station" or
      "lake" in them. This leaves us with two options:

      - Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is located north of Lake Waco.
