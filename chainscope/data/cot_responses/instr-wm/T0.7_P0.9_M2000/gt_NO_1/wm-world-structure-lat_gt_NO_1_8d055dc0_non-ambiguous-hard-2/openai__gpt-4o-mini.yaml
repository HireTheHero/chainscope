      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: We need to determine the geographic locations
      of both the Calatagan Solar Farm and the Carrapatelo Dam.


      2. **Locate Calatagan Solar Farm**: The Calatagan Solar Farm is located in the
      Philippines.


      3. **Locate Carrapatelo Dam**: The Carrapatelo Dam is located in Portugal.


      4. **Determine Relative Positions**: Since Calatagan Solar Farm is in the Philippines
      and Carrapatelo Dam is in Portugal, they are located in different countries
      and far apart from each other.


      5. **Assess the Direction**: Given that one location is in Asia (Philippines)
      and the other in Europe (Portugal), we cannot directly compare their north-south
      positions relative to each other in a straightforward manner.


      6. **Conclusion**: Since both locations are in different hemispheres and countries,
      we cannot say that one is north of the other in a meaningful geographic context.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Calatagan Solar Farm located north
      of Carrapatelo Dam?" is **NO**.'

      locations of both structures.


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to establish where Cuartel de Santa Lucia
      and St. Martha Catholic Church are situated. This typically involves looking
      at a map or having knowledge of their coordinates.


      2. **Determine their relative positions**: Once we know the locations, we can
      assess the cardinal directions. If Cuartel de Santa Lucia is positioned at a
      latitude that is greater than that of St. Martha Catholic Church, then it is
      located north of it.


      3. **Final assessment**: After gathering the necessary information about the
      locations and confirming their relative positions on a map, we can arrive at
      a conclusion.


      Without specific geographical data or a map at hand, I cannot definitively answer
      the question. However, if we assume the necessary information leads us to find
      that Cuartel de Santa Lucia is indeed north of St. Martha Catholic Church based

      YES or NO answer without that information. However, if you have the locations,

      - The Hague is located in the western part of the Netherlands, which is in Europe.

      west of The Hague. Since The Hague is to the east of Waterford, we can conclude
      that the Eugene O''Neill Theater Center is not north of Catshuis, but rather
      to the west.

      After performing this reasoning:


      - **Sai Ying Pun Community Complex** is located in Hong Kong, while **Cherokee
      Lake** is not a well-known landmark but could refer to various lakes named Cherokee
      in different regions, including the United States.


      Since the geographical context of these two places is different, it is not possible
      for Sai Ying Pun Community Complex to be north of Cherokee Lake.
