      **Step 1: Locate Cuartel de Santa Lucia**

      Cuartel de Santa Lucia is a historical military barracks located in Intramuros,
      Manila, Philippines.


      **Step 2: Locate St. Martha Catholic Church**

      There are several churches named St. Martha Catholic Church around the world.
      To make an accurate comparison, we need to know which specific St. Martha Catholic
      Church is being referred to.


      However, if we assume this refers to the St. Martha Catholic Church in Pateros,
      Metro Manila, Philippines (as it is a known church in the same general region),
      we can proceed.


      **Step 3: Compare their locations**

      - Cuartel de Santa Lucia is in Intramuros, Manila.

      - St. Martha Catholic Church is in Pateros, which is southeast of Intramuros.


      Therefore, in terms of geographic orientation:

      - Intramuros (Cuartel de Santa Lucia) is located to the northwest of Pateros
      (St. Martha Catholic Church).


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Cuartel de Santa Lucia is northwest of St. Martha Catholic Church, it
      is indeed located to the north.
