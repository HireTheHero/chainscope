      2. **Determine a common reference:** Both buildings are on North Michigan Avenue.  Therefore,

      2. **Determine the general direction:** "North Michigan" suggests 333 North
      Michigan is on North Michigan Avenue.  This avenue runs north-south.


      3. **Consider street numbering conventions:** In Chicago, like most cities,
      street addresses increase as you go north along north-south avenues.


      4. **Infer relative positions:**  If 333 North Michigan is on North Michigan
      Avenue, and the number is relatively low, it''s likely in the southern or central
      part of that avenue.  To be north of another building on the same avenue, it
      would need a higher street number.  Without knowing Skyll House''s address,
      we can''t be certain. However, the question implies Skyll House *is* on North
      Michigan Avenue.


      5. **Consider the possibility of Skyll House being on a different street:**  If
      Skyll House is not on North Michigan Avenue, then the directional comparison

      Therefore, the statement that El Hogar Filipino Building is *north* of Sacred
      Heart Cathedral is meaningless in a practical sense as they are on different
      landmasses.  While one could argue a technical directionality based on global
      coordinates, the question implies proximity.
