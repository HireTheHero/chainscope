      1. **Identify the location of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant**: The Rooppur Nuclear
      Power Plant is located in Bangladesh, specifically in the Ishwardi Upazila of
      Pabna District, which is in the northwestern part of the country.


      2. **Identify the location of Summerhill House**: Summerhill House is located
      in Ireland. It is historically associated with Summerhill, County Meath.


      3. **Determine the relative geographical positions**: Bangladesh is situated
      in South Asia, while Ireland is located in Western Europe. On a world map, Bangladesh
      is generally to the east of Ireland.


      4. **Consider the latitudinal positions**: Bangladesh, where the Rooppur Nuclear
      Power Plant is located, is closer to the equator compared to Ireland. Therefore,
      it is situated further south in terms of latitude.


      Based on these steps, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, located in Bangladesh, is
      geographically south of Summerhill House in Ireland.


      The answer is: NO.'
