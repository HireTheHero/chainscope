      1. First, let me locate Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station

      - It is located in Kenya

      - It''s on the Tana River

      - It''s approximately 160km northeast of Nairobi


      2. Now, let me locate Windy Hill Wind Farm

      - Windy Hill Wind Farm is located in Queensland, Australia


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Kindaruma is in Kenya (East Africa)

      - Windy Hill is in Australia (Oceania)

      - Australia is located entirely south of the equator

      - Kenya straddles the equator

      - Therefore, Windy Hill Wind Farm must be south of Kindaruma

      churches with this name
