      NO"
    e1a25d74-52b4-4b5a-9a14-955caa55dd28: 'Okay, let''s break this down:


      1.  **Locate Windy Hill Wind Farm:** Windy Hill Wind Farm is located in California,
      USA (specifically, often associated with the Altamont Pass area or near Fairfield/Rio
      Vista).

      2.  **Locate Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station:** Kindaruma Hydroelectric
      Power Station is located on the Tana River in Kenya.

      3.  **Compare Locations:** California, USA is in North America. Kenya is in
      East Africa.

      4.  **Determine Relative Position:** Geographically, California (USA) is located
      significantly north of Kenya (Africa). California is entirely in the Northern
      Hemisphere, while Kenya straddles the Equator.


      Therefore:


      YES'
    f68ec985-185e-4ed5-aa33-f318174cce4d: 'Okay, here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Locate Windy Hill Wind Farm:** Windy Hill Wind Farm is located near Raglan,
      on the North Island of **New Zealand**.

      2.  **Locate Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station:** Kindaruma Hydroelectric
      Power Station is located on the Tana River in **Kenya**.

      3.  **Compare the locations geographically:** New Zealand is an island country
      in the South Pacific Ocean, entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. Kenya is a
      country in East Africa, located near the equator (Kindaruma specifically is
      slightly south of the equator).

      4.  **Determine the directional relationship:** Since Kenya is located significantly
      north of New Zealand (Kenya is near the equator, New Zealand is far south),
      Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station is north of Windy Hill Wind Farm.

      5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Windy Hill Wind Farm
      (New Zealand) is north of Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station (Kenya). Based
      on the locations, Windy Hill Wind Farm is far south of Kindaruma Hydroelectric
      Power Station.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'

      1.  **Identify Location 1:** Cuartel de Santa Lucia is a historical structure
      located within the walls of Intramuros, Manila, Philippines. Specifically, it''s
      in the southwestern part of Intramuros.

      2.  **Identify Location 2:** St. Martha Catholic Church (assuming the prominent
      St. Martha Parish Church) is located in the Paco district of Manila, which is
      situated southeast of Intramuros.

      3.  **Compare Latitudes/Relative Positions:** Looking at a map, Intramuros (where
      Cuartel de Santa Lucia is) is generally north and slightly west of the Paco
      district (where St. Martha Parish Church is).

      4.  **Conclusion:** Since Cuartel de Santa Lucia is in Intramuros and St. Martha
      Parish Church is in Paco (south/southeast of Intramuros), Cuartel de Santa Lucia
      is indeed located north of St. Martha Parish Church.

      \n1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to find the geographical positions\

      \ Both names strongly suggest locations within Intramuros, Manila, Philippines.\n\
      3.  **Locate Cuartel de Santa Lucia:** This structure is well-known. It's located\
      \ in the southwestern part of Intramuros, along Calle Real del Palacio (now\
      \ General Luna Street) and Santa Lucia Street, near the Santa Lucia Gate. Its\
      \ approximate coordinates are around 14.586\xB0 N latitude.\n4.  **Locate St.\
      \ Martha Catholic Church:** Finding a prominent, distinct \"St. Martha Catholic\
      \ Church\" *within* Intramuros is difficult. There isn't a major landmark church\
      \ specifically known by that name like San Agustin Church or Manila Cathedral.\
      \ However, there might be a chapel or a reference within another complex. The\
      \ ruins of the San Ignacio Church, which are sometimes associated with related\
      \ shrines or historical references, are located slightly northeast of the Cuartel\
      \ de Santa Lucia, along Arzobispo Street. The approximate latitude for the San\
      \ Ignacio Church ruins area is around 14.587\xB0 N. Let's assume this area is\
      \ the intended reference for \"St. Martha Catholic Church\" as it's the most\
      \ plausible candidate *inside* Intramuros near the Cuartel. (If the reference\
      \ was to a St. Martha church outside Intramuros, like in Paco, it would be further\

      2.  **Identify Location 2:** St. Martha Catholic Church. A prominent church
      with this name is located in Balangkas, Valenzuela City, Metro Manila, Philippines.
      (There might be others, but this is a well-known one in the Metro Manila area).

      3.  **Determine Relative Geography:** Intramuros (where Cuartel de Santa Lucia
      is) is in the City of Manila. Valenzuela City (where the St. Martha Catholic
      Church is) is located significantly north of the City of Manila.

      4.  **Compare Positions:** Since Cuartel de Santa Lucia is in Manila and St.
      Martha Catholic Church is in Valenzuela City (which is north of Manila), Cuartel
      de Santa Lucia is located *south* of St. Martha Catholic Church.

      5.  **Answer the Question:** The question asks if Cuartel de Santa Lucia is
