      1. First, I need to locate Concordia in Portland, Oregon

      2. Then, I need to locate Hartford County, Connecticut

      3. Then, I''ll determine their relative geographic positions


      Step 1: Portland, Oregon is located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States,
      specifically in the state of Oregon on the West Coast.


      Step 2: Hartford County is located in Connecticut, which is on the East Coast
      of the United States.


      Step 3: The West Coast (Oregon) is geographically west of the East Coast (Connecticut).
      Therefore, any location in Portland, Oregon would be west of Hartford County,
      Connecticut.


      So, is Concordia, Portland, Oregon located east of Hartford County, Connecticut?

      2. Phalut is a mountain located in the Singalila Range, on the border between
      Nepal and India, specifically in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India.


      3. Putuo District is located in Zhoushan, which is a city and archipelago in
      Zhejiang Province, China. It is situated in the East China Sea.


      4. Geographically, Phalut is located in the western part of West Bengal, India,
      while Putuo District is in eastern China.


      5. Comparing their locations on a map, Phalut is significantly west of Putuo
      District.


      6. Therefore, Phalut is NOT located east of Putuo District, Zhoushan.

      3. To determine their relative positions, we need to compare their geographical
      locations:

      - Camden County is in North America (North Carolina, USA)

      - San Sebastiano al Vesuvio is in Europe (Italy)

      - These locations are on different continents


      4. Comparing their positions on a globe:

      - North America is west of Europe

      - So, Camden County is west of San Sebastiano al Vesuvio


      5. Therefore, Camden County is NOT east of San Sebastiano al Vesuvio.


      Answer: NO'

      1. First, let''s locate Rukum District:

      - Rukum District is located in western Nepal

      - It is in the Rapti Province of Nepal

      - Geographically, it is in the mid-western region of Nepal


      2. Next, let''s locate Hokota, Ibaraki:

      - Hokota is a city in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan

      - It is located in the eastern part of Honshu island


      3. Consider their relative geographical positions:

      - Rukum District is in Nepal (South Asia)

      - Hokota is in Japan (East Asia)

      - These locations are very far apart, on different continents


      4. Assess their east-west positioning:

      - Nepal is west of Japan

      - Rukum District would therefore be west of Hokota, not east


      5. Conclusion:

      - Since Rukum District is west of Hokota, the answer is NOT located east of
      Hokota.

      1. First, I''ll locate Agame and Koraput district on a map of India.


      2. Agame is a town or region in Ethiopia, not in India. So the initial premise
      of the question seems geographically misplaced.


      3. Koraput district is located in Odisha state in eastern India.


      4. Since Agame is in Ethiopia (in Africa) and Koraput is in India, they are
      on different continents.
