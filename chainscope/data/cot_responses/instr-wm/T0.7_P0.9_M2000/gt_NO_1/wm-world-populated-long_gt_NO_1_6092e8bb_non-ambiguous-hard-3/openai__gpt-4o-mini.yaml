      Without specific coordinates or a defined location for La Vera, it''s challenging
      to make an accurate comparison. However, if La Vera is indeed located further
      west than Succasunna, then the answer would be YES, and if it is further east
      or at the same latitude, the answer would be NO.


      Given that La Vera is less commonly defined, and depending on the context, it
      is more likely that Succasunna is east of La Vera (if we are considering La
      Vera to be in another country or region).


      Based on these considerations, my answer is: **NO**, Succasunna is not located
      east of La Vera (assuming La Vera is west of the United States). If you have
      a specific La Vera in mind, please clarify for a more accurate answer.'

      - Montebello, Quebec, has a longitude of about -75.0 degrees.

      - Inishvickillane, County Kerry, Ireland, has a longitude of about -10.5 degrees.


      Since longitude is measured in degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian (0
      degrees), a place with a larger negative longitude value (like Montebello) is
      located further west than a place with a smaller negative longitude value (like
      Inishvickillane).


      Given that the longitude of Montebello is considerably west of that of Inishvickillane,
      we can conclude that Montebello is not east of Inishvickillane.

      east of Uribarri, we need to identify the locations of both places.


      1. **Mascouche**: This is a city located in Quebec, Canada, situated to the
      northeast of Montreal.


      2. **Uribarri**: This is a neighborhood in Bilbao, Spain.


      Next, we need to compare the geographical positions of these two locations.


      - **Mascouche** is in North America (Canada).

      - **Uribarri** is in Europe (Spain).


      Given that Mascouche is in Canada and Uribarri is in Spain, they are separated
      by the Atlantic Ocean, and thus cannot be directly east or west of each other
      in a typical sense of proximity.


      However, if we consider their relative positions on a map of the world:

      - Canada (where Mascouche is) is generally to the northwest of Spain (where
      Uribarri is).


      Since Uribarri is located in the southern part of Europe and Mascouche is in
      northeastern North America, we can conclude that Mascouche is not east of Uribarri.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'
