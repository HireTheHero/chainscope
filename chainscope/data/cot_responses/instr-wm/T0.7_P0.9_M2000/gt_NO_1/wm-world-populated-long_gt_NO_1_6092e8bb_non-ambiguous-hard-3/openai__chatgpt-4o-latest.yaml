    d597c7fd-2f4b-448a-bcef-5b6ad56a0cfe: 'To determine whether Cascade, Wisconsin
      is located east of Shipley, West Sussex, we need to compare their longitudes,
      since longitude determines how far east or west a location is.


      **Step 1: Identify the location of Cascade, Wisconsin**

      - Cascade is a village located in the state of Wisconsin, USA.

      - Wisconsin is in the central part of the United States.

      - Approximate longitude of Cascade, Wisconsin: around **-88 degrees** (West).


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Shipley, West Sussex**

      - Shipley is a village in West Sussex, England.

      - England is located in western Europe.

      - Approximate longitude of Shipley, West Sussex: around **-0.4 degrees** (West).


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes**

      - -88 (Cascade, WI) is more west than -0.4 (Shipley, West Sussex).

      - Therefore, Cascade, Wisconsin is located **west** of Shipley, West Sussex.


      **Final Answer: NO**.'
