      2. **Locate Nusa Kambangan:** Nusa Kambangan is an island off the south coast
      of Java, Indonesia, in the Indian Ocean.


      3. **Compare Longitudes:**  We need to determine which island is further east.  East
      corresponds to higher longitude values.


      4. **Inference:** Since Pemba Island is off the east coast of Africa and Nusa
      Kambangan is near Java, which is considerably further east, Nusa Kambangan is
      likely east of Pemba Island.

      2. **Locate Sanderao:** "Sanderao" doesn''t appear to be a recognized place
      name in Okinawa.  It''s possible there''s a misspelling, or it might be a very
      small, localized name.  The closest sounding major place is Sunabe Seawall,
      which is a seawall located in Chatan, Okinawa. Chatan is southwest of Motobu.

      location) is southwest of Motobu, it is not east.

      2. **Locate Sanderao:**  I need to find Sanderao.  Searching online indicates
      Sanderao is likely a misspelling or slight variation.  The most probable intended
      location is likely Cape Hedo (Hedo Misaki), often referred to as the northernmost
      point of Okinawa Island. Phonetically, "Sanderao" might derive from a local
      dialect or mishearing.

      3. **Determine relative positions:** Cape Hedo is indeed located north, and
      slightly east, of Motobu.


      Therefore, assuming Sanderao refers to the northern tip of Okinawa (Cape Hedo/Hedo
      Misaki), the answer is **YES**.

      is what is meant, but I can''t be certain.

      3. **Determine East/West relationship:**  Assuming "Sanderao" is meant to be
      Cape Zampa/Zanpamisaki, it is located at the northwestern tip of the Motobu

      3. **Compare Longitudes:**  Cape May is in the Western Hemisphere. Cape Verde
      is in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Arizona and California are also in the Western
      Hemisphere but further west than New Jersey.


      4. **East or West?:**  Places to the east have a more easterly longitude.  Since
      Cape Verde is in the Eastern Hemisphere and Cape May is in the Western Hemisphere,
      Cape May is west of Cape Verde.  Similarly, Arizona and California are west
      of New Jersey.  Therefore, Cape May is west of any of the likely interpretations
      of "Verd."
