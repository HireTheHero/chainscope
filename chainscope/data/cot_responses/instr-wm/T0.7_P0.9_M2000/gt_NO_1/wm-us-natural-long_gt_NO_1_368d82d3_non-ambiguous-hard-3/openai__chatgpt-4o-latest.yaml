      longitudes of both locations. The further east a place is, the smaller (more
      negative) its longitude value in the Western Hemisphere.


      **Step 1: Identify the location of Lake Agnes (Colorado):**

      Lake Agnes is located in the state of Colorado, specifically in the Rocky Mountains
      in Jackson County. Colorado is a western U.S. state.


      **Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Wawasee (Indiana):**

      Lake Wawasee is located in northeastern Indiana, near the town of Syracuse.
      Indiana is in the Midwestern region of the U.S., east of Colorado.


      **Step 3: Compare relative positions:**

      - Colorado is generally west of Indiana.

      - Therefore, Lake Agnes (CO) is west of Lake Wawasee (IN).


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Colorado is west of Indiana, Lake Agnes is west of Lake Wawasee.

      the relative geographic locations of Honey Lake, California, and the Sierra
      Madre Range in Wyoming.


      **Step 1: Locate Honey Lake, CA**

      - Honey Lake is located in northeastern California, near the border with Nevada.

      - It is situated in Lassen County, California.


      **Step 2: Locate Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming), WY**

      - The Sierra Madre Range is located in south-central Wyoming.

      - Specifically, it lies in Carbon County, Wyoming, and is part of the Rocky
      Mountains.

      - It is near the border with Colorado.


      **Step 3: Determine relative positions (east vs. west)**

      - California is west of Wyoming.

      - Honey Lake, being in northeastern California, is still west of the Sierra
      Madre Range in Wyoming.

      - The Sierra Madre Range, being in Wyoming, is east of Honey Lake.

      2. **Lake Worth, Texas** is located in North Texas, near Fort Worth in Tarrant

      Now we analyze their relative positions:


      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Texas is to the east of California.

      - Specifically, Riverside County, CA (Diamond Valley Lake) is west of Tarrant

      - They are part of the Hells Canyon Wilderness, and are situated in west-central
      Idaho.


      **Step 2: Locate Lake Thompson, SD**

      - Lake Thompson is located in eastern South Dakota.

      - It is one of the largest natural lakes in the state and is situated in Kingsbury
      County, SD.


      **Step 3: Determine relative positions**

      - South Dakota is east of Idaho.

      - Specifically, Lake Thompson is in eastern South Dakota, while the Seven Devils
      Mountains are in western Idaho.

      - Therefore, the Seven Devils Mountains are significantly west of Lake Thompson.


      **Conclusion:**

      The Seven Devils Mountains are west of Lake Thompson.

      NV is located east of La Poudre Pass Lake, CO, we need to reason through the
      geographic locations of the two lakes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of La Poudre Pass Lake.

      - La Poudre Pass Lake is located in north-central Colorado, near the Continental
      Divide in the Rocky Mountains.

      - It is situated in the northern part of Rocky Mountain National Park, close
      to the source of the Colorado River.

      - Therefore, La Poudre Pass Lake is in Colorado, relatively far to the east
      compared to Nevada.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Lahontan (reservoir).

      - Lake Lahontan is a reservoir in western Nevada.

      - It is located near the cities of Fallon and Fernley, east of Reno.

      - This places it in the western part of Nevada, which is west of most of Colorado.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Colorado as a whole lies east of Nevada.

      - Since La Poudre Pass Lake is in Colorado and Lake Lahontan is in Nevada, and
      there is no overlap in their longitudinal positions, La Poudre Pass Lake is
      east of Lake Lahontan.

      a mountain range in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. It is part of
      the southern Rockies and lies well to the east of most of California.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: California lies to the west of Colorado. Even northeastern
      California (where Crazy Lake is located) is west of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Crazy Lake is in California and the Sangre de Cristo
      Range is in Colorado, and Colorado is east of California, then Crazy Lake must
      be west of the Sangre de Cristo Range.

      **Step 1: Haggetts Pond, MA**

      - Haggetts Pond is located in Andover, Massachusetts.

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States.

      - The approximate longitude of Haggetts Pond is around **-71.2 degrees**.


      **Step 2: Gun Lake (Michigan), MI**

      - Gun Lake is located in southwestern Michigan, near the border of Allegan and
      Barry counties.

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - The approximate longitude of Gun Lake is around **-85.5 degrees**.


      **Step 3: Compare Longitudes**

      - Longitudes are measured in degrees east or west from the Prime Meridian.

      - The more negative the longitude (in the western hemisphere), the farther west
      the location is.

      - -85.5 (Gun Lake) is west of -71.2 (Haggetts Pond).
