    6492e0c5-1fb5-4875-99d8-fa8522ad3924: 'Let''s break this down to determine the
      answer.


      **Step 1: Locate Lost Lake (Santiam Pass, Linn County, Oregon).**

      *   Oregon is on the West Coast of the United States.

      *   Linn County is in the central western part of Oregon.

      *   Santiam Pass is in the Cascade Mountains, which run north-south through
      Oregon.

      *   Therefore, Lost Lake, Oregon, is located in the western half of the continental
      United States.


      **Step 2: Locate Lake Sharpe, SD.**

      *   SD stands for South Dakota.

      *   South Dakota is a state in the Midwest region of the United States.

      *   Lake Sharpe is a large reservoir on the Missouri River, roughly in the geographic
      center of South Dakota.


      **Step 3: Compare East/West positions.**

      *   Oregon is significantly to the west of South Dakota.

      *   If you draw a vertical line from north to south through the United States,
      Oregon would be on the left (west) side, and South Dakota would be further to
      the right (east).


      **Conclusion:**

      Lost Lake, Oregon, is located *west* of Lake Sharpe, South Dakota.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Lost Lake (Santiam Pass, Linn County,
      Oregon), OR located east of Lake Sharpe, SD?" is:

      \ Idaho is a western state in the US. Its longitude generally ranges from about\
      \ 111\xB0W to 117\xB0W. Stanley, ID is around 115\xB0W.\n    *   Minnesota is\
      \ a midwestern state. Its longitude generally ranges from about 89\xB0W to 97\xB0\
      W. Minneapolis-St. Paul is around 93\xB0W.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since 115\xB0\
      W (Stanley Lake) is a larger negative number (further west) than 93\xB0W (Lake\
      \ Minnetonka), Stanley Lake is located *west* of Lake Minnetonka.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer to \"Is Stanley Lake, ID located east of Lake Minnetonka, MN?\"\

      answer.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations.**


      *   **Lake Lahontan (reservoir), NV:** This is a man-made reservoir in Nevada.
      While the ancient Lake Lahontan covered a vast area, the modern reservoir is
      specifically in west-central Nevada, near Fallon. Its approximate longitude
      is around **119 degrees West**.


      *   **La Poudre Pass Lake, CO:** This is a small natural lake in northern Colorado,
      high in the Rocky Mountains, and is the source of the Cache la Poudre River.
      Its approximate longitude is around **105 degrees West**.


      **Step 2: Compare the longitudes.**


      *   Lake Lahontan (NV) is at approximately 119 degrees West longitude.

      *   La Poudre Pass Lake (CO) is at approximately 105 degrees West longitude.


      **Step 3: Determine "east of".**


      On a map, as you move west, the longitude numbers increase (e.g., 100W, 105W,
      110W). Conversely, as you move east, the longitude numbers decrease.


      Since 105 is a smaller number (further east) than 119, La Poudre Pass Lake (105W)
      is *east* of Lake Lahontan (119W).


      The question asks if Lake Lahontan (NV) is located *east* of La Poudre Pass
      Lake (CO).


      Since Lake Lahontan (119W) is *west* of La Poudre Pass Lake (105W), the answer
      is no.

      *   119.0 degrees West is a larger number than 105.8 degrees West.


      **Step 3: Determine relative position.**


      Since 119.0 degrees West is a larger (more negative) number than 105.8 degrees
