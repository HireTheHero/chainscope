      the populations of Durham County, NC, and Fayette County, KY.


      1. **Determine the population of Durham County, NC:** As of the most recent
      data, Durham County, NC, is known to have a significant urban population, largely
      centered around the city of Durham. The population has been steadily increasing
      over the years due to factors such as economic growth and the presence of major
      educational and research institutions.


      2. **Determine the population of Fayette County, KY:** Fayette County, KY, is
      primarily composed of the city of Lexington, which is the second-largest city
      in Kentucky. The county''s population is also significant and has been experiencing
      growth, though it might not be as rapid or large as some counties in larger
      metropolitan areas.


      3. **Compare the populations:** Recent estimates suggest that Durham County
      has a population that is typically larger than that of Fayette County. This
      can be attributed to Durham''s status as part of the Research Triangle, a major
      urban and economic area in North Carolina, which attracts a large number of
      residents.
