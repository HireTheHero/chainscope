      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\

      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\

      \ zip code 01938, MA\n\n   Both zip codes start with different initial digits\
      \ (\"03\" for New Hampshire and \"01\" for Massachusetts), indicating that they\

      \ of 53406, WI, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how\
      \ they relate to geographic locations.\n\n1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**:\
      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\
      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Breaking Down the Zip Codes**:\n   - **60525**: The first three digits\
      \ \"605\" indicate the regional area, and \"25\" specifies the post office or\
      \ area within that region.\n   - **53406**: Similarly, \"534\" indicates the\
      \ regional area, and \"06\" specifies the post office or area.\n\n3. **Geographic\
      \ Location Based on Zip Codes**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way\
      \ that increases numerically from east to west and north to south within a region,\
      \ but this is not a hard rule and can vary significantly based on the specific\
      \ geography and the history of postal service development in an area.\n\n4.\

      \ Brook, IL.\n   - **53406**: This zip code corresponds to Racine, WI.\n\n5.\
      \ **Determining East/West Location**:\n   - Without specific geographic knowledge\
      \ of these areas, one might assume that because \"25\" is greater than \"06\"\
      , 60525 could be west of 53406 based on the general principle that zip codes\
      \ increase from east to west. However, this principle is not always reliable,\

      \ these states could be an exception to this general rule.\n\n5. **Specific\
      \ zip code locations**:\n   - 45050 corresponds to a location in Ohio.\n   -\
      \ 49233 corresponds to a location in Michigan.\n\n6. **Geographic comparison**:\n\
      \   - Given that Ohio is generally west of Michigan, and considering the specific\
      \ locations within these states, it's unlikely that a location in Ohio would\
      \ be east of a location in Michigan.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the\
      \ general geography of the region and the relative positions of Ohio and Michigan,\
      \ it's highly improbable that 45050, OH is located east of 49233, MI.\n\nGiven\

      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\
      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\

      \ zip code 92108, CA\n\n   Both zip codes start with \"92\", which means they\
      \ are in the same regional area. The difference lies in the last two digits:\
      \ \"07\" for the first zip code and \"08\" for the second.\n\n3. **Geographical\
      \ Implication**: Generally, within a specific regional area (defined by the\

      \ of 24416, VA, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how\
      \ they relate to geographic locations.\n\n1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**:\
      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\
      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Breaking Down the Zip Codes**:\n   - **16214**: The first three digits\
      \ \"162\" indicate the regional area, and \"14\" specifies the post office or\
      \ area within that region.\n   - **24416**: Similarly, \"244\" indicates the\
      \ regional area, and \"16\" specifies the post office or area.\n\n3. **Geographic\
      \ Location Based on Zip Codes**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way\
      \ that increases numerically from east to west and north to south within a region,\
      \ but this is not a hard rule and can vary significantly based on the specific\
      \ geography and the history of postal service development in an area.\n\n4.\
      \ **Specific Locations**:\n   - **16214**: This zip code corresponds to Clarion,\
      \ PA.\n   - **24416**: This zip code corresponds to Deerfield, VA.\n\n5. **Determining\
      \ East/West Location**:\n   - Without specific geographic knowledge of these\
      \ areas, one might assume that because \"162\" is lower than \"244\", 16214\
      \ could be east of 24416 based on the general principle that zip codes increase\
      \ from east to west. However, this principle is not always reliable, especially\
      \ in areas with complex geography or where zip code assignments were made based\
      \ on other factors like postal route efficiency rather than strict geographic\
      \ progression.\n\n6. **Actual Geographic Locations**:\n   - Clarion, PA (16214)\

      \ is located at approximately 38.20\xB0N, 79.41\xB0W.\n\n7. **Comparison**:\n\
      \   - By comparing the longitude (west-east coordinate), Clarion, PA (79.38\xB0\
      W) is east of Deerfield, VA (79.41\xB0W), indicating that 16214 is east of 24416.\n\
      \nGiven the steps above, the answer to whether 16214, PA is located east of\

      \ Implication**: Generally, within a specific regional area (defined by the\

      \ East/West Location**:\n   - Without specific geographic knowledge of these\
      \ areas, one might assume that because \"222\" is greater than \"206\", 22206\
      \ could be east of 20616 based on the general principle that zip codes increase\

      \ of 30331, GA, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how\
      \ they relate to geographic locations.\n\n1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**:\
      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\
      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Breaking Down the Zip Codes**:\n   - **45214**: The first three digits\
      \ \"452\" indicate the regional area, and \"14\" specifies the post office or\
      \ area within that region.\n   - **30331**: The first three digits \"303\" indicate\
      \ the regional area, and \"31\" specifies the post office or area.\n\n3. **Geographic\
      \ Location Based on Zip Codes**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way\
      \ that increases numerically from east to west and north to south within a region,\
      \ but this is not a hard rule and can vary significantly based on the specific\
      \ geography and the history of postal service development in an area.\n\n4.\
      \ **Specific Locations**:\n   - **45214**: This zip code corresponds to Cincinnati,\
      \ OH.\n   - **30331**: This zip code corresponds to Atlanta, GA.\n\n5. **Determining\
      \ East/West Location**:\n   - Without specific geographic knowledge of these\
      \ areas, one might assume that because \"452\" is greater than \"303\", 45214\
      \ could be east of 30331 based on the general principle that zip codes increase\
      \ from east to west. However, this principle is not always reliable, especially\
      \ in areas with complex geography or where zip code assignments were made based\
      \ on other factors like postal route efficiency rather than strict geographic\
      \ progression.\n\n6. **Actual Geographic Locations**:\n   - Cincinnati, OH (45214)\
      \ is located at approximately 39.10\xB0N, 84.51\xB0W.\n   - Atlanta, GA (30331)\
      \ is located at approximately 33.76\xB0N, 84.42\xB0W.\n\n7. **Comparison**:\n\
      \   - By comparing the longitude (west-east coordinate), Cincinnati (84.51\xB0\
      W) is west of Atlanta (84.42\xB0W), indicating that 45214 is actually west of\

      \ OH refers to a different zip code in Ohio.\n\n2. **Determine the general geographic\
      \ locations of the zip codes**:\n   - Without exact coordinates, we can infer\
      \ based on the zip codes. However, knowing that zip codes are generally sequential\
      \ and can give clues about the location within a state, we still need to consider\
      \ their positions relative to each other.\n\n3. **Research or knowledge of specific\
      \ zip codes**:\n   - 44621 corresponds to a location in Ohio.\n   - 44023 corresponds\
      \ to a location in Ohio.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Given that both zip codes\
      \ are in Ohio, we must determine if 44621 is east of 44023.\n\n5. **Geographic\
      \ relation**:\n   - Ohio is a relatively rectangular state in the Midwestern\
      \ United States. Generally, higher zip code numbers are located to the east\
      \ of lower zip code numbers within a state, but this is not a hard and fast\
      \ rule and can vary significantly based on the geography of the state and the\
      \ specific zip code assignments.\n\n6. **Conclusion based on geographic principles**:\n\
      \   - Given that 44621 is a higher number than 44023, and considering the general\
      \ geography of Ohio, it's reasonable to conclude that 44621, OH could be east\
      \ of 44023, OH, depending on their exact locations within the state.\n\nGiven\
      \ the steps and the understanding that zip code assignments can be irregular,\
      \ the answer would be based on the premise that higher zip code numbers are\
      \ generally to the east of lower zip code numbers within a state.\n\nYES"

      \ of 44023, OH, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify\
      \ the locations**: \n   - Both zip codes, 44621 and 44023, are located in Ohio\
      \ (OH).\n\n2. **Understand the structure of zip codes**:\n   - US zip codes\
      \ are 5-digit numbers. The first three digits represent a sectional center facility\
      \ (SCF) or a major city, and the last two digits represent a specific post office\
      \ or delivery area within that SCF or city.\n\n3. **Analyze the given zip codes**:\n\
      \   - 44621: The first three digits \"446\" indicate the SCF or major city.\
      \ The last two digits \"21\" represent a specific post office or delivery area.\n\
      \   - 44023: Similarly, \"440\" indicates the SCF or major city, and \"23\"\
      \ represents a specific post office or delivery area.\n\n4. **Geographical implications\
      \ of zip codes**:\n   - Generally, within a state, lower-numbered zip codes\
      \ are located to the west or south, and higher-numbered ones are to the east\
      \ or north. However, this is not a hard and fast rule and can vary significantly\
      \ based on the specific geography of the area and the history of zip code assignments.\n\
      \n5. **Specific locations within Ohio**:\n   - Without specific knowledge of\
      \ the geography of Ohio and the zip code assignments, we can only make general\
      \ assumptions based on the structure of zip codes.\n\n6. **Comparison based\
      \ on general assumptions**:\n   - Since 44621 has a higher number than 44023,\
      \ it could potentially be located to the east or north, based on the general\
      \ rule of thumb. However, without specific knowledge, this is a general assumption.\n\

      \ a regional area within that group, and the last two digits represent a specific\
      \ post office or area within that region.\n\n3. **Compare the zip codes**: \n\
      \   - Both zip codes start with \"20\", indicating they are in the same general\
      \ region.\n   - The second and third digits are different: \"44\" for 21044\
      \ and \"85\" for 20785.\n\n4. **Consider general principles of zip code assignments**:\
      \ \n   - Zip codes are generally assigned sequentially within a region, but\

      \n5. **Consider the geography of Maryland**: \n   - Maryland is a relatively\
      \ small state with a complex coastline and a mix of urban and rural areas. The\
      \ layout of zip codes can be irregular and not strictly based on east-west progression.\n\
      \n6. **Specific locations of the zip codes**: \n   - Without specific information\
      \ about the exact locations within Maryland, it's difficult to definitively\

      \ of 50023, IA, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how\
      \ they relate to geographic locations.\n\n1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**:\
      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\
      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Breaking Down the Zip Codes**:\n   - **71006**: The first three digits\
      \ \"710\" indicate the regional area, and \"06\" specifies the post office or\
      \ area within that region.\n   - **50023**: Similarly, \"500\" indicates the\
      \ regional area, and \"23\" specifies the post office or area.\n\n3. **Geographic\
      \ Location Based on Zip Codes**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way\
      \ that increases numerically from east to west and north to south within a region,\
      \ but this is not a hard rule and can vary significantly based on the specific\
      \ geography and the history of postal service development in an area.\n\n4.\
      \ **Specific Locations**:\n   - **71006**: This zip code corresponds to Benton,\
      \ LA.\n   - **50023**: This zip code corresponds to Ankeny, IA.\n\n5. **Determining\
      \ East/West Location**:\n   - Without specific geographic knowledge of these\
      \ areas, one might assume that because \"710\" is greater than \"500\", 71006\
      \ could be east of 50023 based on the general principle that zip codes increase\
      \ from east to west. However, this principle is not always reliable, especially\
      \ in areas with complex geography or where zip code assignments were made based\
      \ on other factors like postal route efficiency rather than strict geographic\
      \ progression.\n\n6. **Actual Geographic Locations**:\n   - Benton, LA (71006)\

      \ is located at approximately 41.73\xB0N, 93.60\xB0W.\n\n7. **Comparison**:\n\
      \   - By comparing the longitude (west-east coordinate), Benton, LA (93.74\xB0\
      W) is west of Ankeny, IA (93.60\xB0W), indicating that 71006 is actually west\
      \ of 50023.\n\nGiven the steps above, the answer to whether 71006, LA is located\

      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\
      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Analyzing the Given Zip Codes**: \n   - The zip code 11439, NY\n   - The\
      \ zip code 10583, NY\n\n   Both zip codes start with \"1\", which means they\
      \ are in the same general region. The second and third digits \"143\" and \"\
      583\" indicate specific areas within that region. The last two digits \"39\"\
      \ and \"83\" represent specific post offices or areas within those regions.\n\
      \n3. **Geographical Implication**: Generally, within a specific regional area\
      \ (defined by the first three digits), lower numbered zip codes tend to be located\
      \ west or southwest of higher numbered ones, but this is not a hard and fast\
      \ rule. It can vary significantly depending on the region's layout and how zip\
      \ codes were assigned.\n\n4. **Specific Case Analysis**: Without specific knowledge\
      \ of the layout of zip codes in New York, especially in the regions covered\
      \ by \"114\" and \"105\", one might assume that a lower number could indicate\
      \ a location to the west or southwest. However, zip code assignments can be\
      \ quite irregular and depend on various factors including the geography of the\

      \ how zip codes relate to locations.\n\n1. **Identify the states**: \n   - 43938\
      \ is in Ohio (OH), which is in the Midwest region of the United States.\n  \
      \ - 28081 is in North Carolina (NC), which is in the Southeast region of the\
      \ United States.\n\n2. **Determine the general geographic locations of the states**:\n\
      \   - Ohio is generally located to the north and west of North Carolina.\n\n\
      3. **Specific locations within the states**:\n   - Without exact coordinates,\
      \ we can infer based on the zip codes. However, knowing that zip codes are generally\
      \ sequential and can give clues about the location within a state, we still\
      \ need to consider their positions relative to each other.\n\n4. **Research\
      \ or knowledge of specific zip codes**:\n   - 43938 corresponds to a location\
      \ in Ohio.\n   - 28081 corresponds to a location in North Carolina.\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n\
      \   - Given that Ohio is generally north and west of North Carolina, and considering\
      \ the specific locations within each state, we must determine if 43938, OH is\
      \ east of 28081, NC.\n\n6. **Geographic relation**:\n   - Ohio, being to the\
      \ north and west of North Carolina, cannot be east of any location in North\
      \ Carolina. However, \"east\" in this context might be somewhat flexible due\
      \ to the nature of geographic comparisons.\n\n7. **Conclusion based on geographic\
      \ principles**:\n   - Given that 43938 is in Ohio and 28081 is in North Carolina,\
      \ and considering the general geography of the region, it's reasonable to conclude\
      \ that 43938, OH cannot be east of 28081, NC.\n\nGiven the steps and the understanding\
      \ that \"east\" in this context might be somewhat flexible due to the nature\
      \ of geographic comparisons, the answer would be based on the premise that Ohio\
      \ is generally north and west of North Carolina, and thus cannot be considered\

      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\
      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\

      \ knowledge of these areas, one might assume that because \"81\" is greater\
      \ than \"38\", 28081 could be east of 43938 based on the general principle that\

      \ of 91701, CA, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how\
      \ they relate to geographical locations.\n\n1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**:\
      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\
      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Breaking Down the Zip Codes**:\n   - **91764**: The first three digits\
      \ \"917\" indicate the regional area, and \"64\" specifies the post office or\
      \ area within that region.\n   - **91701**: Similarly, \"917\" indicates the\
      \ regional area, and \"01\" specifies the post office or area.\n\n3. **Geographic\
      \ Location Based on Zip Codes**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way\
      \ that increases numerically from east to west and north to south within a region,\
      \ but this is not a hard rule and can vary significantly based on the specific\
      \ geography and the history of postal service development in an area.\n\n4.\
      \ **Specific Locations**:\n   - **91764**: This zip code corresponds to Diamond\
      \ Bar, CA.\n   - **91701**: This zip code corresponds to Rancho Cucamonga, CA.\n\
      \n5. **Determining East/West Location**:\n   - Without specific geographic knowledge\
      \ of these areas, one might assume that because \"64\" is greater than \"01\"\
      , 91764 could be east of 91701 based on the general principle that zip codes\
      \ increase from east to west. However, this principle is not always reliable,\

      \ Rancho Cucamonga, CA (91701) is located at approximately 34.11\xB0N, 117.58\xB0\
      W.\n\n7. **Comparison**:\n   - By comparing the longitude (west-east coordinate),\
      \ Diamond Bar (117.81\xB0W) is west of Rancho Cucamonga (117.58\xB0W), indicating\
      \ that 91764 is actually west of 91701.\n\nGiven the steps above, the answer\

      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\

      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Breaking Down the Zip Codes**:\n   - **89509**: The first three digits\
      \ \"895\" indicate the regional area, and \"09\" specifies the post office or\
      \ area within that region.\n   - **89506**: Similarly, \"895\" indicates the\
      \ regional area, and \"06\" specifies the post office or area.\n\n3. **Geographic\
      \ Location Based on Zip Codes**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way\

      \ East/West Location**:\n   - Without specific geographic knowledge of these\
      \ areas, one might assume that because \"09\" is greater than \"06\", 89509\
      \ could be west of 89506 based on the general principle that zip codes increase\

      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Breaking Down the Zip Codes**:\n   - **53705**: The first three digits\

      \ \n   - 11510, NY refers to a zip code in New York State.\n   - 12123, NY also\
      \ refers to a zip code in New York State.\n\n2. **Understand the structure of\
      \ US zip codes**: US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first three digits represent\
      \ a specific section of the country, while the last two digits represent a more\
      \ precise location within that section.\n\n3. **Analyze the zip codes**: Both\
      \ zip codes have the same first three digits (121), which means they are in\
      \ the same general region. The difference lies in the last two digits: \"10\"\
      \ for the first zip code and \"23\" for the second.\n\n4. **Geographical implication**:\
      \ Generally, within a specific region (defined by the first three digits), lower\
      \ numbered zip codes tend to be located west or southwest of higher numbered\
      \ ones, but this is not a hard and fast rule. It can vary significantly depending\
      \ on the region's layout and how zip codes were assigned.\n\n5. **Specific case\
      \ analysis**: Without specific knowledge of the layout of zip codes in New York\
      \ State, especially in the region covered by \"121\", one might assume that\
      \ a lower number could indicate a location to the west or southwest. However,\
      \ zip code assignments can be quite irregular and depend on various factors\
      \ including the geography of the area, the location of post offices, and the\
      \ historical development of the region.\n\n6. **Conclusion based on general\
      \ knowledge**: Given the general tendency but also the irregularity of zip code\
      \ assignments, it's difficult to make a definitive statement without specific\
      \ knowledge of the \"121\" region in New York State. However, if we were to\
      \ follow a general assumption that higher numbers might be more eastward or\
      \ northeastward within the same regional prefix, then 12123 could potentially\
      \ be east of 11510.\n\nGiven these considerations and without specific geographical\
      \ data on these zip codes, the most informed answer based on general principles\
      \ would be speculative. However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO\

      \ area within that region.\n   - **07924**: Similarly, \"079\" indicates the\
      \ regional area, and \"24\" specifies the post office or area.\n\n3. **Geographic\
      \ Location Based on Zip Codes**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way\
      \ that increases numerically from east to west and north to south within a region,\
      \ but this is not a hard rule and can vary significantly based on the specific\
      \ geography and the history of postal service development in an area.\n\n4.\
      \ **Specific Locations**:\n   - **08562**: This zip code corresponds to Perrineville,\
      \ NJ.\n   - **07924**: This zip code corresponds to Bernardsville, NJ.\n\n5.\
      \ **Determining East/West Location**:\n   - Without specific geographic knowledge\
      \ of these areas, one might assume that because \"62\" is greater than \"24\"\
      , 08562 could be west of 07924 based on the general principle that zip codes\
      \ increase from east to west. However, this principle is not always reliable,\
      \ especially in areas with complex geography or where zip code assignments were\
      \ made based on other factors like postal route efficiency rather than strict\
      \ geographic progression.\n\n6. **Actual Geographic Locations**:\n   - Perrineville,\
      \ NJ (08562) is located at approximately 40.24\xB0N, 74.46\xB0W.\n   - Bernardsville,\
      \ NJ (07924) is located at approximately 40.72\xB0N, 74.58\xB0W.\n\n7. **Comparison**:\n\
      \   - By comparing the longitude (west-east coordinate), Bernardsville (74.58\xB0\
      W) is west of Perrineville (74.46\xB0W), indicating that 08562 is actually east\
      \ of 07924.\n\nGiven the steps above, the answer to whether 08562, NJ is located\
      \ east of 07924, NJ is: **YES**"
    a88f644e-53be-48a6-b22a-707dd9b3ca18: "To determine if 08562, NJ is located east\
      \ of 07924, NJ, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how\
      \ they relate to geographic locations.\n\n1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**:\
      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\
      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Analyzing the Given Zip Codes**: \n   - The zip code 08562, NJ\n   - The\
      \ zip code 07924, NJ\n\n   Both zip codes start with \"08\", which means they\
      \ are in the same regional area. The difference lies in the next two digits:\
      \ \"56\" for the first zip code and \"24\" for the second.\n\n3. **Geographical\
      \ Implication**: Generally, within a specific regional area (defined by the\
      \ first three digits), lower numbered zip codes tend to be located west or southwest\
      \ of higher numbered ones, but this is not a hard and fast rule. It can vary\
      \ significantly depending on the region's layout and how zip codes were assigned.\n\
      \n4. **Specific Case Analysis**: Without specific knowledge of the layout of\
      \ zip codes in New Jersey, especially in the region covered by \"085\", one\
      \ might assume that a higher number could indicate a location to the east or\
      \ northeast. However, zip code assignments can be quite irregular and depend\
      \ on various factors including the geography of the area, the location of post\
      \ offices, and the historical development of the region.\n\n5. **Conclusion\
      \ Based on General Knowledge**: Given the general tendency but also the irregularity\
      \ of zip code assignments, it's difficult to make a definitive statement without\
      \ specific knowledge of the \"085\" region in New Jersey. However, if we were\
      \ to follow a general assumption that higher numbers might be more eastward\
      \ or northeastward within the same regional prefix, then 08562 could potentially\
      \ be east of 07924.\n\nGiven these considerations and without specific geographical\
      \ data on these zip codes, the most informed answer based on general principles\
      \ would be speculative. However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO\
      \ as requested:\n\nYES"

      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Analyzing the Given Zip Codes**: \n   - The zip code 35116, AL\n   - The\
      \ zip code 47905, IN\n\n   Both zip codes start with \"3\", which means they\
      \ are in the same general region (in this case, the eastern United States).\
      \ The difference lies in the next two digits: \"51\" for the first zip code\
      \ and \"79\" for the second.\n\n3. **Geographical Implication**: Generally,\
      \ within a specific region (defined by the first three digits), lower numbered\
      \ zip codes tend to be located west or southwest of higher numbered ones, but\
      \ this is not a hard and fast rule. It can vary significantly depending on the\

      \ Without specific knowledge of the layout of zip codes in Alabama and Indiana,\

      \ can be quite irregular and depend on various factors including the geography\
      \ of the area, the location of post offices, and the historical development\
      \ of the region.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on General Knowledge**: Given the\
      \ general tendency but also the irregularity of zip code assignments, it's difficult\

      \ of 55902, MN, we need to understand the structure of US zip codes and how\
      \ they relate to geographical locations.\n\n1. **Understanding Zip Code Structure**:\
      \ US zip codes are 5-digit numbers. The first digit represents a group of states,\
      \ the next two digits represent a regional area within that group, and the last\
      \ two digits represent a specific post office or area within that region.\n\n\
      2. **Breaking Down the Zip Codes**:\n   - **54017**: The first three digits\
      \ \"540\" indicate the regional area, and \"17\" specifies the post office or\
      \ area within that region.\n   - **55902**: Similarly, \"559\" indicates the\
      \ regional area, and \"02\" specifies the post office or area.\n\n3. **Geographic\
      \ Location Based on Zip Codes**: Generally, zip codes are assigned in a way\
      \ that increases numerically from east to west and north to south within a region,\
      \ but this is not a hard rule and can vary significantly based on the specific\
      \ geography and the history of postal service development in an area.\n\n4.\

      \ Richmond, WI.\n   - **55902**: This zip code corresponds to Rochester, MN.\n\
      \n5. **Determining East/West Location**:\n   - Without specific geographic knowledge\
      \ of these areas, one might assume that because \"17\" is greater than \"02\"\
      , 54017 could be east of 55902 based on the general principle that zip codes\
      \ increase from east to west. However, this principle is not always reliable,\
      \ especially in areas with complex geography or where zip code assignments were\
      \ made based on other factors like postal route efficiency rather than strict\
      \ geographic progression.\n\n6. **Actual Geographic Locations**:\n   - New Richmond,\

      \ MN (55902) is located at approximately 44.02\xB0N, 92.47\xB0W.\n\n7. **Comparison**:\n\
      \   - By comparing the longitude (west-east coordinate), New Richmond (92.54\xB0\
      W) is west of Rochester (92.47\xB0W), indicating that 54017 is actually west\
