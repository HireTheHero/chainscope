      (NH) is north of Massachusetts (MA).

      2. **Consider east-west within the context of their relative positions:**  Since
      NH is north of MA, a location in NH would need to be significantly east of a
      location in MA to be considered directly "east."  Being just a bit east wouldn''t
      be enough, as it would still be primarily north.

      3. **General knowledge/lookup (if needed):** A quick look at a map confirms
      that the eastern border of NH is nearly directly north of the northeastern part
      of MA.


      Therefore, a zip code in NH is highly unlikely to be east of a zip code in MA
      unless it''s very far east in NH and the MA zip code is very far west.  Without
      looking up the specific locations of these zip codes, it''s reasonable to assume
      the NH zip code is probably north, or slightly northeast, but not significantly
      east, of the MA zip code.

      the eastern portion of Oregon extends slightly east of the westernmost parts
      of Washington.  Therefore, simply knowing that one zip code is in Oregon and
      the other is in Washington doesn''t automatically tell us which is further east.
      We need more specific location information.

      4. **Zip Code Lookup (Optional, but helpful):** A quick search shows 97459 is
      in Oakridge, Oregon, and 98569 is in McCleary, Washington.

      5. **Map Visualization/Geographic Knowledge:** Oakridge, Oregon is east of McCleary,
      Washington.

      is a small section where Oregon''s border is slightly east of a sliver of southern
      Washington, generally, Oregon is west of Washington.


      3. **Impact of Latitude on East/West Determination:** Since Oregon is mostly
      west of Washington, a location in Oregon will almost certainly be west of a
      location in Washington.  Minor differences in latitude within each state won''t
      change this overall west-east relationship.

      be considered "east" of it.  Simply being slightly east geographically might
      not be sufficient given the primary north/south relationship.

      4. **Zip Code Proximity:** Zip codes close to state borders can sometimes be
      misleading in terms of relative east/west positions due to the irregular shape
      of state lines.


      While a precise longitudinal comparison would be needed for definitive proof,
      Oregon is generally west of Washington. Therefore, it''s highly unlikely a zip
      code in Oregon would be east of one in Washington.

      small parts of Missouri might dip slightly west at the southern border.  We
      need to be sure 65616 isn''t one of those edge cases.  A quick online zip code
      lookup confirms 65616 is in Branson, MO, and 71964 is in Umpire, AR. Branson
      is indeed considerably east of Umpire.

      Carolina.  South Carolina''s eastern coastline runs roughly north-south.

      3. **Consider east-west orientation:**  Since South Carolina is north of Florida,
      a location in SC would need to be significantly *west* of a location in FL for
      it *not* to be east.  While Florida extends further west than South Carolina''s

      2. **Recall US geography:** Virginia is generally south of Pennsylvania.  However,
      the western portion of Virginia extends further west than the western portion
      of Pennsylvania.


      3. **Determine relative east/west positions**: We need to consider the specific
      locations within each state.  Since Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, and the
      question asks if the VA zip code is *east* of the PA zip code, we need to determine
      if 24151 is far enough east to be east of 15104, despite being further south.  A
      quick look at a map shows that western VA extends significantly westward of
      western PA.

      15104, PA.

      2. **General US Geography:** Virginia is generally south of Pennsylvania.  However,

      3. **East vs. West is the key:** The question asks about East vs. West, not
      North vs. South.

      4. **Visualize or look at a map:** Picture the US map.  Pennsylvania is more
      inland/west than the eastern part of Virginia.  Therefore, even if a Virginia
      zip code is south of a Pennsylvania one, it could still be east.

      5. **Confirm with a map (optional but recommended for accuracy):** Checking
      a map confirms that zip code 24151 in Virginia is east of zip code 15104 in
      Pennsylvania.

      3. **East vs. West:**  Since Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, a location in
      Virginia would need to be significantly east *and* south to be east of a location
      in Pennsylvania.  Just being a little east isn''t enough if it''s significantly
      south.

      4. **Consider longitude:**  Longitude determines east/west position.  We''d
      need to check the longitude of both zip codes to be sure, but given the general
      geography, it''s highly unlikely a Virginia zip code would be east of a Pennsylvania
      zip code.

      code in PA.

      2. **Interpret the question:** "East of" relates to longitude.  A location further
      east will have a higher longitude value.


      3. **Find the longitude of each zip code:**  This requires an external resource
      (a zip code lookup).  08863 corresponds to South Bound Brook, NJ. 07068 corresponds
      to Scotch Plains, NJ.  South Bound Brook is west of Scotch Plains.


      4. **Compare longitudes:** Since South Bound Brook is west of Scotch Plains,
      08863 has a lower longitude than 07068.

      CT, and the NY zip code is further east in NY than the CT zip code is in CT,
      11976, NY *must* be east of 06415, CT.

      in western MA.

      3. **Zip code specifics:** 06051 is in Newington, CT, which is in central Connecticut.
      01085 is in Westfield, MA, which is in western Massachusetts.


      Therefore, Newington, CT is likely west of Westfield, MA.

      (CT) is further east than 01085 (MA), even though CT is south of MA.
