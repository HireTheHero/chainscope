      - Ohio zip codes generally start with 44

      - The next two digits typically indicate the region within Ohio


      2. For 44621:

      - First 3 digits (446) suggest it''s in northeastern Ohio

      - Likely located near Columbiana County or eastern part of the state


      3. For 44023:

      - First 3 digits (440) suggest it''s in northeastern Ohio

      4. Comparing their locations:

      - 44621 has a higher last two digits (21 vs 23)

      - In Ohio, this often correlates with being further east

      1. First, let''s look at the first part of the zip codes: 483 for the first
      zip code, and 482 for the second zip code.


      2. In Michigan, zip codes starting with 483 are generally located in the western
      part of the state (around Oakland County), while zip codes starting with 482
      are located in the eastern part of the state (around Wayne County, which includes
      Detroit).


      3. Since 483 is west of 482, this means the first zip code (48316) is located
      west of the second zip code (48212).


      4. The question asks if 48316 is east of 48212.


      5. Since 48316 is west of 48212, the answer is the opposite of what the question
      asks.

    97b1d2f5-2bc8-48e5-a0c0-c2e560fa1c16: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s look at the structure of NJ zip codes:

      - NJ zip codes generally start with 07 or 08

      - The first three digits often indicate a general region within NJ


      2. Let''s compare the first three digits:

      - 08562 starts with 085

      - 07924 starts with 079


      3. In NJ, zip codes with lower first three digits are typically located more
      to the west

      - 079xx would be in the western part of NJ

      - 085xx would be in the eastern part of NJ


      4. Since 08562 has a higher first three digits than 07924, it is located more
      to the east


      5. Therefore, 08562 is located east of 07924


      Answer: YES'

      Jersey.


      2. In New Jersey, zip codes generally increase from south to north and from
