      - Both cities are on the Pacific coast

      - North Bend, OR is south of Long Beach, WA

      - Since they''re both coastal cities, North Bend is NOT east of Long Beach

      1) 97459 is in Oregon (OR)

      2) 98569 is in Washington (WA)


      3) In the US zip code system:

      - First digit represents a certain geographical region

      - 9 represents the west coast region

      - For west coast states, the second digit generally increases from south to
      north


      4) Looking at the second digits:

      - 97459 (Oregon) starts with 97

      - 98569 (Washington) starts with 98

      - Since 7 < 8, and Oregon is indeed south of Washington


      5) When two locations are on the west coast, and one is north of the other:

      - The western location would be the northern one (Washington)

      - The eastern location would be the southern one (Oregon)

      - 58601 is in North Dakota (ND)

      - 79360 is in Texas (TX)


      2) In the US ZIP code system:

      - First digit indicates a certain geographical region

      - 7xxxx (like 79360) covers TX and parts of surrounding states


      3) Looking at a US map:

      - North Dakota is located in the northern part of the country

      - Texas is located in the southern part

      1) First, let me locate these zip codes:

      - 46761 is in Indiana (IN)

      - 40071 is in Kentucky (KY)


      2) In terms of US geography:

      - Indiana is directly north of Kentucky

      - The border between IN and KY runs east-west

      - Neither state is particularly wide east-to-west


      3) Looking at the zip code patterns:

      - 467xx zip codes are in north-central Indiana

      - 400xx zip codes are in north-central Kentucky


      4) Therefore:

      - These zip codes are roughly in the same vertical band

      - One is simply north of the other

      - They are not significantly offset east or west from each other


      NO'

      2) Looking at the general structure of US zip codes:

      - First digit 4 in both cases indicates they are in the same general region

      - 467xx is in Indiana

      - 400xx is in Kentucky


      3) Geographically:

      - Indiana is located directly north of Kentucky

      - These zip codes are in different states, so their east/west relationship depends
      on their specific locations within their states


      4) More specifically:

      - 46xxx zip codes are in central/northern Indiana

      - 40xxx zip codes are in northern Kentucky


      5) Looking at the specific locations:

      - 46761 is in north-central Indiana

      - 40071 is in north-central Kentucky


      Since these zip codes are both in roughly the same vertical corridor of their
      respective states, and Indiana and Kentucky are stacked north-south, neither
      location is significantly east or west of the other.


      NO - 46761, IN is not located east of 40071, KY. They are roughly in the same

      - 39047 is in Pearl River, Mississippi


      2) Looking at their relative positions:

      - New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana

      3) Comparing their positions:

      - While both are in the southeastern region, Pearl River, MS (39047) is actually
      located northwest of New Orleans East (70128)

      - Lexington, NC is located in the central part of North Carolina, inland


      3) When comparing east-west positions:

      - Miami (33168) is very close to the Atlantic coast

      - Lexington (27292) is several hundred miles inland from the Atlantic


      4) Therefore, since Miami is right on the Atlantic coast and Lexington is inland,
      33168 is clearly east of 27292.
