    d3b9ea49-a392-4ce9-867c-0f21562531e3: 'Let''s break this down step by step:


      1. **Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator** was a Pharaoh of Egypt and co-ruler with
      his sister, Cleopatra VII. He died in **47 BCE** during the conflicts surrounding
      Julius Caesar and Cleopatra.


      2. **Mithridates I of the Bosporus** was a ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom. His
      reign is typically dated to around **120s BCE to 63 BCE**, and he died in **63
      BCE**, likely executed by Pompey the Great after being deposed.


      Now, comparing their death years:


      - **Ptolemy XIII died in 47 BCE**.

      - **Mithridates I of the Bosporus died in 63 BCE**.


      Since 47 BCE is later than 63 BCE, the answer is:
