      1. First, I''ll identify who Zhang Qian was:

      - Zhang Qian was a Chinese diplomat and explorer who lived during the Han Dynasty

      - He lived from around 195 BC to 114 BC


      2. Next, I''ll identify who Marcia was:

      - Marcia was a Roman woman who lived during the late Roman Republic period

      - She was a companion of Julius Caesar

      - She lived around the late 1st century BC (around 50-40 BC)


      3. Comparing their lifetimes:

      - Zhang Qian: 195 BC to 114 BC

      - Marcia: around 50-40 BC


      4. Analyzing their time periods:

      - Zhang Qian died earlier (114 BC) than Marcia''s lifetime (around 50-40 BC)


      5. Answering the specific question: "Did Zhang Qian die later than Marcia?"

      - No, Zhang Qian did not die later than Marcia

      Song Dynasty period, I can compare their lifespans.


      5. Without precise birth and death dates, I''ll rely on the general time periods.


      6. The fact that Al-Khazini lived around 1121 AD and Zhang Jun lived during
      the Song Dynasty (which extends beyond 1121 AD) suggests Zhang Jun likely lived
      later.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Zhang Jun died later than Al-Khazini.'

      1. First, I need to identify who Zoe and Osroes I are:

      - Zoe was likely a Byzantine empress

      - Osroes I was a Parthian king


      2. I''ll check their approximate time periods:

      - Osroes I ruled the Parthian Empire from around 109 to 129 AD

      - Zoe (assuming the Byzantine empress) lived from around 978 to 1050 AD


      3. Comparing their lifetimes:

      - Osroes I died around 129 AD

      - Zoe died around 1050 AD


      4. Calculating the chronological order:

      - Zoe lived and died MUCH later than Osroes I

      - Zoe''s lifetime is almost 900 years after Osroes I''s lifetime


      5. Therefore, Zoe definitely died later than Osroes I.

      \u5DDD\u771F\u5B88 was alive.\n\n4. Therefore, \u77F3\u5DDD\u771F\u5B88 would\
