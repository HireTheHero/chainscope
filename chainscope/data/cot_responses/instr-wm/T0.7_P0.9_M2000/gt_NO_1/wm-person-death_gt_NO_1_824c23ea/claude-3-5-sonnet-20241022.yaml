      - Bilal ibn Ribah died in 640 CE (20 AH) in Damascus


      2. Looking at the years:

      - 641 CE comes after 640 CE

      - Both deaths occurred in 20 AH, but the CE dates help us determine the sequence


      3. Since Zaynab bint Jahsh died in 641 CE and Bilal died in 640 CE, she died
      after him.


      Therefore, YES, Zaynab bint Jahsh did die later than Bilal ibn Ribah.'

      - If Bilal died in 642 CE, then Zaynab (641 CE) died earlier

      \ I need to identify who these people are and when they died:\n\n2) \u77F3\u5DDD\
      \u771F\u5B88 (Ishikawa Mamoru) was a Japanese samurai who died in 1330.\n\n\
      3) Dong Jin (\u6771\u6649/Eastern Jin) refers to either:\n   - The Eastern Jin\
      \ dynasty (317-420 CE)\n   - If it's meant as a person, there could be multiple\
      \ historical figures with this name\n\n4) Even if we take the latest possible\
      \ date associated with Dong Jin (the end of Eastern Jin dynasty in 420 CE),\
      \ this is much earlier than 1330 CE when Ishikawa Mamoru died.\n\n5) Therefore,\
      \ \u77F3\u5DDD\u771F\u5B88 (1330) died later than any reasonable interpretation\
      \ of Dong Jin (no later than 420).\n\nAnswer: YES"

      \ let me identify when these people lived and died:\n\n2) \u77F3\u5DDD\u771F\
      \u5B88 (Ishikawa Mamoru) was a Japanese samurai who lived 1893-1940\n\n3) Dong\
      \ Jin (\u6771\u6649/\u4E1C\u664B) was a Chinese dynasty that existed from 317-420\

      \ in 1940\n- Dong Jin ended in 420 CE\n\n5) 1940 CE is much later than 420 CE\n\
      \nTherefore: YES"
