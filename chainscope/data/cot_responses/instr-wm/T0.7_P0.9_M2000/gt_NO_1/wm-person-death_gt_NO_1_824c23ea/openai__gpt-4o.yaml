      Zhong died around 645 BC.


      2. **Arion**: He was a Greek poet and musician, traditionally dated to the 7th

      ruled Corinth from approximately 627 to 585 BC. This implies that Arion likely
      lived and possibly died around this time.


      Considering these timelines:

      late 7th or early 6th century BC.

      traditionally associated with the court of Periander, the tyrant of Corinth,

    ce5ac7ff-de5d-4be1-81fa-70b01f1b68b0: 'To determine whether Arion died later than
      Guan Zhong, we need to establish the approximate dates for both individuals.


      1. **Arion**: Arion was a legendary Greek poet and musician, often associated
      with the 7th century BCE. There is no exact date for his death, as he is more
      of a semi-mythical figure, but he would have lived around this time period.


      2. **Guan Zhong**: Guan Zhong was a Chinese philosopher and politician who lived
      during the Spring and Autumn period. He died in 645 BCE.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - Arion, being associated with the 7th century BCE, would have lived around
      the same time as Guan Zhong. However, there is no specific record of Arion''s
      death.

      - Guan Zhong''s death is recorded as 645 BCE.


      Given the lack of specific information on Arion''s death and the historical
      placement of both figures in the 7th century BCE, it''s reasonable to conclude
      that Guan Zhong''s recorded death date provides a clearer point of reference.


      Based on the available historical data, the answer is:


      NO, Arion did not die later than Guan Zhong.'
    e6468fa9-345c-45f2-9844-7046a355be3b: 'To determine whether Arion died later than
      Guan Zhong, we need to establish the approximate time periods during which each
      of these historical figures lived and died.


      1. **Arion**: Arion is a semi-legendary figure from ancient Greece, often associated
      with the 7th century BCE. He was a poet and musician from Methymna on the island
      of Lesbos. While specific dates of his life and death are not well-documented,
      he is typically placed around this time due to his association with Periander,
      the tyrant of Corinth, who ruled from approximately 627 to 587 BCE.


      2. **Guan Zhong**: Guan Zhong (also known as Guan Yiwu) was a prominent Chinese
      statesman and philosopher who lived during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese
      history. He served as the chancellor under Duke Huan of Qi. Guan Zhong is generally
      believed to have died in 645 BCE.


      Comparing the two:

      - Arion is associated with the 7th century BCE, likely overlapping with the
      time of Periander''s rule.

      - Guan Zhong died in 645 BCE.


      Given these timeframes, it is more plausible that Arion lived and possibly died
      later than Guan Zhong, but since the exact death date of Arion is not well-documented,
      this is an estimation based on available historical context.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Arion died later than Guan Zhong is:


      YES.'
    ecf51179-6a9c-4802-a1ee-0425ac6328d8: 'To determine whether Arion died later than
      Guan Zhong, we need to look at the historical timelines of both figures.


      1. **Arion**: Arion was an ancient Greek poet and musician, who is often associated
      with the 7th century BC. However, specific details about his life, including
      his birth and death years, are not well-documented. He is best known for the
      legend involving a dolphin saving him, which does not provide concrete chronological
      information.


      2. **Guan Zhong**: Guan Zhong was a prominent Chinese political figure and reformer
      who served as the chancellor during the Spring and Autumn period in China. He
      was born around 725 BC and died in 645 BC.


      Given the lack of specific death information for Arion but understanding that
      he was active in the 7th century BC, it is reasonable to assume that he lived
      around the same time period as Guan Zhong. However, without exact dates, it
      is challenging to definitively state who died later.


      Considering that Guan Zhong''s death is recorded as 645 BC and assuming Arion
      was active around the same century, without specific evidence of Arion''s lifespan
      extending beyond this period, it is generally more likely that Arion did not
      outlive Guan Zhong.


      Therefore, based on available historical information, the answer is:


      NO'

      1. **Arion**: Arion was a legendary Greek poet and musician, often associated

      served as a chancellor during the Spring and Autumn period. He is believed to
      have died in 645 BCE.


      With this information, we compare the two:


      - Arion is associated with the 7th century BCE, which could mean he lived around
      the same time or possibly later within that century.

      - Guan Zhong''s death is more precisely dated to 645 BCE.


      Considering these points, we can''t definitively state the exact death date
      for Arion, but it is likely he lived and died slightly later than Guan Zhong
      given the general timeline.


      Thus, the answer to the question "Did Arion die later than Guan Zhong?" is likely
      **YES**.'

      from 141 BC to 87 BC. Consort Zhou is believed to have died during this period,
      likely before Emperor Wu''s death in 87 BC.


      2. **Saint Gordianus**: Saint Gordianus was a Christian martyr who died during
      the reign of Emperor Julian the Apostate. Julian reigned from 361 AD to 363
      AD. Gordianus is traditionally said to have been martyred around 362 AD.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - Consort Zhou died before 87 BC.

      - Saint Gordianus died around 362 AD.


      Therefore, Saint Gordianus died later than Consort Zhou.

      died later than Alemanno Adimari, we need to establish the death dates for both
      historical figures.


      1. **Ulrich V. von Neuhaus:** There is limited information readily available
      about Ulrich V. von Neuhaus, but he was a Bohemian nobleman who lived during
      the late Middle Ages. He is not a widely known historical figure, so specific
      dates associated with his life, including his death, are not easily accessible
      in common historical resources.


      2. **Alemanno Adimari:** Alemanno Adimari was an Italian philosopher and theologian
      who lived during the Renaissance period. He died in 1422.


      Given the known death date of Alemanno Adimari (1422) and the lack of detailed
      information about Ulrich V. von Neuhaus, it''s challenging to definitively compare
      their death dates without further specific historical data on Ulrich V. von
      Neuhaus''s death. However, based on the time period Ulrich V. von Neuhaus is
      associated with, it is likely he lived around a similar time frame.


      Without precise information on Ulrich V. von Neuhaus''s death date, a definitive
      comparison cannot be made. However, in the absence of specific data indicating
      that Ulrich V. von Neuhaus lived past 1422, the default assumption would be
      that he did not die later than Alemanno Adimari.

      for both historical figures.


      1. **Tommaso degli Stefani**: He was an Italian painter from the 13th century.
      Historical records indicate that he died around the year 1310.


      2. **Alboino I della Scala**: He was a member of the Scaliger family and the
