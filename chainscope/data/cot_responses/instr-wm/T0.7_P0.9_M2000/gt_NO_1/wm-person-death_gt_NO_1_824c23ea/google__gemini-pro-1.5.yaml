      referred to as Wang Xu, Wang Chan, or Gu Shao), was an ancient Chinese philosopher
      and strategist.  It is important to distinguish between Guiguzi (the book attributed
      to him) and the historical figure himself, for whom information is scarce.


      * **Step 2: Establish approximate lifespans.** Qin Shi Huang lived from approximately
      259 BCE to 210 BCE.  Guiguzi''s dates are uncertain, but he is generally placed
      in the Warring States period (475-221 BCE), likely before the unification of
      China by Qin Shi Huang.


      * **Step 3: Compare the death dates.**  Qin Shi Huang died in 210 BCE. Guiguzi
      likely died sometime before 221 BCE.


      * **Step 4: Answer the question.**  Since Qin Shi Huang (Ying Zheng/Ying Chang)
      died *after* Guiguzi (potentially known as Gu Shao), the answer is YES.

      Ying Zheng, better known as Qin Shi Huang, was the first emperor of a unified
      China.  Gu Shao was a strategist and advisor during the late Eastern Han Dynasty.


      * **Step 2: Establish their timelines.** Qin Shi Huang lived from 259 BCE to
      210 BCE. Gu Shao lived from 150 CE to 218 CE.


      * **Step 3: Compare their death dates.** Qin Shi Huang died in 210 BCE, and
      Gu Shao died in 218 CE.


      * **Step 4: Determine who died later.** Since 218 CE is after 210 BCE, Gu Shao
      died later.

      Tommaso degli Stefani died in 1373.  Alboino I della Scala died in 1311.


      Since 1373 is later than 1311, Tommaso degli Stefani died later.
