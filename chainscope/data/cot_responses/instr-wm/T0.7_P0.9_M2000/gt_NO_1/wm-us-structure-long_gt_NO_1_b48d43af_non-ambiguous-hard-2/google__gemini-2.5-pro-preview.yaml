      2.  **Identify Location 2:** California Theatre is in San Bernardino, California
      (CA).

      3.  **Determine the relative geography:** Oregon is a state located north of

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to compare the locations of Lake Mohawk,
      Ohio (OH) and Watson Pond, Massachusetts (MA).

      2.  **Determine the states:** Lake Mohawk is in Ohio. Watson Pond is in Massachusetts.

      3.  **Compare the states'' relative positions:** Consider the map of the United
      States. Ohio is a state in the Midwest. Massachusetts is a state in New England,
      on the East Coast.

      4.  **Establish East/West relationship:** Geographically, Ohio is located significantly
      west of Massachusetts.

      5.  **Apply to the specific locations:** Since Ohio is west of Massachusetts,
      any location within Ohio (like Lake Mohawk) will be west of any location within
      Massachusetts (like Watson Pond).

      6.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Lake Mohawk, OH is *east*

      5.  **Compare East/West:** Since Arkansas is west of Georgia, Nimrod Lake (in
      Arkansas) must be west of Savannah (in Georgia).

      6.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Nimrod Lake is *east* of Savannah.
      Based on our reasoning, it is west.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      east of Pennsylvania. Therefore, Moore Dam in New Hampshire is east of Allegheny
      Reservoir in Pennsylvania.

      4.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks if Allegheny Reservoir,
      PA is *east* of Moore Dam, NH. Since Allegheny Reservoir is in western Pennsylvania
      and Moore Dam is in New Hampshire (which is east of Pennsylvania), Allegheny
      Reservoir is *west* of Moore Dam.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      **NO**'
