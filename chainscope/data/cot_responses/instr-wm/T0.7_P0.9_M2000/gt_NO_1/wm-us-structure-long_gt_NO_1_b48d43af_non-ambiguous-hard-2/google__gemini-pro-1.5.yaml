      2. West Point Jewish Chapel is in West Point, New York. New York is also on

      4. Miami Beach is significantly south of West Point.  However, the East Coast

      in a significant way compared to the distance north.

    e6eb2848-468a-4715-8859-9042e89a58b1: '1. **San Andreas Lake''s Location:** San
      Andreas Lake is in California.  California is a West Coast state.


      2. **Little Goose Dam''s Location:** Little Goose Dam is in Washington. Washington
      is also a West Coast state, but north of California.


      3. **West Coast Geography:** On the West Coast of the US, lines of longitude
      increase as you move East.


      4. **Relative Position:** Since Washington is north of California, and assuming
      similar longitude, Little Goose Dam would be WEST of San Andreas Lake.  Moving
      East from Little Goose Dam would eventually lead you to California and San Andreas
      Lake.

      Plantation is located in Gloucester County, Virginia.  Virginia is a state on
      the East Coast of the United States.


      2. **Locate Battell Chapel, CT:** Battell Chapel is located in New Haven, Connecticut.
      Connecticut is also a state on the East Coast of the United States.


      3. **Relative Positions of VA and CT:** Virginia is south of Connecticut.  Generally,
      locations further south will be further west on a globe (due to the Earth''s
      curvature).  However, the difference in longitude between Virginia and Connecticut
      is relatively minor compared to the north-south distance. The question is about
      East/West, not North/South.


      4. **East/West Comparison:** While Virginia is slightly west of Connecticut''s
      central longitude, coastal Virginia, where Gloucester County is located, is

      Connecticut is also a state on the East Coast of the United States.


      3. **Relative Positions of VA and CT:** Virginia is south of Connecticut.  Generally,
      lines of longitude in the US run North-South. Therefore, locations further south
      will be further west on the globe if considering the curvature. However, for
      locations relatively close together like these two, the East/West distinction
      is primarily defined by longitude.


      4. **Compare Longitudes (if needed):**  While Virginia is south of Connecticut,
      it''s not significantly further west.  A quick check confirms Virginia is mostly
      EAST of Connecticut.
