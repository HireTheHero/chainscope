      2. Next, I''ll locate Anderson Ranch Dam in Idaho

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is located in southwestern Idaho, in Elmore County

      - It is situated in the central part of the state


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - California is west of Idaho

      - Trinity Dam is in western California

      - Anderson Ranch Dam is in western Idaho


      4. Determine the relative east-west positioning

      - Since California is west of Idaho, any point in California will be west of
      any point in Idaho

      - Therefore, Trinity Dam is west of Anderson Ranch Dam


      5. Answer the specific question: Is Trinity Dam, CA located east of Anderson
      Ranch Dam, ID?

      - No, it is not east of Anderson Ranch Dam


      Answer: NO'
