    a90be75f-bef6-403f-b63b-c0d6526539db: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is located in
      Oregon (OR), and the California Theatre is in San Bernardino, California (CA).


      2. **Understand the geography**: California is a state on the West Coast of
      the United States, and Oregon is also on the West Coast, north of California.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Oregon is north of California and both are
      on the west coast, any point in Oregon would be north (and possibly slightly
      east, depending on the specific locations within the states) of any point in
      California.


      4. **Determine east-west orientation**: The question asks if the Trojan Nuclear
      Power Plant is east of the California Theatre. Given that the theatre is in
      California and the nuclear plant is in Oregon, the plant could potentially be
      slightly east of the theatre due to the geographical layout of the two states.
      However, the primary difference in their locations is north-south, not east-west.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the north-south alignment of the West Coast states
      and considering that Oregon is directly north of California, any location in
      Oregon would be north of a location in California but could also be slightly
      east depending on the specific longitude of the two points. However, the question
      simplifies to whether Oregon (where the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is) is east
      of California (where the California Theatre is), which simplifies further to
      understanding the general geography rather than precise longitudinal positions.


      Given these steps, the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon would indeed be
      north of the California Theatre in San Bernardino, California, but the question
      asks about being east. Considering the general geography and not precise longitudes,
      Oregon is generally north of California, and while parts of Oregon might be
      at a slightly higher longitude (east) than parts of California, the question''s
      framing suggests a simplification. Therefore, without precise longitudes but
      understanding the states'' general positions, the answer would tend towards
      a simplification based on the primary north-south relationship between the two
      states.


      However, the precise answer to whether the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is east
      of the California Theatre depends on their exact longitudes, which are not provided.
      Given typical geographical understandings and without calculating exact longitudes,
      one might initially think the question simplifies to the states'' relative positions.
      But, considering the normal geographical layout and that the question specifically
      asks about east-west positioning:

      Help, WI, and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Lac qui Parle, MN**: Lac qui Parle is a county in western Minnesota. The
      specific location we''re considering seems to refer to Lac qui Parle State Park,
      which is situated in this county, near the town of Watson, Minnesota. This area
      is in the western part of Minnesota.


      2. **National Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help, WI**: This shrine is located
      in Champion, Wisconsin. Champion is in Brown County, Wisconsin, which is in
      the eastern part of the state, near Green Bay.


      Given these locations:

      - Lac qui Parle, MN, is in western Minnesota.

      - The National Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help, WI, is in eastern Wisconsin.


      Considering the general geography of the United States, Minnesota is located
      west of Wisconsin. Therefore, a location in western Minnesota (Lac qui Parle)
      would be west of a location in eastern Wisconsin (National Shrine of Our Lady
      of Good Help).


      So, Lac qui Parle, MN, is **not** located east of the National Shrine of Our
      Lady of Good Help, WI.


      The answer is: **NO**'

    27487513-9fb5-40be-97cc-710700527af4: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of both St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA, and Sarang
      Community Church in Southern California, CA.


      1. **Location of St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral**: Seattle, WA is a city located
      in the state of Washington, which is in the Pacific Northwest region of the
      United States. This region is generally considered to be in the western part
      of the country.


      2. **Location of Sarang Community Church**: Southern California, CA refers to
      the southern portion of the state of California. California is also located
      on the West Coast of the United States, similar to Washington. However, Southern
      California is farther south compared to Seattle, WA.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Both locations are on the West Coast, but we need
      to determine their relative positions in terms of east-west orientation. Seattle,
      WA is at a higher latitude and is directly west of the Rocky Mountains, while
      Southern California, CA is south of Seattle and also directly west of the Rocky
      Mountains but at a lower latitude.


      4. **East-West Comparison**: Since both locations are on the West Coast and
      west of the Rocky Mountains, their east-west positioning relative to each other
      depends on their longitudinal positions rather than their latitudinal positions.
      Seattle, WA, and Southern California, CA are both near the Pacific Ocean, but
      Seattle is north, and Southern California is south. The key factor here is that
      Seattle is not east of Southern California; instead, it is north. However, in
      terms of longitude (east-west), Seattle, WA, is west of the 100th meridian,
      and parts of Southern California can also be west of this line, but the critical
      point is whether Seattle is east or west of Southern California in a geographical
      sense.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Seattle, WA, is generally northwest of Southern
      California, CA, and considering the question asks if St. Mark''s Episcopal Cathedral
      (in Seattle) is east of Sarang Community Church (in Southern California), the
      answer hinges on the relative east-west positioning. Since Seattle is not east

      \ steps, St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA, is west of Sarang Community\
      \ Church in Southern California, CA, because both locations are on the West\
      \ Coast, and Seattle is at a higher latitude (further north) but also more to\
      \ the west in terms of longitude compared to the easternmost parts of Southern\
      \ California. However, the key comparison here is east-west, and Seattle is\

      1. Tappan Lake is located in Ohio. Ohio is a state in the eastern United States,
      but more specifically, it is in the Midwest region, which is considered to be
      in the eastern part of the central United States.


      2. Astor Court Building is located in New York. New York is a state in the northeastern
      United States, which is generally east of the Midwest.


      Given these locations:

      - Tappan Lake, OH, is in the eastern part of the central United States (Midwest).

      - Astor Court Building, NY, is in the northeastern United States.


      Since the northeastern United States (where New York is located) is generally
      east of the Midwest (where Ohio is located), we can conclude that Tappan Lake,
      OH, is west of Astor Court Building, NY.

    0f85c766-04c5-43fe-a028-2d617fbfbe3c: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE, and Herb Parsons Lake, TN, and then
      compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. Lewis and Clark Lake is located in the state of Nebraska (NE). Nebraska is
      in the Midwestern United States, relatively in the central part of the country.


      2. Herb Parsons Lake is located in the state of Tennessee (TN). Tennessee is
      in the Southeastern United States, which is generally east of the Midwestern
      states.


      Given these locations:

      - Nebraska (where Lewis and Clark Lake is located) is west of Tennessee (where
      Herb Parsons Lake is located).


      Therefore, considering the geographical positions of Nebraska and Tennessee,
      Lewis and Clark Lake, NE, is west of Herb Parsons Lake, TN.


      The answer to whether Lewis and Clark Lake, NE, is located east of Herb Parsons
      Lake, TN, is: NO.'

      to be in the eastern United States but more centrally located when considering
      the entire country from coast to coast. Massachusetts is in the northeastern
      part of the United States, which places it east of West Virginia.


      3. **Determine Direction**: Since Massachusetts is east of West Virginia, any
      location in Massachusetts, including Bunch-of-Grapes, would be east of any location
      in West Virginia, including Pleasants Power Station.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Pleasants Power Station, WV is located
      east of Bunch-of-Grapes, MA is **NO**.'

      \ WV is located east of Bunch-of-Grapes, MA, we need to establish the geographical\
      \ locations of both points and then compare their relative positions.\n\n1.\
      \ **Identify Locations:**\n   - Pleasants Power Station is located in West Virginia\
      \ (WV).\n   - Bunch-of-Grapes is not a well-known location and doesn't directly\

      east of Big Stone Lake, SD, we should first identify the geographical locations
      of both lakes.


      1. **Sahuarita Lake, AZ**: This lake is located in Arizona. Arizona is in the
      southwestern United States.


      2. **Big Stone Lake, SD**: This lake is situated on the border between South
      Dakota and Minnesota. South Dakota is in the northern United States, more towards

      Given these locations:

      - Arizona (Sahuarita Lake) is generally west of South Dakota (Big Stone Lake).

      - Since Arizona is to the west of South Dakota, a location in Arizona cannot
      be east of a location in South Dakota.

    fa1f5c4b-bee8-4574-bc14-6e3a74023c21: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of Red Bluff Reservoir and Corpus Christi Cathedral in relation
      to each other.


      1. First, let''s identify the location of Corpus Christi Cathedral in Corpus
      Christi, Texas. Corpus Christi is a city located on the Gulf of Mexico, in the
      southern part of Texas.


      2. Next, we need to find the location of Red Bluff Reservoir. After researching,
      I found that Red Bluff Reservoir is located in Texas, but the exact location
      is necessary for comparison. Red Bluff Reservoir is situated near the city of
      Snyder, which is in western Texas, specifically in Scurry County.


      3. Now, comparing the locations: Corpus Christi is in southern Texas, near the
      Gulf of Mexico, while Red Bluff Reservoir is in western Texas. Generally, western
      Texas is considered to be west of southern Texas, where Corpus Christi is located.


      Based on these steps, since Red Bluff Reservoir is in western Texas and Corpus
      Christi is in southern Texas, Red Bluff Reservoir would be west, not east, of
      Corpus Christi Cathedral.


      The answer is: NO'

      in Colorado, and Lovewell Reservoir is located in Kansas.

      and Lovewell Reservoir is in northern Kansas.


      4. **Compare Longitudes**: To determine if John Martin Reservoir is east of
      Lovewell Reservoir, we need to compare their longitudes. Since Colorado is west
      of Kansas, for John Martin Reservoir to be east of Lovewell Reservoir, it would
      have to be significantly east within Colorado, closer to the Kansas border than
      Lovewell Reservoir is to the Colorado border.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given the general west-to-east arrangement of the states

      John Martin Reservoir is in southeastern Colorado and Lovewell Reservoir is
      in northern Kansas, John Martin Reservoir is likely west of Lovewell Reservoir

      \ the comparison hinges on their latitudinal difference (north-south) rather\
      \ than longitudinal (east-west), as both are near the eastern edge of the country.\n\
      \   - Connecticut is north of Virginia. The question, however, asks about east-west\
      \ positioning, not north-south.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both locations\
      \ are near the eastern seaboard, the question simplifies to understanding that\
      \ \"east\" in this context is somewhat misleading because both are already \"\
      east\" in the context of the United States. However, if we strictly interpret\
      \ \"east\" as being further towards the Atlantic from a given point, we must\
      \ consider their longitudinal positions. Given Virginia and Connecticut are\
      \ both coastal states with Virginia being to the south and Connecticut to the\
      \ north, neither is significantly \"east\" of the other in a way that would\
      \ make one decidedly more eastern than the other based on their state locations\
      \ alone.\n\nHowever, to directly answer the question based on geographical positioning\
      \ and typical understandings of \"east\" in a U.S. context:\n- Virginia is west\
      \ of Connecticut in terms of longitude when considering the entire country,\
      \ but since the question is about being \"east,\" we acknowledge both are near\
      \ the eastern edge of the U.S. \n\nGiven the direct question and simplifying\
      \ the geographical relationship:\n- Abingdon, VA is not east of Battell Chapel,\
      \ CT, in the conventional sense of moving further towards the Atlantic from\
      \ Connecticut, as Connecticut is already more eastern (or at least as eastern)\
      \ in terms of longitude compared to Virginia.\n\n**NO**"

      \ down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify Locations**: \n   - Abingdon (plantation),\
      \ VA: This is referring to a location in Virginia, USA. Specifically, it's mentioning\
      \ a plantation, which could be a historical site or a specific type of estate,\
      \ in Abingdon, Virginia.\n   - Battell Chapel, CT: This refers to a chapel located\
      \ in Connecticut, USA.\n\n2. **Determine Geographic Positions**:\n   - Virginia\
      \ (VA) is generally located in the southeastern part of the United States.\n\
      \   - Connecticut (CT) is located in the northeastern part of the United States.\n\
      \n3. **Compare Positions**:\n   - To determine if Abingdon, VA is east of Battell\
      \ Chapel, CT, we need to understand the general geography of the eastern United\
      \ States. \n   - Virginia is south of Connecticut. \n   - The question of east-west\
      \ positioning between these two states depends on their specific longitudes.\
      \ However, generally speaking, Virginia and Connecticut are both in the eastern\
      \ part of the United States, but Virginia is more to the south and slightly\
      \ to the west compared to Connecticut.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that\
      \ Abingdon, VA is more to the southwest compared to Battell Chapel, CT (which\
      \ is in the northeast), Abingdon, VA would not be east of Battell Chapel, CT.\
      \ It would be more south and slightly west.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether\
      \ Abingdon (plantation), VA is located east of Battell Chapel, CT is: **NO**."
    f3bbdd0d-913f-4b7b-9ff4-f41069265939: 'To determine if Abingdon (plantation),
      VA is located east of Battell Chapel, CT, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Abingdon (plantation) is in Virginia (VA), and
      Battell Chapel is in Connecticut (CT).


      2. **Understand geographical positions**: Virginia is generally located to the
      south of Connecticut.


      3. **Consider east-west alignment**: Since Connecticut is east of Virginia (given
      the general east-west alignment of the U.S. states along the eastern seaboard),
      any location in Virginia would be west of locations in Connecticut.


      Based on these steps, we can conclude that Abingdon (plantation), VA is west
      of Battell Chapel, CT. Therefore, the answer to whether Abingdon (plantation),
      VA is located east of Battell Chapel, CT is:


      NO'
