      located east of the Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Baptist in Savannah,
      Georgia, we need to consider their geographic locations in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Nimrod Lake, AR.

      - Nimrod Lake is located in west-central Arkansas.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Baptist.

      - The Cathedral is located in Savannah, Georgia, which is in the southeastern
      part of the state, near the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Arkansas is west of Georgia in the United States.

      - Savannah, being on the eastern edge of Georgia, is significantly farther east
      than any point in Arkansas, including Nimrod Lake.


      Conclusion:

      Since Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas and Savannah is in eastern Georgia, Nimrod
      Lake is west of Savannah.

      Nonnatus in Joliet, Illinois is located east of the Basilica of Regina Pacis
      in New York, we need to compare their geographical positions, specifically their
      longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus.

      - This cathedral is in Joliet, Illinois.

      - Joliet is a city located in the northeastern part of Illinois, southwest of
      Chicago.

      - Illinois is in the central part of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Basilica of Regina Pacis.

      - This basilica is located in Brooklyn, New York.

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States, along the East
      Coast.


      Step 3: Understand longitude.

      - Longitude measures east-west position on the Earth.

      - The further east you go, the higher the longitude in degrees west becomes
      closer to zero (and eventually into east if crossing the Prime Meridian).

      - New York is generally east of Illinois in terms of longitude.


      Step 4: Compare locations.

      - Joliet, IL is west of New York City.

      - Therefore, the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is west of the Basilica of
      Regina Pacis.

      in Oklahoma is located east of Tellico Reservoir in Tennessee, we need to compare
      their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Blue Canyon Wind Farm.

      - Blue Canyon Wind Farm is located in southwestern Oklahoma, near the town of
      Lawton, which is in Comanche County.

      - This places it in the western part of the state of Oklahoma.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Tellico Reservoir.

      - Tellico Reservoir is located in eastern Tennessee, near the town of Lenoir
      City.

      - It is part of the Tennessee River system and is situated in the eastern part
      of the state, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Oklahoma is west of Tennessee.

      - Blue Canyon Wind Farm is in southwestern Oklahoma.

      - Tellico Reservoir is in eastern Tennessee.


      Therefore, Blue Canyon Wind Farm is located west of Tellico Reservoir.
