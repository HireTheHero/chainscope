      - Old National Centre is in Indianapolis, Indiana (IN)

      - O''Rourke''s Diner is in Middletown, Connecticut (CT)


      2) To determine east/west positioning, I need to compare their states:

    dbf11a63-1b44-4947-90d6-d9d955b8f429: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, I need to locate Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica

      - It''s in Beaumont, Texas

      - Beaumont is in southeastern Texas


      2) Next, locate Theatre Building Chicago

      - As the name suggests, it''s in Chicago, Illinois

      - Chicago is in northeastern Illinois


      3) Compare their relative positions

      - Texas is west of Illinois

      - Beaumont, TX is east of most of Texas, but still west of Chicago, IL

      - Chicago is much further east than Beaumont


      Therefore: NO, Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica is NOT located east of Theatre
      Building Chicago. It is west of it.


      The answer is: NO'

    885a4bc7-3c5f-48ba-8bd7-39741880b158: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Abingdon plantation is in Virginia (VA)

      - Battell Chapel is in Connecticut (CT)


      2) When comparing east/west positions in the US:

      - Connecticut is in New England, in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is south of Connecticut, but also somewhat west


      3) Specifically:

      - Connecticut is one of the easternmost states

      - Virginia is several states west of the Atlantic coast compared to Connecticut


      4) Therefore, a location in Virginia would generally be WEST of a location in
      Connecticut, not east.


      Answer: NO'

      1) First, let me identify these locations:

      - Abingdon plantation is in Virginia (VA)

      - Battell Chapel is in Connecticut (CT)


      2) Let me consider their states'' relative positions:

      - Connecticut is in New England, in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is in the Mid-Atlantic region, south of Connecticut


      3) When comparing east-west positioning:

      - Both Connecticut and Virginia are on the eastern seaboard

      - Connecticut and Virginia are roughly aligned on a north-south axis

      - There isn''t a significant east-west difference between these states


      4) Therefore, locations in Virginia and Connecticut are generally at similar
      longitudes


      NO (Abingdon plantation, VA is not located east of Battell Chapel, CT - they
      are at similar longitudes, with Abingdon possibly slightly to the west)'
    9ade0c33-20ee-4bb1-8b72-170f5a51cb8a: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Abingdon plantation was in Virginia (VA)

      - Virginia is a state on the east coast of the US


      2) Battell Chapel is in Connecticut (CT)

      - Connecticut is also on the east coast of the US

      - Connecticut is one of the northernmost east coast states

      - Virginia is south of Connecticut


      3) When comparing east-west positions on the east coast:

      - Connecticut is slightly further east than Virginia

      - This is because the east coast curves, with New England states being further
      east than mid-Atlantic states


      4) Therefore, since Battell Chapel is in Connecticut, and Connecticut is further
      east than Virginia where Abingdon plantation was located...


      NO'

      1) First, let me identify these locations:

      - Abingdon plantation is in Virginia (VA)

      - Virginia is south of Connecticut

      - Connecticut is one of the northeastern states

      - Virginia is a mid-Atlantic state


      3) When comparing locations in these states:

      - Connecticut is consistently east of Virginia

      - Any location in Connecticut will be east of locations in Virginia

      - Therefore, Battell Chapel (CT) must be east of Abingdon plantation (VA)


      4) Since the question asks if Abingdon is east of Battell Chapel, and we determined
      that Battell Chapel is actually east of Abingdon, the answer must be:


      NO'

      - Connecticut is in New England, in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is in the South Atlantic region, south of Connecticut


      3) When comparing the east/west position of these states:

      - Connecticut is further east than Virginia

      - Any point in Connecticut will generally be east of points in Virginia


      4) Therefore, Battell Chapel (in CT) must be east of Abingdon plantation (in

      NO (Abingdon plantation is NOT east of Battell Chapel - it''s the other way
