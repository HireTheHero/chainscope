      2. **Locate Magic Reservoir**: Magic Reservoir is located in Idaho, near the

      3. **Determine Relative Position**: To find out if one location is east of the
      other, we need to consider their longitudes. California is generally west of
      Idaho. Since Santa Margarita Lake is in California and Magic Reservoir is in
      Idaho, we can infer that Santa Margarita Lake is located to the west of Magic
      Reservoir.

      establish the locations of both Mississinewa Lake Dam in Indiana and St. Mary''s
      Church in New Haven, Connecticut.


      1. **Location of Mississinewa Lake Dam**: Mississinewa Lake Dam is situated
      in Indiana, specifically in the vicinity of the town of Peru.


      2. **Location of St. Mary''s Church**: St. Mary''s Church is located in New
      Haven, Connecticut.

      any point in Indiana, including Mississinewa Lake Dam, would be west of a point
      in Connecticut, including St. Mary''s Church.


      4. **Comparison of Locations**: Since Mississinewa Lake Dam is located in Indiana
      and St. Mary''s Church is in Connecticut, it follows that Mississinewa Lake
      Dam is west of St. Mary''s Church.


      Based on this reasoning, Mississinewa Lake Dam is not east of St. Mary''s Church;
      it is actually west.

      east of Battell Chapel, Connecticut, we need to consider the geographical locations
      of both places.


      1. **Locate Battell Chapel, CT**: Battell Chapel is situated in Connecticut,
      which is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      2. **Locate Abingdon, VA**: Abingdon is located in Virginia, which is further
      south and west of Connecticut.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Connecticut is to the north of Virginia.
      Since Abingdon is in Virginia, it is south of Connecticut.


      4. **East-West Positioning**: To determine if one location is east of another,
      we consider their longitudes. Virginia generally has longitudes that place it
      to the west of Connecticut.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since Abingdon is south and west of Battell Chapel, it cannot
      be considered east of it.

      locations of both places.


      1. **Location of Abingdon, VA**: Abingdon is located in the southwestern part
      of Virginia. It is situated near the Virginia-Tennessee border.


      2. **Location of Battell Chapel, CT**: Battell Chapel is located in New Haven,
      Connecticut, which is in the northeastern United States.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: To see if Abingdon is east of Battell Chapel,
      we need to analyze their longitudinal positions. Connecticut is generally located
      to the north and east of Virginia.


      4. **Relative Positioning**: Since Virginia is south of Connecticut and Abingdon
      is in the southwestern part of Virginia, it would generally be south and west
      of Connecticut.


      Given this analysis, Abingdon, VA is located to the southwest of Battell Chapel,
