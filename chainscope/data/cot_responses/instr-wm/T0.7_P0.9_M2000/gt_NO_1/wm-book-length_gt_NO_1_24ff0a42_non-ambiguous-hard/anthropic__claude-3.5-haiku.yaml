      - It''s likely to be longer than a typical genre fiction novel


      4. While I don''t have the exact page count memorized, based on the typical
      lengths of these authors'' works, I''m confident that The Rifles is likely longer
      than Nightmare in Pink.


      5. Therefore, the answer is: NO, Nightmare in Pink does NOT have more pages
      than The Rifles.


      The answer is: NO'

      2. Robert J. Schwalb''s Book of Vile Darkness is a Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying
      game sourcebook. These types of books are typically around 160-224 pages.

      often around 300-400 pages.


      4. Without having the exact page count in front of me, the novel Waylander is
      more likely to have more pages than the RPG sourcebook.
