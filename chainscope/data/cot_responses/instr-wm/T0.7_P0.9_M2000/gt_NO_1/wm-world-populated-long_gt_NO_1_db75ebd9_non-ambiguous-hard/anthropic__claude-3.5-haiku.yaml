      4. Determining east/west orientation:

      - Zirakpur is east of the prime meridian (in Asia)

      - Beaufort is west of the prime meridian (in Australia)

      - From a global perspective, Zirakpur is east of Beaufort


      5. Conclusion:

      Since Zirakpur is located east of Beaufort, Victoria, the answer is:


      YES'

      3. Cropthorne is a village in Worcestershire, England.


      4. These locations are on different continents - Barclay is in North America,
      Cropthorne is in Europe.

      6. After carefully checking available geographical references, I do not have
      enough definitive information to confidently state whether Bungeni is east or
      west of Birur.


      Given the lack of precise geographical information, I cannot confidently answer
      YES or NO.


      If forced to give a YES or NO answer, I would say NO, as I cannot confirm the
      eastward position.'
    e3e84544-d628-4fbb-ae85-cc89f9f4da9d: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to locate Bungeni and Birur on a map.


      2. Bungeni appears to be a location in India.


      3. Birur is also a town in Karnataka, India.


      4. To determine their relative east-west positions, I''ll check their longitude
      coordinates.


      5. After careful checking, Bungeni is located west of Birur.


      6. Therefore, Bungeni is NOT east of Birur.


      The answer is: NO.'
