      2. Looking at relative positions:

      - Ohio is west of Virginia

      - Westerville, OH is west of Fairfax, VA

      - Therefore, Otterbein University is west of Stratford University


      3. The question asks if Otterbein is east of Stratford

      - Since Otterbein is west of Stratford, not east

      - This means the answer must be no


      NO'
    ffda71a9-a323-44b6-9120-4811c38e9a1a: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I need to locate both universities:

      - Otterbein University is in Westerville, Ohio

      - Stratford University was in Fairfax, Virginia


      2. To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their relative
      positions:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest

      - Virginia is on the East Coast


      3. Looking at a map:

      - Virginia is clearly east of Ohio

      - Therefore, Stratford University is east of Otterbein University


      4. Since Otterbein is WEST of Stratford (not east), the answer is:


      NO'

      3. Looking at a US map:

      - Texas is significantly west of Ohio

      - Even though both institutions are in the eastern parts of their respective
      states, any point in Texas would be west of any point in Ohio


      4. Therefore, Mary Allen Seminary in Texas must be west of Walsh University
      in Ohio, not east.


      Answer: NO'

      - Slippery Rock, PA is in western Pennsylvania


      3) When comparing states:

      - Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, any location in Massachusetts would be east of a location in western
      Pennsylvania


      4) Final comparison:

      - Since Holy Cross is in Massachusetts and Slippery Rock is in western Pennsylvania,
      Slippery Rock must be WEST of Holy Cross, not east of it.
