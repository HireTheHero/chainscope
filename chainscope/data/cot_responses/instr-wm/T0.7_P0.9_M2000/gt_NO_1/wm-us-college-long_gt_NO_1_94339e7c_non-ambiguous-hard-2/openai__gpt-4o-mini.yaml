      College of Engineering).

      - Therefore, Lubbock is actually west of Lamoni.


      Since Whitacre College of Engineering is west of Graceland University, the answer
      to the question is:


      NO.'

      States.


      2. **Location of Full Sail University**: Full Sail University is located in

      and Technical College (MSCTC) in Minnesota is located east of Bethel University

      1. **Location of Minnesota State Community and Technical College**: MSCTC is
      located in Minnesota, which is in the northern part of the United States.


      2. **Location of Bethel University**: Bethel University is located in McKenzie,
      Tennessee, which is in the southern part of the United States.


      3. **Geographic Comparison**: Minnesota is north of Tennessee. When comparing
      east-west positions, we need to look at their respective longitudes. Generally,
      states further east have a lower longitude than states further west.


      4. **Longitude Consideration**: Tennessee is east of Minnesota. Therefore, any
      point in Minnesota, including MSCTC, will have a higher longitude compared to
      Bethel University, which is located in Tennessee.

      Radford University is in Virginia, it follows that Radford University is south
      of Marywood University.


      4. **East-West Orientation**: To determine if Radford University is east of
      Marywood University, we need to consider their longitudinal positions. Virginia,
      in general, lies to the west of Pennsylvania.


      Given that Radford University is located south and slightly to the west of Marywood
      University, it is not east of it.

      3. **Relative Positioning**: To assess if Reinhardt University is east of Keuka
      College, we can visualize or reference a map of the United States. Georgia is
      generally south of New York, and since it is further south and to the west of
      New York, Reinhardt University would not be east of Keuka College.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, Reinhardt University
      is located to the south and west of Keuka College, not east.

      in Texas is located east of Lewis University in Illinois, we need to look at
      the geographic locations of both universities.


      1. **Location of Midwestern State University**: Midwestern State University
      is located in Wichita Falls, Texas. This city is situated in the northern part
      of Texas, near the border with Oklahoma.


      2. **Location of Lewis University**: Lewis University is located in Romeoville,
      Illinois, which is in the northeastern part of Illinois, southwest of Chicago.


      3. **Comparing the Locations**: Illinois is generally located to the north of
      Texas. Since Lewis University is in Illinois and Midwestern State University
      is in Texas, we need to determine their relative positions. Given that Texas
      is further south than Illinois, and considering their specific locations, Wichita
      Falls (Midwestern State) is to the southwest of Romeoville (Lewis University).


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Wichita Falls is not east of Romeoville, we conclude
      that Midwestern State University is not located east of Lewis University.
