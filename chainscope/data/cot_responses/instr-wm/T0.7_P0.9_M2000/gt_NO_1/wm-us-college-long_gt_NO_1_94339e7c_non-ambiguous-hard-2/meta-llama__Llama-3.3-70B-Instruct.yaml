      the locations of University of St. Thomas, TX, and Lake Michigan College, MI,
      relative to each other, specifically considering their positions in relation
      to Lake Michigan.


      1. **Identify the location of University of St. Thomas, TX**: This university
      is located in Texas. Texas is in the southern United States, far to the southwest
      of the Great Lakes.


      2. **Identify the location of Lake Michigan College, MI**: This college is located
      in Michigan, which is in the northern United States, near the Great Lakes. Specifically,
      Lake Michigan is one of the Great Lakes, and Michigan borders it to the east.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Texas is far to the southwest
      of the Great Lakes, and Lake Michigan College is near Lake Michigan in Michigan,

      1. Michigan is a state located in the northern United States, in the Great Lakes
      region. It is generally considered to be in the eastern part of the northern
      United States, but more specifically, it is in the northeastern to north-central
      part of the country.


      2. Florida is a state located in the southeastern United States.


      Given these locations:

      - Davenport University in Michigan is more to the north and somewhat central
      to eastern in the U.S.

      - Full Sail University in Florida is in the southeast.


      Since Michigan (where Davenport University is located) is north and more central
      to eastern, and Florida (where Full Sail University is located) is southeast,
      Michigan is indeed north of Florida but also generally east of Florida when

    b73a37d0-40a4-4ec2-a36d-952d4cf9d3da: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the location of Florida State University School of Library & Information
      Studies (FL):** Florida State University is located in Tallahassee, Florida.
      Since Florida is on the eastern coast of the United States, this places it to
      the southeast in the country''s geography.


      2. **Identify the location of Marymount University (VA):** Marymount University
      is located in Arlington, Virginia. Virginia is also on the eastern coast of
      the United States but is situated north of Florida.


      3. **Compare the locations:** Given that both institutions are on the eastern
      coast, the key factor is their relative north-south positioning rather than
      east-west. Florida is south of Virginia.


      4. **Determine if Florida State University is east of Marymount University:**
      Since Florida is directly south of Virginia and not east, the geographical relationship
      is primarily south-north rather than east-west. However, because both are near
      the eastern coast of the United States, the question might seem ambiguous. The
      critical point is understanding "east of" typically implies a direct eastward
      direction, not a general eastern location. Florida is more south than east relative
      to Virginia.


      Considering these steps, the correct interpretation hinges on understanding
      the question asks for a direct directional relationship ("east of") rather than
      a general regional location ("in the eastern part of the country"). Therefore,
      Florida State University is not directly east of Marymount University; it is
      more accurately described as being south.

      1. First, we identify the location of Angelo State University, which is in Texas
      (TX). Texas is a state located in the southwestern United States.


      2. Next, we identify the location of Mississippi Valley State University, which
      is in Mississippi (MS). Mississippi is a state located in the southeastern United
      States, east of Texas.


      Given these locations:

      - Texas is generally west of Mississippi.

      - Therefore, a location in Texas would typically be west, not east, of a location
      in Mississippi.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether Angelo State University, TX is
      located east of Mississippi Valley State University, MS is: NO.'

    48aa6d55-dbdb-45ba-9169-56568074ace0: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the locations of both Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX, and Grand
      Valley State University, MI, and then compare their geographical positions.


      1. **Identify the location of Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX**:
      First, it''s essential to note that the main campus of Texas Tech University
      is located in Lubbock, Texas. However, Texas Tech University has a campus in
      Fredericksburg, which is part of the Texas Tech University System but is specifically
      related to the Texas Tech University at Junction (for the Junction campus) or
      could be referring to an extension or program in Fredericksburg. For simplicity,
      we will consider the general area of Fredericksburg, Texas, which is in the
      central part of the state, west of the eastern part of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Grand Valley State University, MI**: Grand Valley
      State University is located in Allendale, Michigan, with additional campuses
      in Grand Rapids and other locations in Michigan. Michigan is in the northern
      United States, in the Great Lakes region, which is east of Texas.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Texas is generally considered to be in the southwestern
      United States, while Michigan is in the northern part of the eastern United
      States. Given that Fredericksburg, Texas, is in the central part of Texas and
      Texas as a whole is west of Michigan, we can conclude that Texas Tech University

      First, we need to note that there seems to be a bit of confusion in the question.
      Texas Tech University is primarily located in Lubbock, Texas, not Fredericksburg.
      However, assuming there might be a satellite campus or a confusion with the
      name, we should consider the general location of Texas in relation to other
      states. Fredericksburg, TX, if we are considering it as a point of reference,
      is in the central part of Texas.


      2. **Identify the location of Grand Valley State University, MI**: Grand Valley
      State University is located in Allendale, Michigan. Michigan is in the northern
      United States, in the Great Lakes region, which is east of Texas.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Texas is generally considered to be in the southwestern

      \   - California is to the south of Washington State.\n\n4. **Determine east-west\
      \ positioning**:\n   - To be \"east\" of EWU, CCA would need to be to the east\
      \ of EWU's longitude.\n   - Given that both are near the Pacific Ocean (on the\
      \ west coast), the significant factor is their latitude (north-south position)\
      \ rather than longitude (east-west position) for this comparison. However, we\
      \ must consider their actual geographic positions.\n\n5. **Geographic Positioning**:\n\
      \   - Eastern Washington University is in Cheney, Washington, which is indeed\
      \ in the eastern part of Washington State, hence the name.\n   - California\
      \ College of the Arts is in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, both\
      \ of which are on the western edge of the United States, far to the west of\
      \ Eastern Washington University's location.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given\
      \ that California College of the Arts is located on the west coast and Eastern\
      \ Washington University, despite being in the eastern part of its state, is\
      \ still west of many parts of the U.S. but significantly, CCA is to the south\
      \ and also on the west coast, the question becomes about the relative east-west\
      \ positioning.\n   - Since Eastern Washington University is in the eastern part\
      \ of Washington but still on the west coast, and California College of the Arts\
      \ is directly west of it in terms of the U.S. map, the answer hinges on understanding\
      \ \"east of\" in the context of the U.S. map.\n\nGiven the above steps, California\
      \ College of the Arts is **NO**, not east of Eastern Washington University.\
      \ The phrasing of the question requires understanding the relative positions\
      \ and acknowledging that \"east of\" in this context means further east on the\

      3. **Comparison:** Since both universities are on the western coast of the United

      Given that San Diego (where Coleman University is located) is south of Monterey

      \ locations**:\n   - Monterey Bay, where CSUMB is located, is on the central\
      \ coast of California, closer to the Pacific Ocean (west).\n   - San Diego,\
      \ where Coleman University is located, is in the southern part of California,\
      \ also near the Pacific Ocean (west) but farther south than Monterey Bay.\n\n\
      4. **Determine east-west orientation**:\n   - Since both universities are near\
      \ the Pacific coast, they are both generally on the western side of California.\n\
      \   - San Diego (Coleman University) is south and slightly east of Monterey\
      \ Bay (CSUMB) because it is inland from the coast compared to Monterey Bay's\
      \ coastal location, but not significantly so in terms of east-west orientation\
      \ within the state's geography.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that both\
      \ universities are on the western side of California, with Monterey Bay being\
      \ directly on the coast and San Diego being slightly inland but still coastal\
      \ in the southern part of the state, the question of which is east of the other\
      \ depends on their precise locations relative to each other.\n   - Considering\
      \ the general geography, Monterey Bay is north and slightly west of San Diego,\
      \ but since San Diego is not significantly east (it's more south than east in\
      \ relation to Monterey Bay), we need to consider the actual longitudinal positions.\n\
      \nGiven the specific question, without precise longitudinal data, the general\
      \ understanding might lead to confusion. However, considering typical geography:\n\
      - **Coleman University in San Diego** is at approximately 117.17\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      - **CSUMB in Monterey Bay** is at approximately 121.64\xB0 W longitude.\n\n\
      Since 121.64\xB0 W (Monterey Bay) is west of 117.17\xB0 W (San Diego), Monterey\
      \ Bay is west of San Diego, making San Diego east of Monterey Bay in terms of\
      \ longitude.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether California State University,\
      \ Monterey Bay, CA is located east of Coleman University, CA is **NO**."

      1. **Location of Southwest Baptist University, MO**: Missouri is located in
      the Midwestern United States. It is not considered an eastern state in the broad
      geographical divisions of the U.S. but is more centrally located.


      2. **Location of Everglades University, FL**: Florida is located in the Southeastern
      United States, directly bordering the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Gulf

      Alabama (AL) is located east of Shepherd University (WV), we need to consider
      the geographical locations of both universities.


      1. **Identify the locations**: The University of West Alabama is in Alabama
      (AL), and Shepherd University is in West Virginia (WV).


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Alabama is generally considered
      to be in the southeastern part of the United States, while West Virginia is
      in the eastern part of the United States but more to the north.


      3. **Compare the longitudes**: Since we''re comparing east-west positions, we
      look at the longitudes. Generally, the farther east a location is, the higher
      its longitude (up to a point, before it wraps around the globe). However, in
      the context of the continental United States, we can simplify this by knowing
      that Alabama is to the west of West Virginia.


      4. **Determine the relative east-west positions**: Given that Alabama is to
      the west of West Virginia, any institution in Alabama, such as the University
      of West Alabama, would be west of an institution in West Virginia, like Shepherd

      the locations of Cornerstone University in Michigan and Clarkson University
      in New York.


      1. **Identify the states**: Cornerstone University is located in the state of
      Michigan (MI), and Clarkson University is located in the state of New York (NY).


      2. **General geographic knowledge**: Michigan is located in the Great Lakes
      region of the United States, which is considered to be in the northern part
      of the country but more towards the central or western side when considering
      the entire country from east to west. New York, on the other hand, is located
      in the northeastern part of the United States.


      3. **Relative positions of states**: Given their positions, New York is generally
      east of Michigan. This is because when moving from Michigan to New York, one
      would be traveling eastward.


      4. **Conclusion based on state locations**: Since New York (where Clarkson University
      is located) is east of Michigan (where Cornerstone University is located), it
      means Cornerstone University in Michigan is west of Clarkson University in New
      York.


      Therefore, considering the question of whether Cornerstone University, MI is

      United States, known for being a peninsula that extends into the Atlantic Ocean
      and the Gulf of Mexico. Given its name, the "Southwest Recreation Center" suggests
      a location on the southwest part of the University of Florida''s campus, but
      the key factor is the state''s overall geographical position relative to Illinois.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Florida is generally east of Illinois. Since Illinois
      is landlocked and located more centrally in the eastern part of the United States
      (but west of the Eastern Seaboard states like Florida), any location in Florida,
      including the University of Florida, is east of any location in Illinois, including
