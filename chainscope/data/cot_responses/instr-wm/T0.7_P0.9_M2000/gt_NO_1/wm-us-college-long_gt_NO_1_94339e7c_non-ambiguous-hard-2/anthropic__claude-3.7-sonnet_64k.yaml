      \ locations of two colleges in the United States:\n1. University of St. Thomas\
      \ in TX (Texas)\n2. Lake Michigan College in MI (Michigan)\n\nThe question asks\
      \ if University of St. Thomas, TX is located east of Lake Michigan College,\
      \ MI.\n\nTo determine this, I need to identify the locations of both institutions\
      \ and compare their east-west positions (longitudes).\n\nFirst, let me identify\
      \ the locations:\n\nUniversity of St. Thomas is in Houston, Texas. Houston is\
      \ in the southeastern part of Texas.\n\nLake Michigan College is in Michigan,\
      \ likely near Lake Michigan. Michigan is in the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region\
      \ of the United States.\n\nNow, I need to think about their relative east-west\
      \ positions. In the United States:\n- States in the eastern part of the country\
      \ have lower (more negative) longitude values\n- States in the western part\
      \ of the country have higher (less negative) longitude values\n\nTexas is generally\
      \ west of Michigan in the United States. Texas is in the south-central part\
      \ of the United States, while Michigan is in the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region,\
      \ which is more eastern.\n\nIf we look at a map of the United States:\n- Michigan\
      \ is bordered by the Great Lakes to the north and east\n- Texas is bordered\
      \ by Mexico to the south and states like New Mexico and Oklahoma to the west\n\
      \nSo, Lake Michigan College in Michigan would be east of the University of St.\
      \ Thomas in Texas, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, the University of\
      \ St. Thomas, TX is NOT located east of Lake Michigan College, MI. Instead,\
      \ it's located west of Lake Michigan College.\n\nThe answer is NO.\n\nActually,\
      \ let me double-check my reasoning by thinking about the approximate longitudes:\n\
      - Houston, TX (where University of St. Thomas is located) is around longitude\
      \ -95\xB0 W\n- Michigan is generally between longitudes -82\xB0 W and -90\xB0\
      \ W\n\nSince -95\xB0 is further west than the longitude range for Michigan,\
      \ the University of St. Thomas in Texas is indeed west of Lake Michigan College\

      \ at longitude 95\xB0 West\n   - Benton Harbor, MI is approximately at longitude\
      \ 86\xB0 West\n   - Lower longitude numbers indicate more easterly positions\n\
      \n4) Since 95\xB0 West is further west than 86\xB0 West, the University of St.\
      \ Thomas in Texas is located WEST of Lake Michigan College in Michigan, not\
      \ east of it.\n\nNO, University of St. Thomas, TX is not located east of Lake\

      2) Then I'll determine which one is further east (or west).\n\nFirst, let me\
      \ think about where these institutions are located:\n\nUniversity of St. Thomas\
      \ (TX) is likely in Texas. Based on my knowledge, I believe it's in Houston,\
      \ Texas, which is in the southeastern part of Texas.\n\nLake Michigan College\
      \ (MI) is in Michigan, which is in the Great Lakes region. Given its name, it's\
      \ probably close to Lake Michigan, which forms the western border of Michigan's\
      \ Lower Peninsula. Michigan is in the northern United States, east of the Mississippi\

      \ W (along Lake Michigan)\n\nLake Michigan College is likely near the lake,\
      \ so it would be in western Michigan, which would place it at approximately\
      \ 86-87\xB0 W longitude.\n\nThe University of St. Thomas in Houston would be\
      \ around 95\xB0 W longitude.\n\nA smaller longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere\
      \ where these states are located) indicates a more easterly location, since\
      \ longitude counts westward from the Prime Meridian.\n\nSince 87\xB0 W (Lake\
      \ Michigan College's approximate longitude) is less than 95\xB0 W (University\
      \ of St. Thomas's approximate longitude), Lake Michigan College is further east\
      \ than the University of St. Thomas.\n\nActually, I need to double-check my\
      \ facts here. Let me be more precise:\n\n- University of St. Thomas (TX) is\
      \ indeed in Houston, Texas, at approximately 95.4\xB0 W longitude.\n- Lake Michigan\
      \ College is in Benton Harbor, Michigan, which is on the eastern shore of Lake\
      \ Michigan, at approximately 86.5\xB0 W longitude.\n\nSo Lake Michigan College\
      \ is at 86.5\xB0 W, and University of St. Thomas is at 95.4\xB0 W.\n\nSince\

      \nFirst, let me establish the general locations of these two states:\n- Texas\

      \ United States, in the Great Lakes region\n\nNow, regarding their east-west\
      \ positioning:\n- Texas is generally west of Michigan in terms of longitude\n\
      - Michigan is further east than Texas\n\nThe University of St. Thomas is in\

      \ is NOT located east of Lake Michigan College in Michigan.\n\nActually, let\
      \ me double-check this by thinking about the specific locations of these colleges\

      \ means it's probably in the western part of Michigan.\n\nEven though Lake Michigan\
      \ College might be in western Michigan, Michigan as a whole is still significantly\

      \ of the United States, while Benton Harbor, Michigan is in the northern part.\
      \ More importantly for this question, Houston, Texas is west of Benton Harbor,\
      \ Michigan.\n\nTo be completely sure, I can consider their approximate coordinates:\n\
      - Houston, TX (where University of St. Thomas is): approximately 29.7\xB0 N,\

      \ position):\n- University of St. Thomas: 95.4\xB0 W\n- Lake Michigan College:\
      \ 86.5\xB0 W\n\nSince 95.4\xB0 W is further west than 86.5\xB0 W (a higher western\

      to determine the locations of both schools and compare their geographical positions
      to determine if Whitacre College of Engineering, TX is east of Graceland University,
      IA.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both schools.

      - Whitacre College of Engineering is in Texas (TX)

      - Graceland University is in Iowa (IA)


      Step 2: Find more specific location information for each school.


      For Whitacre College of Engineering in Texas:

      I believe Whitacre College of Engineering is the engineering school at Texas
      Tech University, which is located in Lubbock, Texas, in the western part of
      Texas.


      For Graceland University in Iowa:

      Graceland University is located in Lamoni, Iowa, which is in the southern part
      of Iowa.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      To determine which is further east, I need to compare their longitudes. In the
      U.S., lower (more negative) longitude numbers indicate more western locations,
      while higher (less negative) longitude numbers indicate more eastern locations.


      Since Texas is generally west of Iowa on a U.S. map, and specifically Lubbock,
      TX (where Whitacre College is likely located) is in western Texas, while Lamoni,
      IA (where Graceland University is located) is in southern Iowa, Whitacre College
      would be west of Graceland University.


      Therefore, Whitacre College of Engineering, TX is NOT located east of Graceland
      University, IA. It is located west of Graceland University.


      Let me double-check this:

      - Iowa is in the Midwestern United States

      - Texas is in the Southern/Southwestern United States

      - On a west-to-east axis, Iowa is east of Texas


      So my answer is consistent. Whitacre College of Engineering in Texas is west

      Specifically, I need to determine if Spring Arbor University is located east
      of Touro College.


      Let me think about the locations of these two colleges:


      1. Spring Arbor University is in Spring Arbor, Michigan (MI). Michigan is in
      the Midwest region of the United States.


      2. Touro College is in New York (NY). New York is on the East Coast of the United

      Places further east have more easterly (lower negative or higher positive) longitudes
      than places further west.


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Michigan. The East Coast of the US (where
      NY is located) is east of the Midwest region (where MI is located).


      Since Touro College is in New York, and Spring Arbor University is in Michigan,

      \ hemisphere).\n\nTexas is generally west of Indiana in the United States. However,\
      \ Texas is a large state that extends quite far east, and Indiana is in the\

      \nHammond and Westville, Indiana (where Purdue University Northwest has campuses)\
      \ are in the northwestern part of Indiana.\n\nLet me think about the general\

      \ South/Southwest region\n- Generally, Indiana is east of Texas\n\nHowever,\
      \ since Beaumont is in far eastern Texas and the Purdue campuses are in northwestern\

      \ locations of Lamar University in Texas and Purdue University Northwest in\
      \ Indiana, I need to determine their relative east-west positions on a map.\n\
      \nFirst, let me recall where these universities are located:\n\n1. Lamar University\
      \ is located in Beaumont, Texas, which is in the eastern part of Texas near\
      \ the Louisiana border.\n\n2. Purdue University Northwest has campuses in Hammond\
      \ and Westville, Indiana. Indiana is in the Midwest region, bordering Illinois\
      \ to the west, Michigan and Ohio to the east.\n\nTo determine which is further\
      \ east, I need to compare their approximate longitudes. On maps of the United\
      \ States, lower longitude numbers correspond to more western locations, while\
      \ higher longitude numbers correspond to more eastern locations.\n\nTexas is\
      \ generally west of Indiana on a US map. However, Texas is a large state that\
      \ extends quite far east, especially in its eastern portions near Louisiana.\
      \ And Beaumont, where Lamar University is located, is in the far eastern part\
      \ of Texas.\n\nIndiana is in the Midwest, but it's considerably east of most\
      \ of Texas. However, I need to be precise about the specific locations.\n\n\
      Beaumont, TX (where Lamar University is) is very close to the Louisiana border,\
      \ making it one of the easternmost cities in Texas. Its approximate longitude\
      \ is around 94\xB0 W.\n\nHammond and Westville, IN (where Purdue University\
      \ Northwest campuses are located) are in northwest Indiana. Hammond is near\
      \ the Illinois border, and Westville is not far from there. The approximate\
      \ longitude for this area is around 87\xB0 W.\n\nSince lower longitude numbers\
      \ (going west) indicate more western locations, and 87\xB0 W (Purdue University\
      \ Northwest) is a lower number than 94\xB0 W (Lamar University), this means\
      \ that Purdue University Northwest is actually further east than Lamar University.\n\
      \nWait, I made an error. Let me correct myself. Lower longitude numbers in the\
      \ western hemisphere (where both universities are located) correspond to more\
      \ eastern locations. So:\n\n- If Lamar University is at approximately 94\xB0\
      \ W\n- And Purdue University Northwest is at approximately 87\xB0 W\n\nThen\
      \ Purdue University Northwest (87\xB0 W) is further east than Lamar University\
      \ (94\xB0 W), because 87 is a smaller number than 94 when dealing with western\
      \ longitudes.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful here. In the western hemisphere\
      \ (where both the US and Canada are), longitude is measured in degrees west.\
      \ So 0\xB0 longitude is at the prime meridian through Greenwich, UK, and as\
      \ you go west, the degrees increase. So:\n\n- More eastern locations have lower\
      \ \"degrees west\" longitudes\n- More western locations have higher \"degrees\
      \ west\" longitudes\n\nSo let me try again:\n\n- Beaumont, TX (Lamar University)\
      \ is at approximately 94\xB0 W\n- Northwest Indiana (Purdue University Northwest)\
      \ is at approximately 87\xB0 W\n\nSince 87\xB0 W is less than 94\xB0 W, Purdue\
      \ University Northwest is further east than Lamar University.\n\nActually, I\
      \ need to be extremely careful here. In the western hemisphere:\n- Eastern locations\
      \ have LOWER west longitude values (closer to 0\xB0 W)\n- Western locations\
      \ have HIGHER west longitude values (further from 0\xB0 W)\n\nSo, let me correct\
      \ my analysis:\n\n- Beaumont, TX (Lamar University) is at approximately 94\xB0\
      \ W\n- Northwest Indiana (Purdue University Northwest) is at approximately 87\xB0\
      \ W\n\nSince 87 is less than 94, and we're talking about degrees west longitude,\
      \ that means Purdue University Northwest (87\xB0 W) is EAST of Lamar University\
      \ (94\xB0 W).\n\nSo the answer to the question \"Is Lamar University, TX located\
      \ east of Purdue University Northwest, IN?\" is NO, because Purdue University\
      \ Northwest is actually east of Lamar University.\n\nLet me double-check my\
      \ reasoning to make sure:\n\n1. Lamar University (Beaumont, TX): ~94\xB0 W longitude\n\
      2. Purdue University Northwest (Northwest Indiana): ~87\xB0 W longitude\n3.\
      \ In the western hemisphere, smaller west longitude numbers represent more eastern\
      \ locations\n4. 87 is smaller than 94\n5. Therefore, Purdue University Northwest\
      \ is east of Lamar University\n\nOK so to be super clear, the answer is NO,\
      \ Lamar University is NOT east of Purdue University Northwest. Lamar University\
      \ is WEST of Purdue University Northwest.\n\nHmm, actually, I'm not fully confident\
      \ in my longitudes. Let me be more precise.\n\nLamar University is in Beaumont,\
      \ Texas, which is located in the southeastern part of Texas near the Gulf of\
      \ Mexico and the Louisiana border. Beaumont's longitude is approximately 94.1\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nPurdue University Northwest has campuses in Hammond and Westville, Indiana.\
      \ Hammond, IN is located at approximately 87.5\xB0 W longitude, and Westville,\
      \ IN is at approximately 86.9\xB0 W longitude.\n\nBoth of these locations for\
      \ Purdue University Northwest have longitudes less than Lamar University's 94.1\xB0\
      \ W. Since lower west longitude numbers in the western hemisphere indicate more\
      \ eastern locations, this confirms that Purdue University Northwest is located\
      \ east of Lamar University.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is Lamar\
      \ University, TX located east of Purdue University Northwest, IN?\" is NO.\n\
      \nActually, let me visualize this once more, going from east to west across\
      \ the United States:\n\nEast Coast (Atlantic Ocean) \u2192 ... \u2192 ~87\xB0\
      \ W (Purdue University Northwest, IN) \u2192 ... \u2192 ~94\xB0 W (Lamar University,\
      \ TX) \u2192 ... \u2192 West Coast (Pacific Ocean)\n\nThis clearly shows that\
      \ Purdue University Northwest is east of Lamar University.\n\nSo my final answer\
      \ is NO, Lamar University is not located east of Purdue University Northwest;\
      \ it's the other way around.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine\

      \ let's identify the locations of these universities:\n   - Lamar University\
      \ is in Beaumont, Texas\n   - Purdue University Northwest has campuses in Hammond\
      \ and Westville, Indiana\n\n2. Now, I need to determine which one is further\
      \ east.\n\nIn the United States, going from west to east:\n- Texas is generally\
      \ in the south-central part of the US\n- Indiana is in the Midwest, and is generally\
      \ east of Texas\n\nHowever, Texas is a large state that extends quite far east,\
      \ and Indiana is not on the East Coast. I need to be more precise about the\
      \ specific locations of these universities.\n\n3. Let's think about the longitude\
      \ (east-west position):\n   - Beaumont, TX (where Lamar University is located)\
      \ is in the far eastern part of Texas, near the Louisiana border.\n   - Hammond\
      \ and Westville, IN (where Purdue University Northwest campuses are) are in\
      \ the northwestern part of Indiana, near Chicago and Lake Michigan.\n\nTo be\
      \ more precise, I need to compare the approximate longitudes:\n   - Beaumont,\
      \ TX is at approximately 94.1\xB0 W longitude\n   - Hammond, IN is at approximately\
      \ 87.5\xB0 W longitude\n   - Westville, IN is at approximately 86.9\xB0 W longitude\n\
      \n4. Comparing these longitudes:\n   - Lower numbers of western longitude (\xB0\
      W) indicate more eastern locations\n   - 94.1\xB0 W (Lamar) is a higher number\
      \ than 87.5\xB0 W or 86.9\xB0 W (Purdue Northwest)\n   - Therefore, Lamar University\
      \ is further west than Purdue University Northwest\n\nSince Lamar University\
      \ is at 94.1\xB0 W and Purdue University Northwest is at approximately 87.5\xB0\
      \ W (Hammond) or 86.9\xB0 W (Westville), and smaller western longitude numbers\
      \ mean further east, Purdue University Northwest is east of Lamar University.\n\
      \nWait, I need to be careful here. The question asks if Lamar University is\
      \ east of Purdue University Northwest. Since Purdue University Northwest is\
      \ further east (has a smaller western longitude), Lamar University is NOT east\
      \ of Purdue University Northwest. Rather, Lamar University is west of Purdue\
      \ University Northwest.\n\nActually, let me double-check. I think I made a mistake\
      \ in my reasoning.\n\nLooking at a US map:\n- Texas is in the south-central\
      \ US\n- Indiana is in the Midwest, further east than Texas\n\nBeaumont, TX (Lamar\
      \ University) is in the far eastern part of Texas, but even the easternmost\
      \ part of Texas is still west of Indiana.\n\nThe longitude coordinates confirm\
      \ this:\n- Beaumont, TX: ~94.1\xB0 W\n- Hammond/Westville, IN: ~87.5\xB0 W or\
      \ ~86.9\xB0 W\n\nSince 94.1 > 87.5 or 86.9, and we're talking about western\
      \ longitude (\xB0W), that means:\n- The higher number (94.1) is further west\n\
      - The lower number (87.5 or 86.9) is further east\n\nTherefore, Purdue University\
      \ Northwest (in Indiana) is east of Lamar University (in Texas), not the other\
      \ way around.\n\nSo, is Lamar University, TX located east of Purdue University\
      \ Northwest, IN?\nThe answer is NO.</think># Is Lamar University, TX located\
      \ east of Purdue University Northwest, IN?\n\nI need to determine the relative\
      \ east-west positions of these two universities.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the\
      \ locations\n- Lamar University is in Beaumont, Texas (eastern Texas)\n- Purdue\
      \ University Northwest is in Indiana (specifically Hammond and Westville)\n\n\
      ## Step 2: Compare longitudes\n- Beaumont, TX is approximately at 94.1\xB0 W\
      \ longitude\n- Hammond/Westville, IN is approximately at 87.5\xB0 W longitude\n\
      \n## Step 3: Analyze the coordinates\n- For western longitudes (\xB0W), smaller\
      \ numbers indicate more eastern locations\n- 94.1\xB0 W (Lamar) is a larger\
      \ number than 87.5\xB0 W (Purdue Northwest)\n- Therefore, Lamar University is\
      \ located WEST of Purdue University Northwest\n\n## Answer: NO\n\nLamar University\

      To solve this, I need to compare the geographic locations of these two universities.
      Specifically, I''ll need to determine their relative east-west positions by
      comparing their longitudes.


      First, let me recall the locations:


      1. Aurora University is in Aurora, Illinois (IL)

      2. University of Findlay is in Findlay, Ohio (OH)


      Now I need to think about the geographic relationship between Illinois and Ohio.
      In the United States, Illinois is generally west of Ohio. Ohio borders Lake
      Erie to the north and the Ohio River to the south, and is part of the eastern
      Midwest. Illinois is further west in the Midwest region, bordering the Mississippi
      River on its western edge.


      Since Aurora, IL would be in Illinois and Findlay, OH would be in Ohio, and
      Illinois is west of Ohio, Aurora University would be west of the University
      of Findlay.


      So, is Aurora University, IL located east of University of Findlay, OH?


      No, Aurora University is not east of the University of Findlay. It''s west of
      it, since Illinois is west of Ohio.


      Just to double-check: Illinois is west of Indiana, and Indiana is west of Ohio.
      So Illinois is definitely west of Ohio, meaning Aurora University in Illinois
      is west of the University of Findlay in Ohio.</think># Determining if Aurora
      University, IL is east of University of Findlay, OH


      I need to compare the geographic locations of these two universities by determining
      their relative east-west positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Aurora University is in Aurora, Illinois (IL)

      - University of Findlay is in Findlay, Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      In the United States, Illinois is located to the west of Ohio. The general geographic
      arrangement from west to east is:

      - Illinois

      - Indiana (between Illinois and Ohio)

      - Ohio


      ## Step 3: Apply this geographic relationship to the universities

      Since Aurora University is in Illinois, and the University of Findlay is in
      Ohio, Aurora University must be located to the west of the University of Findlay.


      Therefore, Aurora University is NOT located east of the University of Findlay.

      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the United States,

      So geographically speaking, Purdue University Fort Wayne in Indiana would be
      located to the west of Kean University in New Jersey.


      Since the question asks if Purdue University Fort Wayne is east of Kean University,
      and I''ve determined that it''s actually west of Kean University, the answer
      is NO.</think># Is Purdue University Fort Wayne, IN located east of Kean University,
      NJ?


      Let me think about the geographical locations of these universities:


      1) Purdue University Fort Wayne is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN)

      2) Kean University is located in New Jersey (NJ)

      3) In the United States, Indiana is in the Midwest region

      4) New Jersey is on the East Coast along the Atlantic Ocean

      5) States on the East Coast (like NJ) are generally east of Midwestern states
      (like IN)

      6) Even though Fort Wayne is in northeastern Indiana, it''s still significantly
      west of New Jersey


      Therefore, Purdue University Fort Wayne in Indiana is located WEST of Kean University
      in New Jersey, not east of it.

      \ College is in Georgia (GA)\n   - National Defense University is in Washington,\
      \ DC (District of Columbia)\n\n2. To determine if one location is east of another,\
      \ I need to compare their longitudes. East-west positions are measured by longitude,\

      \n3. Let me recall the approximate geographical positions:\n   - Georgia is\
      \ a state in the southeastern United States\n   - Washington, DC is on the eastern\
      \ seaboard, but north of Georgia\n\n4. In terms of east-west positioning:\n\
      \   - Washington, DC is approximately at longitude 77\xB0 W (west)\n   - Georgia\

      \ locations\n- Central Georgia Technical College is in Georgia (GA), in the\
      \ southeastern United States\n- National Defense University is in Washington,\
      \ DC, on the east coast\n\n## Step 2: Consider longitudinal positions\n- Washington,\
      \ DC is located at approximately 77\xB0 West longitude\n- Central Georgia (the\
      \ middle part of Georgia state) is located at approximately 83-84\xB0 West longitude\n\
      \n## Step 3: Compare the longitudes\n- For longitude in the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ smaller negative numbers (or smaller \"West\" values) indicate more easterly\
      \ locations\n- 77\xB0 W (Washington DC) is a smaller number than 83-84\xB0 W\
      \ (Central Georgia)\n- Therefore, Washington DC is further east than Central\
      \ Georgia\n\n## Step 4: Draw conclusion\nSince National Defense University is\
      \ in DC, which is further east than Central Georgia Technical College, Central\
      \ Georgia Technical College cannot be east of National Defense University.\n\
      \nNO, Central Georgia Technical College is not located east of National Defense\

      \ on the Atlantic Ocean and western coast on the Pacific Ocean. \n\nWashington,\
      \ DC is located on the eastern part of the United States, roughly at longitude\
      \ 77\xB0 W.\nMassachusetts is also on the eastern coast of the United States,\
      \ but typically further north than DC, with Boston (the main city in Massachusetts)\
      \ roughly at longitude 71\xB0 W.\n\nSince lower longitude numbers (less negative\
      \ or smaller in absolute value) in the Western Hemisphere indicate more easterly\
      \ positions, Massachusetts would generally be east of Washington, DC.\n\nStep\
      \ 3: Make the final determination.\nBased on the general geographic understanding,\
      \ Middlesex University in Massachusetts would be east of George Washington University\
      \ in DC.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be NO, George Washington University\
      \ School of Nursing, DC is NOT located east of Middlesex University, MA. Rather,\
      \ it would be west of it.\n\nHowever, let me double-check this because there\
      \ might be specific campus locations that could change this assessment.\n\n\
      Upon further consideration, I need to verify if Middlesex University in MA actually\
      \ exists. I'm familiar with Middlesex County in Massachusetts, and there are\
      \ institutions like Middlesex Community College, but I'm not immediately certain\
      \ about a \"Middlesex University\" in Massachusetts.\n\nAfter reflection, I\
      \ believe the question might be referring to Middlesex Community College in\
      \ Massachusetts. If that's the case, my reasoning still holds - institutions\
      \ in Massachusetts are generally east of those in Washington, DC.\n\nSo my answer\
      \ remains NO - George Washington University School of Nursing in DC is NOT east\
      \ of Middlesex University/College in MA.\n\nActually, let me be more precise\
      \ about this. The east coast of the US runs roughly northeast to southwest.\
      \ Washington DC is south of Massachusetts, but also slightly west of it. \n\n\
      Washington, DC is approximately at:\n- Latitude: 38.9\xB0 N\n- Longitude: 77.0\xB0\
      \ W\n\nBoston, MA (as a reference point in Massachusetts) is approximately at:\n\
      - Latitude: 42.4\xB0 N\n- Longitude: 71.1\xB0 W\n\nSince the longitude of DC\
      \ (77.0\xB0 W) has a larger westward value than Massachusetts (71.1\xB0 W),\
      \ DC is west of Massachusetts.\n\nTherefore, George Washington University School\
      \ of Nursing in DC would be west of Middlesex University/College in Massachusetts,\
      \ not east of it.\n\nSo the answer is NO.</think># Step by Step Reasoning\n\n\
      To answer this question, I need to compare the geographic locations of both\

      \ the locations\n- George Washington University School of Nursing is located\
      \ in Washington, DC (District of Columbia)\n- Middlesex University (or Middlesex\
      \ Community College) is located in Massachusetts (MA)\n\n## Step 2: Determine\
      \ east-west positioning\nOn a map of the United States, locations are measured\
      \ by longitude, with lower west longitude numbers indicating more easterly positions.\n\
      \n- Washington, DC is approximately at longitude 77\xB0 W\n- Massachusetts locations\
      \ are approximately at longitude 71\xB0 W\n\n## Step 3: Compare the longitudes\n\
      Since 71\xB0 W is less than 77\xB0 W, Massachusetts is east of Washington, DC.\n\
      \n## Step 4: Reach conclusion\nSince Massachusetts is east of DC, Middlesex\

      \ School of Nursing is in DC (District of Columbia, Washington DC)\n- Middlesex\
      \ University is in MA (Massachusetts)\n\nStep 2: Determine the relative east-west\
      \ positioning of these locations.\nLet me think about the general geography\
      \ of the eastern United States:\n- Massachusetts (MA) is in the northeastern\
      \ United States\n- Washington DC is in the mid-Atlantic region\n\nIn terms of\
      \ east-west positioning on a map of the United States:\n- Washington DC is roughly\
      \ at longitude around 77\xB0 W\n- Massachusetts locations are typically around\
      \ 71-73\xB0 W longitude\n\nSince longitude increases as you go west, a smaller\
      \ longitude number (less negative in the western hemisphere) means further east.\n\
      \nSo Massachusetts is generally east of Washington DC.\n\nStep 3: Verify this\
      \ with more specific information about these institutions.\n\nGeorge Washington\
      \ University School of Nursing is located in Washington DC, which is at approximately\
      \ 77\xB0 W longitude.\n\nFor Middlesex University in MA, I need to be a bit\
      \ careful. There is a Middlesex University in the UK, but the question specifies\
      \ Middlesex University in MA. In Massachusetts, there are institutions like\
      \ Middlesex Community College, but I'm not aware of a \"Middlesex University\"\
      \ specifically in Massachusetts.\n\nAssuming the question is referring to Middlesex\
      \ Community College or a similar institution in Middlesex County, MA, these\
      \ would be located in eastern Massachusetts, which would put them at approximately\
      \ 71-72\xB0 W longitude.\n\nSince 71-72\xB0 W (Massachusetts) is a smaller number\
      \ than 77\xB0 W (Washington DC), and smaller western longitude means further\
      \ east, Middlesex University in MA would be east of George Washington University\
      \ School of Nursing in DC.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nGeorge Washington University\
      \ School of Nursing in DC is west of Middlesex University (or Middlesex Community\
      \ College) in MA, not east of it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO.\n\nActually,\
      \ I should double check if there really is a Middlesex University in Massachusetts\
      \ before finalizing my answer. Let me think...\n\nIn the United States, I'm\
      \ not aware of a \"Middlesex University\" in Massachusetts. There is:\n- Middlesex\
      \ Community College in Massachusetts\n- Middlesex County College in New Jersey\n\
      \nBut not specifically a \"Middlesex University\" in Massachusetts that I know\
      \ of.\n\nThe well-known Middlesex University is in London, UK.\n\nIf the question\
      \ is referring to Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts, then my reasoning\
      \ stands - Massachusetts is east of Washington DC, so George Washington University\
      \ School of Nursing in DC would be west of any institution in Massachusetts.\n\
      \nIf there's a specific \"Middlesex University\" in Massachusetts that I'm not\
      \ familiar with, it would still be in Massachusetts, which is east of Washington\
      \ DC.\n\nMy answer remains NO - George Washington University School of Nursing\

      Dearborn is located in Dearborn, Michigan (MI)\n- Shaw University is located\
      \ in Raleigh, North Carolina (NC)\n\nStep 2: Now I need to determine the relative\
      \ east-west positioning of these locations.\nIn the United States, points further\
      \ east have lower longitude values. For example, New York on the east coast\
      \ has a longitude around 74\xB0 West, while Los Angeles on the west coast has\
      \ a longitude around 118\xB0 West.\n\nLet me recall the approximate longitudes\
      \ of Michigan and North Carolina:\n- Michigan is in the Midwest region of the\
      \ US.\n- North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard of the US.\n\nGenerally speaking,\
      \ North Carolina is further east than Michigan. The eastern edge of the US is\
      \ the Atlantic Ocean, and North Carolina borders this ocean, while Michigan\
      \ is further inland.\n\nLet me try to be more precise:\n- Dearborn, MI is in\
      \ the southeastern part of Michigan, near Detroit.\n- Raleigh, NC (where Shaw\
      \ University is located) is in the central part of North Carolina.\n\nEven though\
      \ Dearborn is in the eastern part of Michigan, North Carolina as a whole is\
      \ significantly further east than Michigan.\n\nThe approximate longitude of\
      \ Dearborn, MI should be around 83\xB0 West.\nThe approximate longitude of Raleigh,\
      \ NC should be around 78\xB0 West.\n\nSince 78\xB0 West is a smaller number\
      \ than 83\xB0 West (meaning less west, or more east), Shaw University in Raleigh,\
      \ NC is east of University of Michigan\u2013Dearborn, MI.\n\nTherefore, University\
      \ of Michigan\u2013Dearborn is NOT located east of Shaw University. Rather,\
      \ it's the opposite: Shaw University is east of University of Michigan\u2013\
      Dearborn.\n\nThe answer is NO.\n\nLet me double-check by thinking about the\
      \ map of the United States. If we look at a map, Michigan is in the Great Lakes\
      \ region toward the middle of the country (though still in the eastern half),\

      \ This confirms my answer.</think># Is University of Michigan\u2013Dearborn,\

      To solve this problem, I need to know the relative east-west positions of these
      two universities. In the United States, we can determine this by looking at
      the longitudes of the locations. Lower (more negative) longitude numbers indicate
      locations further west, while higher (less negative or positive) longitude numbers
      indicate locations further east.


      Let me think about the general locations of these states first:

      - Kansas (KS) is a Midwestern state

      - Mississippi (MS) is a Southern state that borders the Gulf of Mexico


      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - Kansas is generally considered to be in the central part of the country

      - Mississippi is in the southeastern United States


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, Mississippi is significantly east of
      Kansas. The Mississippi River largely forms the eastern border of the state
      of Mississippi, and Kansas is well west of the Mississippi River.


      If we look at a map of the US, we would find that Mississippi is several states
      east of Kansas. So any location in Mississippi, including Alcorn State University,
      would generally be east of any location in Kansas, including Ottawa University.


      Therefore, Ottawa University in Kansas is NOT east of Alcorn State University
      in Mississippi. Instead, Ottawa University is WEST of Alcorn State University.


      The answer is NO, Ottawa University, KS is not located east of Alcorn State
      University, MS. It is actually located west of it.</think># Is Ottawa University,
      KS located east of Alcorn State University, MS?


      To determine this, I need to consider the geographical locations of Kansas and
      Mississippi within the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations of these states.

      - Kansas (KS) is located in the Midwestern United States

      - Mississippi (MS) is located in the Southeastern United States


      Step 2: Consider their east-west positioning.

      - Mississippi is significantly east of Kansas

      - Kansas is in the central part of the country, while Mississippi is closer
      to the eastern seaboard


      Step 3: Compare the specific universities'' locations.

      - Ottawa University is in Kansas, which is further west

      - Alcorn State University is in Mississippi, which is further east


      Since Kansas is west of Mississippi, Ottawa University must be west (not east)
      of Alcorn State University.

      The United States generally has states arranged with western states on the left
      (west) and eastern states on the right (east).


      Let me think about the relative positions of Kansas and Mississippi:

      - Kansas is located in the central part of the United States

      - Mississippi is located in the southeastern part of the United States


      Geographically, Mississippi is east of Kansas. This means that locations in
      Mississippi are generally east of locations in Kansas.


      So, Ottawa University in Kansas would be west of Alcorn State University in
      Mississippi, not east of it.


      To be more precise:

      - Ottawa, KS is in eastern Kansas

      - Alcorn State University is in southwestern Mississippi


      But even though Ottawa is in eastern Kansas, Kansas as a whole is still west
      of Mississippi as a whole. The easternmost part of Kansas is still west of the

      \ California South Bay University is in California, specifically in the South\

      - Mountain states (Denver): around 105\xB0 W longitude\n- West Coast (Los Angeles):\

      \ it has a higher western longitude (more negative number) than Montana which\
      \ is in the Rocky Mountain region. \n\nCalifornia's longitude is approximately\
      \ 118\xB0-124\xB0 W, while Montana's longitude is approximately 104\xB0-116\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nSince a smaller western longitude (less negative number) means more\
      \ eastern, and Montana has a smaller western longitude than California, Montana\
      \ State University would be east of California South Bay University, not the\
      \ other way around.\n\nActually, let me double-check this. California is on\
      \ the west coast, and Montana is inland to the east of California. So Montana\
      \ is east of California. But the question is asking if California South Bay\

      \ is in Bozeman, Montana, which is at approximately 111\xB0 W longitude.\n\n\
      California South Bay University - I need to find its exact location. However,\
      \ I'm not immediately familiar with a university by this exact name in California's\
      \ South Bay area. The major universities in that region include Stanford University,\
      \ Santa Clara University, San Jose State University, etc.\n\nLet me reconsider\
      \ this. If \"California South Bay University\" exists, it would be in California's\
      \ South Bay region, which is definitely on the West Coast. Montana is east of\
      \ California. \n\nNow, to be absolutely clear: When we say \"east of\", it means\
      \ having a smaller western longitude (being more to the east on a map).\n\n\
      Montana State University (Bozeman, MT): ~111\xB0 W longitude\nCalifornia South\
      \ Bay (San Jose area): ~121\xB0 W longitude\n\nSince 111\xB0 W is a smaller\
      \ number than 121\xB0 W, Montana State University is located east of where California\
      \ South Bay University would be.\n\nTherefore, California South Bay University,\
      \ CA is NOT located east of Montana State University, MT. Instead, it is located\
      \ west of Montana State University.\n\nLet me double-check this once more.\n\
      \nActually, let me be even more careful. Longitude increases as you go east\
      \ from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude), but in North America, we're dealing\
      \ with western longitudes which are negative. So a more negative number (or\
      \ a larger western longitude) is further west.\n\nMontana State University (Bozeman,\
      \ MT): approximately 111\xB0 W longitude\nCalifornia's South Bay region: approximately\
      \ 121\xB0 W longitude\n\nSince 111\xB0 W is less negative than 121\xB0 W, Montana\
      \ State University is indeed east of the California South Bay region where California\
      \ South Bay University would be located.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO, California\
      \ South Bay University, CA is not located east of Montana State University,\
      \ MT.\n\nActually, I now realize I'm overthinking this in a way that might be\
      \ confusing. Let me simplify.\n\nThe continental United States spans from the\

      to determine the relative east-west positioning of two universities:

      1. California South Bay University in California (CA)

      2. Montana State University in Montana (MT)


      I''ll need to consider the geographical positions of these states and universities.


      First, let''s consider the locations of the states:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Montana is an inland state, located to the east of California


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), California is generally west
      of Montana. On a map of the US, California is farther to the west than Montana.


      Now, I need to consider the specific locations of these universities within
      their states.


      California South Bay University would be in the South Bay area of California,
      which typically refers to the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area. This
      would be in Northern/Central California, but still on the west coast.


      Montana State University is in Bozeman, Montana, which is in the southwestern
      part of Montana.


      Even though Montana State is in the western part of Montana, and California
      South Bay is not on the extreme western edge of California, the overall east-west
      relationship between these states means that Montana State University would
      still be east of any point in California.


      Therefore, California South Bay University is NOT located east of Montana State
      University. Rather, it''s the opposite - Montana State University is east of
      California South Bay University.


      Actually, let me check something first. I need to confirm that California South
      Bay University is a real institution, as I''m not immediately familiar with
      it by that name.


      Upon reflection, I''m not certain that "California South Bay University" is
      an accredited university in California. There are universities in the South
      Bay area of California (like San Jose State University), but I''m not immediately
      recognizing one called "California South Bay University."


      Regardless, any university in California would be west of Montana State University
      in Montana, because California is west of Montana.


      So, is California South Bay University, CA located east of Montana State University,
      MT?


      No, it would not be. California is west of Montana, so any university in California
      would be west (not east) of any university in Montana.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is California South Bay University, CA located east

      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' positions

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Montana
      is an inland state to the east of California.


      ## Step 2: Consider longitude (east-west positioning)

      The entire state of California lies to the west of Montana on a map of the United
      States. California''s eastern border is west of Montana''s western border.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific university locations

      California South Bay University would be in California''s South Bay region (regardless
      of whether this is a real institution). Any location in California is west of
      any location in Montana.


      Montana State University is located in Bozeman, Montana, in the western portion
      of that state.


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since California is entirely west of Montana, California South Bay University
      must be west (not east) of Montana State University.

      \ South Bay University is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of\
      \ the United States.\n- Montana State University is in Montana (MT), which is\
      \ in the northwestern United States.\n\nStep 2: Let me consider their relative\
      \ positions along the east-west axis.\n- California is located on the Pacific\
      \ coast, forming part of the western edge of the contiguous United States.\n\
      - Montana is an inland state, east of California, but still in the western United\
      \ States.\n\nStep 3: When we say \"east of\" in geography, we're comparing longitude\
      \ coordinates. Something that is \"east of\" another location has a higher longitude\
      \ value (moving from the 0\xB0 Prime Meridian toward 180\xB0 East).\n\nStep\
      \ 4: California is west of Montana, not east. Therefore, any location in California\
      \ would generally be west of (not east of) locations in Montana.\n\nStep 5:\
      \ To confirm this reasoning, California South Bay University (if it exists -\
      \ I should note I'm not immediately familiar with this specific institution)\
      \ would be in California, likely in the South Bay area (possibly referring to\
      \ the South Bay area of San Francisco Bay or Los Angeles). Either way, it would\
      \ be located in California, which is west of Montana.\n\nTherefore, California\
      \ South Bay University, CA is NOT located east of Montana State University,\
      \ MT. It is located WEST of Montana State University.\n\nThe answer is NO.\n\
      \nActually, let me double-check my understanding of US geography to be completely\
      \ sure.\n\nCalifornia is definitely on the west coast of the United States,\
      \ bordering the Pacific Ocean.\nMontana is an inland state in the northwestern\
      \ United States, east of Washington, Idaho, and Oregon, but west of states like\
      \ North Dakota.\n\nSo California is west of Montana, not east. This confirms\
      \ that California South Bay University (in California) would be west of Montana\
      \ State University (in Montana), not east of it.\n\nTherefore, my answer remains\
      \ NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine whether California South\

      \n2. Montana is an inland state in the northwestern United States, east of states\
      \ like Washington, Oregon, and California.\n\n3. When looking at a US map from\
      \ west to east, California is further west than Montana.\n\n4. Since California\
      \ South Bay University would be located in California, and Montana State University\
      \ in Montana, the California university must be west of the Montana university.\n\
      \n5. \"East of\" means a location with a higher longitude (further toward the\
      \ East). California has a lower longitude than Montana.\n\n# Answer: NO\n\n\

    e2e06f73-5ebb-4635-a086-f4b9e35bfb10: '<think>This question asks whether California
      South Bay University in California is located east of Montana State University
      in Montana. Let''s think about the geographic locations of these two states
      within the United States.


      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean
      on the west. In terms of states:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.

      - Montana is in the northwestern part of the United States, but it''s inland
      (not on the coast).


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - California is generally more western than Montana

      - This means California has a smaller longitude value (more negative or less
      positive) than Montana


      Since California is west of Montana, a university in California would be west
      of a university in Montana.


      So, California South Bay University in CA would be west of Montana State University
      in MT, not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think># Is California South Bay University, CA
      located east of Montana State University, MT?


      To solve this, I need to consider the geographic positions of California and
      Montana.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) California is located on the west coast of the United States, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean

      2) Montana is an inland state in the northwestern United States, but it is east
      of California

      3) California South Bay University would be in California, while Montana State
      University would be in Montana

      4) When comparing east-west positions in the US, locations in California are
      west of locations in Montana

      5) "East of" would mean California South Bay University would need to be to
      the right of Montana State University on a map, which is not the case


      ## Answer: NO


      California South Bay University is located WEST of Montana State University,
      not east of it.'

      \ to determine the locations of California South Bay University in California\
      \ and Montana State University in Montana, and then figure out which one is\
      \ farther east.\n\nFirst, let me think about the general geography of the United\
      \ States. California is on the west coast of the United States, while Montana\
      \ is an inland state in the western part of the country, but east of California.\n\
      \nNow, let's be more specific:\n\n1. California South Bay University would be\
      \ located in the South Bay area of California. The South Bay is typically referring\
      \ to the southern region of the San Francisco Bay Area, which includes cities\
      \ like San Jose, Santa Clara, etc. This would place California South Bay University\
      \ in western California.\n\n2. Montana State University is located in Bozeman,\
      \ Montana, which is in the southwestern part of Montana.\n\nNow, I need to compare\
      \ their longitudinal positions (east-west positioning):\n\n- California is west\
      \ of Montana on a map of the United States\n- The South Bay area of California\
      \ is on the western side of California\n- Bozeman, Montana (home of Montana\
      \ State University) is in the western part of Montana\n\nSince California is\
      \ west of Montana, and California South Bay University would be in California,\
      \ while Montana State University is in Montana, California South Bay University\
      \ would be west of Montana State University, not east of it.\n\nTo be even more\
      \ precise, let me consider the actual longitudes. The South Bay area of California\
      \ is roughly around 122\xB0 W longitude, while Bozeman, Montana is roughly around\
      \ 111\xB0 W longitude. A smaller western longitude number means farther east,\
      \ and since 111 is less than 122, Bozeman is east of the South Bay area.\n\n\
      To double-check, I should note that I'm assuming \"California South Bay University\"\
      \ refers to a university in the South Bay area of California. I'm not 100% certain\
      \ if there's a specific institution with exactly that name, but for the purposes\
      \ of this geographic reasoning, I'm assuming it's in the South Bay area of California.\n\
      \nSo, is California South Bay University located east of Montana State University?\
      \ No, it is not. California South Bay University would be located west of Montana\
      \ State University.\n\nWait, I should double check that California South Bay\
      \ University actually exists. If it doesn't exist, I'll have to make an assumption\
      \ based on the name.\n\nI'm not immediately familiar with a university specifically\
      \ named \"California South Bay University\" in the South Bay area of California.\
      \ There are universities in that region like San Jose State University, Santa\
      \ Clara University, and Stanford University, but I don't recall one with the\
      \ exact name \"California South Bay University.\"\n\nBut even if there isn't\
      \ a university with exactly that name, the question is asking about a university\
      \ in California's South Bay, which would still be west of Montana State University.\n\
      \nActually, let me check again. There might be a California South Bay University\
      \ that I'm not familiar with. If it exists, it would likely be in the South\
      \ Bay area of California, which includes cities like San Jose, Sunnyvale, Cupertino,\
      \ Santa Clara, etc.\n\nRegardless, any university in California's South Bay\
      \ would be west of Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana.\n\nSo my answer\
      \ remains: No, California South Bay University, CA is not located east of Montana\
      \ State University, MT. It would be located west of Montana State University.\n\
      \nHmm, let me double check if there is a California South Bay University.\n\n\
      Actually I don't think there is a university with that specific name. However,\
      \ the question seems to be using a hypothetical example, or possibly referring\
      \ to an institution with a slightly different name.\n\nRegardless of whether\
      \ the specific university exists, the geography is clear: any university in\
      \ California's South Bay would be west of Montana State University in Montana.\n\
      \nSo, the answer to the question \"Is California South Bay University, CA located\
      \ east of Montana State University, MT?\" is NO.\n\nActually, let's make absolutely\
      \ sure: I'm thinking of the locations on a map of the United States. Moving\
      \ from west to east:\n\n1. We start at the Pacific Ocean on the west coast.\n\
      2. Just east of the Pacific Ocean is California, including the South Bay area.\n\
      3. Further east, after several other states (Nevada, Utah, Idaho, etc.), we\
      \ reach Montana.\n\nSo California South Bay University (assuming it exists or\
      \ is hypothetical) would be west of Montana State University, not east of it.\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is: NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine\

      \ State University is located in Bozeman, Montana, in the southwestern part\
      \ of that state\n\n3) Comparing east-west positions:\n   - California's longitudinal\
      \ position is approximately 122\xB0 W\n   - Montana's longitudinal position\
      \ is approximately 111\xB0 W\n   - Since lower western longitude numbers indicate\

      1. University of Texas at Tyler is located in Tyler, Texas.

      2. Altamaha Technical College is located in Georgia (GA).


      To determine which one is east of the other, I need to know their approximate
      longitudes. In the United States, eastern locations have lower longitude values
      than western locations.


      Let me think about the general geographic locations:

      - Texas is in the southern central part of the US

      - Georgia is in the southeastern US, bordering the Atlantic Ocean


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Texas. So Altamaha Technical College
      in Georgia would be east of the University of Texas at Tyler.


      Let me double-check my geographical knowledge:

      - Georgia is one of the states on the eastern seaboard of the US, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Texas is west of Georgia, and doesn''t border the Atlantic Ocean.


      This confirms that Georgia is east of Texas. Therefore, Altamaha Technical College
      in Georgia would be east of the University of Texas at Tyler in Texas.


      So the answer to "Is University of Texas at Tyler, TX located east of Altamaha
      Technical College, GA?" would be NO, because the University of Texas at Tyler

      So the answer is NO.</think># Is University of Texas at Tyler, TX located east

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic

      - Altamaha Technical College locations are at approximately 82\xB0 W longitude\n\
      \nAnd since smaller longitude values in the western hemisphere indicate more\

      \ Pacific coast and inland\n- Central/Midwestern states in the middle\n\nVermont\
      \ (VT) is in the northeastern United States, specifically in New England. It\
      \ borders New York to its west, Massachusetts to its south, New Hampshire to\
      \ its east, and Canada to its north.\n\nAlabama (AL) is in the southeastern\
      \ United States. It's part of the Deep South region and borders Tennessee to\
      \ the north, Georgia to the east, Florida to the south, and Mississippi to the\

      - Vermont is quite far east, being in New England near the Atlantic coast\n\
      - Alabama is also in the eastern half of the country, but is more central/southern\n\
      \nTo determine which is further east, I need to consider their approximate longitudes.\

      \ has a smaller western longitude (around 72-73\xB0 W) compared to Alabama (around\
      \ 85-88\xB0 W), Vermont is further east than Alabama.\n\nTherefore, Air University\

      To determine if Air University in Alabama is east of Community College of Vermont\

      \ at Arlington (specifically, its School of Architecture)\n2. The geographical\
      \ location of University Center Rochester in Minnesota\n3. Compare their east-west\
      \ positioning (longitude)\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. University of Texas at Arlington\
      \ School of Architecture:\n   - Located in Arlington, Texas\n   - Arlington\
      \ is in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area in Texas\n   - Texas is in the\

      \   - Located in Rochester, Minnesota\n   - Minnesota is in the northern central\
      \ part of the United States, bordering Canada\n\nNow, to determine east-west\
      \ positioning, I need to think about their relative longitudes:\n\nIn the United\
      \ States, generally:\n- The East Coast is at approximately 70-80 degrees West\
      \ longitude\n- The central part of the country is roughly 90-100 degrees West\n\
      - The West Coast is roughly 120-125 degrees West\n\nMinnesota is in the upper\

      \ longitude.\n\nTexas is more southern, and Arlington, TX would be approximately\
      \ around 97-98 degrees West longitude.\n\nSince a smaller number of degrees\
      \ West indicates a more eastern location, and Minnesota (\u224892-93\xB0W) has\

      - Minnesota is quite far north but also extends relatively far east in the north-central\

      \ \u2192 YES\nIf the University of Texas at Arlington is west of University\

      \ positioning (longitude):\n- Rochester, MN is approximately at 92.5\xB0W longitude\n\
      - Arlington, TX is approximately at 97.1\xB0W longitude\n\nSince the smaller\

      Springs


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions
      of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Los Angeles Recording School is in Los Angeles, California

      - University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is in Colorado Springs, Colorado


      ## Step 2: Consider US geography from west to east

      The United States generally runs from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east), with:

      - California on the west coast

      - Colorado in the interior, in the Rocky Mountain region


      ## Step 3: Compare the locations

      California is located to the west of Colorado on the US map. Los Angeles is
      in western California, while Colorado Springs is in central Colorado.


      ## Conclusion

      Los Angeles Recording School is located WEST of the University of Colorado at
      Colorado Springs, not east.


      NO'

      to compare the locations of two schools:

      1. Los Angeles Recording School, CA

      2. University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, CO


      I need to figure out if the Los Angeles Recording School is east of the University
      of Colorado at Colorado Springs.


      First, let me think about where these places are located geographically:


      1. Los Angeles is on the west coast of the United States, in California.

      2. Colorado Springs is in Colorado, which is in the central/mountain west region
      of the United States.


      Looking at a map of the United States, California is located to the west of
      Colorado. Los Angeles is in southern California, while Colorado Springs is in
      central Colorado.


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude):

      - Los Angeles is further west than Colorado Springs

      - Colorado Springs is further east than Los Angeles


      Since the question asks if Los Angeles Recording School is east of University
      of Colorado at Colorado Springs, the answer is NO, because Los Angeles is west
      of Colorado Springs, not east of it.


      To double-check this: If you travel from the west coast (Pacific Ocean) toward
      the east coast (Atlantic Ocean) of the United States, you would encounter Los
      Angeles before you would encounter Colorado Springs. This confirms that Los
      Angeles is west of Colorado Springs, not east of it.</think># Is Los Angeles
      Recording School, CA located east of University of Colorado, at Colorado Springs,
      CO?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Los Angeles Recording School is in Los Angeles, California

      - University of Colorado at Colorado Springs is in Colorado Springs, Colorado


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographical positions

      - Los Angeles is on the west coast of the United States

      - Colorado Springs is in the central/mountain region of the United States

      - California is west of Colorado on a map of the United States


      ## Step 3: Consider east-west positioning

      When looking at a US map, you can clearly see that Colorado is east of California.
      Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter Los Angeles
      before Colorado Springs.


      NO - Los Angeles Recording School is NOT east of University of Colorado at Colorado
      Springs. It is actually west of it.'

      \ whether National Hispanic University, CA is located east of Utah State University\
      \ Eastern, UT. I'll need to consider the geographical locations of these two\
      \ universities.\n\nFirst, let me figure out where these two universities are\
      \ located:\n\n1. National Hispanic University, CA: Based on the name, it's in\
      \ California. California is a state on the west coast of the United States.\n\
      \n2. Utah State University Eastern, UT: Based on the name, it's in Utah. Utah\
      \ is a state in the western United States, located east of California.\n\nNow,\
      \ to determine if National Hispanic University is east of Utah State University\
      \ Eastern, I need to know more specifically where these universities are located\
      \ within their respective states.\n\nCalifornia is generally west of Utah. California's\
      \ eastern border touches Nevada, which then borders Utah on the west. So, generally\
      \ speaking, a location in California would be west of a location in Utah.\n\n\
      Given this geographical arrangement, it's highly unlikely that National Hispanic\
      \ University in California is east of Utah State University Eastern in Utah.\
      \ In fact, I believe the answer is \"NO,\" but let me confirm by checking the\
      \ specific locations of these universities.\n\nNational Hispanic University\
      \ was a university located in San Jose, California. San Jose is in the western\
      \ part of California, near the San Francisco Bay.\n\nUtah State University Eastern\
      \ is in Price, Utah. Price is in eastern Utah.\n\nGiven these locations, let's\
      \ confirm the relative east-west positioning:\n\nSan Jose, CA is approximately\
      \ at longitude 121.9\xB0 W.\nPrice, UT is approximately at longitude 110.8\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nThe longitude values tell us how far east or west a location is. A higher\
      \ (less negative) longitude value indicates a more eastern location. \n\nSo,\
      \ comparing the two: \n- 121.9\xB0 W (San Jose, CA) is more negative than 110.8\xB0\
      \ W (Price, UT).\n- This means San Jose, CA is west of Price, UT.\n- Therefore,\
      \ National Hispanic University, CA is west of Utah State University Eastern,\
      \ UT.\n\nSo, the answer is NO, National Hispanic University, CA is NOT located\
      \ east of Utah State University Eastern, UT. It is, in fact, west of it.\n\n\
      Actually, let me double-check this, because I think I may have misremembered\
      \ the longitude convention. \n\nLongitude ranges from -180\xB0 (west) to +180\xB0\
      \ (east), with 0\xB0 at the Prime Meridian (which passes through Greenwich,\
      \ London). In the western hemisphere, longitudes are negative, and the more\
      \ negative a longitude is, the more westward the location. \n\nSo, let's check\
      \ again:\n- San Jose, CA: approx. -121.9\xB0 (or 121.9\xB0 W)\n- Price, UT:\
      \ approx. -110.8\xB0 (or 110.8\xB0 W)\n\nSince -121.9\xB0 is more negative than\
      \ -110.8\xB0, San Jose, CA is more westward than Price, UT.\n\nAlso, as a sanity\
      \ check, we know that California is on the west coast of the US, and Utah is\
      \ an inland state east of California (with Nevada in between). So, it makes\
      \ sense that a university in California would be west of a university in Utah.\n\
      \nTherefore, I'm reaffirming: NO, National Hispanic University, CA is NOT located\
      \ east of Utah State University Eastern, UT.\n\nActually, let me be absolutely\
      \ certain about this. Let's review the geography once more:\n\n- The United\
      \ States spans from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean on the\
      \ east.\n- California is a state on the west coast, touching the Pacific Ocean.\n\
      - Utah is a state located inland, east of California (with Nevada in between).\n\
      - San Jose, CA is in the western part of California.\n- Price, UT is in the\
      \ eastern part of Utah.\n\nGiven this arrangement, it's impossible for San Jose,\
      \ CA to be east of Price, UT. It's much more westward.\n\nSo, my final answer\
      \ is NO, National Hispanic University, CA is NOT located east of Utah State\
      \ University Eastern, UT.</think># Is National Hispanic University, CA located\

      - West Coast states\n- Mountain states\n- Midwest states (including Indiana)\n\

      \ Therefore, Indiana University Fort Wayne is west of Darul Uloom Al-Madania,\
      \ not east of it.\n\nThe answer is NO, Indiana University Fort Wayne is not\
      \ located east of Darul Uloom Al-Madania. It is located west of it.\n\nLet me\
      \ double-check my logic:\n\nOn a conventional map with north at the top:\n-\
      \ Indiana is to the left (west) of New York\n- New York is to the right (east)\
      \ of Indiana\n\nSo a location in Indiana would be west of a location in New\

      \ located east of Darul Uloom Al-Madania, NY.\n\nActually I realized I should\
      \ be even more careful. Let me think about this once more.\n\nI know:\n1. Indiana\
      \ University Fort Wayne is in Fort Wayne, Indiana\n2. Darul Uloom Al-Madania\
      \ is somewhere in New York state\n\nFort Wayne, Indiana is in the northeastern\
      \ part of Indiana, so it's relatively eastern for Indiana. New York state extends\
      \ quite far west, with its western border being around Buffalo and Niagara Falls.\n\
      \nHowever, even the westernmost part of New York state is still east of the\
      \ easternmost part of Indiana:\n- Western New York (around Buffalo) is at about\
      \ 79\xB0W longitude\n- Eastern Indiana (including Fort Wayne) is at about 85\xB0\
      W longitude\n\nSince lower longitude numbers in the Western Hemisphere represent\
      \ more eastern locations (closer to the Prime Meridian), and New York has lower\
      \ longitude values than Indiana, locations in New York are east of locations\
      \ in Indiana.\n\nTherefore, Indiana University Fort Wayne (in Indiana) is west\

      To answer whether New Mexico Highlands University is east of Texas A&M University-San
      Antonio, I need to:

      1. Identify the location of New Mexico Highlands University in New Mexico

      2. Identify the location of Texas A&M University-San Antonio in Texas

      3. Compare their east-west positions (longitude)


      Step 1: Location of New Mexico Highlands University

      New Mexico Highlands University is located in Las Vegas, New Mexico (not to
      be confused with Las Vegas, Nevada). Las Vegas, NM is in the northeastern part
      of New Mexico.


      Step 2: Location of Texas A&M University-San Antonio

      Texas A&M University-San Antonio is located in San Antonio, Texas. San Antonio
      is in south-central Texas.


      Step 3: Comparing east-west positions

      Now I need to compare their geographic positions, specifically whether New Mexico
      Highlands University is east of Texas A&M University-San Antonio.


      Looking at a map of the United States, New Mexico is directly west of Texas.
      New Mexico shares its eastern border with Texas''s western border. Generally

      - Las Vegas, NM (home of NM Highlands) is in northeastern New Mexico

      - San Antonio, TX is in south-central Texas


      ## Step 4: Determine relative positions

      Even though Las Vegas, NM is in the eastern part of New Mexico, it still lies

      to identify the locations of both institutions and determine if St. Catharine
      College in Kentucky is located east of SUNY Canton in New York.


      First, let me determine where each college is located:


      1. St. Catharine College, KY - This college would be in Kentucky, which is in
      the eastern United States, but west of New York state.


      2. State University of New York at Canton, NY - This is in New York state, in
      the northeastern United States.


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider the geographical orientation
      of the United States. The eastern coast of the United States includes states
      like Maine, Massachusetts, New York, etc. As you move west, you encounter states
      like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, etc.


      New York is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Kentucky
      is an inland state that''s west of states like West Virginia and Virginia, which
      themselves are west of New York.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), New York is east of Kentucky.
      This means that SUNY Canton, being in New York, would be east of St. Catharine
      College, which is in Kentucky.


      Therefore, St. Catharine College, KY is NOT located east of State University
      of New York at Canton, NY. St. Catharine College is west of SUNY Canton.


      The answer is: NO</think># Is St. Catharine College, KY located east of State
      University of New York at Canton, NY?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two colleges by
      looking at their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      - Kentucky (KY) is located in the eastern part of the central United States.

      - New York (NY) is located in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positioning.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, New York is significantly further east
      than Kentucky.

      - New York borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast.

      - Kentucky is inland and west of New York.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific colleges.

      - SUNY Canton is in New York state, so it inherits New York''s eastern position.

      - St. Catharine College is in Kentucky, so it inherits Kentucky''s more western
      position.


      NO - St. Catharine College in Kentucky is NOT located east of SUNY Canton in
      New York. It is located to the west.'

      \nGiven this general geography, it's very likely that St. Catharine College\

      \ answer should be NO, St. Catharine College in KY is NOT located east of State\
      \ University of New York at Canton, NY. It's located to the west.\n\nActually,\
      \ let me double-check by thinking about the approximate longitude coordinates\

      \ 74-79\xB0 W, with eastern parts of New York having lower values (more easterly).\n\
      \nKentucky is inland and has longitudes around 82-89\xB0 W.\n\nSo even the easternmost\
      \ part of Kentucky is likely to be west of the westernmost part of New York.\n\
      \nCanton, NY is in the northern part of New York state. St. Catharine, KY would\
      \ be in Kentucky.\n\nBased on these general locations, St. Catharine College\
      \ is almost certainly west of SUNY Canton, not east.\n\nSo my answer is NO.\n\
      \nLet me double-check this by looking more carefully at these specific locations.\n\

      \ Kentucky, but it should be in Kentucky, which is entirely west of New York.\
      \ Even the easternmost point of Kentucky is going to be west of Canton, NY.\n\
      \nLet's say St. Catharine College is in eastern Kentucky. Eastern Kentucky might\
      \ have a longitude around 82\xB0 W. This is still west of Canton, NY's 75.1692\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nChecking my knowledge for St. Catharine College, it is (or was, if it's\
      \ no longer operating) likely in Washington County, Kentucky, which is in the\
      \ central part of Kentucky. Central Kentucky would be even further west than\
      \ eastern Kentucky, probably around 85\xB0 W.\n\nSo, St. Catharine College in\
      \ KY, with a longitude of approximately 85\xB0 W, is west of SUNY Canton in\
      \ NY, with a longitude of approximately 75\xB0 W.\n\nTherefore, the answer is\
      \ definitively NO, St. Catharine College is NOT located east of SUNY Canton.\n\
      \nActually, let me look up more precise information about St. Catharine College.\
      \ It seems that St. Catharine College was located in Washington County, Kentucky,\
      \ near the town of Springfield. Springfield, KY has coordinates of approximately\

      of Premier Flight Academy


      Step 1: Locate Indiana University Northwest (IN)

      Indiana University Northwest is located in Gary, Indiana. Gary is in the northwestern
      part of Indiana, near the Illinois border and Lake Michigan.


      Step 2: Locate Premier Flight Academy (OH)

      Let me think about where Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio. Ohio is generally
      east of Indiana. Premier Flight Academy appears to be in Ohio, but I need to
      find its specific location. I believe Premier Flight Academy is located in Columbus,
      Ohio, but let me double-check.


      Actually, I''m not 100% certain of the exact location of Premier Flight Academy
      in Ohio. There may be multiple flight academies with similar names. But what
      I do know is that Ohio is positioned east of Indiana on the U.S. map.


      Step 3: Compare the locations

      Geographic orientation:

      - Indiana is west of Ohio

      - Gary, Indiana (where Indiana University Northwest is located) is in the northwestern
      part of Indiana

      - Ohio (where Premier Flight Academy is located) is east of Indiana


      Since Indiana is west of Ohio, and Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana,
      while Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio, Indiana University Northwest would
      be west of Premier Flight Academy, not east.


      Therefore, Indiana University Northwest (IN) is NOT located east of Premier
      Flight Academy (OH). It is located WEST of it.


      Wait, I should double-check my reasoning. The question is specifically about
      Indiana University Northwest in IN and Premier Flight Academy in OH.


      Indiana University Northwest is in Gary, Indiana, which is in the northwest
      part of Indiana.

      Ohio is generally east of Indiana.

      Premier Flight Academy in Ohio would be east of any location in Indiana.


      Therefore, Indiana University Northwest (in Indiana) would be WEST of Premier
      Flight Academy (in Ohio), not east.


      The answer is NO, Indiana University Northwest is not located east of Premier
      Flight Academy. It is located west of it.</think># Reasoning Step by Step


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Locate Indiana University Northwest (IN)

      Indiana University Northwest is located in Gary, Indiana, which is in the northwestern
      corner of Indiana state.


      ## Step 2: Locate Premier Flight Academy (OH)

      Premier Flight Academy is located in Ohio. Ohio state is positioned entirely
      east of Indiana on the US map.


      ## Step 3: Compare geographical positions

      Since:

      - Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana

      - Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio

      - Ohio is east of Indiana

      - Any location in Indiana would be west of any location in Ohio


      Therefore, Indiana University Northwest would be to the west of Premier Flight
      Academy, not to the east.


      # Answer: NO


      Indiana University Northwest is not located east of Premier Flight Academy.
      It is located west of it.'
    1c71fdd1-2d7f-44ed-ba3f-2b0ce104cbcf: "<think>Alright, this question is asking\
      \ me to compare the geographic locations of two institutions: Indiana University\
      \ Northwest in Indiana, and Premier Flight Academy in Ohio.\n\nI need to determine\
      \ if Indiana University Northwest is located east of Premier Flight Academy.\n\
      \nFirst, let me identify where these two institutions are located:\n\n1. Indiana\
      \ University Northwest (IUN) is in Indiana (IN), specifically in the city of\
      \ Gary, which is in the northwestern part of Indiana, near the border with Illinois\
      \ and close to Chicago.\n\n2. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH). I need\
      \ to determine which city in Ohio it's located in. \n\nI don't have specific\
      \ information about where Premier Flight Academy is located in Ohio. However,\
      \ Ohio is generally east of Indiana. The states are adjacent, with Indiana to\
      \ the west of Ohio.\n\nGary, Indiana (where IUN is located) is in the far northwestern\
      \ corner of Indiana. So it's on the western side of Indiana, which itself is\
      \ west of Ohio.\n\nSince Indiana is west of Ohio, and Gary is in the western\
      \ part of Indiana, it's very likely that Indiana University Northwest is west\
      \ of Premier Flight Academy, regardless of where exactly in Ohio the flight\
      \ academy is located.\n\nBut let me double check. It's possible that Premier\
      \ Flight Academy could be in the far western part of Ohio, close to the Indiana\
      \ border, while IUN is in the far eastern part of Indiana, also close to the\
      \ Ohio border. In that case, IUN could potentially be east of the flight academy.\n\
      \nHowever, I know that IUN is in Gary, which is in the northwestern corner of\
      \ Indiana, far from the Ohio border. Even if Premier Flight Academy is in the\
      \ westernmost part of Ohio, it would still be east of Gary, Indiana.\n\nSo my\
      \ conclusion is: No, Indiana University Northwest is not located east of Premier\
      \ Flight Academy. It's located west of it.\n\nWait, let me check this more carefully.\
      \ I need to be more precise about the locations.\n\nIndiana University Northwest\
      \ is located in Gary, Indiana, which is in the northwest corner of Indiana,\
      \ near Lake Michigan and close to the border with Illinois.\n\nI don't have\
      \ specific information about where Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio. Let me\
      \ think about the possible locations and whether any of them could make Indiana\
      \ University Northwest east of Premier Flight Academy.\n\nOhio is east of Indiana.\
      \ The western border of Ohio touches the eastern border of Indiana. If Premier\
      \ Flight Academy is anywhere in Ohio, it's east of the Indiana-Ohio border.\n\
      \nGary, Indiana is in the northwest corner of Indiana, which is far from the\
      \ Indiana-Ohio border. It's closer to the Indiana-Illinois border, which is\
      \ on the western side of Indiana.\n\nGiven these geographical positions, it's\
      \ not possible for Indiana University Northwest (in Gary, IN) to be east of\
      \ Premier Flight Academy (in OH), regardless of where in Ohio the academy is\
      \ located.\n\nSo my answer is NO.\n\nActually, let me reconsider more carefully.\
      \ I'm making an assumption here that Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio. The\
      \ question statement says \"Premier Flight Academy, OH\", which suggests that\
      \ it's in Ohio, but let me consider if there's any ambiguity.\n\nI interpreted\
      \ \"Premier Flight Academy, OH\" to mean that Premier Flight Academy is located\
      \ in the state of Ohio. But I need to be careful here. Let me reconsider.\n\n\
      If Premier Flight Academy is indeed in Ohio, then Indiana University Northwest\
      \ (in Gary, Indiana) cannot be east of it, since Indiana is west of Ohio, and\
      \ Gary is in the western part of Indiana.\n\nBut what if Premier Flight Academy\
      \ is not in Ohio? What if \"OH\" stands for something else, or if Premier Flight\
      \ Academy is actually located in a different state, perhaps west of Indiana?\n\
      \nThe question explicitly says \"Premier Flight Academy, OH\". This notation\
      \ typically means that the institution is in the state of Ohio. So I'm going\
      \ to proceed with the understanding that Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio.\n\
      \nGiven that:\n1. Indiana University Northwest is in Gary, Indiana.\n2. Gary\
      \ is in the northwest corner of Indiana.\n3. Indiana is west of Ohio.\n4. Premier\
      \ Flight Academy is in Ohio.\n\nIt's not possible for Indiana University Northwest\
      \ to be east of Premier Flight Academy. Indiana University Northwest is west\
      \ of Premier Flight Academy.\n\nOK, let me think this through one more time.\n\
      \nIf we look at a map of the United States, we see that Indiana is west of Ohio.\
      \ So if we're comparing two points, one in Indiana and one in Ohio, the one\
      \ in Indiana is generally going to be west of the one in Ohio.\n\nBut we should\
      \ be more specific. Indiana University Northwest is in Gary, Indiana, which\
      \ is in the northwestern part of the state. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio,\
      \ but I don't know exactly where in Ohio. It could be anywhere in Ohio.\n\n\
      Even if Premier Flight Academy is in the westernmost part of Ohio, right on\
      \ the Indiana-Ohio border, it would still be east of Gary, Indiana, which is\
      \ in the northwest corner of Indiana, far from the Ohio border.\n\nSo my answer\
      \ is NO, Indiana University Northwest is not east of Premier Flight Academy.\
      \ It's west of it.\n\nI think I've been overthinking this, based on the limitations\
      \ of my knowledge. I've been trying to consider all possibilities, including\
      \ the possibility that I'm misunderstanding the question or that \"Premier Flight\
      \ Academy, OH\" doesn't mean what I think it means.\n\nBut the simplest and\
      \ most straightforward interpretation of the question is that it's asking whether\
      \ Indiana University Northwest, which is in Indiana, is east of Premier Flight\
      \ Academy, which is in Ohio. And the answer to that question is NO, because\
      \ Indiana is west of Ohio, and Indiana University Northwest is in the western\
      \ part of Indiana, which is even further west of the Ohio border.</think># Step-by-Step\
      \ Reasoning\n\nTo determine if Indiana University Northwest (IN) is east of\
      \ Premier Flight Academy (OH), I need to understand the geographical relationship\
      \ between these locations.\n\n1. First, let me identify the states involved:\n\
      \   - Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN)\n   - Premier Flight Academy\
      \ is in Ohio (OH)\n\n2. Next, I need to understand the relative positions of\
      \ these states:\n   - Ohio is located east of Indiana on the US map\n   - Indiana\
      \ shares its eastern border with Ohio's western border\n\n3. Looking more specifically:\n\
      \   - Indiana University Northwest is in Gary, Indiana, which is in the northwestern\
      \ part of Indiana\n   - While I don't know the exact location of Premier Flight\
      \ Academy in Ohio, I know that even the westernmost point in Ohio is still east\
      \ of Gary, Indiana\n\n4. Since Indiana University Northwest is in the northwestern\
      \ part of Indiana, and Ohio (where Premier Flight Academy is located) is entirely\
      \ east of Indiana, it's geographically impossible for Indiana University Northwest\
      \ to be east of Premier Flight Academy.\n\n# Answer: NO"

      \ recall what I know about Indiana and Ohio's relative positions:\n- Ohio is\
      \ located east of Indiana. Indiana borders Ohio on Ohio's western side.\n\n\
      3) Since Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN) and Premier Flight\
      \ Academy is in Ohio (OH), and Ohio is east of Indiana, it's likely that Indiana\

      \ northwest part of the state), while Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio, Indiana\
      \ University Northwest would be west of Premier Flight Academy, not east.\n\n\
      So, the answer would be NO, Indiana University Northwest is not located east\
      \ of Premier Flight Academy. It is located west of it.\n\nActually, let me be\
      \ more careful. I need to verify the specific locations of these institutions.\
      \ It's possible that Premier Flight Academy could be in western Ohio and Indiana\
      \ University Northwest could be in eastern Indiana, which might complicate the\

      \n- Indiana University Northwest is in Gary, Indiana, which is in the far northwestern\
      \ corner of Indiana\n- Ohio borders Indiana on Indiana's eastern side\n- Even\
      \ if Premier Flight Academy is in western Ohio, it would still be east of Gary,\
      \ Indiana\n\nSo the answer remains NO - Indiana University Northwest is not\
      \ east of Premier Flight Academy; it is west of it.\n\nActually, let me be even\
      \ more careful here. I should double-check if I know the exact location of Premier\

      \ be more complex. However, given that Indiana University Northwest is in Gary,\

      \ the information I have:\n\n1. Indiana University Northwest is in Gary, Indiana,\
      \ in the northwestern part of Indiana.\n2. Ohio is east of Indiana.\n3. Premier\
      \ Flight Academy is in Ohio.\n4. Given the geography of the United States, a\
      \ location in northwestern Indiana (like Gary) would be west of any location\

      \ the location of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio to be absolutely certain. If\
      \ I don't have that specific information, I'll have to rely on the general geographic\
      \ relationship between Indiana and Ohio.\n\nI believe Premier Flight Academy\
      \ is located in Ohio, but I'm not certain of its specific city within Ohio.\
      \ Ohio is generally east of Indiana, and Gary (where Indiana University Northwest\

      \ in Ohio.\n\nBased on the information available to me, Indiana University Northwest\
      \ in Gary, Indiana is west of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio, not east of it.\n\
      \nSo the answer is NO.\n\nActually, let me check if my knowledge about Indiana\

      Actually, let me try to think more about this. The relative east/west positioning\

      \ the east-west positioning:\n   - In the United States, moving from west to\
      \ east, you encounter Indiana before Ohio.\n   - This means Indiana is west\
      \ of Ohio.\n   - Since Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana, it is west\
      \ of places in Ohio, including Premier Flight Academy.\n\n3. Therefore, Indiana\
      \ University Northwest is NOT east of Premier Flight Academy; it is west of\
      \ it.\n\nOK I wish I knew where exactly Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio, but\
      \ I'm relatively confident in the broad state-level geography. I think the answer\
      \ is \"No\", Indiana University Northwest is not located east of Premier Flight\
      \ Academy, OH, because Indiana is west of Ohio, and Indiana University Northwest\
      \ is in the western part of Indiana.\n\nActually, let me triple-check this by\
      \ trying to find more specific locations:\n\nIndiana University Northwest: Located\
      \ in Gary, Indiana, which is in the far northwestern corner of Indiana.\n\n\
      Premier Flight Academy: It's in Ohio, but I'm not certain of the specific city.\
      \ Even without knowing the exact location, Ohio as a state is entirely east\
      \ of Indiana, so any location in Ohio would be east of Gary, Indiana.\n\nSo\
      \ my reasoning holds: Indiana University Northwest (in Gary, IN) is west of\
      \ Premier Flight Academy (in OH), not east of it.\n\nThe answer is NO.\n\nActually,\
      \ let me be extra-sure:\n\nLet's think about the possible location of Premier\
      \ Flight Academy in Ohio. Even if it were located in the westernmost part of\
      \ Ohio (near the Indiana border), it would still be east of Gary, Indiana, where\
      \ Indiana University Northwest is located. This is because the entire state\
      \ of Ohio is east of Indiana.\n\nActually, let me try to look at whether my\
      \ geographical understanding is correct.\n\nOhio does indeed border Indiana\
      \ to the east. That is, Ohio is east of Indiana, and Indiana is west of Ohio.\n\
      \nGary, Indiana, where Indiana University Northwest is located, is in the northwestern\
      \ part of Indiana, near the Illinois border and Lake Michigan. This puts it\
      \ even further west compared to most of Indiana, and certainly west of any location\
      \ in Ohio.\n\nSo, given the east-west positioning of these states, Indiana University\
      \ Northwest (in Gary, IN) is west of Premier Flight Academy (in OH), not east\
      \ of it.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is NO, Indiana University Northwest,\
      \ IN is not located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH. It is located west of\
      \ it.\n\nActually one more time. We're looking at the east-west positioning.\
      \ Let's place the two on the East coast vs. West coast spectrum.\n\nEast Coast\
      \ \u2190 | \u2192 West Coast\n\nEast Coast \u2190 Ohio | Indiana \u2192 West\
      \ Coast\n\nEast Coast \u2190 Premier Flight Academy | Indiana University Northwest\
      \ \u2192 West Coast\n\nSo the question is: Is Indiana University Northwest,\
      \ IN located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH?\n\nIn this visualization, something\
      \ is \"east of\" something else if it's closer to the East Coast. Indiana University\
      \ Northwest is in Indiana, which is west of Ohio, where Premier Flight Academy\
      \ is. So Indiana University Northwest is NOT east of Premier Flight Academy;\
      \ it's west of it.\n\nSo the answer is NO.\n\nActually I realized that I've\
      \ been thinking about this incorrectly. \"East\" means closer to the East Coast\
      \ (and farther from the West Coast), and \"West\" means closer to the West Coast\
      \ (and farther from the East Coast). So:\n\nWest Coast \u2190 Indiana | Ohio\
      \ \u2192 East Coast\n\nWest Coast \u2190 Indiana University Northwest | Premier\
      \ Flight Academy \u2192 East Coast\n\nSo the question \"Is Indiana University\
      \ Northwest, IN located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH?\" is asking whether\
      \ Indiana University Northwest (in IN) is closer to the East Coast than Premier\
      \ Flight Academy (in OH) is.\n\nSince Indiana is west of Ohio, and Indiana University\
      \ Northwest is in Indiana, while Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio, the answer\
      \ is NO, Indiana University Northwest is not located east of Premier Flight\
      \ Academy; it's located west of it.\n\nWait, I got confused in my explanation.\
      \ Let me clarify.\n\nIn the United States, the East Coast is on the east side,\
      \ and the West Coast is on the west side. When we say something is \"east of\"\
      \ something else, we mean it's closer to the East Coast (or farther from the\
      \ West Coast).\n\nThe states from west to east in this region are: Indiana,\
      \ then Ohio. So Ohio is east of Indiana.\n\nIndiana University Northwest is\
      \ in Indiana (specifically Gary, in the northwest of the state).\nPremier Flight\
      \ Academy is in Ohio.\n\nSince Ohio is east of Indiana, Premier Flight Academy\
      \ is east of Indiana University Northwest. Conversely, Indiana University Northwest\
      \ is west of Premier Flight Academy.\n\nSo the answer to \"Is Indiana University\
      \ Northwest, IN located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH?\" is NO, it's not\
      \ east; it's west.\n\nOK final check:\n\n1. The question asks: Is Indiana University\
      \ Northwest, IN located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH?\n\n2. To be \"east\
      \ of\" means to be positioned more towards the East Coast of the United States.\n\
      \n3. Indiana University Northwest is in Gary, Indiana, which is in the northwestern\
      \ part of Indiana.\n\n4. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio.\n\n5. Geographically,\
      \ Ohio is located entirely east of Indiana.\n\n6. Therefore, any location in\
      \ Ohio (including Premier Flight Academy) is east of any location in Indiana\
      \ (including Indiana University Northwest).\n\n7. Conversely, Indiana University\
      \ Northwest is west of Premier Flight Academy, not east of it.\n\nSo the answer\
      \ is NO, Indiana University Northwest, IN is not located east of Premier Flight\
      \ Academy, OH; it is located west of it.</think># Determining if Indiana University\

    715dc334-d6f8-41b7-8c11-f6dd19b67f6e: '<think>This question asks if Indiana University
      Northwest, IN is located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH. To answer this,
      I need to find the locations of both institutions and compare their east-west
      positions.


      First, let''s identify the locations:


      1. Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN). The "Northwest" in its name
      suggests it''s in the northwestern part of Indiana.


      2. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH).


      Now, I need to determine their relative positions. In the United States, Indiana
      is west of Ohio. Ohio borders Indiana on Indiana''s eastern side.


      Since Indiana University Northwest is in the northwestern part of Indiana, it
      would be in the western part of the state. And Premier Flight Academy is somewhere
      in Ohio, which is entirely east of Indiana.


      Therefore, Indiana University Northwest (in Indiana) would be west of Premier
      Flight Academy (in Ohio), not east of it.


      To be completely certain, let me double-check the specific locations of these
      institutions:


      Indiana University Northwest is likely in Gary, Indiana or nearby, which is
      indeed in the northwestern part of Indiana.


      I''m not completely certain about the exact location of Premier Flight Academy
      in Ohio, but regardless of where in Ohio it is located, Ohio is east of Indiana.


      Therefore, Indiana University Northwest is west of Premier Flight Academy, not
      east of it.


      Actually, let me be a bit more cautious here. While Indiana is generally west
      of Ohio, I should verify the specific locations of these institutions to be
      certain of their east-west relationship.


      Indiana University Northwest is located in Gary, Indiana, which is in the northwestern
      part of Indiana, near Chicago, Illinois.


      I need to find the location of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio. Without that
      specific information, I can''t be absolutely certain of their relative east-west
      positions, though it''s highly likely that the Indiana institution is west of
      the Ohio institution.


      On second thought, Indiana is definitely west of Ohio on a map, so any location
      in Indiana would be west of any location in Ohio (with respect to longitude).
      So Indiana University Northwest, being in Indiana, would be west of Premier
      Flight Academy, which is in Ohio.


      Therefore, Indiana University Northwest is NOT located east of Premier Flight
      Academy; it''s located west of it.


      So the answer is NO.


      Actually, let me pause and be more careful again. While Indiana is generally
      west of Ohio, their borders are not perfectly aligned north-south. There could
      potentially be some parts of northwestern Indiana that are directly west or
      even slightly east of some parts of southwestern Ohio.


      Let me try to recall the geography more specifically:


      The eastern border of Indiana and the western border of Ohio run almost entirely
      north-south. Indiana''s eastern border is slightly tilted, with the northeastern
      corner of Indiana being slightly more east than the southeastern corner. Ohio''s
      western border follows a similar pattern.


      Given this, it''s still highly likely that Indiana University Northwest, being
      in the northwestern part of Indiana (Gary, IN), is west of any location in Ohio,
      including where Premier Flight Academy is located.


      However, to be absolutely certain, I should know the specific locations of both
      institutions.


      Indiana University Northwest is in Gary, Indiana, which is indeed in the far
      northwestern part of the state.


      Without knowing the exact location of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio, I can''t
      be 100% certain, but based on the general geography of the two states, it''s
      most likely that Indiana University Northwest is west of Premier Flight Academy.


      So, my answer remains NO, Indiana University Northwest is not located east of
      Premier Flight Academy; it''s most likely located west of it.


      Wait, I''m overthinking this. Let me simplify:


      1. Indiana is west of Ohio.

      2. Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana.

      3. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio.

      4. Therefore, Indiana University Northwest is west of Premier Flight Academy,
      not east of it.


      So the answer is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if Indiana University Northwest (IN) is east of Premier Flight
      Academy (OH), I need to analyze their geographic locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN)

      - Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states

      When looking at a US map, Ohio is located east of Indiana. The entire state
      of Ohio is positioned to the east of Indiana.


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states

      - Indiana University Northwest is in Gary, Indiana, in the northwestern part
      of the state

      - Premier Flight Academy is somewhere in Ohio

      - Since Ohio as a whole is east of Indiana, any location in Ohio would be east
      of a location in Indiana


      ## Step 4: Determine the directional relationship

      If Premier Flight Academy is east of Indiana University Northwest, then Indiana
      University Northwest must be west of Premier Flight Academy, not east of it.


      # Answer: NO


      Indiana University Northwest is not located east of Premier Flight Academy.
      It is located west of it.'
    7a200ab0-c9f2-4cc5-a696-ed37b7ab2d94: '<think>I need to determine the locations
      of Indiana University Northwest, IN and Premier Flight Academy, OH, and then
      compare their geographical positions to determine if one is east of the other.


      Let me identify where each institution is located:


      1. Indiana University Northwest (IUN) is in Indiana (IN). Based on the name,
      it''s likely in the northwestern part of Indiana. Let me recall where specifically
      IUN is located... Indiana University Northwest is located in Gary, Indiana.
      Gary is in the northwestern corner of Indiana, near the Illinois border and
      Lake Michigan.


      2. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH). I need to determine where in Ohio
      this flight academy is located. I don''t have specific information about Premier
      Flight Academy''s location in Ohio. Ohio is generally east of Indiana, as Indiana
      borders Ohio on its eastern side.


      Now, let''s think about the geography:

      - Indiana is west of Ohio (Ohio is east of Indiana)

      - Indiana University Northwest is in northwestern Indiana (Gary)

      - Premier Flight Academy is somewhere in Ohio


      Since Ohio is east of Indiana, and Indiana University Northwest is in the northwestern
      part of Indiana (putting it even further west within the state), Premier Flight
      Academy in Ohio would be east of Indiana University Northwest.


      However, I should double-check if there are any unusual geographical configurations.
      For example, if Premier Flight Academy were in the far western part of Ohio
      and Indiana University Northwest were in the far eastern part of Indiana, there
      might be a different conclusion.


      But given that Indiana University Northwest is specifically in the northwestern
      part of Indiana (Gary), which is quite far from the Ohio border, and Ohio is
      entirely east of Indiana, it''s very likely that Premier Flight Academy is east
      of Indiana University Northwest.


      So, the answer is NO, Indiana University Northwest is NOT east of Premier Flight
      Academy. Instead, Premier Flight Academy (OH) is east of Indiana University
      Northwest (IN).


      Wait, I need to be careful here. The question asks: "Is Indiana University Northwest,
      IN located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH?"


      To answer this correctly:

      - If IUN is east of Premier Flight Academy, the answer is YES.

      - If IUN is west of Premier Flight Academy, the answer is NO.


      As I''ve determined, Indiana University Northwest is in northwestern Indiana,
      and Premier Flight Academy is somewhere in Ohio. Since Ohio is east of Indiana,
      Premier Flight Academy is likely east of Indiana University Northwest.


      Therefore, Indiana University Northwest is NOT east of Premier Flight Academy;
      it''s west of it.


      The answer is NO.</think># Determining if Indiana University Northwest is east
      of Premier Flight Academy


      I need to find the locations of both institutions and compare their east-west
      positions.


      ## Step 1: Locate Indiana University Northwest (IN)

      Indiana University Northwest is located in Gary, Indiana, which is in the northwestern
      corner of Indiana near Lake Michigan.


      ## Step 2: Locate Premier Flight Academy (OH)

      Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio. While I don''t know its exact location in
      Ohio, I know that Ohio as a state is positioned east of Indiana on the US map.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      - Indiana is directly west of Ohio (Ohio shares Indiana''s eastern border)

      - Indiana University Northwest is in the northwestern part of Indiana, placing
      it even further west within the state

      - Any location in Ohio would be east of Gary, Indiana


      ## Conclusion

      Since Indiana University Northwest is in western Indiana and Premier Flight
      Academy is in Ohio (which is east of Indiana), Indiana University Northwest
      cannot be east of Premier Flight Academy.

      \nSo, the answer is NO, Indiana University Northwest, IN is not located east\
      \ of Premier Flight Academy, OH.\n\nActually, let me try a different approach.\
      \ I'm trying to be too precise without having all the exact information.\n\n\
      Simply put:\n- Indiana is west of Ohio.\n- Indiana University Northwest is in\
      \ the northwest part of Indiana, which is even further west.\n- Premier Flight\
      \ Academy is in Ohio, which is east of Indiana.\n\nBased on these general geographic\
      \ facts, Indiana University Northwest is west of Premier Flight Academy, not\
      \ east.\n\nSo, the answer is NO, Indiana University Northwest, IN is not located\
      \ east of Premier Flight Academy, OH.\n\nHold up, I need to double check. I\
      \ know that Indiana University Northwest is in the northwest part of Indiana,\
      \ in Gary, Indiana. \n\nFor Premier Flight Academy in Ohio, I don't have the\
      \ specific location. If it's in the eastern part of Ohio, then the answer is\
      \ clearly NO. If it's in the western part of Ohio, it might be closer to Indiana\
      \ University Northwest, but given that Ohio is east of Indiana, Premier Flight\
      \ Academy would still be east of Indiana University Northwest.\n\nSo, the answer\
      \ remains NO, Indiana University Northwest, IN is not located east of Premier\
      \ Flight Academy, OH.\n\nActually, I realize I'm overthinking this. Let me simplify:\n\
      1. Indiana is west of Ohio.\n2. Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana.\n\
      3. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio.\n\nBased on these facts, Indiana University\
      \ Northwest is west of Premier Flight Academy, not east of it.\n\nSo, the answer\
      \ is NO, Indiana University Northwest, IN is not located east of Premier Flight\
      \ Academy, OH.\n\nWait, I'm still not being entirely precise. If both institutions\
      \ are very close to the Indiana-Ohio border, and Indiana University Northwest\
      \ is in the eastern part of Indiana while Premier Flight Academy is in the western\
      \ part of Ohio, then the answer might be more nuanced.\n\nBut Indiana University\
      \ Northwest is in Gary, Indiana, which is in the very northwestern corner of\
      \ Indiana, far from the Ohio border. It's close to the Illinois border and Lake\
      \ Michigan. So, it's definitely in the western part of Indiana.\n\nGiven this,\
      \ and the fact that Ohio is east of Indiana, Indiana University Northwest is\
      \ west of Premier Flight Academy, not east.\n\nSo, the answer is NO, Indiana\
      \ University Northwest, IN is not located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH.\n\
      \nActually, before I give a final answer, let me do one more check. Let's think\
      \ of this in terms of a map.\n\nIndiana is directly west of Ohio. The western\
      \ border of Ohio is the eastern border of Indiana.\n\nIndiana University Northwest\
      \ is in Gary, Indiana, which is in the northwest corner of Indiana, near Chicago,\
      \ Illinois and Lake Michigan. This is the furthest northwest point of Indiana,\
      \ which means it's far from the Indiana-Ohio border (which would be in eastern\
      \ Indiana).\n\nPremier Flight Academy is in Ohio. Even if it's in the westernmost\
      \ part of Ohio, it's still east of Indiana. And since Indiana University Northwest\
      \ is in the western part of Indiana, it's definitely west of the Indiana-Ohio\
      \ border.\n\nSo, Indiana University Northwest is west of Premier Flight Academy,\
      \ not east.\n\nTo be super precise, let me check if there is a Premier Flight\
      \ Academy in Ohio? I can't recall its exact location. Let me double-check a\
      \ bit more.\n\nWithout the exact location of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio,\
      \ I'll stick with the general geographic principle: Indiana is west of Ohio.\
      \ Indiana University Northwest is in the western part of Indiana, making it\
      \ even more west compared to any location in Ohio, including Premier Flight\
      \ Academy.\n\nSo, the answer is NO, Indiana University Northwest, IN is not\
      \ located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH.\n\nActually, I'm making this more\
      \ complicated than it needs to be. Let me go with my knowledge:\n\nIndiana University\
      \ Northwest is in Gary, Indiana, which is in the northwest corner of Indiana.\
      \ Indiana is west of Ohio. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio. Given the relative\
      \ positions of the states and the specific location of Indiana University Northwest,\
      \ it's clear that Indiana University Northwest is west of Premier Flight Academy,\
      \ not east.\n\nSo, the answer is NO, Indiana University Northwest, IN is not\
      \ located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\
      \nTo determine if Indiana University Northwest is located east of Premier Flight\
      \ Academy, I need to identify where both institutions are located.\n\n1. Indiana\
      \ University Northwest is located in Gary, Indiana (IN), which is in the northwestern\
      \ part of Indiana.\n\n2. Premier Flight Academy is located in Ohio (OH).\n\n\
      3. Geographically, the state of Indiana is located directly west of Ohio. The\
      \ entire state of Indiana is west of the entire state of Ohio.\n\n4. Since Indiana\
      \ University Northwest is in the northwestern part of Indiana, it's not only\
      \ west of Ohio, but it's in the part of Indiana that's furthest away from Ohio.\n\
      \n5. Even without knowing the exact location of Premier Flight Academy within\
      \ Ohio, any location in Ohio would be east of any location in Indiana, especially\
      \ one in northwestern Indiana.\n\n6. Therefore, Indiana University Northwest\
      \ must be west of Premier Flight Academy, not east of it.\n\n# Answer: NO\n\n\
      Indiana University Northwest is not located east of Premier Flight Academy.\

    0a6b6dad-ce26-44d7-bb52-9fb91bee9f27: '<think>To solve this problem, I need to
      determine if Jarvis Christian College, TX is located east of Georgia Highlands
      College, GA.


      First, let me establish where these colleges are located:


      1. Jarvis Christian College is in Texas (TX)

      2. Georgia Highlands College is in Georgia (GA)


      Now, I need to think about the relative positions of Texas and Georgia in the
      United States. The United States is oriented such that the east coast is on
      the right side of the map, and the west coast is on the left side.


      Georgia is located on the southeastern part of the United States, whereas Texas
      is in the south-central part of the United States.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Texas is to the west of Georgia. This means
      that Jarvis Christian College in Texas would be west of Georgia Highlands College
      in Georgia, not east of it.


      Therefore, Jarvis Christian College, TX is NOT located east of Georgia Highlands
      College, GA. It is located west of it.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is Jarvis Christian College, TX located east of Georgia
      Highlands College, GA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two colleges by
      examining which states they''re in and where those states are located.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Jarvis Christian College is in Texas (TX)

      - Georgia Highlands College is in Georgia (GA)


      ## Step 2: Compare the geographic positions

      - On a U.S. map, Georgia is located on the southeastern coast

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the country

      - Georgia is clearly east of Texas on any U.S. map


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      Since Texas is west of Georgia, Jarvis Christian College (in Texas) must be
      west of Georgia Highlands College (in Georgia), not east of it.


      NO'

      to find the locations of both colleges and determine whether Jarvis Christian
      College in Texas is east of Georgia Highlands College in Georgia.


      First, let me identify the rough locations of these states:

      - Texas (TX) is in the south-central United States

      - Georgia (GA) is in the southeastern United States


      Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Texas. On a map of the US, Georgia is
      to the right (east) of Texas.


      Now, let''s think about the specific colleges:

      1. Jarvis Christian College is in Texas (TX)

      2. Georgia Highlands College is in Georgia (GA)


      Since Georgia as a whole is east of Texas, and these colleges are within their
      respective states, it''s very likely that Georgia Highlands College is east
      of Jarvis Christian College.


      To be absolutely certain, I would need the precise longitudes of both institutions,
      but based on state geography alone, we can be fairly confident.


      So the question asked: "Is Jarvis Christian College, TX located east of Georgia
      Highlands College, GA?"


      If Jarvis Christian College (TX) is east of Georgia Highlands College (GA),
      then Jarvis would be to the right of Georgia Highlands on a map.


      But as we''ve established, Texas is west of Georgia, so Jarvis Christian College
      (in Texas) would be west (to the left) of Georgia Highlands College (in Georgia).


      Therefore, Jarvis Christian College is NOT east of Georgia Highlands College.
      In fact, it''s the opposite - Georgia Highlands College is east of Jarvis Christian
      College.


      So the answer is NO, Jarvis Christian College, TX is not located east of Georgia
      Highlands College, GA.</think># Determining if Jarvis Christian College, TX
      is east of Georgia Highlands College, GA


      I need to think about the geographic locations of these colleges based on the
      states they''re in.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions

      - Texas (TX) is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - On a US map, Georgia is positioned east of Texas


      ## Step 2: Apply this to the specific colleges

      - Jarvis Christian College is in Texas

      - Georgia Highlands College is in Georgia

      - Since Georgia is east of Texas, a college in Georgia would generally be east
      of a college in Texas


      ## Step 3: Make a conclusion about the direction

      Since Georgia is east of Texas, Georgia Highlands College would be east of Jarvis
      Christian College, not the other way around.


      NO, Jarvis Christian College is not east of Georgia Highlands College. It is
      west of it.'

      Angelo State University (TX) is located east of Mississippi Valley State University
      (MS).


      Step 1: Let''s identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Angelo State University is in Texas (TX)

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi (MS)


      Step 2: Let''s think about the general geography of these states.

      Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States, while Mississippi
      is in the Deep South, directly east of Texas.


      Step 3: Let''s be more precise and think about the specific locations of these
      universities within their states.


      - Angelo State University is in San Angelo, Texas. San Angelo is in west-central
      Texas.

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Itta Bena, Mississippi. Itta Bena
      is in the Mississippi Delta region, in the western part of Mississippi.


      Step 4: Now let''s think about the relative positions of these two locations.


      Texas (where Angelo State is located) is generally west of Mississippi (where
      Mississippi Valley State is located). The entirety of Texas is west of the entirety
      of Mississippi. Therefore, Angelo State University, which is in Texas, must
      be west (not east) of Mississippi Valley State University, which is in Mississippi.


      Even though Angelo State is in the eastern part of Texas and Mississippi Valley
      State is in the western part of Mississippi, the distance between the states
      is such that any location in Texas would still be west of any location in Mississippi.


      Therefore, Angelo State University (TX) is NOT located east of Mississippi Valley
      State University (MS). Instead, it''s located to the west.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is Angelo State University, TX located east of Mississippi
      Valley State University, MS?


      To determine this, I need to consider the geographical locations of both universities
      and their states.


      ## Step 1: Identify state locations

      - Angelo State University is in Texas (TX)

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi (MS)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geography of these states

      Texas is located in the south-central United States, while Mississippi is in
      the Deep South, east of Texas. Mississippi borders the Mississippi River on
      its western edge.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific university locations

      - Angelo State University is in San Angelo, which is in west-central Texas

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Itta Bena, which is in the western
      part of Mississippi


      ## Step 4: Compare relative positions

      Even though I''m comparing specific universities (not just states), the fact
      remains that the entirety of Texas lies west of Mississippi. Any location in
      Texas, including San Angelo, would be west of any location in Mississippi, including
      Itta Bena.


      NO, Angelo State University is not east of Mississippi Valley State University.

    686596d1-5851-492c-869b-ad27cbb22e66: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographical locations of Angelo State University, TX and Mississippi
      Valley State University, MS, and then determine if Angelo State University is
      east of Mississippi Valley State University.


      First, let me identify where each university is located:


      1. Angelo State University is in Texas (TX), specifically in San Angelo, Texas.

      2. Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi (MS), likely in the
      Mississippi Valley region.


      Now I need to figure out their relative positions. The question is asking if
      Angelo State University (in TX) is east of Mississippi Valley State University
      (in MS).


      Generally speaking:

      - Texas is west of Mississippi

      - The Mississippi River runs roughly north-south, forming part of the eastern
      border of Texas


      Let me be more specific about the locations:


      Angelo State University is in San Angelo, Texas, which is in west-central Texas.

      Mississippi Valley State University is in Itta Bena, Mississippi, which is in
      the Mississippi Delta region in the western part of Mississippi.


      If we consider the relative positions of these states:

      - Texas is west of Mississippi

      - San Angelo is in the western part of Texas

      - Itta Bena is in the western part of Mississippi


      Even though Itta Bena is in the western part of Mississippi, Mississippi as
      a whole is still east of Texas. So Angelo State University (in Texas) would
      be west of Mississippi Valley State University (in Mississippi), not east of
      it.


      Therefore, Angelo State University is NOT east of Mississippi Valley State University.


      To verify my reasoning, I can think about the general geography of the United
      States:

      - Going from west to east, the states in this region are roughly: Texas, Louisiana,
      Mississippi, Alabama, etc.

      - So Texas (where Angelo State is) is west of Mississippi (where Mississippi
      Valley State is).


      The answer is NO, Angelo State University is not east of Mississippi Valley
      State University.</think># Reasoning Step by Step


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Locate both universities

      - Angelo State University is in San Angelo, Texas (TX)

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Itta Bena, Mississippi (MS)


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographical positions

      - Mississippi is significantly east of Texas in the United States

      - The Mississippi River roughly marks the eastern border of Texas (with Louisiana
      in between)

      - All of Mississippi state is east of Texas state


      ## Step 3: Make the east-west comparison

      - Since Angelo State is in Texas (western state)

      - And Mississippi Valley State is in Mississippi (eastern state)

      - Angelo State must be WEST of Mississippi Valley State, not east


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      the geographic locations of two universities: Angelo State University in Texas
      (TX) and Mississippi Valley State University in Mississippi (MS). Specifically,
      I need to determine if Angelo State is located east of Mississippi Valley State.


      Let me think about the geographic locations of Texas and Mississippi:


      1. Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States, bordering
      Mexico to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast.


      2. Mississippi is located in the southeastern United States, east of Texas.
      The Mississippi River forms the western boundary of the state.


      Given that Mississippi as a state is generally east of Texas as a state, it
      would be typical for a university in Texas to be west of a university in Mississippi.


      However, I should be more precise and consider the specific locations of these
      universities within their states.


      Angelo State University is located in San Angelo, Texas, which is in the west-central
      part of Texas.


      Mississippi Valley State University is located in Itta Bena, Mississippi, which
      is in the Mississippi Delta region in the northwestern part of Mississippi.


      Given these specific locations:

      - San Angelo, TX is in the western part of Texas

      - Itta Bena, MS is in the western part of Mississippi


      Since Texas is west of Mississippi, and San Angelo is in the western part of
      Texas, while Itta Bena is in the western part of Mississippi, Angelo State University
      is almost certainly west of Mississippi Valley State University.


      Therefore, Angelo State University is NOT located east of Mississippi Valley
      State University.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is Angelo State University, TX located east of Mississippi
      Valley State University, MS?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify locations

      - Angelo State University is in San Angelo, Texas

      - Mississippi Valley State University is in Itta Bena, Mississippi


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' positions

      Texas is located west of Mississippi in the United States. The entire state
      of Mississippi lies east of Texas.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within states

      - San Angelo is in west-central Texas

      - Itta Bena is in the Mississippi Delta region of northwestern Mississippi


      ## Step 4: Compare longitudinal positions

      Even though Angelo State is in eastern Texas and Mississippi Valley State is
      in western Mississippi, the overall east-west geography of the United States
      means that any location in Texas would be west of any location in Mississippi.


      NO - Angelo State University is not located east of Mississippi Valley State
      University. It is located to the west.'

      To answer this, I need to understand the relative geographic positions of these
      two institutions. The United States generally follows a layout where:

      - East means closer to the Atlantic Ocean

      - West means closer to the Pacific Ocean

      - North means closer to Canada

      - South means closer to Mexico/Gulf of Mexico


      Nebraska (NE) is a state in the central part of the United States, in what''s
      often called the Midwest or Great Plains region.


      Kentucky (KY) is a state in the east-central part of the United States, often
      categorized as part of the Southeast or sometimes the Midwest.


      Based on my knowledge of U.S. geography, Kentucky is located east of Nebraska.
      That is, if you''re in Nebraska and travel eastward, you would eventually reach
      Kentucky (after crossing through some other states like Iowa, Illinois, or Missouri,
      depending on your exact route).


      Since Concordia University is in Nebraska, and Gateway Community and Technical
      College is in Kentucky, and Kentucky is east of Nebraska, then Gateway Community
      and Technical College is east of Concordia University.


      The question asks if Concordia University is east of Gateway Community and Technical
      College. Since we''ve established that Gateway is east of Concordia, the answer
      to the original question is NO, Concordia University in Nebraska is NOT located

      - The University of North Georgia, being in Georgia, is therefore east of any
      location in Texas


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Lee College in Texas is not east of the University of North Georgia in
      Georgia. The University of North Georgia is east of Lee College.'

      Step 1: Determine the location of Lee College, TX.

      Lee College is in Baytown, Texas, which is near Houston in southeast Texas.


      Step 2: Determine the location of the University of North Georgia, GA.

      The University of North Georgia has multiple campuses, but the main campus is

      \ these universities.\n\nUniversity of Louisiana at Monroe, LA: This is located\
      \ in Monroe, Louisiana. Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States,\
      \ along the Gulf of Mexico. In terms of east-west positioning, Louisiana is\

      \ part of Louisiana.\nI believe Andrews University is in Berrien Springs, which\
      \ is in the southwestern part of Michigan, near Lake Michigan.\n\nLet me think\
      \ about the general longitude of these states:\n- Louisiana longitudes range\
      \ approximately from 89\xB0 W to 94\xB0 W\n- Michigan longitudes range approximately\
      \ from 82\xB0 W to 90\xB0 W\n\nBased on this, it seems like Michigan generally\

      \ side of Michigan, Michigan is generally further east than Louisiana in the\

      \ east of the University of Louisiana at Monroe.\n\nTherefore, the answer to\
      \ \"Is University of Louisiana at Monroe, LA located east of Andrews University,\
      \ MI?\" is NO.\n\nActually, let me triple-check this. I'm getting a bit confused\
      \ about the exact longitudes, and I want to make sure I have the relative positions\
      \ correct.\n\nIn the US, longitude increases as you go westward. The East Coast\

      \ to determine the locations of University of Louisiana at Monroe, LA and Andrews\
      \ University, MI, and then determine whether the University of Louisiana at\

      \ the universities.\n- University of Louisiana at Monroe is located in Monroe,\
      \ Louisiana.\n- Andrews University is located in Berrien Springs, Michigan.\n\
      \nStep 2: Determine the general east-west positioning of Louisiana and Michigan.\n\
      The United States is roughly oriented with the east coast on the Atlantic Ocean\
      \ and the west coast on the Pacific Ocean. Moving from west to east:\n- The\
      \ West Coast states (like California, Oregon, Washington)\n- The Mountain states\
      \ (like Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana)\n- The Plains/Midwest states\
      \ (like North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Minnesota,\
      \ Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan)\n- The South/Southeast\
      \ states (like Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida)\n- The Northeast\
      \ states (like Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, etc.)\n\nMichigan is in the Midwest\
      \ region, while Louisiana is in the South/Southeast region.\n\nStep 3: Compare\
      \ the longitudes.\nEast-west positioning is determined by longitude. Lower (or\
      \ more negative) longitude values are further west, while higher (or less negative)\
      \ longitude values are further east.\n\nMichigan is in the upper Midwest of\
      \ the US, roughly in the middle of the country from east to west. Louisiana\
      \ is in the Deep South, also roughly in the middle from east to west.\n\nLouisiana\
      \ is indeed south of Michigan, but that doesn't tell us about the east-west\
      \ relationship. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nMichigan is bordered\
      \ by Lakes Michigan and Huron to the west and north, and by Ohio and Indiana\
      \ to the south. It's in the Great Lakes region.\n\nLouisiana is at the mouth\
      \ of the Mississippi River, bordering the Gulf of Mexico to the south, Texas\
      \ to the west, Arkansas to the north, and Mississippi to the east.\n\nGiven\
      \ these geographic positions, I believe Louisiana is generally west and south\
      \ of Michigan. However, I should be more precise about the specific locations.\n\
      \nMonroe, Louisiana is located in the northeastern part of Louisiana. Berrien\
      \ Springs, Michigan is in the southwestern part of Michigan. This could affect\
      \ their east-west relationship, so I need to be precise.\n\nLet me check approximate\
      \ longitudes:\n- Monroe, LA is roughly at longitude 92\xB0 W.\n- Berrien Springs,\
      \ MI is roughly at longitude 86\xB0 W.\n\nSince degrees west are measured from\
      \ the Prime Meridian (0\xB0) and increase as you go westward, a higher number\
      \ of degrees west means you're further west. So, if Monroe, LA is at 92\xB0\
      \ W and Berrien Springs, MI is at 86\xB0 W, then Monroe, LA is further west\
      \ (not east) of Berrien Springs, MI.\n\nActually, let me double-check these\
      \ coordinates. \n\nMonroe, LA is located at approximately 32.5093\xB0 N, 92.1193\xB0\
      \ W.\nBerrien Springs, MI is located at approximately 41.9466\xB0 N, 86.3358\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nSo, Monroe, LA is at 92.1193\xB0 W longitude, and Berrien Springs, MI\
      \ is at 86.3358\xB0 W longitude.\n\nSince 92.1193 > 86.3358, Monroe, LA is further\
      \ west than Berrien Springs, MI. This means the University of Louisiana at Monroe\
      \ is NOT located east of Andrews University.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning:\
      \ \nEast-west direction is determined by longitude. Moving west, longitude values\
      \ (in the Western Hemisphere) increase, and moving east, they decrease. Monroe,\
      \ LA has a longitude of approximately 92.1\xB0 W, while Berrien Springs, MI\
      \ has a longitude of approximately 86.3\xB0 W. Since 92.1 > 86.3, Monroe, LA\
      \ is further west than Berrien Springs, MI, which means the University of Louisiana\
      \ at Monroe is west (not east) of Andrews University.\n\nTherefore, the answer\

      \ of West Florida.\nThe University of West Florida is likely located in the\
      \ western part of Florida, based on its name. Western Florida is closer to the\
      \ Gulf of Mexico than the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nStep 3: Let me think about Regent\
      \ University.\nRegent University is in Virginia. I believe it's located in Virginia\
      \ Beach, Virginia, which is on the eastern coast of Virginia, right by the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean.\n\nStep 4: Compare the east-west positioning.\nWhen we think about\
      \ east-west positioning in the United States, locations farther east have a\
      \ higher longitude (more degrees east). The eastern edge of the United States\
      \ is the Atlantic coast.\n\nVirginia is north of Florida, but that doesn't tell\
      \ us about east-west positioning. We need to consider their longitudinal positions.\n\
      \nVirginia Beach (where Regent University is) is on the Atlantic coast, which\
      \ is the eastern edge of Virginia.\n\nThe University of West Florida, being\
      \ in western Florida, is likely further west than Virginia Beach, which is on\
      \ the Atlantic coast.\n\nTherefore, the University of West Florida is most likely\
      \ west of Regent University, not east of it.\n\nLet me double-check by considering\
      \ the approximate longitudes:\n- Virginia Beach, VA (where Regent University\
      \ is) is approximately at 76\xB0 W longitude.\n- The western part of Florida\
      \ (where University of West Florida likely is) would be approximately 84-87\xB0\
      \ W longitude.\n\nA higher value of west longitude means further west. So University\
      \ of West Florida (around 84-87\xB0 W) would be west of Regent University (around\
      \ 76\xB0 W), not east.\n\nThe answer to \"Is University of West Florida, FL\
      \ located east of Regent University, VA?\" is NO.\n\nActually, I should try\
      \ to be more precise about the locations to be sure.\n\nThe University of West\
      \ Florida is located in Pensacola, Florida. Pensacola is in the far western\
      \ part of the Florida panhandle, very close to the Alabama border. Its approximate\
      \ longitude is 87.2\xB0 W.\n\nRegent University is indeed in Virginia Beach,\
      \ Virginia, on the Atlantic coast. Its approximate longitude is 76.2\xB0 W.\n\
      \nSo comparing:\n- University of West Florida: ~87.2\xB0 W\n- Regent University:\
      \ ~76.2\xB0 W\n\nSince 87.2\xB0 W is further west than 76.2\xB0 W (the higher\
      \ the west longitude, the further west the location), the University of West\
      \ Florida is west of Regent University, not east.\n\nTherefore, the answer to\
      \ the question \"Is University of West Florida, FL located east of Regent University,\
      \ VA?\" is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine if University\
      \ of West Florida (in Florida) is east of Regent University (in Virginia), I\
      \ need to consider their geographic locations.\n\n1. First, let me identify\
      \ the specific locations of each university:\n   - University of West Florida\
      \ is located in Pensacola, in the western panhandle of Florida\n   - Regent\
      \ University is located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, on the Atlantic coast\n\
      \n2. Now I need to compare their longitudes (east-west positioning):\n   - Pensacola,\
      \ FL is located at approximately 87\xB0 West longitude\n   - Virginia Beach,\
      \ VA is located at approximately 76\xB0 West longitude\n\n3. On a map of the\
      \ United States, lower west longitude numbers indicate more easterly locations.\
      \ Since 76\xB0 West (Regent) is a lower number than 87\xB0 West (UWF), Regent\
      \ University is further east.\n\n4. Therefore, University of West Florida is\
      \ located WEST of Regent University, not east of it.\n\n# Answer: NO"

      \nThe University of West Florida is likely in western Florida (given the name\

      \ closer to the Gulf of Mexico, significantly further west than Virginia Beach.\n\
      \nSo, is University of West Florida (in western Florida) east of Regent University\
      \ (in eastern Virginia)?\n\nNo, University of West Florida is NOT east of Regent\
      \ University. University of West Florida is further WEST than Regent University.\n\
      \nTo verify, we can consider approximate longitudes:\n- Virginia Beach, VA (where\

      \ FL (where University of West Florida is located) is at roughly 87\xB0 W longitude\n\

      \ Florida (87\xB0 W) is further west than Regent University (76\xB0 W).\n\n\
      Therefore, University of West Florida is NOT east of Regent University. It's\
      \ west of it.</think># Is University of West Florida, FL located east of Regent\

      \ of West Florida is in Pensacola, Florida (in the western Florida panhandle)\n\
      - Regent University is in Virginia Beach, Virginia (on the eastern coast of\
      \ Virginia)\n\n## Step 2: Consider the geography\n- Florida extends as a peninsula\
      \ in the southeastern US\n- Virginia is located on the mid-Atlantic coast\n\
      - However, \"West Florida\" refers to the western panhandle region, which extends\

      \ is approximately at 76\xB0 W longitude\n- Pensacola (University of West Florida)\
      \ is approximately at 87\xB0 W longitude\n- A higher western longitude number\
      \ means further west\n\n## Step 4: Draw a conclusion\nSince University of West\
      \ Florida (87\xB0 W) has a higher western longitude than Regent University (76\xB0\

      \nLet me start with Otterbein University in Ohio.\n\nOtterbein University is\
      \ located in Westerville, Ohio, which is a suburb of Columbus, Ohio. Columbus\

      \ the coast), while Westerville is in central Ohio, it's very likely that Otterbein\
      \ University is west of Stratford University, not east.\n\nSo the answer should\

    1f01d423-bbd2-4823-a682-20e2ada905db: '<think>To solve this problem, I need to
      determine the locations of two universities and compare them:

      1. Texas Tech University College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources
      in Texas (TX)

      2. Mount Mercy University in Iowa (IA)


      First, let''s identify the approximate locations of these universities:


      Texas Tech University is in Lubbock, Texas, which is in northwest Texas.

      Mount Mercy University is in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which is in eastern Iowa.


      Now, I need to determine which is further east (has a higher longitude).


      In the United States, the general geographic orientation is:

      - East = toward the Atlantic Ocean

      - West = toward the Pacific Ocean


      Texas is generally west and south of Iowa. Iowa is in the midwest region of
      the US, while Texas is in the south/southwest.


      Looking at the relative positions:

      - Iowa''s eastern border is along the Mississippi River, with Illinois to its
      east

      - Texas is considerably further west than Iowa


      Therefore, Mount Mercy University in Iowa would be east of Texas Tech University
      in Texas.


      So to answer the question: "Is Texas Tech University College of Agricultural
      Sciences & Natural Resources, TX located east of Mount Mercy University, IA?"


      The answer would be NO. Texas Tech is located WEST of Mount Mercy University,
      not east of it.</think># Is Texas Tech University east of Mount Mercy University?


      I need to determine the geographical positions of these two universities and
      compare them.


      ## Step 1: Locate both universities

      - Texas Tech University College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources
      is in Lubbock, Texas (TX)

      - Mount Mercy University is in Cedar Rapids, Iowa (IA)


      ## Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the US map

      - Iowa is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is in the southern/southwestern United States

      - Generally, Iowa is north and east of Texas


      ## Step 3: Compare specific east-west positioning

      - Lubbock, Texas is in the western part of Texas

      - Cedar Rapids, Iowa is in eastern Iowa

      - On the US map, Iowa is significantly east of Texas''s position


      ## Conclusion

      Texas Tech University is located WEST of Mount Mercy University, not east of
      it.

      \ the United States.\n2. Mount Mercy University is located in Cedar Rapids,\
      \ Iowa. Iowa is in the midwestern part of the United States.\n\nNow, to determine\
      \ which one is more eastern, I need to compare their longitudes. In the United\
      \ States, eastern locations have lower (less negative) longitude values than\
      \ western locations.\n\nTexas is generally west of Iowa. Looking at their relative\
      \ positions on a map of the US:\n- Texas is in the south-central part of the\
      \ country\n- Iowa is in the north-central part of the country, but more importantly\
      \ for this question, Iowa is east of Texas\n\nSo Mount Mercy University in Iowa\
      \ should be east of Texas Tech University in Texas.\n\nLet me confirm by thinking\
      \ about their approximate longitudes:\n- Lubbock, TX (Texas Tech) is around\
      \ longitude -101.8\xB0 (101.8\xB0 West)\n- Cedar Rapids, IA (Mount Mercy) is\

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States. Texas is generally\
      \ south of Iowa. But we need to know their east-west positioning, not north-south.\n\
      \nIowa is in the Midwest and is approximately in the middle of the continental\
      \ US from an east-west perspective. \n\nTexas extends quite far west. Lubbock,\
      \ where Texas Tech is located, is in the western part of Texas.\n\nComparing\

      \ of the US.\n\nTherefore, I believe Mount Mercy University in Iowa would be\
      \ east of Texas Tech University in Texas. Since the question asks if Texas Tech\
      \ is east of Mount Mercy, the answer would be NO.\n\nBut let me double-check\
      \ by being more specific about the locations.\n\nIowa is approximately between\
      \ 90\xB0W and 96\xB0W longitude.\nCedar Rapids is in eastern Iowa, so it would\
      \ be closer to 90\xB0W.\n\nTexas's longitude ranges from about 94\xB0W to 106\xB0\
      W.\nLubbock, being in western Texas, would be closer to 106\xB0W.\n\nSo Cedar\
      \ Rapids (Mount Mercy) is around 91-92\xB0W, while Lubbock (Texas Tech) is around\
      \ 101-102\xB0W.\n\nSince smaller longitude numbers in the western hemisphere\

      Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas is located at approximately 33.6\xB0\

      W\n- Texas Tech: 101.9\xB0W\n\nThe smaller the west longitude number, the further\
      \ east the location. So Mount Mercy (91.6\xB0W) is east of Texas Tech (101.9\xB0\

      \ Kentucky University-Owensboro is in Kentucky (KY). Kentucky is a state in\
      \ the eastern half of the United States, located south of Ohio and Indiana.\n\
      \   \n2. Ave Maria University is in Florida (FL). Florida is a state in the\
      \ southeastern United States, forming the peninsula that separates the Gulf\
      \ of Mexico from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n3. Now I need to think about the east-west\
      \ relationship. In the United States, the eastward direction corresponds to\
      \ moving toward the Atlantic coast, while the westward direction corresponds\
      \ to moving toward the Pacific coast.\n\n4. Kentucky is generally north of Florida.\
      \ But the question is about the east-west relationship, not north-south.\n\n\
      5. Kentucky is in the eastern U.S., but it's more inland compared to Florida,\
      \ which has a large Atlantic coastline.\n\n6. Specifically, Owensboro, KY is\
      \ in the western part of Kentucky (as the name \"Western Kentucky University\"\
      \ suggests). So it's in the western part of an eastern state.\n\n7. Ave Maria,\
      \ FL, based on my knowledge, is in southwestern Florida, east of Naples.\n\n\
      I need to compare the longitudes to be more precise. The continental U.S. spans\
      \ roughly from longitude 67\xB0W (eastern Maine) to 125\xB0W (western Washington\
      \ state). Lower longitude numbers (less negative, since these are western longitudes)\
      \ are more eastward.\n\nI believe:\n- Owensboro, KY is approximately at longitude\

      \ 81\xB0W is a smaller number than 87\xB0W, Ave Maria, FL is east of Owensboro,\

      \ Even the western parts of Florida, like the panhandle, are still relatively\

      \ Florida, so it's not as far east as Miami or other parts of eastern Florida,\
      \ but it's still on the Florida peninsula, which extends eastward.\n\nKentucky,\
      \ on the other hand, is more centrally located in the eastern U.S. Owensboro,\

      \ University-Owensboro is NOT east of Ave Maria University.\n\nI think the answer\
      \ to the question \"Is Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY located east\
      \ of Ave Maria University, FL?\" is NO.\n\nActually, let me double-check this.\
      \ I need to be precise about the longitudes.\n\nOwensboro, KY is in the western\
      \ part of Kentucky, close to the border with Indiana. Its approximate longitude\
      \ is indeed around 87\xB0W.\n\nAve Maria, FL is near Naples in southwestern\
      \ Florida. Its approximate longitude is around 81\xB0W to 82\xB0W.\n\nSince\
      \ longitude 81\xB0W to 82\xB0W is east of 87\xB0W (remember, for western longitudes,\
      \ smaller numbers are eastward), Ave Maria, FL is east of Owensboro, KY.\n\n\
      Therefore, the answer is NO, Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY is NOT\
      \ located east of Ave Maria University, FL. Instead, Ave Maria University, FL\
      \ is east of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY.\n\nHmm, let me think\
      \ about this a bit more carefully. I want to check my understanding of US geography.\
      \ \n\nKentucky is north of Florida. Kentucky's western border is at the Mississippi\
      \ river, and it extends quite a ways east. Owensboro is a city in the western\
      \ part of the state. Florida is a southeastern state, with a large Atlantic\
      \ coastline, and the peninsula extending south into the Caribbean. \n\nNow,\
      \ the question is asking about the east-west relationship. Even though Kentucky\
      \ is north of Florida, that doesn't tell us about the east-west relationship.\n\
      \nI know that Kentucky is generally north of Florida. But Florida extends farther\

      \ 87.1\xB0W longitude.\n- Ave Maria, FL is at approximately 81.4\xB0W longitude.\n\
      \nSince 81.4 is a smaller number than 87.1, and we're talking about western\

      \ KY is located at approximately 87.1\xB0W.\nAve Maria University, FL is located\
      \ at approximately 81.4\xB0W.\n\nThese are both western longitude, i.e., they\
      \ are west of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0). The scale then goes from 0\xB0W (Prime\
      \ Meridian) to 180\xB0W (International Date Line). So a smaller number means\
      \ the location is more towards the east.\n\nComparing 87.1\xB0W and 81.4\xB0\
      W:\n81.4\xB0W < 87.1\xB0W\n\nThis means that Ave Maria University, FL is east\
      \ of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY.\n\nTherefore, the answer to\
      \ the question \"Is Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY located east of\
      \ Ave Maria University, FL?\" is NO.\n\nActually, let me verify with my knowledge\
      \ of U.S. geography that the relative longitudes I've been using are roughly\
      \ correct.\n\nKentucky is a state in the eastern United States. Owensboro is\
      \ a city in western Kentucky, near the border with Indiana.\n\nFlorida is also\
      \ in the eastern United States, forming a peninsula that extends southward.\
      \ Ave Maria is a town in southwestern Florida, relatively close to the Gulf\
      \ of Mexico.\n\nGiven the shape of the United States, it's generally true that\
      \ locations in Florida are east of locations in Kentucky, especially when comparing\
      \ a western Kentucky city like Owensboro to a Florida location.\n\nEven though\
      \ Ave Maria is in the southwestern part of Florida, Florida's entire peninsula\
      \ is still quite eastern compared to many parts of the U.S. Southwestern Florida\
      \ would still generally be east of a location in western Kentucky.\n\nGiven\
      \ the general shape of the United States, it makes sense that 81.4\xB0W (Ave\
      \ Maria, FL) is east of 87.1\xB0W (Owensboro, KY).\n\nTherefore, based both\
      \ on my understanding of U.S. geography and the specific longitude values, I\
      \ believe that Ave Maria University, FL is east of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro,\
      \ KY.\n\nThe answer to the question \"Is Western Kentucky University-Owensboro,\
      \ KY located east of Ave Maria University, FL?\" is NO.\n\nActually, let me\
      \ make sure I'm not confused about the directions. In terms of longitude:\n\n\
      - East longitudes are from 0\xB0 to 180\xB0E.\n- West longitudes are from 0\xB0\
      \ to 180\xB0W.\n\nFor locations in the western hemisphere (which includes the\
      \ United States), longitudes are given as degrees west. A smaller west longitude\
      \ (closer to 0\xB0W) is more eastward than a larger west longitude.\n\nSo, comparing\
      \ 81.4\xB0W (Ave Maria, FL) and 87.1\xB0W (Owensboro, KY):\n81.4\xB0W is closer\
      \ to 0\xB0W than 87.1\xB0W, which means Ave Maria, FL is east of Owensboro,\
      \ KY.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is Western Kentucky University-Owensboro,\
      \ KY located east of Ave Maria University, FL?\" is NO.\n\nLet me try once more,\
      \ using a slightly different approach:\n\nIf I imagine standing at the Prime\
      \ Meridian (0\xB0 longitude) and looking westward:\n- At 81.4\xB0W, I'd see\
      \ Ave Maria, FL.\n- At 87.1\xB0W, which is further to the west, I'd see Owensboro,\
      \ KY.\n\nThis indicates that Ave Maria, FL is east of Owensboro, KY.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer to the question \"Is Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY\
      \ located east of Ave Maria University, FL?\" is NO.\n\nIn summary: Western\
      \ Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY is NOT located east of Ave Maria University,\
      \ FL. Instead, Ave Maria University, FL is east of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro,\
      \ KY.</think># Determining if Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is east\

      whether Arkansas State University-Mountain Home in Arkansas is located east
      of Ball State University in Indiana.


      To solve this, I need to know the geographic locations of both universities
      and compare their east-west positions, which is determined by their longitude.
      Lower (or more negative) longitude numbers in the western hemisphere indicate
      more westerly locations.


      Let me recall the approximate locations:


      1. Arkansas State University-Mountain Home (ASU-Mountain Home) is in Mountain
      Home, Arkansas.

      2. Ball State University is in Muncie, Indiana.


      Arkansas is a state that is generally west of Indiana. Arkansas is in the south-central
      part of the United States, while Indiana is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Arkansas''s eastern border touches the Mississippi River

      - Indiana''s western border touches Illinois, and its eastern border touches
      Ohio

      - Arkansas is definitely west of Indiana


      Since ASU-Mountain Home is in Arkansas, and Ball State University is in Indiana,
      I can say with high confidence that ASU-Mountain Home is west of Ball State
      University, not east.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Arkansas State University-Mountain Home, AR is
      NOT located east of Ball State University, IN.</think># Is Arkansas State University-Mountain
      Home, AR located east of Ball State University, IN?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities by examining their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Mountain Home, Arkansas

      - Ball State University is in Muncie, Indiana


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central region of the United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Arkansas is positioned west of the Mississippi River

      - Indiana is several states to the east of Arkansas

      - On a map of the United States, Indiana is clearly east of Arkansas


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Since Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Arkansas (a western state
      relative to Indiana), and Ball State University is in Indiana (an eastern state
      relative to Arkansas), Arkansas State University-Mountain Home must be west
      of Ball State University, not east.

      I need to determine the geographic locations of Arkansas State University-Mountain
      Home, AR and Ball State University, IN, and then compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Locate Arkansas State University-Mountain Home, AR.

      Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is located in Mountain Home, Arkansas.
      Arkansas is a state in the south-central region of the United States.


      Step 2: Locate Ball State University, IN.

      Ball State University is located in Muncie, Indiana. Indiana is a state in the
      Midwestern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      To determine which university is further east, I need to compare their longitudes.
      In the United States, locations further east have lower longitude values (when
      expressed as negative numbers) or higher longitude values (when expressed as
      positive numbers).


      Arkansas is generally west of Indiana on a U.S. map. Indiana borders Illinois
      to its west and Ohio to its east, while Arkansas borders Oklahoma to its west
      and Mississippi to its east.


      Specifically:

      - Arkansas is in the south-central United States

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, but further east than Arkansas


      Looking at a mental map of the United States, Arkansas is definitely west of
      Indiana. Therefore, Arkansas State University-Mountain Home would be west of
      Ball State University, not east of it.


      So, Arkansas State University-Mountain Home, AR is NOT located east of Ball
      State University, IN. It''s located west of it.


      The answer is NO.

      knowledge about U.S. states is sufficient to answer this question confidently.)</think>I
      need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities

      - Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Mountain Home, Arkansas.

      - Ball State University is in Muncie, Indiana.


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of Arkansas and Indiana.

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Arkansas lies to the west of Indiana.
      The Mississippi River roughly serves as a dividing line, with Arkansas west
      of the river and Indiana east of it.


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Since Arkansas is west of Indiana, Arkansas State University-Mountain Home must
      be west (not east) of Ball State University.

      First, let me think about the general geography of Oklahoma and Illinois:

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Generally speaking, Illinois is east of Oklahoma. On a map of the United States,

      \ in the southeastern part of the United States.\n\nThinking about this more\
      \ specifically, New Hampshire is definitely north of Georgia, but whether it's\

      \ Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is NOT located east of Grand Valley\

      First, I need to locate both universities geographically:\n\n1. Texas Tech University\
      \ at Fredericksburg, TX\n   - Fredericksburg is located in central Texas\n \
      \  - Approximate longitude: around 98.9\xB0 W\n\n2. Grand Valley State University,\
      \ MI\n   - Located in Allendale, Michigan (with campuses in Grand Rapids and\
      \ other Michigan locations)\n   - Approximate longitude: around 85.9\xB0 W\n\
      \nWhen comparing longitudes in the western hemisphere (the United States), the\
      \ smaller the western longitude number, the further east a location is.\n\n\
      Since 85.9\xB0 W (Michigan) is a smaller number than 98.9\xB0 W (Texas), Grand\
      \ Valley State University is located further east than Texas Tech University\
      \ at Fredericksburg.\n\n# Answer: NO\n\nTexas Tech University at Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX is NOT located east of Grand Valley State University, MI."

      \ the locations of these two universities.\n\nStep 1: I need to identify the\
      \ locations of both universities.\n- Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX\n- Grand Valley State University, MI\n\nStep 2: Fredericksburg, TX is in\
      \ Texas, which is in the southern part of the United States.\n\nStep 3: MI stands\

      \ in the Great Lakes region.\n\nStep 4: Now I need to determine which one is\
      \ further east. In the US, the eastern states are closer to the Atlantic Ocean,\
      \ and the western states are closer to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nStep 5: Let me\
      \ think about the approximate longitudes of these locations.\n- Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX is in central Texas, which is roughly at longitude around 98\xB0 W.\n-\
      \ Grand Valley State University is in Michigan, which is more in the eastern\
      \ half of the US. Michigan's longitude ranges approximately from 82\xB0 W to\
      \ 90\xB0 W.\n\nStep 6: The more negative the longitude number (or the higher\
      \ the \"W\" number), the further west a location is. The more positive the longitude\
      \ number (or the lower the \"W\" number), the further east it is.\n\nStep 7:\
      \ Based on my knowledge, Fredericksburg, TX is around longitude 98\xB0 W, while\
      \ Grand Valley State University in Michigan is likely around 85-86\xB0 W.\n\n\
      Step 8: Since 85-86\xB0 W is a smaller number than 98\xB0 W (when looking at\
      \ the absolute value), Grand Valley State University is further east than Texas\
      \ Tech University at Fredericksburg.\n\nLet me double-check this. If we look\
      \ at a map of the United States:\n- Texas is generally west of Michigan.\n-\
      \ Fredericksburg is in central Texas, so it doesn't change this relationship.\n\
      - Grand Valley State University is in western Michigan (near Grand Rapids),\
      \ but Michigan as a whole is still east of Texas.\n\nSo, to answer the question\
      \ \"Is Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX located east of Grand Valley\

      \ to compare the east-west positions of two universities:\n\n1. Texas Tech University\

      \ if Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is located east of Grand Valley\
      \ State University, MI.\n\nLet me think about the geographic locations:\n\n\
      Texas is a state in the southern United States, generally considered to be in\
      \ the south-central part of the country.\nMichigan (MI) is a state in the northern\
      \ United States, in the Great Lakes region.\n\nIn terms of east-west positioning,\
      \ let me think about the general geography:\n- Texas is generally west of Michigan.\n\
      - Fredericksburg is a city in Texas, though I'm not sure if there's actually\
      \ a Texas Tech campus in Fredericksburg.\n- Grand Valley State University is\
      \ in Michigan, likely in the western part of Michigan but I should check.\n\n\
      Let me try to recall more specific information:\n\nGrand Valley State University\
      \ is located in Allendale, Michigan, which is in the western part of Michigan,\
      \ not far from Lake Michigan.\n\nTexas Tech University's main campus is in Lubbock,\
      \ Texas, which is in the western part of Texas. However, the question specifically\
      \ mentions a campus in Fredericksburg, Texas. Fredericksburg is in central Texas,\
      \ in the Texas Hill Country region.\n\nNow let's think about this in terms of\
      \ longitude (east-west position):\n\nMichigan is approximately between 82\xB0\
      W and 90\xB0W longitude.\nTexas is approximately between 94\xB0W and 106\xB0\
      W longitude.\n\nSince lower western longitude numbers indicate more eastern\
      \ positions in North America, Michigan is east of Texas.\n\nFredericksburg,\
      \ TX is in central Texas, so it would be somewhere around 98\xB0W-99\xB0W.\n\
      Grand Valley State University in western Michigan would be around 85\xB0W-86\xB0\
      W.\n\nSince 85\xB0W-86\xB0W is numerically smaller than 98\xB0W-99\xB0W, Grand\
      \ Valley State University is east of Fredericksburg, TX.\n\nActually, let me\
      \ double-check this. The smaller the western longitude, the farther east a location\
      \ is. So:\n\n- If Fredericksburg, TX is at ~98\xB0W \n- And Grand Valley State\
      \ University is at ~85\xB0W\n\nThen Grand Valley State University is farther\
      \ east than Fredericksburg, TX.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think\
      \ about this differently.\n\nIn the western hemisphere (where both the US and\
      \ Canada are), longitude is measured in degrees west. The eastern coast of the\
      \ US is around 70\xB0W-80\xB0W, while the western coast is around 120\xB0W-125\xB0\
      W. So lower numbers of degrees west mean farther east.\n\nSo if:\n- Grand Valley\
      \ State University is at ~85\xB0W\n- Fredericksburg, TX is at ~98\xB0W\n\nThen\
      \ Grand Valley State University is farther east than Fredericksburg, TX, because\
      \ 85 < 98.\n\nBut that still doesn't sound right, because Michigan is generally\
      \ north and east of Texas.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll use my knowledge\
      \ of US geography:\n\nMichigan is in the Great Lakes region, in the northern\
      \ central part of the US.\nTexas is in the south central part of the US.\n\n\
      If we look at a map of the US, Michigan is definitely east of Texas. So Grand\
      \ Valley State University in Michigan should be east of any location in Texas,\
      \ including Fredericksburg.\n\nActually, maybe I'm confused about the geography.\
      \ Let me try to visualize a map of the US again:\n\n- The east coast states\
      \ include Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New\
      \ York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\
      \ Georgia, and Florida.\n- The west coast states include Washington, Oregon,\
      \ and California.\n- The central states include (from north to south) North\
      \ Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas in a vertical\
      \ line, and to their east are Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana.\n\
      - Michigan is east of this central line, in the Great Lakes region along with\
      \ Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.\n\nSo Michigan is east of Texas. But\
      \ let me try to be more precise about the specific cities:\n\n- Grand Valley\
      \ State University is in Allendale, Michigan, which is in the western part of\
      \ Michigan.\n- Fredericksburg, Texas is in central Texas.\n\nEven though Grand\
      \ Valley State University is in western Michigan, Michigan as a whole is so\
      \ much farther east than Texas that even western Michigan is east of central\
      \ Texas.\n\nI should double-check by looking at approximate longitudes:\n\n\
      - Allendale, MI (location of Grand Valley State University) is approximately\
      \ at 85.9\xB0W longitude.\n- Fredericksburg, TX is approximately at 98.9\xB0\
      W longitude.\n\nSince 85.9 < 98.9, Allendale (and thus Grand Valley State University)\
      \ is east of Fredericksburg, TX.\n\nActually, let me reconsider this again.\
      \ I think I might have been confused initially, but I'm now more confident in\
      \ my reasoning.\n\nIn the western hemisphere, longitudes are measured in degrees\
      \ west from the prime meridian (0\xB0), which runs through Greenwich, London.\
      \ The farther west you go, the larger the longitude value becomes. The east\
      \ coast of the US is around 70\xB0W-80\xB0W, while the west coast is around\
      \ 120\xB0W-125\xB0W.\n\nSo:\n- If Allendale, MI (GVSU) is at ~85.9\xB0W\n- And\
      \ Fredericksburg, TX is at ~98.9\xB0W\n\nThen Allendale is farther east than\
      \ Fredericksburg because 85.9 < 98.9, meaning it's fewer degrees west of the\
      \ prime meridian.\n\nMichigan is indeed east of Texas, so this makes sense.\n\
      \nTherefore, Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is NOT located east\
      \ of Grand Valley State University, MI. It's actually located west of it.\n\n\
      Actually, let me double-check one more thing before giving my final answer.\
      \ I want to make sure that Texas Tech actually has a campus in Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX. I'm not immediately familiar with a Texas Tech campus in Fredericksburg.\n\
      \nTexas Tech University's main campus is in Lubbock, TX, and they have several\
      \ satellite campuses or centers. I'm not completely certain that they have a\
      \ campus in Fredericksburg, but for the purposes of this question, I'll assume\
      \ there is a Texas Tech facility in Fredericksburg, TX.\n\nSo, my final reasoning\
      \ is:\n1. Grand Valley State University is in Allendale, MI, at approximately\
      \ 85.9\xB0W longitude.\n2. Fredericksburg, TX (where I'm assuming there's a\
      \ Texas Tech campus) is at approximately 98.9\xB0W longitude.\n3. Since 85.9\
      \ < 98.9, Allendale (GVSU) is east of Fredericksburg (Texas Tech).\n4. Therefore,\
      \ Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is NOT located east of Grand Valley\
      \ State University, MI. It's located west of it.\n\nThe answer is NO.\n\nActually,\
      \ I just realized I should double-check if there actually is a Texas Tech campus\
      \ in Fredericksburg. Looking at my knowledge, I'm not confident there is a Texas\
      \ Tech campus in Fredericksburg, TX. Texas Tech's main campus is in Lubbock,\
      \ and they have satellite locations, but I'm not aware of one specifically in\
      \ Fredericksburg.\n\nIf there isn't actually a Texas Tech campus in Fredericksburg,\
      \ the question might be hypothetical or based on incorrect information. But\
      \ the geographical reasoning would still apply - a location in Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX would be west of Grand Valley State University in Michigan.\n\nSo, my answer\
      \ remains the same: NO, Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is not located\
      \ east of Grand Valley State University, MI.\n\nWait, I just noticed I'm making\
      \ a mistake. Let me think through this one more time.\n\nThe question asks:\n\
      \"Is Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX located east of Grand Valley\
      \ State University, MI?\"\n\nIf Texas Tech at Fredericksburg is at ~98.9\xB0\
      W and Grand Valley State is at ~85.9\xB0W, then Texas Tech is at a higher degree\
      \ of western longitude.\n\nIn the western hemisphere, locations with higher\
      \ degrees of western longitude are farther west, not east. So Texas Tech at\
      \ Fredericksburg is west of Grand Valley State, not east of it.\n\nSo the answer\
      \ to \"Is Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX located east of Grand\
      \ Valley State University, MI?\" is NO.\n\nI'm going to triple-check my reasoning:\n\
      \n1. In the western hemisphere, longitudes are measured in degrees west from\
      \ the prime meridian (0\xB0).\n2. The farther west you go, the larger the longitude\
      \ value becomes.\n3. Fredericksburg, TX is at approximately 98.9\xB0W longitude.\n\
      4. Allendale, MI (location of Grand Valley State University) is at approximately\

      \ positions (longitudes) to determine if Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg\
      \ is east of Grand Valley State University.\n\nFirst, let me consider the locations:\n\
      \nTexas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX:\n- Fredericksburg is a city in\

      \ University, MI:\n- MI stands for Michigan\n- Michigan is in the northern United\

      - States in the eastern United States generally have smaller (less negative)\
      \ longitude values than states in the western United States\n- Michigan is in\
      \ the Midwest/Great Lakes region\n- Texas is generally considered to be in the\
      \ Southwest\n\nLooking at a mental map of the United States:\n- Michigan is\

      \ is around roughly 85-87\xB0 W longitude\n- Central Texas (where Fredericksburg\
      \ is) would be roughly around 98-100\xB0 W longitude\n\nSince a smaller (less\

      \ immediately recall a Fredericksburg campus. But regardless of whether this\
      \ campus exists, the geographic reasoning remains the same - any location in\
      \ central Texas would be west of Michigan.\n\nThe answer is NO, Texas Tech University\

      \ determine if Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is east of Grand\
      \ Valley State University in Michigan, I need to compare their geographic locations.\n\
      \n1) Let me identify the locations:\n   - Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg\
      \ would be in Fredericksburg, Texas\n   - Grand Valley State University is in\
      \ Michigan (primarily in Allendale, MI)\n\n2) Considering the east-west positioning\
      \ in the United States:\n   - Michigan is in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest\n\
      \   - Texas is in the southwestern part of the United States\n   - On a map\

      \ longitudes:\n   - Michigan locations are generally around 85-87\xB0 West longitude\n\
      \   - Central Texas (where Fredericksburg is located) is around 98-99\xB0 West\
      \ longitude\n   - Lower longitude numbers (less negative) indicate more easterly\
      \ positions\n\n4) Since Michigan has a lower west longitude than central Texas,\
      \ Michigan is east of Texas, not the other way around.\n\n# Answer: NO\n\nTexas\

      \ locations:\n\nTexas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX:\n- Fredericksburg\
      \ is a city in central Texas.\n- Texas is in the southern United States, generally\
      \ extending from roughly 94\xB0W to 106\xB0W longitude.\n- Fredericksburg, specifically,\

      \ there actually is a Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX. Texas Tech\
      \ University's main campus is in Lubbock, TX, and I'm not immediately aware\
      \ of a campus in Fredericksburg.\n\nLet me reason through anyway: \n\nMichigan\
      \ is generally east of Texas. Points in Texas typically have more westerly longitudes\
      \ (higher negative numbers or higher degrees West) than points in Michigan.\n\
      \nSo, if there is a Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX, it is likely\
      \ west of Grand Valley State University, MI.\n\nBut let me double-check these\
      \ locations to be sure:\n\n- Fredericksburg, TX is indeed in central Texas,\
      \ with a longitude of about 98.9\xB0W.\n- Grand Valley State University is in\
      \ Allendale, MI (main campus), with a longitude of about 85.9\xB0W.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two:\n- Fredericksburg, TX: ~98.9\xB0W\n- Grand Valley State University,\
      \ MI: ~85.9\xB0W\n\nSince 98.9 is a larger number than 85.9 in terms of degrees\
      \ West, Fredericksburg is further west. Another way to think of it: as you go\
      \ west from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0), the degrees West increase.\n\nSo, Texas\
      \ Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX (if it exists) would be west of Grand\
      \ Valley State University, MI, not east.\n\nHmm, let me check if there genuinely\
      \ is a Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX. \n\nI don't think there's\

      \ MI?\n\nBased on the longitudes, Fredericksburg, TX (98.9\xB0W) is west of\
      \ Grand Valley State University, MI (85.9\xB0W). So, the answer is NO.\n\nLet\
      \ me double check by thinking about a map of the United States. Texas is in\
      \ the southern part of the country, while Michigan is in the northern part.\
      \ But in terms of east-west positioning, Michigan is definitely further east\

      \nTo determine if Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is east of Grand\

      \ Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX\n   - Grand Valley State University,\
      \ MI\n\n2. Fredericksburg, TX is a city in Texas. Texas is in the southern part\

      \ I need to compare their longitudes. In the United States, lower longitude\
      \ numbers represent locations further east.\n\nLet me think about the general\
      \ geography of the United States:\n- Michigan is in the Great Lakes region,\
      \ in the northern central/eastern part of the US\n- Texas is in the southern\
      \ central part of the US\n\nTexas is generally west of Michigan. However, Texas\
      \ is a large state, and Fredericksburg is a specific city in Texas. Similarly,\
      \ I should know exactly where Grand Valley State University is located in Michigan.\n\
      \nFredericksburg, TX is located in central Texas, west of Austin and San Antonio.\n\
      Grand Valley State University is located in Allendale, Michigan, which is in\
      \ the western part of Michigan.\n\nLet's think about the approximate longitudes:\n\
      - Western Michigan is approximately around 85-86\xB0W longitude\n- Central Texas\
      \ (where Fredericksburg is) is approximately around 98-99\xB0W longitude\n\n\
      Since larger western longitudes indicate locations further west, and Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX has a larger western longitude than western Michigan, that means Fredericksburg\
      \ is west of Grand Valley State University.\n\nTherefore, Texas Tech University\
      \ at Fredericksburg, TX is NOT located east of Grand Valley State University,\
      \ MI. It's located west of it.\n\nActually, let me double check this. It's important\
      \ to be precise about the locations.\n\nFredericksburg, TX is located at approximately\
      \ 98.8724\xB0W longitude.\nGrand Valley State University in Allendale, MI is\
      \ located at approximately 85.9531\xB0W longitude.\n\nSince 98.8724\xB0W is\
      \ a larger number than 85.9531\xB0W (when dealing with western longitudes, larger\
      \ numbers indicate locations further west), Fredericksburg is indeed west of\
      \ Grand Valley State University.\n\nSo my answer is correct: Texas Tech University\
      \ at Fredericksburg, TX is NOT located east of Grand Valley State University,\
      \ MI. It's located west of it.\n\nHowever, let me double-check another fact:\
      \ the existence of Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg. Texas Tech University's\

      \ Texas Tech University's main campus is in Lubbock, and they have satellite\
      \ locations, but I'm not immediately certain about a Fredericksburg location.\n\
      \nRegardless, the question is asking about the relative east-west positioning.\
      \ If we assume there is a Texas Tech location in Fredericksburg, TX, then it\

      \ the question more carefully:\n\n\"Is Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg,\
      \ TX located east of Grand Valley State University, MI?\"\n\nThe question asks\
      \ if Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX is east of Grand Valley State\

      Texas is generally south of Oklahoma. However, the question is specifically
      about east-west positioning.


      Western Texas (where Midland is located) is to the west of central Oklahoma
      (where Shawnee is located). Oklahoma is entirely east of the western part of
      Texas where Midland is located.


      Since Midland College is in western Texas, and Oklahoma Baptist University is
      in central Oklahoma, Midland College is west of Oklahoma Baptist University,
      not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Midland College, TX is not located east of Oklahoma
      Baptist University, OK. It is located west of it.</think># Step-by-step reasoning


      To determine if Midland College, TX is located east of Oklahoma Baptist University,
      OK, I need to find the geographic locations of both institutions and compare
      their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Midland College is in Midland, Texas, which is in western Texas

      - Oklahoma Baptist University is in Shawnee, Oklahoma, which is in central Oklahoma


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - Texas extends significantly further west than Oklahoma

      - Western Texas (where Midland is) is west of any part of Oklahoma


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations

      - Midland, TX sits in the western part of Texas

      - Shawnee, OK is in central Oklahoma

      - Looking at a map, Midland is clearly west of Shawnee, not east of it

      \ (GA) is in the southeastern United States\n- Pennsylvania (PA) is in the northeastern\
      \ United States\n\nWhile both states are on the eastern side of the US, I need\
      \ to determine their relative east-west positioning. In the US, locations are\
      \ typically measured by longitude, where lower (more negative) longitude numbers\
      \ indicate more western locations, and higher (less negative) longitude numbers\
      \ indicate more eastern locations.\n\nLet me think about the general positions:\n\
      - Georgia is generally south of Pennsylvania\n- But the question is asking about\
      \ east-west positioning\n\nI know that Pennsylvania is more toward the northeast,\
      \ while Georgia is in the southeast. Georgia's eastern border includes the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean, but Pennsylvania is inland, though its eastern border is relatively\
      \ close to the Atlantic as well.\n\nNow, let's be more specific about these\
      \ universities:\n- Clayton State University is in Morrow, Georgia, which is\
      \ near Atlanta\n- Robert Morris University is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania,\
      \ which is near Pittsburgh\n\nAtlanta is in northern Georgia but not on the\

      \ 80.0\xB0 W (west).\nAtlanta, GA is located approximately at longitude 84.4\xB0\

      \ and Pittsburgh (80.0\xB0 W) has a smaller western longitude than Atlanta (84.4\xB0\
      \ W), that means Pittsburgh is east of Atlanta.\n\nSince Clayton State University\
      \ is near Atlanta (in Morrow, GA), and Robert Morris University is near Pittsburgh\
      \ (in Moon Township, PA), this would suggest that Robert Morris University is\
      \ east of Clayton State University, not the other way around.\n\nHowever, let\
      \ me double-check the specific locations of these universities to be sure:\n\
      \nClayton State University is in Morrow, GA, which is just south of Atlanta.\
      \ Its approximate longitude would be similar to Atlanta's, around 84.3\xB0 W.\n\
      \nRobert Morris University is in Moon Township, PA, which is just west of Pittsburgh.\
      \ Its approximate longitude would be similar to Pittsburgh's, around 80.1\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nSince 80.1\xB0 W is east of 84.3\xB0 W (remember, with western longitudes,\
      \ smaller numbers are further east), Robert Morris University is east of Clayton\
      \ State University.\n\nSo, is Clayton State University, GA located east of Robert\

      \nAtlanta, GA is roughly at longitude around 84\xB0 W.\nPittsburgh, PA is roughly\

      \ that Morrow is south of Atlanta doesn't change the east-west relationship\
      \ much. Similarly, Moon Township being west of Pittsburgh means it's slightly\
      \ more western than Pittsburgh itself.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n- Morrow,\
      \ GA (Clayton State) is around 84\xB0 W longitude\n- Moon Township, PA (Robert\
      \ Morris) is around 80\xB0 W longitude\n\nSince 80\xB0 W is east of 84\xB0 W\
      \ (smaller western longitude numbers are more eastern), Robert Morris University\

      \ east of western Pennsylvania.\n\nStep 5: Based on my knowledge of US geography,\
      \ I believe that Clayton State University in Georgia is likely east of Robert\
      \ Morris University in Pennsylvania, since Robert Morris is in the western part\

      \ 0\xB0 at the Prime Meridian), a location at 80\xB0 W is east of a location\
      \ at 84\xB0 W.\n\nTherefore, Robert Morris University in PA (near 80\xB0 W)\

      \ State University in Georgia is located east of Robert Morris University in\

      \ of these two universities.\n\nFirst, let me recall the locations:\n- Clayton\
      \ State University is in Georgia (GA)\n- Robert Morris University is in Pennsylvania\
      \ (PA)\n\nGeorgia is generally in the southeastern United States, while Pennsylvania\
      \ is in the northeastern United States. However, this general knowledge isn't\
      \ precise enough to determine their east-west relationship. I need to consider\
      \ their specific locations within their states.\n\nClayton State University\
      \ is in Morrow, Georgia, which is in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Atlanta\
      \ is in northern Georgia.\n\nRobert Morris University is located in Moon Township,\
      \ Pennsylvania, which is near Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania.\n\nTo determine\
      \ which is farther east, I need to compare their longitudes. The eastern United\
      \ States has negative longitude values, with more eastern locations having values\
      \ closer to 0 (less negative).\n\nPennsylvania is generally northeast of Georgia.\
      \ However, the important factor is not the north-south position but the east-west\
      \ position.\n\nWestern Pennsylvania (where Pittsburgh and Robert Morris University\
      \ are located) is indeed quite far west within the state. Eastern Georgia is\
      \ along the Atlantic coast, but Atlanta (near where Clayton State is) is more\
      \ central in Georgia.\n\nLooking at a mental map of the US:\n- Pittsburgh, PA\
      \ is in the western part of Pennsylvania, close to the Ohio border\n- Atlanta\
      \ area, GA is more centrally located in Georgia\n\nOn a US map, western Pennsylvania\
      \ is actually farther west than central Georgia. Pennsylvania extends quite\
      \ far to the west, and Pittsburgh is in that western portion. Georgia's western\
      \ border doesn't extend as far west as western Pennsylvania.\n\nSo, Clayton\
      \ State University in Georgia is likely EAST of Robert Morris University in\
      \ Pennsylvania.\n\nTo be absolutely certain, I would need the exact longitude\
      \ coordinates, but based on geographical knowledge of US states and cities,\
      \ Clayton State University in Georgia is east of Robert Morris University in\
      \ Pennsylvania.\n\nSo my answer is YES, Clayton State University, GA is located\
      \ east of Robert Morris University, PA.\n\nActually, let me double check this.\
      \ Let me verify the specific locations and approximate longitudes:\n\nRobert\
      \ Morris University is in Moon Township, PA, near Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh's approximate\
      \ longitude is around 80\xB0 W.\n\nClayton State University is in Morrow, GA,\
      \ near Atlanta. Atlanta's approximate longitude is around 84\xB0 W.\n\nWait,\
      \ if Atlanta is at 84\xB0 W and Pittsburgh is at 80\xB0 W, then Atlanta is actually\
      \ WEST of Pittsburgh (since 84\xB0 W is a larger negative number than 80\xB0\
      \ W, meaning it's farther west).\n\nSo if Clayton State is near Atlanta (84\xB0\
      \ W) and Robert Morris is near Pittsburgh (80\xB0 W), then Clayton State would\
      \ be WEST of Robert Morris, not east.\n\nLet me verify my understanding of the\
      \ longitudes:\n- Lower (less negative) longitude numbers in the western hemisphere\
      \ indicate more eastern locations\n- Higher (more negative) longitude numbers\
      \ indicate more western locations\n\nSo 80\xB0 W is east of 84\xB0 W.\n\nIf\
      \ my estimated longitudes are correct, then Clayton State University is actually\
      \ WEST of Robert Morris University.\n\nTo be absolutely certain, let me try\
      \ to recall the exact locations more precisely:\n\nClayton State University\
      \ is in Morrow, GA, which is just south of Atlanta.\nRobert Morris University\
      \ is in Moon Township, PA, which is northwest of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe longitude\
      \ of Atlanta, GA is approximately 84.39\xB0 W.\nThe longitude of Pittsburgh,\
      \ PA is approximately 80.00\xB0 W.\n\nSince 84.39\xB0 W is more westerly than\
      \ 80.00\xB0 W (84.39 > 80.00 in terms of distance west from the prime meridian),\
      \ and Clayton State is near Atlanta while Robert Morris is near Pittsburgh,\
      \ it appears that Clayton State University is WEST of Robert Morris University.\n\
      \nThis would mean the answer is NO, Clayton State University is NOT east of\
      \ Robert Morris University.\n\nLet me just double-check my geography knowledge...\n\
      \nGeorgia is in the southeastern US, and Pennsylvania is in the northeastern\
      \ US. While Georgia is south of Pennsylvania, the question is specifically about\
      \ east-west positioning. Western Pennsylvania extends quite far west, and Pittsburgh\
      \ is in that western portion. Atlanta is in northern Georgia but not at the\
      \ extreme eastern part of the state.\n\nGiven the approximate longitudes:\n\
      - Atlanta area (Clayton State): ~84\xB0 W\n- Pittsburgh area (Robert Morris):\
      \ ~80\xB0 W\n\nSince 84\xB0 W is further west than 80\xB0 W, Clayton State University\

      \ precisely:\n- CCA is in California, likely in one of the major cities (probably\
      \ San Francisco or Oakland area)\n- EWU is in eastern Washington state, which\
      \ would be closer to Idaho\n- Washington state is north of California, but we're\

      \ and EWU is specifically in the eastern part of Washington (closer to Idaho),\
      \ CCA would be west of EWU, not east.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO, California\
      \ College of the Arts is not located east of Eastern Washington University.\n\
      \nActually, let me double-check these locations to be more precise:\n\nCalifornia\
      \ College of the Arts has campuses in San Francisco and Oakland, both of which\

      San Francisco and Oakland are at approximately 122\xB0 W longitude.\nCheney,\
      \ Washington is at approximately 117\xB0 W longitude.\n\nSince lower numbers\
      \ of west longitude mean further east, and 117 is less than 122, Eastern Washington\
      \ University is actually east of California College of the Arts.\n\nSo my final\
      \ answer is NO, California College of the Arts is not located east of Eastern\

      University in Alabama (AL) is located east of Stevenson University in Maryland
      (MD). To answer this, I need to determine the geographic positions of both universities
      and compare their east-west positions.


      Let me recall the general geographic positions of Alabama and Maryland:

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States

      - Maryland (MD) is located on the East Coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - East Coast states (like Maryland) are obviously more eastern

      - Alabama is more inland/western compared to Maryland


      Let me think about this in terms of longitude (east-west position):

      - States on the East Coast like Maryland have more eastern (higher) longitudes

      - Alabama is west of Maryland


      Since Selma University is in Alabama and Stevenson University is in Maryland,
      and Alabama is west of Maryland, Selma University would be west of Stevenson
      University, not east.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Selma University in Alabama is NOT located east

      To solve this problem, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities by identifying where Alabama and Maryland are located
      in the United States.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Selma University is in Alabama (AL)

      - Stevenson University is in Maryland (MD)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative geographic positions

      - Maryland is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, but is west of Maryland


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      - States closer to the Atlantic Ocean are generally more eastern

      - Maryland borders the Atlantic Ocean

      - Alabama is several states west of Maryland


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      When comparing the longitudes (east-west coordinates), Maryland is clearly east
      of Alabama on a US map. Therefore, Selma University in Alabama must be west
      of Stevenson University in Maryland, not east of it.

      - Maryland (MD) is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States, but it''s further

      Now, let''s look more specifically at these universities:


      1. Selma University is in Selma, Alabama.

      Therefore, Selma University is NOT east of Stevenson University. Instead, Stevenson

      Let me double-check this:

      - Maryland is on the east coast of the US.

      - Alabama is more inland and to the west of Maryland.

      1. Selma University is located in Selma, Alabama (AL)

      2. Stevenson University is located in Stevenson, Maryland (MD)


      To determine which one is further east, I need to consider the geographic positioning
      of Alabama and Maryland within the United States.


      The United States is generally oriented such that states on the east coast are
      further east than states in the interior. Maryland is on the east coast of the
      United States, while Alabama is in the southeastern part of the country but
      not on the east coast.


      Looking at the relative positions:

      - Maryland is on the eastern seaboard of the US

      - Alabama is in the southeastern US, but west of Maryland


      So Maryland is east of Alabama. Since Selma University is in Alabama and Stevenson
      University is in Maryland, Selma University is west of Stevenson University,
      not east of it.


      Therefore, Selma University, AL is NOT located east of Stevenson University,
      MD.


      The answer is NO.</think>To determine if Selma University, AL is located east
      of Stevenson University, MD, I need to analyze their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      - Selma University is in Alabama (AL)

      - Stevenson University is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states.

      - Maryland is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States, but is positioned to the west
      of Maryland


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      Looking at a U.S. map, Maryland is significantly farther east than Alabama.
      Maryland borders the Atlantic Ocean, while Alabama is several states inland
      from the east coast.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Alabama is west of Maryland, Selma University (in Alabama) must be west
      of Stevenson University (in Maryland), not east of it.

      University in Alabama is located east of Stevenson University in Maryland.


      To determine this, I need to compare the relative east-west positions of these
      two universities by considering their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Selma University is in Alabama (AL)

      - Stevenson University is in Maryland (MD)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positions of these states.

      In the United States, Alabama is in the southeastern part of the country, while
      Maryland is on the eastern seaboard, in the mid-Atlantic region.


      Maryland is definitely east of Alabama. On a map of the United States, if you
      compare their positions, Maryland is located further east than Alabama.


      Step 3: Determine if the specific locations of these universities within their
      states would change this relationship.

      - Selma, Alabama is a city in central Alabama.

      - Stevenson University is located in the Baltimore metropolitan area in Maryland.


      Even accounting for specific locations within their states, the distance between
      Alabama and Maryland is significant enough that any city in Alabama would be
      west of any city in Maryland.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Selma University in Alabama is west of Stevenson University in Maryland,
      Selma University is NOT east of Stevenson University.

      in Alabama is located east of Stevenson University in Maryland, I need to determine
      the relative locations of these two universities and compare their east-west
      positioning.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - Selma University is in Alabama (AL)

      - Stevenson University is in Maryland (MD)


      I''ll think about the general geographic positioning of these states within
      the United States:


      Alabama is located in the southeastern United States. It borders the Gulf of
      Mexico to the south, Georgia to the east, Tennessee to the north, and Mississippi
      to the west.


      Maryland is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States, in the Mid-Atlantic
      region. It''s situated east of West Virginia, north of Virginia, south of Pennsylvania,
      and west of Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean.


      In terms of east-west positioning within the continental United States, Maryland
      is further east than Alabama. The entire state of Maryland lies to the east
      of Alabama.


      Now, let''s consider the specific locations of these universities:

      - Selma University is in Selma, Alabama

      - Stevenson University is in the Baltimore area of Maryland


      Since Maryland as a whole is east of Alabama, and these cities don''t change
      this fundamental relationship (they''re not at extreme edges of their states
      that would reverse the relationship), Stevenson University in Maryland is east
      of Selma University in Alabama.


      Therefore, Selma University is NOT located east of Stevenson University. Instead,
      Stevenson University is east of Selma University.


      Let me double-check this with a mental map of US geography: Moving from west
      to east across the United States, you would encounter Alabama before Maryland.
      This confirms my reasoning.


      So the answer is NO, Selma University in Alabama is not located east of Stevenson
      University in Maryland.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      First, I need to identify the locations of both universities:

      - Selma University is in Alabama (AL)

      - Stevenson University is in Maryland (MD)


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions:


      1. Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      2. Maryland is located on the eastern seaboard in the Mid-Atlantic region

      3. Looking at a map of the United States, Maryland is significantly further
      east than Alabama

      4. Since both universities are within their respective states, the east-west
      relationship follows that of their states


      Maryland is east of Alabama on the US map, which means Stevenson University
      is east of Selma University, not the other way around.

      \ if California State University, Monterey Bay, California is located east of\
      \ Coleman University, California.\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to:\n1. Identify\
      \ the location (coordinates) of California State University, Monterey Bay, CA\n\
      2. Identify the location (coordinates) of Coleman University, CA\n3. Compare\
      \ their longitudes - if CSU Monterey Bay has a smaller longitude number than\
      \ Coleman University, it's west of Coleman (remember that on a map, longitude\
      \ decreases as you go west); if CSU Monterey Bay has a larger longitude number,\
      \ it's east of Coleman\n\nLet's find these locations:\n\n1. California State\
      \ University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) is located in Seaside, California, near Monterey\
      \ Bay on the central coast of California. It's on the Pacific coast, fairly\
      \ far west in California.\n\n2. Coleman University was located in San Diego,\
      \ California, in the southern part of California, also near the Pacific coast.\n\
      \nNow, comparing their east-west positions:\n- Monterey Bay is on the central\
      \ California coast\n- San Diego is on the southern California coast\n\nLooking\
      \ at a map of California, Monterey Bay is northwest of San Diego. The California\
      \ coastline runs roughly northwest to southeast. Since Monterey Bay is further\
      \ north along this coastline, it would be west of San Diego.\n\nIn terms of\
      \ longitude, Monterey Bay would have a larger negative longitude (further west)\
      \ than San Diego.\n\nTherefore, California State University, Monterey Bay is\
      \ NOT east of Coleman University. It's west of Coleman University.\n\nThe answer\
      \ is NO.\n\nLet me double-check by looking at approximate longitudes:\n- CSU\
      \ Monterey Bay is around longitude -121.8\xB0 (west)\n- San Diego is around\
      \ longitude -117.2\xB0 (west)\n\nSince -121.8 is a larger negative number than\

      \ approximately at longitude -117.2\xB0 west\n\n## Step 3: Determine east-west\
      \ relationship\n- Moving east corresponds to increasing longitude values (less\
      \ negative numbers)\n- Since -121.8\xB0 is more negative than -117.2\xB0, Monterey\
      \ Bay is west of San Diego\n- Therefore, CSU Monterey Bay is west of Coleman\

      to determine the geographic locations of these two universities and then determine
      if Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in Iowa (IA) is
      located to the east of National Louis University in Illinois (IL).


      Let''s start by figuring out where these universities are located:


      1. Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is located in Iowa
      (IA). Specifically, Drake University is in Des Moines, Iowa, which is the capital
      city of Iowa.


      2. National Louis University is located in Illinois (IL). I believe it has multiple
      campuses, but the main campus is in Chicago, Illinois.


      Now that I know the cities, I need to determine their relative east-west positions.


      Iowa is a state that is west of Illinois. Des Moines, Iowa is located in central
      Iowa, while Chicago, Illinois is in northeastern Illinois along Lake Michigan.


      On a map of the United States, if we move from west to east, we''d go from Iowa
      to Illinois. So Des Moines (where Drake University is) is west of Chicago (where
      National Louis University is).


      Since Drake University is west of National Louis University, Drake University
      is NOT east of National Louis University.


      So the answer is NO, Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences,
      IA is not located east of National Louis University, IL. It is located west
      of it.</think># Determining if Drake University College of Pharmacy is east
      of National Louis University


      I need to find the locations of both universities and compare their east-west
      positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is in Iowa (IA),
      specifically in Des Moines

      - National Louis University is in Illinois (IL), with its main campus in Chicago


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographic positions

      - Illinois is located east of Iowa on the US map

      - Chicago, IL is in the northeastern part of Illinois

      - Des Moines, IA is in central Iowa


      ## Step 3: Make the east-west comparison

      - Since Iowa is west of Illinois, and Des Moines is west of Chicago, Drake University
      (in Iowa) must be west of National Louis University (in Illinois)

      - Therefore, Drake University is NOT east of National Louis University


      NO'

      The question asks about the relative location of two universities:

      1. Kentucky Christian University (KCU) in Kentucky (KY)

      2. Old Dominion University (ODU) - I think "POD" might be a typo, since ODU
      is the common abbreviation - in Virginia (VA)


      The question specifically asks if KCU is located east of ODU.


      To answer this, I need to determine the locations of both universities and compare
      their longitudes. In the US, being "east" means having a smaller longitude number
      (as longitudes in the US are negative, with the east coast having values closer
      to 0 than the west coast).


      First, let me recall the general geographic positions of Kentucky and Virginia:

      - Kentucky is a state in the eastern part of the US, but it''s more inland and
      west of Virginia

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the US


      Based on general geography, Virginia would typically be east of Kentucky. But
      I need to check the specific universities to be certain.


      Kentucky Christian University is located in Grayson, Kentucky, which is in the
      eastern part of Kentucky.


      Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia, which is on the eastern
      coast of Virginia, near the Atlantic Ocean.


      Even though KCU is in eastern Kentucky, Virginia''s eastern coast (where Norfolk
      is) is still further east than any part of Kentucky.


      Therefore, Old Dominion University should be east of Kentucky Christian University.


      To answer the original question: "Is Kentucky Christian University, KY located
      east of Old Dominion University, VA?"


      The answer should be NO. Kentucky Christian University is NOT east of Old Dominion
      University. Instead, Old Dominion University is east of Kentucky Christian University.</think>#
      Determining the East-West Relationship Between Universities


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of Kentucky Christian University
      (KY) and Old Dominion University (VA).


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Kentucky Christian University is in Grayson, Kentucky

      - Old Dominion University is in Norfolk, Virginia


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' general positions

      Kentucky is west of Virginia on a US map. Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean
      on the east, while Kentucky is more inland.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within states

      - Grayson, KY is in eastern Kentucky

      - Norfolk, VA is on the eastern coast of Virginia


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      Even though KCU is in eastern Kentucky, Norfolk''s coastal location puts it
      significantly further east than any point in Kentucky.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Kentucky Christian University is NOT located east of Old Dominion University.
      In fact, Old Dominion University is east of Kentucky Christian University.'

      First, let me recall where these states are:

      - Kentucky (KY) is generally west of Virginia (VA) in the United States

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the US

      - Kentucky is more inland


      Now, let''s be more specific about the university locations:


      1. Kentucky Christian University (KCU) is located in Grayson, Kentucky

      2. Old Dominion University (ODU) is located in Norfolk, Virginia


      To determine which is more eastern, I need to compare their longitudes. In the
      US, lower (more negative) longitude values indicate more western locations,
      while higher (less negative) longitude values indicate more eastern locations.


      Norfolk, Virginia is a coastal city on the east coast of Virginia. Virginia
      itself is east of Kentucky. So generally speaking, Old Dominion University should
      be east of Kentucky Christian University.


      To confirm this geographically:

      - Kentucky borders Virginia on Virginia''s western side

      - Norfolk, Virginia (where ODU is located) is on the eastern coast of Virginia

      - Grayson, Kentucky (where KCU is located) is in eastern Kentucky


      Given these geographical facts, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA would
      be east of Kentucky Christian University in Grayson, KY.


      Therefore, it would NOT be true that "Kentucky Christian University, KY is located
      east of Old Dominion University, VA". Instead, Kentucky Christian University
      is WEST of Old Dominion University.


      So the answer is NO, Kentucky Christian University is not located east of Old
      Dominion University.</think># Determining the East-West Relationship Between

      - Kentucky is more inland


      ## Step 3: Examine specific locations

      - Norfolk, Virginia is a coastal city on the eastern edge of Virginia

      - Grayson, Kentucky is in eastern Kentucky

      - Even though Grayson is in eastern Kentucky, it is still west of Norfolk, Virginia


      ## Step 4: Make the comparison

      Since Norfolk, Virginia (where ODU is located) is on the eastern coast of Virginia,
      and Virginia itself is east of Kentucky, Old Dominion University is east of
      Kentucky Christian University.

      relative locations of two universities in the US. Specifically, it''s asking
      if University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine in Pennsylvania (PA) is
      located east of Westfield State University in Massachusetts (MA).


      To answer this, I need to determine the east-west relationship between these
      two locations. In the US, being "east" generally means being closer to the Atlantic
      coast.


      Let me think about where these universities are located:


      1. University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
      (PA)

      2. Westfield State University is in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA)


      Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts. Massachusetts is one of the
      easternmost states in the US, located on the Atlantic coast in New England.
      Pennsylvania is more inland, located to the west of New Jersey and New York.


      Pittsburgh, specifically, is in western Pennsylvania, close to the Ohio border.
      Westfield, Massachusetts is in the western part of Massachusetts, but Massachusetts
      as a whole is still east of Pennsylvania.


      So if we''re comparing the east-west positions:

      - Pittsburgh, PA is in western Pennsylvania

      - Westfield, MA is in western Massachusetts

      - But western Massachusetts is still east of western Pennsylvania


      Therefore, University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is NOT east of
      Westfield State University. It''s west of it.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine,
      PA located east of Westfield State University, MA?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
      (PA)

      - Westfield State University is in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States, along the Atlantic
      coast

      - Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania, near the Ohio border

      - Westfield is in western Massachusetts


      Step 4: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Even though Westfield is in western Massachusetts, Massachusetts as a whole
      is east of Pennsylvania

      - Pittsburgh''s western location in Pennsylvania puts it even further west


      NO, University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is NOT located east of
      Westfield State University. It is located west of it.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
      (PA)

      - Westfield State University is in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positioning of these locations.

      In the United States, Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts. Massachusetts
      is on the East Coast, while Pennsylvania is more inland.


      To be more precise:

      - Pittsburgh is located in western Pennsylvania

      - Westfield is located in western Massachusetts


      Step 3: Compare their longitude positions (east-west positioning).

      Massachusetts is further east than Pennsylvania on the map of the United States.
      More specifically, western Massachusetts (where Westfield is) would still be
      east of western Pennsylvania (where Pittsburgh is).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, and Westfield is in Massachusetts
      while Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania, the University of Pittsburgh School of
      Dental Medicine (in Pittsburgh, PA) would be WEST of Westfield State University
      (in Westfield, MA).


      Therefore, University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is NOT east of
      Westfield State University. It is west of Westfield State University.</think>#
      Is University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, PA located east of Westfield

      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Locate both universities

      - University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
      (PA)

      - Westfield State University is in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA)


      ## Step 2: Consider geographic positions

      - Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts on the US map

      - Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania

      - Westfield is in western Massachusetts


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      Even though Westfield is in western Massachusetts and Pittsburgh is in western
      Pennsylvania, Massachusetts as a whole is east of Pennsylvania.


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Pittsburgh, PA is west of Westfield, MA, the University of Pittsburgh
      School of Dental Medicine is located WEST (not east) of Westfield State University.

      On a west-to-east basis:

      - South Dakota is farther west

      - Ohio is farther east


      Since Mitchell Technical College is in South Dakota, and Wittenberg University
      is in Ohio, and Ohio is east of South Dakota, Mitchell Technical College would
      be WEST of Wittenberg University, not east.


      So the answer is NO, Mitchell Technical College is not located east of Wittenberg
      University. It''s located west of it.</think># Is Mitchell Technical College,
      SD located east of Wittenberg University, OH?


      I need to determine the relative locations of these two colleges by examining
      which state is further east.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Mitchell Technical College is in South Dakota (SD)

      - Wittenberg University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - South Dakota is located in the upper Great Plains region of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Ohio is significantly east of South Dakota on the US map

      - South Dakota is much further west than Ohio


      Step 4: Conclude about the colleges'' relative positions.

      Since Mitchell Technical College is in South Dakota (western) and Wittenberg
      University is in Ohio (eastern), Mitchell Technical College must be west of
      Wittenberg University, not east.

      Mitchell Technical College is located in Mitchell, South Dakota, which is a
      state in the midwestern region of the United States.


      Wittenberg University is located in Springfield, Ohio, which is a state also
      in the midwestern region of the United States.


      To determine which is further east, I need to compare the longitudes of these
      locations. In the United States, lower (or more negative) longitude values indicate
      locations further west, while higher (or less negative) longitude values indicate
      locations further east.


      South Dakota is generally located west of Ohio in the United States. Ohio borders
      Pennsylvania to its east and Indiana to its west, while South Dakota is much
      further west, bordering Minnesota to its east and Wyoming to its west.


      Given the general geography of the United States, Mitchell Technical College
      in South Dakota would be west of Wittenberg University in Ohio.


      Therefore, to answer the question "Is Mitchell Technical College, SD located
      east of Wittenberg University, OH?", the answer is NO.


      Actually, let me double-check by thinking about the relative east-west positions
      of the states:


      Going from east to west in the United States, the relevant states would be approximately
      ordered as:

      - Ohio (where Wittenberg University is located)

      - Several states in between (like Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, etc.)

      - Fort Wayne, IN: ~85\xB0 West\n- New York (assuming NYC): ~74\xB0 West\n\n\
      Since a lower western longitude (less negative) means further east, and -74\xB0\

      \ New York state (near Buffalo), which is around longitude -79\xB0 (79\xB0 West),\

      \nActually, I should take a moment to verify whether \xC9cole libre des hautes\

      two universities. In the US, locations further east have higher longitude values
      (going from west to east, longitude increases from negative values to less negative
      values).


      Let me think about the general locations:


      1. University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is in San Antonio, Texas

      2. Benedictine University is in Illinois (likely in Lisle, IL, which is a suburb
      of Chicago)


      Now I need to consider their relative positions on a US map. Illinois is in
      the Midwest, while Texas is in the South/Southwest.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Illinois is north and east of Texas

      - Specifically, San Antonio is in south-central Texas

      - Illinois is much further east than Texas


      Illinois is generally positioned in the eastern half of the continental US,
      while Texas (especially San Antonio) is more in the central to western part
      of the southern US.


      Therefore, Benedictine University in Illinois would be east of the University
      of Texas at San Antonio.


      So the answer is NO, University of Texas at San Antonio is NOT east of Benedictine
      University. UTSA is west of Benedictine University.</think># Is University of
      Texas at San Antonio, TX located east of Benedictine University, IL?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify locations

      - University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is in San Antonio, Texas

      - Benedictine University is in Illinois (specifically Lisle, IL, which is near
      Chicago)


      Step 2: Consider their geographic positions

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Texas is in the South/Southwest region

      - On a US map, Illinois is positioned to the east of Texas


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - San Antonio, TX is in south-central Texas

      - Lisle, IL (near Chicago) is in the northeastern part of Illinois

      - Illinois is significantly east of Texas on the US map


      NO, University of Texas at San Antonio is not located east of Benedictine University.
      It is located west of Benedictine University.'

      determine the geographical locations of the two universities and see if Central
      State University in Ohio is located east of the College of Charleston in South
      Carolina.


      Step 1: Determine the approximate geographical location of Central State University
      in Ohio.

      Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States. Specifically, Central
      State University is located in Wilberforce, Ohio. Ohio is not on the east coast
      but is more in the eastern half of the country.


      Step 2: Determine the approximate geographical location of the College of Charleston
      in South Carolina.

      South Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States, along the
      Atlantic Ocean. The College of Charleston is in Charleston, South Carolina,
      which is a coastal city.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning of these locations.

      The eastern United States generally follows a pattern where states further east
      are closer to the Atlantic Ocean. South Carolina is directly on the Atlantic
      coast, while Ohio is further inland.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), states on the Atlantic coast
      like South Carolina are generally further east than Midwestern states like Ohio.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion.

      Since South Carolina is on the Atlantic coast and Ohio is further inland in
      the Midwest, the College of Charleston (in South Carolina) is east of Central
      State University (in Ohio).


      Therefore, Central State University is NOT east of the College of Charleston.

      University.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is Central State University, OH located east of College
      of Charleston, SC?


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Central State University is in Wilberforce, Ohio (OH)

      - College of Charleston is in Charleston, South Carolina (SC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - South Carolina is located on the Atlantic coast in the Southeast


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - States on the Atlantic coast (like South Carolina) are further east than Midwestern
      states (like Ohio)

      - Charleston, SC sits directly on the Atlantic Ocean

      - Ohio is significantly inland from the Atlantic coast


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on longitude.

      South Carolina is east of Ohio on the map of the United States, which means
      the College of Charleston is east of Central State University, not the other
      way around.


      NO, Central State University is not east of College of Charleston. It is west

      Ohio and South Carolina in the United States, and then more specifically the
      locations of these two institutions within their respective states.


      First, let''s think about the states:

      - Ohio (OH) is a Midwestern state

      - South Carolina (SC) is a Southeastern state on the Atlantic coast


      In terms of east-west positioning, South Carolina is generally east of Ohio.
      States along the Atlantic coast (like South Carolina) are in the eastern part
      of the United States, while Ohio is more inland, in the Midwest.


      Now, let''s think about the specific cities:

      - Central State University is in Wilberforce, Ohio

      - College of Charleston is in Charleston, South Carolina


      Charleston, SC is a coastal city on the Atlantic Ocean, which puts it quite
      far east in the United States. Wilberforce, Ohio is inland and would be west
      of any Atlantic coastal city.


      Given these geographical facts, Central State University in Ohio would be WEST
      of College of Charleston in South Carolina, not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Central State University, OH is not located east
      of College of Charleston, SC. It is located west of it.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      First, I need to determine the geographical locations of both institutions:


      1. Central State University is located in Wilberforce, Ohio (OH)

      2. College of Charleston is located in Charleston, South Carolina (SC)


      Next, I need to understand the relative positions of these states:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - South Carolina is on the Atlantic coast in the Southeast


      Looking at the U.S. map from west to east:

      - Ohio is located inland, roughly in the middle of the country

      - South Carolina is much further east, bordering the Atlantic Ocean


      Since Charleston is a coastal city on the Atlantic Ocean, it is positioned near
      the eastern edge of the continental United States. Wilberforce, Ohio is much
      more inland and westward.


      Therefore, Central State University (in Ohio) is located WEST of College of
      Charleston (in South Carolina), not east.

      To answer this, I''ll find the general geographic locations of both universities
      and compare them.


      First, let''s identify where each university is located:


      1. Saint Mary''s University of Minnesota - As the name suggests, this university
      is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the upper Midwest of the United States.


      2. Wingate University, NC - This university is in North Carolina (NC), which
      is on the East Coast of the United States.


      Now I need to determine which is further east. In the United States, states
      generally become more eastern as you move from left to right on a map. Minnesota
      is in the midwest, while North Carolina is on the east coast.


      The continental United States generally has states arranged in a way that those
      on the east coast (like North Carolina) are further east than central states
      (like Minnesota).


      Given that North Carolina is on the East Coast and Minnesota is in the Midwest,
      Wingate University in North Carolina would be located further east than Saint
      Mary''s University in Minnesota.


      To answer the question:

      "Is Saint Mary''s University of Minnesota, MN located east of Wingate University,
      NC?"


      No, Saint Mary''s University of Minnesota is NOT located east of Wingate University.

      MN located east of Wingate University, NC?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Locate the states

      - Saint Mary''s University is in Minnesota (MN), which is in the Upper Midwest
      region of the US

      - Wingate University is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the East Coast of
      the US


      ## Step 2: Compare their positions on the map

      - Minnesota is significantly further west in the country compared to North Carolina

      - North Carolina is part of the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Looking at US geography, states on the East Coast (like NC) are east of Midwestern
      states (like MN)

      \ geographic positions of these two universities. Let me think about the geographic\
      \ locations of Missouri and Florida in the United States.\n\nMissouri is a state\
      \ located in the Midwest/central United States. It's roughly in the middle of\
      \ the country.\n\nFlorida is a state located in the southeastern United States,\
      \ along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWhen considering east-west\
      \ positioning in the US, we're asking about longitude. Eastern locations have\
      \ higher longitude values than western locations.\n\nIn general, Florida is\
      \ located to the east and south of Missouri. So generally speaking, places in\
      \ Florida tend to be east of places in Missouri.\n\nHowever, I should be more\
      \ specific about these particular universities:\n\n1. Southwest Baptist University\
      \ is in Missouri, likely in the southwestern part of the state given its name.\n\
      2. Everglades University is in Florida, and given its name, it's likely near\
      \ the Everglades, which are in southern Florida.\n\nLet me think about this\
      \ more carefully:\n\nMissouri's eastern border is approximately at longitude\
      \ 89\xB0 W, while its western border is around 95.7\xB0 W.\nFlorida stretches\
      \ roughly from longitude 80\xB0 W to 87.6\xB0 W.\n\nThis means that the easternmost\
      \ part of Missouri (89\xB0 W) is still west of the westernmost part of Florida\
      \ (87.6\xB0 W).\n\nSo no matter where in Missouri Southwest Baptist University\
      \ is located, and no matter where in Florida Everglades University is located,\
      \ the Missouri university must be west of the Florida university.\n\nTherefore,\

      \ locations in Boca Raton, Miami, Orlando, Sarasota, and Tampa.\n\nAll of these\
      \ Florida locations are definitely east of Bolivar, Missouri.\n\nSo my answer\
      \ is confirmed: Southwest Baptist University in Missouri is NOT located east\
      \ of Everglades University in Florida. It's west of it.\n\nActually, let me\
      \ make sure my general understanding of US geography is correct. Missouri is\
      \ in the central US, while Florida is on the southeast coast. Florida is definitely\
      \ east of Missouri. So a university in Missouri would be west of a university\

      \nTo determine whether Southwest Baptist University (MO) is east of Everglades\
      \ University (FL), I need to compare their geographic positions on an east-west\
      \ axis.\n\n1) First, I'll identify the locations:\n   - Southwest Baptist University\
      \ is in Bolivar, Missouri\n   - Everglades University's main campus is in Boca\
      \ Raton, Florida\n\n2) Next, I'll consider the general geographic positions\
      \ of these states:\n   - Missouri is in the Midwest region of the United States\n\
      \   - Florida is in the southeastern United States, extending into the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean\n\n3) Looking at longitude (which measures east-west position):\n  \
      \ - Missouri is roughly between 89\xB0W and 96\xB0W longitude\n   - Florida\
      \ is roughly between 80\xB0W and 87.5\xB0W longitude\n   - Lower western longitude\
      \ numbers (like 80\xB0W) are farther east than higher numbers (like 96\xB0W)\n\
      \n4) Specifically:\n   - Bolivar, MO (where SBU is located) is around 93.4\xB0\
      W longitude\n   - Boca Raton, FL (where Everglades University is) is around\
      \ 80.1\xB0W longitude\n\nSince 80.1\xB0W is less than 93.4\xB0W, Boca Raton\
      \ is farther east than Bolivar. Therefore, Everglades University is east of\
      \ Southwest Baptist University, not the other way around.\n\n# Answer: NO"

      1. Eastern Michigan University in Michigan

      2. Lincoln University in Pennsylvania


      I need to determine which one is further east, or in other words, which has
      the easternmost longitude.


      Let me think about the locations:


      Eastern Michigan University is in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which is in the eastern
      part of Michigan. Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States.


      Lincoln University is in Lincoln University, Pennsylvania (the town has the
      same name as the university). Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the
      United States, generally east of Michigan.


      While Eastern Michigan University has "Eastern" in its name, that''s in relation
      to Michigan (it''s in the eastern part of Michigan). But Pennsylvania as a whole
      is east of Michigan.


      The continental United States generally has longitudes that decrease as you
      move east (becoming closer to 0 as you approach the prime meridian). So the
      question is whether Lincoln University, PA has a lower longitude value (more
      eastward) than Eastern Michigan University, MI.


      Let me think about this more precisely:

      - Eastern Michigan University is in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which is near Detroit
      in the southeastern part of Michigan

      - Michigan borders Ohio to its east/southeast

      - Pennsylvania is east of Ohio

      - Lincoln University, PA is in southeastern Pennsylvania


      Based on this chain of states (Michigan -> Ohio -> Pennsylvania), it''s clear
      that Pennsylvania is east of Michigan. Since Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania,
      and Eastern Michigan University is in Michigan, Lincoln University should be
      east of Eastern Michigan University.


      So the answer to "Is Eastern Michigan University, MI located east of Lincoln
      University, PA?" would be NO. Eastern Michigan University is west of Lincoln
      University, not east of it.


      Actually, let me be a bit more precise and consider the exact locations of these
      universities. While Pennsylvania is generally east of Michigan, these universities
      could be positioned such that Eastern Michigan University is actually east of
      Lincoln University if, for example, Eastern Michigan University were in the
      easternmost part of Michigan and Lincoln University were in the westernmost
      part of Pennsylvania.


      Lincoln University, PA is in southeastern Pennsylvania, near the border with
      Maryland and Delaware, which puts it quite far east.


      Eastern Michigan University is in Ypsilanti, which is in southeastern Michigan,
      near Detroit. While this is in the eastern part of Michigan, it''s still well
      west of Pennsylvania.


      So my reasoning holds: Lincoln University, PA is east of Eastern Michigan University,
      MI. Therefore, Eastern Michigan University is NOT east of Lincoln University.


      The answer is NO.</think># Determining the relative positions of Eastern Michigan
      University and Lincoln University

      - Eastern Michigan University is in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in the eastern part
      of Michigan

      - Lincoln University is in Lincoln University, Pennsylvania, in southeastern
      Pennsylvania


      ## Step 2: Compare the states

      Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Pennsylvania is
      in the Northeast region. Pennsylvania is positioned east of Michigan on the
      map.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations

      Even though Eastern Michigan University has "Eastern" in its name, this only
      indicates it''s in the eastern part of Michigan. The entire state of Michigan
      is west of Pennsylvania. Lincoln University''s location in southeastern Pennsylvania
      puts it significantly east of any point in Michigan.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Eastern Michigan University is NOT located east of Lincoln University,
      PA. In fact, it''s the opposite: Lincoln University, PA is located east of Eastern

      Eastern Michigan University is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which is in the

      Lincoln University in Pennsylvania is located in Chester County, Pennsylvania,

      Now, to determine which is further east, I need to consider the geographical

      Even though Eastern Michigan University has "Eastern" in its name, this refers
      to its location within Michigan, not its position relative to other states.
      The entire state of Michigan is west of Pennsylvania.


      Since Pennsylvania is east of Michigan, and Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania
      while Eastern Michigan University is in Michigan, it follows that Lincoln University

      Next, I need to consider the geographic positions of these states:

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is on the eastern side of the United States


      Even though it''s called "Eastern" Michigan University, this name refers to
      its location within Michigan, not its position relative to other states. Pennsylvania
      is significantly east of Michigan on the US map.


      Since Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania (an eastern state) and Eastern Michigan

      east of Eastern Michigan University, not the other way around.

      of University of West Alabama (in Alabama) and Shepherd University (in West
      Virginia) to determine which one is further east.


      First, let me recall the rough geographic positions of Alabama (AL) and West
      Virginia (WV) within the United States:


      - Alabama is located in the southeastern part of the US

      - West Virginia is located in the eastern part of the US, in the Appalachian
      region


      To be more precise, I need to consider the relative longitudinal positions of
      these states. In the US, eastern locations have lower longitude values than
      western locations (since we''re in the western hemisphere where longitudes are
      negative numbers, with values closer to 0 being more eastern).


      Alabama is generally west of West Virginia. Alabama is in the deep south, while
      West Virginia is further east and north, bordering states like Virginia, Maryland,
      Pennsylvania, and Ohio.


      Now, let''s be even more specific about these universities:


      1. University of West Alabama is located in Livingston, Alabama, which is in
      the western part of Alabama (as indicated by its name "West Alabama")


      2. Shepherd University is in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, which is in the eastern
      panhandle of West Virginia, very close to the Maryland border


      Given that:

      - West Virginia is already east of Alabama

      - Shepherd University is in the eastern part of West Virginia

      - University of West Alabama is in the western part of Alabama


      This strongly suggests that Shepherd University is east of the University of
      West Alabama.


      Therefore, the University of West Alabama is NOT located east of Shepherd University.
      It''s actually the opposite - Shepherd University is east of the University
      of West Alabama.


      I''m quite confident about this answer based on my geographic knowledge, but
      to be absolutely sure, I''d ideally want to look up the exact longitude coordinates
      of both universities. However, based on the relative positions of the states
      and the locations of these universities within their respective states, the
      answer is clear.


      The answer is NO, University of West Alabama is not located east of Shepherd
      University.</think># Is University of West Alabama, AL located east of Shepherd
      University, WV?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' locations

      - Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States

      - West Virginia (WV) is located in the eastern United States, in the Appalachian
      region

      - Generally, West Virginia is east of Alabama on a map of the US


      ## Step 2: Consider specific locations within their states

      - University of West Alabama is in Livingston, Alabama (in the western part
      of Alabama, as its name suggests)

      - Shepherd University is in Shepherdstown, West Virginia (in the eastern panhandle
      of WV)


      ## Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions

      - Shepherd University''s location in the eastern panhandle of WV puts it quite
      far east

      - University of West Alabama, being in western Alabama, is considerably further
      west


      ## Conclusion

      NO - University of West Alabama is not located east of Shepherd University.
      In fact, it''s the opposite: Shepherd University is east of University of West
      Alabama.'

      West Alabama, AL is located east of Shepherd University, WV, I need to identify
      the geographic locations of both universities.


      University of West Alabama is in Alabama (AL), and Shepherd University is in
      West Virginia (WV).


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these states:

      - Alabama is in the southeastern United States.

      - West Virginia is in the eastern United States, specifically in the Appalachian
      region.


      To be more precise, I need to consider their relative positions on an east-west
      axis.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Alabama is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida
      to the south, and Mississippi to the west.

      - West Virginia is bordered by Pennsylvania to the north, Maryland and Virginia
      to the east, Kentucky to the west, and Virginia and Kentucky to the south.


      In terms of longitudinal positioning:

      - Alabama is generally positioned further west than West Virginia.

      - West Virginia is quite far east in the United States, being part of the eastern
      seaboard.


      So generally speaking, Alabama as a state is west of West Virginia.


      Now, to be even more precise, I should consider the specific locations of these
      universities within their states:


      The University of West Alabama is in Livingston, Alabama, which is in the western
      part of Alabama (as the university name suggests).


      Shepherd University is in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, which is in the eastern
      part of West Virginia, near the border with Maryland.


      Given that Alabama as a whole is west of West Virginia, and considering that
      University of West Alabama is in the western part of Alabama while Shepherd
      University is in the eastern part of West Virginia, it''s very clear that University
      of West Alabama is west of Shepherd University, not east.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, the University of West Alabama is not located east
      of Shepherd University.</think># Determining the Relative Positions of University
      of West Alabama and Shepherd University


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities
      by examining their geographical locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states'' positions

      - University of West Alabama is in Alabama (AL)

      - Shepherd University is in West Virginia (WV)


      ## Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning of these states

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - West Virginia is located in the eastern United States, in the Appalachian
      region

      - On a west-to-east axis, Alabama is positioned further west than West Virginia


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states

      - University of West Alabama is in Livingston, in the western part of Alabama
      (as its name suggests)

      - Shepherd University is in Shepherdstown, in the eastern panhandle of West
      Virginia


      ## Step 4: Draw a conclusion

      Since Alabama is west of West Virginia, and considering that University of West
      Alabama is in the western part of its state while Shepherd University is in
      the eastern part of its state, the University of West Alabama must be west (not
      east) of Shepherd University.


      NO, the University of West Alabama is not located east of Shepherd University.'

      \ is in the southeast\n- The Atlantic coastline curves, with the North Carolina\
      \ coast extending further east than the New York coast\n\nHowever, both institutions\
      \ are inland:\n- SUNY Oneonta is in central New York\n- St. Andrews University\
      \ is in Laurinburg, which is in the southeast part of North Carolina, but not\
      \ directly on the coast\n\nGiven these locations, and considering that the Atlantic\
      \ coastline curves, it's plausible that St. Andrews could be east of SUNY Oneonta.\n\
      \nBut without exact longitude coordinates, I can't be completely certain. My\
      \ best estimate is that St. Andrews University in NC is east of SUNY Oneonta\
      \ in NY.\n\nActually, let me think about this one more time, focusing on the\
      \ actual longitudes.\n\nOneonta, NY is located in central New York state, roughly\
      \ around 75\xB0W longitude.\nLaurinburg, NC (where St. Andrews University is\
      \ located) is in southeastern North Carolina, roughly around 79\xB0W longitude.\n\
      \nLower longitude numbers indicate more eastern locations in the US. So if Oneonta\
      \ is around 75\xB0W and Laurinburg is around 79\xB0W, then Oneonta is east of\
      \ Laurinburg.\n\nTherefore, St. Andrews University, NC is NOT located east of\
      \ State University of New York at Oneonta, NY.\n\nActually, I realized I keep\
      \ flipping back and forth, which means I'm not confident in my mental map. Let\
      \ me reason through this by considering coastal proximity and the shape of the\
      \ Eastern seaboard.\n\nThe Eastern seaboard of the US curves from northeast\
      \ to southwest. Maine is the northeasternmost state, and Florida is the southeasternmost\
      \ state. Due to this curve, Maine's easternmost point is further east than Florida's\
      \ easternmost point.\n\nNew York is north of North Carolina, and as we move\
      \ south along the coast, the coastline generally moves westward. This means\
      \ that, all else being equal, a location in New York is likely to be east of\
      \ a location in North Carolina.\n\nHowever, proximity to the coast also matters.\
      \ Eastern North Carolina is closer to the Atlantic Ocean than central New York.\
      \ So a coastal location in North Carolina could be east of a central location\
      \ in New York.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific locations:\n- SUNY Oneonta\
      \ is in central New York, far from the coast\n- St. Andrews University is in\
      \ Laurinburg, NC, which is in the eastern part of North Carolina, but still\
      \ inland\n\nGiven that Oneonta is quite far inland in New York, and Laurinburg\
      \ is in the eastern part of North Carolina (though still inland), it's possible\
      \ that St. Andrews is east of SUNY Oneonta.\n\nBut I'm still not confident in\
      \ my mental map, and I keep going back and forth. Without exact longitude coordinates,\
      \ it's hard to give a definitive answer.\n\nActually, I'm overthinking this\
      \ and getting confused. Let's use a simpler approach and consider the general\
      \ east-west positioning of New York and North Carolina.\n\nNew York is generally\
      \ northeast of North Carolina. As you move south along the Eastern seaboard\
      \ from New York to North Carolina, you also move westward due to the curvature\
      \ of the coastline.\n\nGiven this general positioning, and the fact that both\
      \ institutions are inland from their respective coasts, it's more likely that\
      \ SUNY Oneonta (in New York) is east of St. Andrews University (in North Carolina).\n\
      \nSo, my final answer is: No, St. Andrews University, NC is NOT located east\
      \ of State University of New York at Oneonta, NY.\n\nHmm, I just realized that\
      \ I'm again not being systematic in my approach. Let me take a step back and\
      \ think about this more clearly.\n\nIn the continental United States, longitude\
      \ increases as you move west (from the Prime Meridian), and latitude increases\
      \ as you move north (from the Equator).\n\nSo, for one location to be east of\
      \ another, it must have a smaller longitude value.\n\nLet me try to recall the\
      \ approximate longitudes for these locations:\n\n- Oneonta, NY: I believe it's\
      \ around 75\xB0W longitude.\n- Laurinburg, NC (location of St. Andrews University):\
      \ I believe it's around 79\xB0W longitude.\n\nIf these estimates are accurate,\
      \ then since 75 < 79, Oneonta is east of Laurinburg.\n\nBut I'm still not confident\
      \ in my mental map.\n\nActually, I think my estimates for the longitudes are\
      \ reasonable based on the general geography of the eastern United States. New\
      \ York state spans roughly from 73\xB0W to 79\xB0W, with New York City on the\
      \ eastern edge. Oneonta, being in central New York, would be around 75-76\xB0\
      W.\n\nNorth Carolina spans roughly from 75\xB0W to 84\xB0W, with the eastern\
      \ part of the state on the Atlantic coast. Laurinburg, being in the southeastern\
      \ part of North Carolina, would be around 79-80\xB0W.\n\nGiven these longitude\
      \ estimates, SUNY Oneonta would be east of St. Andrews University.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ my answer is: No, St. Andrews University, NC is NOT located east of State\
      \ University of New York at Oneonta, NY.\n\nActually, I think I need to be even\
      \ more careful and systematic about this. \n\nLet's start with the facts: Both\
      \ St. Andrews University and SUNY Oneonta are in the eastern United States,\
      \ with St. Andrews in North Carolina and SUNY Oneonta in New York.\n\nNow, to\
      \ determine which is further east, I need to compare their longitudes. In the\
      \ Northern Hemisphere, places further east have smaller longitude values (longitude\
      \ increases as you move westward from the Prime Meridian).\n\nI don't have exact\
      \ longitude values for these institutions, so I need to make an educated guess\
      \ based on my knowledge of US geography.\n\nNew York is generally northeast\
      \ of North Carolina. Due to the curvature of the Earth and the shape of the\
      \ Eastern seaboard, as you move south from New York to North Carolina, you also\
      \ move slightly westward.\n\nBoth institutions are inland, not directly on the\
      \ coast. SUNY Oneonta is in central New York, while St. Andrews University is\
      \ in southeastern North Carolina.\n\nGiven the general northeast-to-southwest\
      \ trend of the Eastern seaboard, and the fact that both institutions are inland,\
      \ I would expect SUNY Oneonta to be east of St. Andrews University.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ my answer is: No, St. Andrews University, NC is NOT located east of State\
      \ University of New York at Oneonta, NY. It's located west of it.\n\nActually,\
      \ I think I've been making this harder than it needs to be. Let's compare the\
      \ rough longitudes:\n\n- Oneonta, NY is about 75\xB0W longitude.\n- Laurinburg,\
      \ NC is about 79\xB0W longitude.\n\nSince 75 < 79, Oneonta is east of Laurinburg.\
      \ Therefore, St. Andrews University (in Laurinburg) is NOT east of SUNY Oneonta.\n\
      \nMy final answer is: No, St. Andrews University, NC is NOT located east of\
      \ State University of New York at Oneonta, NY.\n\nActually, I'm still not confident\
      \ in my mental map. Let me try a different approach.\n\nInstead of relying on\
      \ my knowledge of exact longitude values, let me think about the overall geography\
      \ of the eastern United States.\n\nThe Eastern seaboard of the US follows a\
      \ roughly northeast-to-southwest direction. Maine is the northeasternmost state,\
      \ and Florida is the southeasternmost state. Due to this curve, a location in\
      \ New England (like Maine) can be further east than a location in the Southeast\
      \ (like Florida), even though Florida is much further south.\n\nNew York is\
      \ in the Northeast, and North Carolina is in the Southeast. Following the general\
      \ trend of the Eastern seaboard, a location in New York would generally be east\
      \ of a location in North Carolina, unless the North Carolina location is significantly\
      \ closer to the coast.\n\nNow, SUNY Oneonta is in central New York, far from\
      \ the coast, and St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the\
      \ eastern part of North Carolina but still inland.\n\nGiven the general northeast-to-southwest\
      \ trend of the Eastern seaboard, and the fact that both institutions are inland,\
      \ SUNY Oneonta is likely to be east of St. Andrews University.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ my answer is: No, St. Andrews University, NC is NOT located east of State\
      \ University of New York at Oneonta, NY.\n\nI think I'm getting confused because\
      \ I'm not accounting for the curved shape of the Eastern seaboard. Let's think\
      \ about it differently.\n\nIf I draw a purely vertical line (a line of constant\
      \ longitude) through Oneonta, NY, would Laurinburg, NC be to the east or west\
      \ of that line?\n\nGiven the general geography of the eastern United States,\
      \ and the fact that the coastline curves from northeast to southwest, a location\
      \ in North Carolina would generally be west of a purely vertical line drawn\
      \ through New York.\n\nThis suggests that Laurinburg, NC would be west of Oneonta,\
      \ NY.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, St. Andrews University, NC is NOT located\
      \ east of State University of New York at Oneonta, NY.\n\nLet me try once more,\
      \ focusing on the actual geography rather than general trends.\n\nOneonta, NY\
      \ is located in central New York state, roughly at 42.5\xB0N, 75.0\xB0W.\nLaurinburg,\
      \ NC (where St. Andrews University is located) is in southeastern North Carolina,\
      \ roughly at 34.8\xB0N, 79.5\xB0W.\n\nComparing the longitudes, 75.0\xB0W is\
      \ east of 79.5\xB0W (because a smaller value for west longitude means further\
      \ east).\n\nTherefore, Oneonta, NY is east of Laurinburg, NC, which means that\
      \ St. Andrews University, NC is NOT located east of State University of New\
      \ York at Oneonta, NY.\n\nActually, I should recognize that I'm not confident\
      \ in these exact latitude and longitude numbers. Let me make one last attempt\
      \ by considering the general geography without trying to recall specific coordinates.\n\
      \nThe Eastern seaboard of the US curves from northeast to southwest. As you\
      \ move south along the coast from Maine to Florida, you're also moving westward.\
      \ New York is in the Northeast, and North Carolina is in the Southeast. Due\
      \ to this curvature, a location in New York is generally east of a location\
      \ in North Carolina, unless the North Carolina location is significantly closer\
      \ to the coast.\n\nGiven that both SUNY Oneonta and St. Andrews University are\
      \ inland from their respective coasts, and considering the general curve of\
      \ the Eastern seaboard, it's most likely that SUNY Oneonta is east of St. Andrews\
      \ University.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, St. Andrews University, NC is\
      \ NOT located east of State University of New York at Oneonta, NY.\n\nTo double-check\
      \ this, let me look at the overall shape of the US eastern seaboard, which I\
      \ feel relatively confident in. I know that the eastern seaboard starts in Maine/the\
      \ Northeast and curves southwest, passing through states like New York, New\
      \ Jersey, Virginia, and the Carolinas, before heading west around Florida. This\
      \ means that as you travel south along the coast, you're also traveling west.\n\
      \nSignificantly, the southern part of the Delmarva Peninsula (in Maryland/Virginia)\
      \ is almost directly south of New York. Points in North Carolina, especially\
      \ those not right on the coast, are generally west of a north-south line passing\
      \ through New York.\n\nSUNY Oneonta, in central NY, is closer to Albany than\
      \ to NYC. But even the western edge of NY is still east of most of North Carolina.\n\
      \nSt. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, which is not on the coast but\
      \ in the eastern part of the state, about 100 miles inland.\n\nGiven the general\
      \ shape of the Eastern seaboard and the specific locations of these institutions,\
      \ SUNY Oneonta is very likely east of St. Andrews University.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ my answer remains: No, St. Andrews University, NC is NOT located east of State\
      \ University of New York at Oneonta, NY.</think># Is St. Andrews University,\

      \ of North Carolina\n\nThe key question is about east-west positioning, not\

      \ But specific locations within states could vary.\n\nLet me think about the\

      \ it's located in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southern part of North Carolina,\
      \ not far from the South Carolina border.\n\n2. SUNY Oneonta is in Oneonta,\
      \ NY, which is in central/upstate New York.\n\nNow I need to determine their\

      \ Eastern locations have lower (more negative) longitude values in the US. The\
      \ US eastern seaboard runs roughly from about:\n- 67\xB0 W (Maine) to \n- 82\xB0\
      \ W (southern Florida)\n\nI need to estimate where these specific locations\

      St. Andrews in Laurinburg, NC is probably around 79\xB0 W longitude.\n\nIf my\
      \ estimates are correct, then SUNY Oneonta would be further east (lower longitude\
      \ number) than St. Andrews.\n\nLet me double check by recalling more precisely\
      \ where these cities are:\n\nOneonta, NY is in the eastern part of upstate New\
      \ York, in the northern foothills of the Catskill Mountains. It's not extremely\
      \ far west in the state.\n\nLaurinburg, NC is in the south-central to southeastern\
      \ part of North Carolina, but not on the coast. It's significantly inland from\
      \ the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nGiven the northeast to southwest angle of the eastern\
      \ US coastline, Oneonta, NY is likely east of Laurinburg, NC.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ St. Andrews University, NC is probably NOT east of State University of New\
      \ York at Oneonta, NY. Instead, SUNY Oneonta is likely east of St. Andrews.\n\
      \nLet me double-check my reasoning. The eastern US coastline runs at an angle,\
      \ with Maine being the furthest east, and Florida being further west. New York\
      \ is north of North Carolina, so it's likely that a location in New York would\
      \ be further east than a non-coastal location in North Carolina.\n\nSo my answer\
      \ is NO, St. Andrews University in NC is not located east of SUNY Oneonta in\
      \ NY.\n\nActually, let me be even more careful here. \n\nThe exact longitude\
      \ of Oneonta, NY is approximately 75.06\xB0 W.\nThe exact longitude of Laurinburg,\
      \ NC (where St. Andrews University is) is approximately 79.46\xB0 W.\n\nSince\
      \ 75.06\xB0 W is a lower number than 79.46\xB0 W, Oneonta is further east than\
      \ Laurinburg.\n\nTherefore, St. Andrews University in NC is NOT east of SUNY\
      \ Oneonta in NY.\n\nActually, I'm not 100% confident in my specific longitude\
      \ estimates above. Let me reason again more carefully.\n\nWhen we look at a\
      \ map of the eastern United States:\n\n1. New York State is north of North Carolina.\n\
      2. The US eastern seaboard runs at an angle from northeast to southwest.\n3.\
      \ SUNY Oneonta is in central/eastern New York State, though not on the coast.\n\
      4. St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina, which is in the\

      \ SUNY Oneonta (in NY) is likely east of St. Andrews University (in NC).\n\n\
      So the answer is NO, St. Andrews University is not east of SUNY Oneonta.\n\n\
      Actually, I was conflating the location a bit. Let me correct myself. \n\nSt.\
      \ Andrews University is indeed in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southeastern\
      \ part of North Carolina, but not on the coast. It's probably approximately\
      \ 50-75 miles from the ocean.\n\nSUNY Oneonta is in central New York, fairly\
      \ far inland.\n\nHowever, because of the diagonal nature of the US East Coast,\
      \ locations in New York even far inland are often still further east than locations\
      \ in North Carolina.\n\nTo be more precise:\n- Laurinburg, NC (where St. Andrews\
      \ is): approximately 79.46\xB0 W longitude\n- Oneonta, NY (where SUNY Oneonta\
      \ is): approximately 75.06\xB0 W longitude\n\nSince 75.06 is less than 79.46,\
      \ Oneonta is further east than Laurinburg.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO, St.\
      \ Andrews University is not east of SUNY Oneonta.\n\nActually, I think I've\
      \ been consistent in my answer throughout my reasoning, though I've been slightly\
      \ uncertain about the specific longitude values. Let me summarize:\n\n1. St.\
      \ Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina.\n2. SUNY Oneonta is in\
      \ Oneonta, New York.\n3. Due to the angle of the US East Coast, locations in\

      \ approximate longitudes confirm this: Oneonta, NY is around 75\xB0 W while\
      \ Laurinburg, NC is around 79\xB0 W.\n5. Since a lower longitude number means\
      \ further east in the Western Hemisphere, SUNY Oneonta is east of St. Andrews\

      \ University in NC is located east of SUNY Oneonta in NY.\n\nTo answer this,\
      \ I need to know the approximate longitude of each university. On a map of the\
      \ United States, east-west positioning is determined by longitude, with eastern\
      \ locations having higher longitude values than western locations.\n\nLet me\
      \ think about the general geography of North Carolina and New York:\n\n- New\
      \ York is in the northeastern United States\n- North Carolina is in the southeastern\
      \ United States\n- Generally, North Carolina is south of New York\n- But the\
      \ question is asking about east-west positioning, not north-south\n\nThe eastern\
      \ coast of the United States runs roughly northeast to southwest. This means\
      \ that locations in North Carolina are typically going to be further west than\
      \ locations in northeastern states like New York.\n\nHowever, this depends on\
      \ the specific locations within each state. Let me try to recall where these\
      \ universities are located:\n\nSt. Andrews University in North Carolina: I believe\
      \ it's located in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southern part of North Carolina,\
      \ relatively close to the South Carolina border.\n\nSUNY Oneonta: Oneonta is\
      \ in central New York state, west of Albany but east of Syracuse.\n\nThe tricky\
      \ part here is that New York extends quite far west (all the way to Lake Erie),\
      \ while North Carolina is generally considered an \"East Coast\" state. But\
      \ Oneonta is not in the westernmost part of New York.\n\nLet me think about\
      \ the approximate longitudes:\n- Laurinburg, NC (where St. Andrews is located)\
      \ is probably around 79-80\xB0 W longitude\n- Oneonta, NY is probably around\
      \ 75-76\xB0 W longitude\n\nIf my estimates are correct, that would mean that\
      \ SUNY Oneonta is actually further east than St. Andrews University.\n\nLet\
      \ me double-check with what I know about US geography. The eastern seaboard\
      \ of the US curves from northeast to southwest. Maine is the easternmost state,\
      \ followed by the rest of New England, then New York, then the mid-Atlantic\
      \ states, and so on. So it's quite possible that a location in central New York\
      \ could be further east than a location in North Carolina.\n\nTo be more precise:\n\
      - Laurinburg, NC is approximately at 79.5\xB0 W longitude\n- Oneonta, NY is\
      \ approximately at 75.1\xB0 W longitude\n\nIf these estimates are accurate,\

      \ east of State University of New York at Oneonta, NY?\n\nNo, St. Andrews University\
      \ in North Carolina is not east of SUNY Oneonta. Instead, it's west of SUNY\
      \ Oneonta. This is because the eastern coastline of the United States curves,\
      \ and central New York is further east than central/eastern North Carolina despite\

      1. St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC).\n2. State University of\
      \ New York at Oneonta is in New York (NY).\n\nGenerally speaking, New York is\
      \ in the northeastern United States, while North Carolina is in the southeastern\
      \ United States. On the east coast, states are arranged roughly from north to\
      \ south, with Maine being the northernmost and Florida being the southernmost.\n\
      \nHowever, the east-west positioning can sometimes be counterintuitive due to\
      \ the shape of the coastline. The eastern seaboard curves, so I need to consider\
      \ the specific locations more carefully.\n\nLet me think about the longitudes\
      \ (which measure east-west position):\n- Eastern locations have smaller (more\
      \ negative) longitudes in the western hemisphere\n- Western locations have larger\
      \ (less negative) longitudes in the western hemisphere\n\nLet me try to recall\
      \ or estimate the approximate longitudes of these locations:\n\nSt. Andrews\
      \ University in NC is likely around the center or eastern part of North Carolina.\
      \ North Carolina's longitude roughly spans from about -84\xB0 in the west to\
      \ -75\xB0 in the east.\n\nSUNY Oneonta is in New York state, likely in the eastern\
      \ or central part of the state. New York's longitude roughly spans from about\
      \ -80\xB0 in the west to -72\xB0 in the east.\n\nJust based on the general positions\
      \ of these states, it's possible that St. Andrews could be further east, especially\
      \ if it's located in eastern North Carolina and if SUNY Oneonta is in a more\
      \ western part of New York.\n\nLet me try to recall more specific information:\n\
      \nSt. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southern part\
      \ of North Carolina, not far from the South Carolina border. I believe it's\
      \ in the eastern half of the state.\n\nSUNY Oneonta is located in Oneonta, NY,\
      \ which I believe is in the central or eastern part of upstate New York.\n\n\
      To be more precise, I would need the exact longitudes:\n\nLaurinburg, NC (location\
      \ of St. Andrews) is approximately at longitude -79.46\xB0\nOneonta, NY (location\
      \ of SUNY Oneonta) is approximately at longitude -75.06\xB0\n\nSince -79.46\xB0\
      \ is more negative than -75.06\xB0, that would mean Laurinburg (and thus St.\
      \ Andrews University) is further west than Oneonta (and thus SUNY Oneonta).\n\
      \nTherefore, St. Andrews University, NC is NOT located east of State University\
      \ of New York at Oneonta, NY. It's actually located west of it.\n\nLet me double-check\
      \ this by thinking about the geography of the US east coast. The coastline curves\
      \ such that New York's eastern portions tend to be further east than North Carolina's\
      \ eastern portions. This makes sense with the longitude values I recalled.\n\
      \nSo my answer is NO, St. Andrews University in NC is not located east of SUNY\
      \ Oneonta in NY.\n\nWait, I notice I may have made an error in my longitude\
      \ values. Let me think about this differently to be sure.\n\nThe east coast\
      \ of the US runs roughly northeast to southwest, meaning that locations further\
      \ north tend to also be further east. New York is north of North Carolina, and\
      \ thus points in New York are likely to be further east than points in North\
      \ Carolina, all else being equal.\n\nI know that Oneonta, NY is in the central/eastern\
      \ part of New York state, so it's not at the westernmost part of the state.\
      \ Laurinburg, NC is in the southern part of North Carolina, not particularly\
      \ close to the eastern coastline.\n\nBased on the general geography of the US\
      \ east coast, it's very likely that SUNY Oneonta is further east than St. Andrews\
      \ University.\n\nLet me look up more accurate information. The approximate coordinates\
      \ are:\n\n- St. Andrews University (Laurinburg, NC): latitude 34.7466\xB0 N,\
      \ longitude 79.4715\xB0 W\n- SUNY Oneonta (Oneonta, NY): latitude 42.4548\xB0\
      \ N, longitude 75.0637\xB0 W\n\nSo St. Andrews is at 79.4715\xB0 W and SUNY\
      \ Oneonta is at 75.0637\xB0 W. Since western longitude numbers get larger as\
      \ you go west (more negative if you drop the W designation), this means that\
      \ 79.4715\xB0 W is further west than 75.0637\xB0 W.\n\nTherefore, St. Andrews\
      \ University in NC is located WEST of SUNY Oneonta in NY, not east of it.\n\n\

      First, I''ll try to recall the locations of both universities:


      D''Youville University is in New York state. I believe it''s located in Buffalo,
      NY, which is in the western part of New York state.


      Stockton University is in New Jersey. I believe it''s located in Galloway, NJ,
      which is in the southern part of New Jersey, near Atlantic City.


      Now I need to compare their east-west positions. Let me think about the geography
      of the eastern United States:


      New York state is north of New Jersey. However, New York is a large state that
      extends far to the west. Buffalo, where D''Youville is located, is in the far
      western part of New York state, near the border with Canada and Pennsylvania.


      New Jersey is entirely east of Buffalo, NY. Even the westernmost part of New
      Jersey is east of Buffalo.


      So if D''Youville University is indeed in Buffalo, NY, and Stockton University

      Let me double-check whether my understanding of the locations is correct:


      D''Youville University is indeed in Buffalo, NY, which is in the far western
      part of New York state.

      Stockton University is in Galloway, NJ, which is in the southern part of New

      Given these locations, D''Youville University in Buffalo, NY is definitely WEST

    3915876a-54db-49a9-ab85-3f60d69f1188: '<think>Let me solve this step by step.


      The question is asking about the relative geographic locations of two universities:

      1. Cornerstone University in Michigan (MI)

      2. Clarkson University in New York (NY)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Cornerstone University is located east
      of Clarkson University.


      Step 1: Let me identify the approximate location of Cornerstone University in
      Michigan.

      Michigan is a state in the Midwest region of the United States. Cornerstone
      University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is on the western side
      of the state.


      Step 2: Let me identify the approximate location of Clarkson University in New
      York.

      New York is a state in the northeastern United States. Clarkson University is
      located in Potsdam, New York, which is in the northern part of the state near
      the Canadian border.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions of these locations.

      To determine which is further east, I need to consider their relative positions
      on the map of the United States.


      The United States generally follows the convention where locations further east
      have higher longitude values (in degrees east) or less negative longitude values
      (in degrees west).


      Michigan is in the Midwest, while New York is in the Northeast. Generally speaking,
      New York is east of Michigan.


      Looking at specific locations:

      - Grand Rapids, MI (where Cornerstone University is located) is in western Michigan

      - Potsdam, NY (where Clarkson University is located) is in northern New York


      Even the easternmost parts of Michigan would be west of most parts of New York
      state. Particularly, Potsdam is in the northern part of New York state, but
      still significantly east of any part of Michigan.


      Therefore, Cornerstone University in Michigan is west of Clarkson University
      in New York, not east of it.


      So the answer is NO, Cornerstone University, MI is not located east of Clarkson
      University, NY. It is located west of it.</think># Determining if Cornerstone
      University, MI is east of Clarkson University, NY


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Locate both universities

      - Cornerstone University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan

      - Clarkson University is in Potsdam, New York


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographic positions

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is in the Northeast region of the United States

      - Looking at a map of the US, New York state is clearly east of Michigan state


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations within their states

      - Grand Rapids is in western Michigan

      - Potsdam is in northern New York

      - Even the easternmost parts of Michigan are west of most of New York state


      Since Cornerstone University (in Michigan) is west of Clarkson University (in
      New York), not east of it, the answer is:


      NO'

      - Clarkson University is in Potsdam, New York (northern New York)


      ## Step 4: Compare longitudinal positions

      Even though Clarkson is in northern NY rather than eastern NY, New York state
      as a whole is significantly east of Michigan. The easternmost point of Michigan
      is still west of the westernmost point of New York.

      University in Illinois is located east of University of Maryland, Baltimore
      County (UMBC) in Maryland.


      First, let''s identify the general locations of these universities:


      1. Dominican University is in Illinois (IL), which is in the Midwest region
      of the United States.

      2. University of Maryland, Baltimore County is in Maryland (MD), which is on
      the East Coast of the United States.


      Generally speaking, states on the East Coast (like Maryland) are east of Midwestern
      states (like Illinois). So based on the states alone, Dominican University in
      Illinois would be WEST of UMBC in Maryland, not east.


      To be more precise, I should consider the exact locations:


      - Dominican University is located in River Forest, Illinois, which is in the
      Chicago metropolitan area

      - UMBC is located in Baltimore County, Maryland, which is near the Chesapeake
      Bay on the East Coast


      Looking at a mental map of the United States, Chicago is definitely west of
      Baltimore. Illinois is west of Maryland. The East Coast (where Maryland is)
      is east of the Midwest (where Illinois is).


      So Dominican University in Illinois is located WEST of UMBC in Maryland, not
      east.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think># Is Dominican University, IL located east
      of University of Maryland, Baltimore County, MD?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative locations of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Dominican University is located in River Forest, Illinois (IL)

      - University of Maryland, Baltimore County is located in Baltimore County, Maryland
      (MD)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Illinois and Maryland within the
      United States.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Maryland is on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positioning.

      - Maryland is significantly east of Illinois on the US map

      - The East Coast (where Maryland is located) is east of the Midwest (where Illinois
      is located)

      - Baltimore is east of Chicago (the major city near River Forest, IL)


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since Maryland is east of Illinois, University of Maryland, Baltimore County
      must be east of Dominican University, not the other way around.


      NO'

      First, let me identify the locations:


      1. Dominican University is in Illinois (IL). Specifically, I recall it''s in
      River Forest, which is near Chicago in the northeastern part of Illinois.


      2. University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is in Maryland (MD). As the
      name suggests, it''s in or near Baltimore, which is in the northern part of
      Maryland on the east coast.


      Now, to determine which is further east, I need to think about the relative
      positions of Illinois and Maryland in the United States:


      - Illinois is in the Midwest region, bordered by Wisconsin to the north, Iowa
      and Missouri to the west, Kentucky to the south, and Indiana to the east.

      - Maryland is on the East Coast, bordered by Pennsylvania to the north, Delaware
      and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Virginia and Washington D.C. to the south,
      and West Virginia to the west.


      The East Coast (where Maryland is located) is definitely east of the Midwest
      (where Illinois is located). So Maryland is east of Illinois.


      Since Dominican University is in Illinois and UMBC is in Maryland, Dominican
      University is west of UMBC, not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Dominican University in Illinois is NOT located
      east of University of Maryland, Baltimore County in Maryland.</think># Determining

      - Dominican University is located in River Forest, Illinois (IL), which is in
      the Chicago metropolitan area in the Midwest region.

      - University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is located near Baltimore,
      Maryland (MD), which is on the East Coast of the United States.


      ## Step 2: Compare geographical positions

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Maryland is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - The East Coast is east of the Midwest.


      ## Step 3: Make the determination

      Since Maryland is on the East Coast and Illinois is in the Midwest, UMBC is
      east of Dominican University, not the other way around.


      NO, Dominican University in Illinois is not located east of University of Maryland,

      First, I need to determine the locations of both universities:


      1. Urbana University in Ohio

      2. West Chester University of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania


      I need to find their geographical coordinates or at least understand their relative
      locations on a map.


      Urbana University is located in Urbana, Ohio. Ohio is generally west of Pennsylvania
      in the United States.


      West Chester University is located in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
      is east of Ohio.


      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, it''s very likely that Urbana University
      (in Ohio) is west of West Chester University (in Pennsylvania). However, I should
      be more precise since the question is asking specifically about these universities,
      not just the states they''re in.


      Urbana, Ohio is in west-central Ohio, while West Chester is in southeastern
      Pennsylvania (near Philadelphia). This further confirms that Urbana University
      would be west of West Chester University.


      If something is west of another thing, then that other thing is east of it.
      So if Urbana University is west of West Chester University, then West Chester
      University is east of Urbana University.


      But the question asks if Urbana University is east of West Chester University.
      Based on the geographic positions of these two institutions, Urbana University
      is NOT east of West Chester University; it''s west of it.

      To determine this, I need to understand the relative east-west positioning of
      these two locations. In the United States, geographic locations are generally
      considered "east" of one another based on their longitude coordinates, with
      more eastern locations having higher longitude values.


      Let me think about the general geographic positioning of Oregon and Arizona:


      Oregon is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      Arizona is an inland state in the southwestern United States.


      Specifically:

      - Portland, Oregon is located in the northwestern United States

      - Arizona (where University of Advancing Technology is located) is in the southwestern
      United States


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude):

      - Portland, OR is further west than Arizona

      - This means that Concordia University Portland would be west of University
      of Advancing Technology, not east


      Since Oregon is on the west coast and Arizona is inland and to the east of Oregon,
      Concordia University Portland would be located WEST of University of Advancing
      Technology in Arizona, not east.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Concordia University Portland, OR is not located
      east of University of Advancing Technology, AZ.</think># Is Concordia University
      Portland, OR located east of University of Advancing Technology, AZ?


      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the geographic locations of Oregon (OR) and Arizona
      (AZ) within the United States.


      2) Oregon is located on the west coast of the United States, in the Pacific
      Northwest region.


      3) Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, inland from the Pacific
      coast.


      4) When comparing east-west positions in the US, we look at longitude. Eastern
      locations have higher longitude values than western locations.


      5) Portland, Oregon is significantly further west than locations in Arizona.


      6) Therefore, Concordia University Portland (in Oregon) would be located to
      the west of University of Advancing Technology (in Arizona), not to the east.


      NO, Concordia University Portland is not located east of University of Advancing
      Technology.'
    578583ab-bcda-4649-94a3-7df603960c9f: "<think>Let's break down this question:\n\
      \n1. We have Concordia University Portland, located in Portland, Oregon (OR).\n\
      2. We have University of Advancing Technology, located in Arizona (AZ).\n3.\
      \ We need to determine if Concordia University Portland (in OR) is located east\
      \ of University of Advancing Technology (in AZ).\n\nTo answer this, I need to\
      \ think about the geographical positions of these states. \n\nThe United States,\
      \ when looking at a map, has Oregon (OR) on the west coast, directly north of\
      \ California. Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern part of the US, east of California\
      \ but west of most of the country.\n\nSpecifically, when comparing the longitudes\
      \ of Oregon and Arizona:\n- Oregon is at approximately 120\xB0W to 124\xB0W\
      \ longitude.\n- Arizona is at approximately 109\xB0W to 114\xB0W longitude.\n\
      \nLower longitude numbers (less negative or moving towards positive) indicate\
      \ locations further east. Since Arizona has a lower longitude number (109\xB0\
      W to 114\xB0W) compared to Oregon (120\xB0W to 124\xB0W), Arizona is actually\
      \ east of Oregon.\n\nGiven the question is about universities, we should be\
      \ more precise and look at the cities:\n- Concordia University Portland is in\
      \ Portland, OR, which is on the western edge of Oregon.\n- I'm not sure which\
      \ city in Arizona houses the University of Advancing Technology. Let me assume\
      \ it's in Phoenix, which is a central location in Arizona.\n\nPortland, OR is\
      \ approximately at 122.7\xB0W longitude.\nPhoenix, AZ is approximately at 112.0\xB0\
      W longitude.\n\nTherefore, Phoenix (and by extension, potentially the University\
      \ of Advancing Technology) is about 10.7 degrees east of Portland (and Concordia\
      \ University Portland).\n\nIf the University of Advancing Technology is indeed\
      \ in Phoenix or anywhere in Arizona, then Concordia University Portland (in\
      \ Portland, OR) is NOT east of it. In fact, it's west of it.\n\nLet me double-check\
      \ the location of the University of Advancing Technology in Arizona.\n\nThe\
      \ University of Advancing Technology is located in Tempe, Arizona. Tempe is\
      \ a suburb of Phoenix, and is at approximately 111.9\xB0W longitude. This is\
      \ indeed east of Portland, OR, and therefore east of Concordia University Portland.\n\
      \nTo answer the specific question: Is Concordia University Portland, OR located\
      \ east of University of Advancing Technology, AZ?\n\nNo, Concordia University\
      \ Portland, OR is not located east of the University of Advancing Technology,\
      \ AZ. It's located west of it. Oregon is on the west coast, and Arizona is more\
      \ inland towards the center of the United States. Specifically, Portland, OR\
      \ is at approximately 122.7\xB0W, while Tempe, AZ is at approximately 111.9\xB0\
      W. Since a lower longitude number indicates a more eastern location, the University\
      \ of Advancing Technology is east of Concordia University Portland.\n\nActually,\
      \ I should clarify that longitude increases as you go further east, if you are\
      \ keeping the values positive. But in the Western Hemisphere, longitudes are\
      \ typically negative, and they increase in the westward direction. So -111.9\xB0\
      W (Tempe, AZ) is further east than -122.7\xB0W (Portland, OR). \n\nTo be even\
      \ clearer, let's drop the negatives and use the traditional notation: Tempe,\
      \ AZ is at 111.9\xB0W, and Portland, OR is at 122.7\xB0W. A lower value in terms\
      \ of W (west) means a location is further east, so Tempe is indeed east of Portland.\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nNo, Concordia University Portland, OR is NOT\
      \ located east of University of Advancing Technology, AZ. It's located west\
      \ of it.\n\nActually, let me double-check again by thinking about it in terms\
      \ of standard time zones. The continental US is divided, from east to west,\
      \ into the following time zones:\n1. Eastern Time Zone\n2. Central Time Zone\n\
      3. Mountain Time Zone\n4. Pacific Time Zone\n\nOregon is in the Pacific Time\
      \ Zone (the westernmost zone in the continental US), while Arizona is in the\
      \ Mountain Time Zone (the second westernmost). This confirms that Oregon is\
      \ west of Arizona, not east.\n\nSo, the answer remains the same.\n\nNo, Concordia\
      \ University Portland, OR is NOT located east of University of Advancing Technology,\
      \ AZ. It's located west of it.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine\
      \ if Concordia University Portland, OR is located east of University of Advancing\
      \ Technology, AZ, I need to compare the geographic locations of these two institutions.\n\
      \n1. First, let's identify the states: \n   - Concordia University Portland\
      \ is in Oregon (OR)\n   - University of Advancing Technology is in Arizona (AZ)\n\
      \n2. Let's consider the geographic positions of these states:\n   - Oregon is\

      \ Technology in Tempe, Arizona is at approximately 111.9\xB0W longitude\n\n\
      4. In the western hemisphere, a lower western longitude number indicates a more\
      \ eastern location.\n   - 111.9\xB0W (Arizona) is a smaller number than 122.7\xB0\
      W (Oregon)\n   - Therefore, Arizona is east of Oregon\n\n5. We can also verify\

      \ University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha, WI is located east of Georgia Southern\
      \ University, GA.\n\nFirst, let me think about the general locations of these\
      \ states:\n- Wisconsin (WI) is in the upper Midwest region of the United States.\n\
      - Georgia (GA) is in the southeastern United States.\n\nLooking at a mental\
      \ map of the US, Wisconsin is generally more western than Georgia. Wisconsin\
      \ borders Lake Michigan on its eastern side, while Georgia lies along the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean on its eastern side.\n\nNow, let's be more specific about these universities:\n\
      \n1. University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha is in Waukesha, Wisconsin, which\
      \ is near Milwaukee in the eastern part of Wisconsin.\n2. Georgia Southern University\
      \ is in Statesboro, Georgia, which is in the eastern part of Georgia.\n\nEven\
      \ though Waukesha is in the eastern part of Wisconsin, and Statesboro is in\
      \ the eastern part of Georgia, the entire state of Georgia is still generally\
      \ east of Wisconsin.\n\nTo be more precise, I can think about the approximate\
      \ longitudes:\n- Wisconsin's eastern border is roughly at longitude 87\xB0 W\
      \ (along Lake Michigan)\n- Georgia's western border is roughly at longitude\
      \ 85\xB0 W\n\nSo even the easternmost parts of Wisconsin are still west of the\
      \ westernmost parts of Georgia.\n\nTherefore, University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Waukesha, WI is NOT located east of Georgia Southern University, GA. It's located\
      \ WEST of Georgia Southern University.\n\nActually, let me double-check this.\
      \ I was a bit imprecise with my longitudes. Let me be more careful:\n\nWaukesha,\
      \ WI is near Milwaukee, so it would be in eastern Wisconsin, roughly around\
      \ longitude 88\xB0 W.\nStatesboro, GA (where Georgia Southern University is\
      \ located) is in eastern Georgia, probably around longitude 81-82\xB0 W.\n\n\
      Comparing these longitudes: 88\xB0 W is further west than 81-82\xB0 W. (Remember\
      \ that western longitudes in the US are negative numbers, so -88 is further\
      \ west than -82).\n\nSo University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha is indeed WEST\
      \ of Georgia Southern University, not east of it.\n\nActually I'd like to be\
      \ even more precise here. Let me look up the exact longitude coordinates of\
      \ these locations:\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha: approximately 88.2\xB0\
      \ W\nGeorgia Southern University in Statesboro, GA: approximately 81.8\xB0 W\n\
      \nSo University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha at 88.2\xB0 W is clearly west of\
      \ Georgia Southern University at 81.8\xB0 W.\n\nTherefore, University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Waukesha, WI is NOT located east of Georgia Southern University, GA.\n\nSo the\

      \ 87\xB0 W and 93\xB0 W longitude\n   - Georgia is approximately between 81\xB0\
      \ W and 85\xB0 W longitude\n\nSince lower western longitude numbers represent\
      \ more eastern positions in the US, Georgia is generally east of Wisconsin.\n\
      \n6. To be even more specific for the cities:\n   - Waukesha, WI is around 88\xB0\
      \ W longitude\n   - Georgia Southern University is in Statesboro, GA, which\
      \ is around 81.8\xB0 W longitude\n\nSince 81.8\xB0 W (Georgia Southern) is a\
      \ lower number than 88\xB0 W (UW-Waukesha), Georgia Southern University is east\
      \ of University of Wisconsin-Waukesha.\n\nSo University of Wisconsin-Waukesha\

      \n## Step 4: Make the comparison\nSince we measure longitude from 0\xB0 (Greenwich,\

      Mississippi River. Georgia is also in the southern part of the US, but on the
      Atlantic coast. Generally speaking, Georgia is east of Mississippi.


      Now, let''s try to be more precise about the specific locations of these institutions
      within their respective states.


      Brenau University is located in Gainesville, Georgia, which is in the northeastern
      part of Georgia.


      I''m not as certain about the exact location of Mount Hermon Female Seminary
      in Mississippi, but given that Mississippi as a state is west of Georgia, it''s
      very likely that any location in Mississippi would be west of Gainesville, Georgia.


      To determine if something is east or west, we compare their longitudes. Eastern
      locations have more easterly (smaller negative or larger positive) longitudes
      than western locations in the northern hemisphere.


      Given the geography of the United States, with Mississippi being west of Georgia,
      Mount Hermon Female Seminary in MS would be west of Brenau University in GA,
      not east.


      So, is Mount Hermon Female Seminary, MS located east of Brenau University, GA?
      The answer would be no, it''s west of Brenau University.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:


      Mississippi is west of Georgia.

      Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in Mississippi.

      Brenau University is in Georgia.

      Therefore, Mount Hermon Female Seminary is west of Brenau University, not east.


      So the answer is NO.</think># Reasoning About Geographical Locations


      To determine if Mount Hermon Female Seminary in Mississippi is east of Brenau
      University in Georgia, I need to analyze the geographical positions of these
      states and institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in Mississippi (MS)

      - Brenau University is in Georgia (GA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship of these states

      Mississippi and Georgia are both southern states, but they have a clear east-west
      relationship. Georgia is on the Atlantic coast, while Mississippi is further
      west, bordering the Mississippi River.


      ## Step 3: Determine the relative positions

      Georgia is definitely east of Mississippi on the map of the United States. This
      means that institutions in Mississippi would generally be west of institutions
      in Georgia.


      ## Step 4: Draw a conclusion

      Since Mount Hermon Female Seminary is in Mississippi (a western state relative
      to Georgia), and Brenau University is in Georgia (an eastern state relative
      to Mississippi), Mount Hermon Female Seminary cannot be east of Brenau University.


      NO'

      \ College District is actually east of CSU East Bay.\n\nLet me double-check\
      \ this reasoning:\n\nCalifornia runs northwest to southeast along the Pacific\

      \nStep 1: Identify where California State University, East Bay is located.\n\
      CSU East Bay is located in Hayward, California, in the eastern part of the San\
      \ Francisco Bay Area. That's why it's called \"East Bay\" - it's on the eastern\

      \ at a map of California, the San Francisco Bay Area is actually WEST of the\
      \ longitude lines that pass through Orange County. \n\nThis is because California's\
      \ coastline runs northwest to southeast. Even though Hayward is called \"East\
      \ Bay,\" that's only in relation to the San Francisco Bay itself. In the broader\
      \ geography of California, the entire San Francisco Bay Area, including its\
      \ eastern parts, is generally west of Southern California locations like Orange\
      \ County.\n\nSo, California State University, East Bay in Hayward is actually\
      \ WEST of Rancho Santiago Community College District in Orange County.\n\nLet\
      \ me verify this by checking the approximate longitudes:\n- Hayward, CA is at\
      \ approximately longitude 122\xB0 W\n- Orange/Santa Ana, CA is at approximately\
      \ longitude 117-118\xB0 W\n\nSince lower numbers of west longitude mean further\

      \ 117.8677\xB0 W\n\nSince 117.8677 is a smaller number than 122.0567 (when both\
      \ are west longitudes), RSCCD is further east than CSU East Bay.\n\nTherefore,\

      1. I need to determine if Lincoln College, IL (in Illinois) is located east
      of Thomas Jefferson University, PA (in Pennsylvania).


      2. To answer this, I need to know the relative locations of Illinois and Pennsylvania
      in the United States.


      The United States is organized geographically such that the eastern states are
      on the right side of the map, and western states are on the left side of the
      map. So I need to determine whether Illinois is east (to the right) of Pennsylvania.


      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States. Pennsylvania is on the
      eastern part of the United States, specifically in the Mid-Atlantic region.


      In terms of east-west orientation, Pennsylvania is definitely to the east of
      Illinois. If you look at a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is closer
      to the Atlantic Ocean (the east coast), while Illinois is more inland toward
      the center of the country.


      So if Lincoln College is in Illinois, and Thomas Jefferson University is in
      Pennsylvania, then Lincoln College is NOT east of Thomas Jefferson University.
      Instead, Lincoln College would be west of Thomas Jefferson University.


      To be sure, let me double-check that I have the states correct:

      - Lincoln College is in Illinois (IL)

      - Thomas Jefferson University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Yes, that''s correct.


      So, the answer is NO, Lincoln College, IL is NOT located east of Thomas Jefferson
      University, PA. Rather, it''s located to the west.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the geographical positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these institutions are located.

      - Lincoln College is in Illinois (IL)

      - Thomas Jefferson University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Mid-Atlantic region, closer to the East Coast


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - When looking at a US map, Pennsylvania is clearly east of Illinois

      - This means institutions in Illinois would be west of institutions in Pennsylvania


      Since Lincoln College is in a state (Illinois) that is west of the state where
      Thomas Jefferson University is located (Pennsylvania), Lincoln College is not
      east of Thomas Jefferson University, but rather west of it.

      the relative geographical positions of two educational institutions:


      1. Lincoln College in Illinois (IL)

      2. Thomas Jefferson University in Pennsylvania (PA)


      The question is specifically asking whether Lincoln College in Illinois is located
      east of Thomas Jefferson University in Pennsylvania.


      Let''s think about the general geographic locations of Illinois and Pennsylvania
      within the United States:


      - Illinois is a state in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is a state in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region of the United
      States


      In terms of east-west positioning in the United States:

      - States on the East Coast are the easternmost

      - As you move westward, you encounter the Mid-Atlantic states, then the Midwest,
      then the Great Plains, Mountain West, and finally the West Coast


      Pennsylvania is significantly farther east than Illinois. Pennsylvania borders
      the Atlantic Ocean (via Delaware Bay), while Illinois is in the Midwest and
      borders Lake Michigan.


      Therefore, in general, locations in Pennsylvania would be east of locations
      in Illinois, not the other way around.


      So, Lincoln College in Illinois would be west of Thomas Jefferson University
      in Pennsylvania, not east of it.

      - Pennsylvania is significantly farther east in the United States than Illinois

      - On a map of the US, Pennsylvania is closer to the Atlantic coast, while Illinois
      is inland toward the center of the country


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, Thomas Jefferson University (in PA)
      must be east of Lincoln College (in IL). This means Lincoln College is west
      of Thomas Jefferson University, not east.

      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Pennsylvania is
      in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region.


      Step 3: Consider the east-west positioning of these states.

      When looking at a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is located east of
      Illinois. Illinois is more toward the middle of the country, while Pennsylvania
      is closer to the Atlantic coast.


      Step 4: Since the colleges are in these respective states, I can determine their
      relative east-west positioning.

      Since Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, Thomas Jefferson University (in PA)
      would be east of Lincoln College (in IL).

      To do this, I need to figure out where each school is located, and then compare
      their relative positions on an east-west axis.


      Let me think about the geographic layout of Virginia (VA) and Pennsylvania (PA):


      Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States, bordering New York to the
      north, New Jersey to the east, Delaware and Maryland to the southeast, West
      Virginia to the southwest, and Ohio to the west.


      Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, bordering Maryland and Washington D.C. to
      the north and northeast, North Carolina and Tennessee to the south, Kentucky
      to the west, and West Virginia to the northwest.


      In general, Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, but their east-west relationship
      depends on the specific locations within each state.


      Now, let''s try to determine the specific locations of these universities:


      1. Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia. Radford is in the western
      part of Virginia, in the New River Valley.


      2. Marywood University is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Scranton is in
      the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Now I need to determine whether Radford, VA is east or west of Scranton, PA.


      Given that Radford is in western Virginia and Scranton is in northeastern Pennsylvania,
      and considering that Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia, I need to
      compare their longitudes.


      Western Virginia would typically be west of northeastern Pennsylvania. This
      is because the states are roughly aligned in terms of longitude, with their
      eastern and western borders approximately matching up. Since Radford is in western
      Virginia and Scranton is in northeastern Pennsylvania, Radford is likely to
      be west of Scranton.


      To be more precise, I would need to know the exact longitudes of these cities.
      But based on general geographical knowledge, Radford University in VA is likely
      located west of Marywood University in PA, not east.


      So, the answer to the question "Is Radford University, VA located east of Marywood
      University, PA?" is NO.</think># Determining if Radford University is east of
      Marywood University


      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities
      by examining their locations.


      ## Step 1: Locate Radford University

      Radford University is in Radford, Virginia, which is located in the western
      part of Virginia in the New River Valley region.


      ## Step 2: Locate Marywood University

      Marywood University is in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which is located in the northeastern
      part of Pennsylvania.


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      Looking at the geography of the eastern United States:

      - Western Virginia is generally west of northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Virginia extends westward toward the Appalachian Mountains

      - Scranton, PA is in the eastern half of Pennsylvania

      - Radford, VA is in the western portion of Virginia


      When comparing their relative positions on a map, Radford University is positioned
      to the west of Marywood University, not to the east.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'

      \nI need to determine if National American University in SD is located east\

      \ the relative positions of South Dakota and Arkansas in the United States.\
      \ Let me think about the US geography:\n\n- South Dakota (SD) is located in\

      \n1) First, let me identify the general locations of these states:\n   - South\

      \ University (NAU) in South Dakota is east of the University of Central Arkansas\
      \ (UCA) in Arkansas, I need to determine the longitudinal positions of both\
      \ institutions. East-west positioning is determined by longitude. Lower (more\
      \ negative) longitude values are further west, while higher (less negative or\
      \ positive) values are further east in the United States.\n\nLet me work out\
      \ the approximate locations:\n\n1. National American University (NAU) in South\
      \ Dakota - I believe there are/were multiple campuses, but its main campus was\
      \ in Rapid City, SD, which is in western South Dakota. South Dakota is in the\
      \ northern central United States.\n\n2. University of Central Arkansas (UCA)\
      \ - This is located in Conway, Arkansas. Arkansas is in the south-central United\
      \ States.\n\nGeographically speaking, South Dakota is north of Arkansas, but\
      \ that doesn't tell us about the east-west positioning. To determine which is\
      \ further east, I need to compare their longitude coordinates.\n\nRapid City,\
      \ SD is in western South Dakota, roughly around longitude -103\xB0 (103 degrees\
      \ west).\n\nConway, AR is in central Arkansas, roughly around longitude -92\xB0\
      \ (92 degrees west).\n\nSince -92 is a higher value than -103, Conway (UCA)\
      \ is further east than Rapid City (NAU).\n\nTherefore, National American University\
      \ in South Dakota is NOT east of University of Central Arkansas in Arkansas.\
      \ Instead, NAU is west of UCA.\n\nHmm, wait - I realize I'm giving approximate\
      \ coordinates based on my knowledge, and I want to be sure. Let me reason through\
      \ this differently.\n\nThe United States, when viewed on a map, has South Dakota\
      \ positioned in the north-central part of the country, while Arkansas is positioned\
      \ in the south-central part. However, Arkansas is generally further east than\
      \ South Dakota.\n\nIf we drew a vertical line (representing a particular longitude)\
      \ through the center of Arkansas, most or all of South Dakota would likely be\
      \ to the west of that line. This is especially true for Rapid City, which is\
      \ in western South Dakota.\n\nGiven the general geography of the United States,\
      \ it's highly likely that National American University in Rapid City, SD is\
      \ west of the University of Central Arkansas in Conway, AR.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ answer is NO, National American University in SD is not located east of University\
      \ of Central Arkansas in AR.\n\nWait, I want to triple-check this. Let me systematically\
      \ think about the east-west positioning of states in the United States.\n\n\
      Going from east to west in the middle part of the United States, we have:\n\
      - Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California\n\
      \nAnd another line:\n- Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas,\
      \ New Mexico, Arizona, California\n\nSouth Dakota is north of Nebraska, which\
      \ is north of Kansas. Arkansas is east of Oklahoma and west of Tennessee.\n\n\
      Based on this mental mapping, Arkansas is indeed east of South Dakota. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Central Arkansas (in Arkansas) is east of National American\
      \ University (in South Dakota).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let\
      \ me be very explicit:\n\nThe primary campus of National American University\
      \ in SD was in Rapid City, which is in the western part of South Dakota.\nThe\
      \ University of Central Arkansas is in Conway, which is in the central part\
      \ of Arkansas.\n\nTo determine which one is further east, I need to compare\
      \ their longitudes. \n\nRapid City, SD is approximately at longitude -103\xB0\
      \ (103\xB0 W).\nConway, AR is approximately at longitude -92\xB0 (92\xB0 W).\n\
      \nSince -92\xB0 is a higher value (less negative) than -103\xB0, Conway (UCA)\
      \ is further east than Rapid City (NAU).\n\nTherefore, NAU in SD is west of\
      \ UCA in AR, not east.\n\nLet me double-check this with another approach. If\
      \ we were to fly directly from NAU to UCA, we would generally be flying in a\
      \ southeasterly direction. This again confirms that UCA is east of NAU.\n\n\

      NE is located east of Ohio State University, Lima Campus, OH, I need to determine
      the relative geographic positions of these two locations.


      First, I''ll identify the states:

      - Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Ohio State University, Lima Campus is in Ohio (OH)


      Now, let me think about the geographic positions of these states in the US:

      - Nebraska is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle of the country

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest, but it''s closer to the East Coast


      In terms of east-west positioning, Ohio is generally east of Nebraska. This
      means that locations in Ohio are generally east of locations in Nebraska.


      Since Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is in Nebraska, and Ohio State University,
      Lima Campus is in Ohio, the Ohio location would be east of the Nebraska location,
      not the other way around.


      Therefore, Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, NE is NOT located east of Ohio State
      University, Lima Campus, OH. Instead, it''s west of it.


      So my answer is NO.</think># Is Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, NE located east
      of Ohio State University, Lima Campus, OH?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Ohio State University, Lima Campus is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Nebraska is in the Midwest region, in the central part of the United States

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest, but is significantly further east


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - Nebraska is located west of Ohio

      - Any location in Nebraska would be west of (not east of) any location in Ohio


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Bellevue, Nebraska is in a state that is west of Ohio, Nebraska Medicine
      cannot be east of Ohio State University''s Lima Campus.


      NO'

      to determine whether Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue, NE is located east of Ohio
      State University''s Lima Campus in OH.


      Step 1: Let''s identify the locations of these two institutions.

      - Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue, NE (Nebraska)

      - Ohio State University, Lima Campus in OH (Ohio)


      Step 2: Let''s recall the relative positions of Nebraska and Ohio within the
      United States.

      Nebraska is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle of the country. Ohio is also
      in the Midwest, but it''s much further east, bordering Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Let''s compare their relative east-west positions.

      In the United States, states that are further east have a higher longitude (more
      negative if we''re using the convention where west is negative). Ohio is definitely
      east of Nebraska on the map of the United States.


      Step 4: Since Ohio is east of Nebraska, Ohio State University''s Lima Campus
      (in Ohio) would be east of Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue (in Nebraska).


      Step 5: The question asks if Nebraska Medicine is east of Ohio State University''s
      Lima Campus. Based on our reasoning above, the answer would be NO, because Nebraska
      is west of Ohio, not east of it.


      Therefore, Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue, NE is NOT located east of Ohio State
      University''s Lima Campus in OH.</think># Is Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, NE

      - Nebraska Medicine is in Bellevue, Nebraska (NE)

      - Ohio State University Lima Campus is in Lima, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Nebraska and Ohio.

      Nebraska is located in the Midwest region, while Ohio is also in the Midwest
      but positioned much further east. On a map of the United States, Ohio is clearly
      east of Nebraska.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion about the specific locations.

      Since Ohio is east of Nebraska, it follows that institutions in Ohio (like OSU
      Lima Campus) would be east of institutions in Nebraska (like Nebraska Medicine
      in Bellevue).


      Step 4: Answer the specific question.

      The question asks if Nebraska Medicine is east of OSU Lima Campus. Since Nebraska
      is west of Ohio, not east of it, Nebraska Medicine would be west of OSU Lima
      Campus.


      NO, Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue, NE is not located east of Ohio State University

      step.


      The question is asking whether Oklahoma Panhandle State University (in Oklahoma,
      or OK) is located east of Midland University (in Nebraska, or NE).


      To determine this, I need to:

      1. Find the approximate location of Oklahoma Panhandle State University in Oklahoma

      2. Find the approximate location of Midland University in Nebraska

      3. Compare their east-west positions (longitude)


      Step 1: Find the location of Oklahoma Panhandle State University.

      The "panhandle" of Oklahoma refers to the narrow strip of land at the western
      end of the state that extends westward. So Oklahoma Panhandle State University
      is likely in the western part of Oklahoma.


      Step 2: Find the location of Midland University in Nebraska.

      I believe Midland University is in Fremont, Nebraska, which is in the eastern
      part of Nebraska.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Let''s think about the geography of the United States, particularly Nebraska
      and Oklahoma:

      - Nebraska is directly north of Oklahoma

      - Nebraska''s eastern border is along the Missouri River

      - Oklahoma''s eastern border is with Arkansas

      - The Oklahoma panhandle is at the far western end of Oklahoma


      Since the Oklahoma panhandle is at the western end of Oklahoma, and Midland
      University is likely in the eastern part of Nebraska, Oklahoma Panhandle State
      University is almost certainly west of Midland University.


      If a location is west of another location, it is not east of it.


      Therefore, Oklahoma Panhandle State University is NOT east of Midland University.


      Actually, let me double-check this. Let me be more precise about the locations:


      Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in Goodwell, Oklahoma, which is in the
      Oklahoma panhandle (the westernmost part of Oklahoma).


      Midland University is in Fremont, Nebraska, which is in eastern Nebraska, not
      far from Omaha.


      Given that the Oklahoma panhandle is the westernmost part of Oklahoma, and eastern
      Nebraska is quite far east, Oklahoma Panhandle State University is definitely
      west of Midland University, not east of it.


      Therefore, my answer is NO, Oklahoma Panhandle State University is not located
      east of Midland University.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if Oklahoma Panhandle State University (OK) is east of Midland
      University (NE), I need to identify the relative locations of both institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Oklahoma Panhandle State University.

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma

      - The Oklahoma panhandle is the westernmost strip of Oklahoma

      - This places the university in the far western portion of Oklahoma


      Step 2: Identify the location of Midland University.

      - Midland University is located in Fremont, Nebraska

      - Fremont is in eastern Nebraska, not far from Omaha


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Nebraska is directly north of Oklahoma

      - The Oklahoma panhandle represents the westernmost part of Oklahoma

      - Eastern Nebraska (where Midland is located) is significantly east of the Oklahoma
      panhandle

      - Therefore, Oklahoma Panhandle State University is west of Midland University,
      not east

      \ Alabama. Montgomery is in central Alabama.\n\nWinston-Salem State University\

      \nAlabama is a state in the southeastern United States. North Carolina is also\

      \ of Alabama.\n\nSo the general arrangement is:\nAlabama --- North Carolina\n\
      \    West <---------------> East\n\nHowever, the question asks specifically\
      \ about the locations of these universities, not just the states. Let me think\
      \ about the locations of these cities.\n\nMontgomery, Alabama is located in\
      \ central Alabama. Winston-Salem, North Carolina is located in northwestern\
      \ North Carolina.\n\nThe general orientation of the US south is that as you\
      \ move east, you go from Alabama to Georgia to South Carolina to North Carolina.\

      \ Alabama, and Winston-Salem is in northwestern North Carolina. So it's possible\

      \ approximately 86.3\xB0 W longitude.\nWinston-Salem, NC is located at approximately\
      \ 80.2\xB0 W longitude.\n\nSince Winston-Salem has a higher longitude (less\

      \ through Greenwich, England. In the Western Hemisphere, longitudes are negative\
      \ (or labeled with W for west).\n\nSo a place at 80\xB0 W is east of a place\
      \ at 86\xB0 W, because 80 is closer to 0 than 86 is.\n\nLet me confirm my numbers:\n\
      Montgomery, AL: approximately 86.3\xB0 W longitude\nWinston-Salem, NC: approximately\
      \ 80.2\xB0 W longitude\n\nYes, Winston-Salem (80.2\xB0 W) is east of Montgomery\
      \ (86.3\xB0 W).\n\nTherefore, Faulkner University in Montgomery, AL is NOT east\
      \ of Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem, NC. It's west of it.\n\
      \nSo the answer is NO.\n\nActually, let me double-check my understanding of\
      \ east and west on a map of the US. East is towards the Atlantic Ocean, and\
      \ west is towards the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIf we look at a map of the US, North\
      \ Carolina is clearly east of Alabama. Montgomery, AL is in central Alabama,\
      \ and Winston-Salem, NC is in northwestern North Carolina. Even though Winston-Salem\
      \ is in the northwestern part of North Carolina, North Carolina as a whole is\
      \ significantly east of Alabama.\n\nSo my answer is still NO, Faulkner University\
      \ in Montgomery, AL is not east of Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem,\
      \ NC. It's west of it.\n\nLet me just triple-check my longitude values:\n\n\

      \ 80.2\xB0 W longitude\n\nSince 80.2 is a smaller negative number than 86.3,\

      \ State University, I need to identify the locations of both universities and\
      \ compare their longitudes. In the United States, lower (more negative) longitude\
      \ numbers indicate locations further west, while higher (less negative) longitude\
      \ numbers indicate locations further east.\n\nFirst, let me recall the general\
      \ geographic positions of Alabama and North Carolina:\n- Alabama is in the southeastern\
      \ United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico\n- North Carolina is on the eastern\
      \ seaboard of the United States, bordering the Atlantic Ocean\n\nGenerally speaking,\
      \ North Carolina is east of Alabama. North Carolina stretches along the Atlantic\
      \ coast, while Alabama is further west, not directly on the Atlantic.\n\nHowever,\
      \ I need to be precise about the specific locations of these universities:\n\
      \nFaulkner University is located in Montgomery, Alabama. Montgomery is in the\
      \ central part of Alabama.\nWinston-Salem State University is located in Winston-Salem,\
      \ North Carolina, which is in the north-central part of North Carolina.\n\n\
      Even though North Carolina is generally east of Alabama, I need to check the\
      \ specific longitude coordinates to be certain about the relative positions\
      \ of these particular universities.\n\nMontgomery, Alabama (where Faulkner University\
      \ is located) is approximately at longitude 86.3\xB0 W.\nWinston-Salem, North\
      \ Carolina (where Winston-Salem State University is located) is approximately\
      \ at longitude 80.2\xB0 W.\n\nSince longitude measures east-west position, and\
      \ lower (more negative) numbers indicate points further west in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, I can compare these values:\n- Faulkner University: 86.3\xB0 W\n\
      - Winston-Salem State University: 80.2\xB0 W\n\nSince 86.3\xB0 W is a lower\
      \ (more negative) number than 80.2\xB0 W, Faulkner University is located WEST\
      \ of Winston-Salem State University, not east.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO,\

      University in Alabama is located east of Haverford College in Pennsylvania.
      To do this, I need to know the approximate longitude of both institutions.


      First, let me think about the general locations:

      - Samford University is in Alabama (AL), which is in the southeastern United
      States

      - Haverford College is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the northeastern United
      States


      In the United States, states that are further east have lower longitude values,
      while states that are further west have higher longitude values. For example,
      Florida (east coast) has a lower longitude than California (west coast).


      Now, Pennsylvania is an eastern state, bordering the Atlantic Ocean (well, it
      has access to the Atlantic via the Delaware River). Alabama is in the southeast,
      but it''s not on the Atlantic coast - it''s on the Gulf of Mexico.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Pennsylvania is quite far east in the US

      - Alabama is somewhat in the middle-east part of the US, but definitely west
      of Pennsylvania


      So without knowing the exact coordinates, I can infer that Samford University
      in Alabama would be WEST of Haverford College in Pennsylvania, not east.


      Let me double-check this logic:

      - The eastern edge of Alabama is west of the western edge of Pennsylvania

      - So any location in Alabama must be west of any location in Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, Samford University must be west of Haverford College


      So the answer is NO, Samford University is NOT located east of Haverford College.
      It''s located west of it.</think># Determining if Samford University is east

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions
      based on their locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Samford University is in Alabama (AL)

      - Haverford College is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Pennsylvania is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States, but notably west of
      Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      In the United States, locations further east have lower longitude values than
      locations further west. Pennsylvania is significantly further east than Alabama.
      Any location in Alabama (including Samford) would be west of any location in
      Pennsylvania (including Haverford).

      Let me think about the locations:


      1. Samford University is in Alabama (AL). Alabama is a state in the southeastern
      United States.

      2. Haverford College is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is a state in the
      northeastern United States.


      To determine which is further east, I need to compare their longitudes. In the
      United States, the eastern states are closer to the Atlantic Ocean, and the
      western states are closer to the Pacific Ocean.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - Pennsylvania is further north and east compared to Alabama.

      - Alabama is further south and west compared to Pennsylvania.


      So generally speaking, locations in Pennsylvania would be east of locations
      in Alabama. However, I need to be more specific since we''re comparing specific
      institutions that could be on various parts of their respective states.


      To be more precise:

      - Samford University is specifically in Birmingham, Alabama, which is in the
      central part of Alabama.

      - Haverford College is specifically in Haverford, Pennsylvania, which is near
      Philadelphia in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Philadelphia and the eastern part of Pennsylvania are very close to the Atlantic
      coast, making them quite far east. Birmingham, Alabama is definitely west of
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, Samford University in Alabama would be west of Haverford College
      in Pennsylvania.

      \ then Keuka College is likely to be farther east.\n\n9. However, I should verify\
      \ this because specific locations within states could potentially reverse this\
      \ general relationship, although it's unlikely given the geographical separation\
      \ of the two states.\n\n10. New York's western border is generally farther east\
      \ than Georgia's eastern border, so it's pretty much guaranteed that any location\
      \ in New York is east of any location in Georgia.\n\nActually, let me double-check\
      \ this last statement I made. New York state is bordered by Pennsylvania to\
      \ the west and Connecticut to the east (as well as other states north), while\
      \ Georgia is bordered by Alabama to the west and South Carolina to the east\
      \ (as well as other states). \n\nLet me think about the specific east-west layout\
      \ of the states on the East Coast of the United States. \n\nThe East Coast of\
      \ the United States, from north to south, includes Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\
      \ Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,\
      \ North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\n\nWhile New York and\
      \ Georgia are both on the East Coast, New York is farther northeast, while Georgia\
      \ is farther southeast. The eastern part of New York (like New York City) is\
      \ definitely east of Georgia, but the western part of New York extends farther\
      \ west. \n\nNew York runs from approximately 71.8 degrees west longitude (at\
      \ the eastern end) to 79.8 degrees west longitude (at the western end).\n\n\
      Georgia runs from approximately 80.8 degrees west longitude (at the eastern\
      \ end) to 85.6 degrees west longitude (at the western end).\n\nGiven these bounds,\
      \ the easternmost point of Georgia (80.8 degrees west) is west of the westernmost\
      \ point of New York (79.8 degrees west). So every point in Georgia is west of\
      \ some part of New York. \n\nHowever, the question is specifically about Reinhardt\
      \ University in Georgia and Keuka College in New York. I need to determine the\
      \ exact locations of these institutions.\n\nReinhardt University is located\
      \ in Waleska, Georgia. Waleska is in Cherokee County, which is in the northwestern\
      \ part of Georgia.\n\nKeuka College is located in Keuka Park, New York. Keuka\
      \ Park is in Yates County, in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, which\
      \ is in the western part of the state.\n\nNow, to determine which one is farther\
      \ east, I need to know the exact or approximate longitudes of these locations.\n\
      \nWaleska, Georgia, where Reinhardt University is located, is at approximately\
      \ 84.5 degrees west longitude.\n\nKeuka Park, New York, where Keuka College\
      \ is located, is at approximately 77.1 degrees west longitude.\n\nRemember,\
      \ for longitude in the Western Hemisphere, smaller (or less negative) numbers\
      \ represent points farther east, while larger (or more negative) numbers represent\
      \ points farther west.\n\nSince 77.1 degrees west is a smaller number (less\
      \ negative, i.e. farther east) than 84.5 degrees west, Keuka College is east\
      \ of Reinhardt University.\n\nSo the answer to the question, \"Is Reinhardt\
      \ University, GA located east of Keuka College, NY?\" is no. In fact, it's the\
      \ opposite: Keuka College, NY is located east of Reinhardt University, GA.\n\
      \nHmm, let me double-check my reasoning. I'm not entirely confident, as I'm\
      \ relying on my knowledge of US geography rather than looking at a map.\n\n\
      East-west positions in the United States are determined by longitude. The east\
      \ coast is around 67-75 degrees west longitude, and the west coast is around\
      \ 120-125 degrees west longitude. The lower the number (i.e., the closer to\
      \ 0), the farther east the location.\n\nNew York state spans from around 72\
      \ to 80 degrees west longitude. Georgia spans from around 81 to 85 degrees west\
      \ longitude.\n\nGiven this, New York is generally east of Georgia. However,\
      \ the specific locations of Reinhardt University and Keuka College could potentially\
      \ alter this general relationship.\n\nKeuka College is in the Finger Lakes region\
      \ of New York, which is in the western part of the state. The Finger Lakes region\
      \ is roughly around 76-78 degrees west longitude.\n\nReinhardt University is\
      \ in Waleska, Georgia, in the northwestern part of the state. Northwestern Georgia\
      \ is roughly around 84-85 degrees west longitude.\n\nEven though Keuka College\
      \ is in the western part of New York, it's still farther east than Reinhardt\
      \ University in northwestern Georgia, because western New York is still generally\
      \ east of northwestern Georgia.\n\nSo, the answer is NO, Reinhardt University,\
      \ GA is not located east of Keuka College, NY. Instead, Keuka College, NY is\
      \ located east of Reinhardt University, GA.\n\nActually, let me clarify once\
      \ more. East-west positions in the United States are determined by longitude.\
      \ The east coast is around 67-75 degrees west longitude, and the west coast\
      \ is around 120-125 degrees west longitude. The lower the number (i.e., the\
      \ closer to 0), the farther east the location.\n\nNew York state spans from\
      \ around 72 to 80 degrees west longitude. Georgia spans from around 81 to 85\
      \ degrees west longitude.\n\nGiven this, New York is generally east of Georgia.\
      \ However, the specific locations of Reinhardt University and Keuka College\
      \ could potentially alter this general relationship.\n\nI don't know the exact\
      \ longitude of Reinhardt University and Keuka College. But I do know that Keuka\
      \ College is in the Finger Lakes region of New York, which is in the western\
      \ part of the state. The Finger Lakes region is roughly around a longitude of\
      \ 77 degrees west, which is farther east than the eastern border of Georgia\
      \ (which is roughly around 81 degrees west). So Keuka College in New York is\
      \ still east of any point in Georgia, including Reinhardt University.\n\nSo,\
      \ the answer to the question, \"Is Reinhardt University, GA located east of\
      \ Keuka College, NY?\" is NO.\n\nLet me do one more check to be sure I have\
      \ my understanding of east-west coordinates right. The definition of east and\
      \ west is based on longitude. Longitude ranges from -180 degrees to +180 degrees,\
      \ with 0 being the Prime Meridian that runs through Greenwich, UK. Positive\
      \ values are east, and negative values are west.\n\nIn the continental United\
      \ States, all points have negative longitudes, meaning they're west of the Prime\
      \ Meridian. The east coast has longitudes around -67 to -75 degrees, and the\
      \ west coast has longitudes around -120 to -125 degrees. The less negative the\
      \ number, the farther east the location.\n\nSo, if Keuka College has a longitude\
      \ of around -77 degrees, and Reinhardt University has a longitude of around\
      \ -84 degrees, then Keuka College has a less negative longitude, which means\
      \ it's farther east.\n\nSo, the answer to the question, \"Is Reinhardt University,\
      \ GA located east of Keuka College, NY?\" is NO. Reinhardt University is west\
      \ of Keuka College.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine if Reinhardt\

      \ farther east\n\n5) Since 77.1\xB0 W is less than 84.5\xB0 W, Keuka College\
      \ is actually east of Reinhardt University\n\n# Answer: NO\n\nReinhardt University\

      \nIn terms of east-west positioning, the eastern United States coastline has\

      \nGeorgia is generally west of New York when comparing the main bodies of both\

      - Reinhardt University is located in Waleska, Georgia, which is in the northern\

      \ is in the western part of New York State, specifically in the Finger Lakes\

      \ the geographic locations of Georgia and New York states, and then more specifically\
      \ about the locations of these colleges within their respective states.\n\n\
      First, let's consider the general geography of the eastern United States:\n\

      \ (GA) is in the southeastern part of the United States\n\nIn terms of east-west\

      \ than the westernmost parts of Georgia.\n\nBut we need to know specifically\
      \ about these colleges' locations within their states.\n\nReinhardt University\
      \ is in Georgia. Without specific information about its location within Georgia,\
      \ I would assume it's not on the extreme eastern coast of Georgia.\n\nKeuka\
      \ College is in New York. The name \"Keuka\" suggests it might be near Keuka\
      \ Lake, which is in the Finger Lakes region of central/western New York state.\n\
      \nGiven that:\n1. New York extends further west than Georgia\n2. Keuka College\
      \ is likely in western/central New York (if it's named after or near Keuka Lake)\n\
      3. Reinhardt University is somewhere in Georgia\n\nIt seems likely that Reinhardt\
      \ University would be east of Keuka College. This is because even though both\
      \ NY and GA have eastern coastlines, NY extends further west than GA, and Keuka\
      \ College is likely in the western part of NY.\n\nLet me double-check by trying\
      \ to recall more specific information about these colleges:\n\nReinhardt University\
      \ is in Waleska, Georgia, which is in Cherokee County in the northern part of\
      \ Georgia. It's not on the coast but in the interior of the state.\n\nKeuka\
      \ College is indeed in the Finger Lakes region of New York, specifically in\
      \ Keuka Park, NY on Keuka Lake. This is in the western part of New York state.\n\
      \nNow I need to think about the east-west positioning:\n- Waleska, GA (Reinhardt\
      \ University) is in northern Georgia\n- Keuka Park, NY (Keuka College) is in\
      \ western New York\n\nLooking at a mental map of the US, western New York is\
      \ still fairly far east in the continent, but Georgia as a whole is east of\
      \ western New York.\n\nTo be more precise, I should think about the longitudes:\n\
      - Western New York is approximately around 77-79\xB0 W longitude\n- Northern\
      \ Georgia is approximately around 84-85\xB0 W longitude\n\nA lower number of\
      \ degrees West means further east. So if western NY is around 77-79\xB0 W and\
      \ northern GA is around 84-85\xB0 W, then Keuka College would be east of Reinhardt\
      \ University, not the other way around.\n\nLet me double-check these longitude\
      \ estimates:\n- Keuka Park, NY is at approximately 77.1\xB0 W longitude\n- Waleska,\
      \ GA is at approximately 84.5\xB0 W longitude\n\nSo Keuka College (77.1\xB0\
      \ W) is east of Reinhardt University (84.5\xB0 W).\n\nWait, that's not right.\
      \ I need to remember that on the western hemisphere, smaller numbers of degrees\
      \ west longitude are further east.\n\nSo:\n- 77.1\xB0 W (Keuka College) is EAST\
      \ of 84.5\xB0 W (Reinhardt University)\n\nTherefore, Keuka College is east of\
      \ Reinhardt University, not the other way around.\n\nWait, I think I got confused.\
      \ Let me clarify the longitude situation again:\n\nIn the western hemisphere\
      \ (which includes the United States):\n- Eastern locations have smaller west\
      \ longitude numbers\n- Western locations have larger west longitude numbers\n\
      \nSo:\n- 77.1\xB0 W (Keuka College) is EAST of 84.5\xB0 W (Reinhardt University)\n\
      \nThis means that Keuka College is EAST of Reinhardt University.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Reinhardt University is NOT east of Keuka College; it's west of it.\n\nThe\
      \ answer is NO.\n\nActually, let me double-check my reasoning once more. I think\
      \ I may have gotten confused about east and west in terms of longitude.\n\n\
      In the western hemisphere:\n- Locations further east have SMALLER west longitude\
      \ numbers\n- Locations further west have LARGER west longitude numbers\n\nSo:\n\
      - 77.1\xB0 W (Keuka College) is further east than 84.5\xB0 W (Reinhardt University)\n\
      \nThis means Keuka College is EAST of Reinhardt University, and conversely,\

      \ would be NO, Reinhardt University, GA is not located east of Keuka College,\
      \ NY.\n\nActually, let me double-check this by thinking more about the geography.\n\
      \nThe eastern portion of the United States generally follows a northeast to\
      \ southwest orientation along the Atlantic coast. This means that as you move\
      \ further north along the eastern seaboard, you also tend to move slightly further\
      \ east.\n\nNew York is significantly north of Georgia. Given the general orientation\

      \ (home of Keuka College) is in Yates County, in the Finger Lakes region of\

      \ still generally east of northern Georgia due to the overall shape of the eastern\
      \ United States.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I still believe that Keuka College\
      \ is east of Reinhardt University, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, my\
      \ answer is still NO, Reinhardt University, GA is not located east of Keuka\
      \ College, NY.\n\nActually wait, let me clarify further.\n\nWhile New York State\
      \ is generally east of Georgia, western New York (where the Finger Lakes region\
      \ is located) extends quite far west. The western border of New York reaches\
      \ Lake Erie, which is significantly further west than many people might initially\
      \ think.\n\nKeuka College is in the Finger Lakes region of New York, which is\
      \ in the western part of the state. Meanwhile, Reinhardt University is in northern\
      \ Georgia.\n\nLet me try to recall approximate longitudes:\n- Finger Lakes region\
      \ of NY: roughly around 77\xB0W longitude\n- Northern Georgia: roughly around\
      \ 84\xB0W longitude\n\nIf these approximations are correct, then Keuka College\
      \ would still be east of Reinhardt University.\n\nTo be absolutely certain,\
      \ I'd need the exact coordinates, but based on my understanding of US geography,\

      \ 42.6\xB0N, 77.1\xB0W\n- Reinhardt University: approximately 34.3\xB0N, 84.5\xB0\
      W\n\nLooking at the longitudes, 77.1\xB0W is further east than 84.5\xB0W. This\
      \ confirms that Keuka College is indeed east of Reinhardt University, not the\
      \ other way around.\n\nSo once again, my answer is NO, Reinhardt University,\
      \ GA is not located east of Keuka College, NY.\n\nActually wait, I think I'm\
      \ still getting confused. Let me just verify this one more time.\n\nWhen we\

      \ values of west longitude (or larger values of east longitude)\n- West corresponds\
      \ to larger values of west longitude (or smaller values of east longitude)\n\
      \nIn the United States, all longitudes are west longitudes (negative values).\n\
      \nSo, if Keuka College is at approximately 77.1\xB0W and Reinhardt University\

      \ specifically thinking about longitude:\n- The eastern edge of the continental\
      \ US is along the Atlantic Ocean, and both New York and Georgia have Atlantic\
      \ coastlines.\n- However, New York extends further east than Georgia does.\n\
      \nStep 4: Narrowing down to the specific locations of these institutions:\n\
      - Reinhardt University is in Georgia, but I need to know its specific location\
      \ within Georgia.\n- Keuka College is in New York, but I need to know its specific\
      \ location within New York.\n\nFrom my knowledge, Reinhardt University is in\
      \ Waleska, Georgia, which is in the northern part of Georgia, likely in the\
      \ interior of the state rather than on the coast.\n\nKeuka College is located\
      \ in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, specifically in the town of\
      \ Keuka Park, which is in central/western New York state.\n\nStep 5: Making\
      \ the comparison:\nWestern New York is still generally east of northern Georgia.\
      \ Even though New York is north of Georgia, in terms of east-west positioning\
      \ (longitude), New York is east of Georgia.\n\nTherefore, Reinhardt University\
      \ in Georgia would be WEST of Keuka College in New York, not east of it.\n\n\
      So, is Reinhardt University, GA located east of Keuka College, NY?\n\nNo, Reinhardt\
      \ University in Georgia is located west of Keuka College in New York.\n\nActually,\
      \ let me double-check by thinking about this more carefully with approximate\
      \ longitudes:\n- The Finger Lakes region of NY is in the western part of New\
      \ York state, roughly between 76\xB0W and 78\xB0W longitude.\n- Northern Georgia,\
      \ where Waleska is located, is roughly around 84\xB0W longitude.\n\nA lower\
      \ value of western longitude (76-78\xB0W) is further east than a higher value\
      \ of western longitude (84\xB0W). So this confirms that Keuka College is further\
      \ east than Reinhardt University.\n\nTherefore, Reinhardt University, GA is\
      \ NOT located east of Keuka College, NY. Reinhardt University is west of Keuka\
      \ College.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine whether Reinhardt\
      \ University in Georgia is east of Keuka College in New York, I need to analyze\
      \ the geographical positions of these two institutions.\n\n1) First, let me\
      \ identify the locations:\n   - Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia\
      \ (GA)\n   - Keuka College is in Keuka Park, New York (NY)\n\n2) Looking at\
      \ the United States map:\n   - Georgia is in the southeastern United States\n\
      \   - New York is in the northeastern United States\n\n3) When comparing east-west\
      \ positions, I need to consider longitude:\n   - Georgia is generally positioned\
      \ around 83\xB0W to 85\xB0W longitude\n   - The Finger Lakes region of New York\
      \ (where Keuka College is located) is positioned around 76\xB0W to 78\xB0W longitude\n\
      \n4) Since lower numbers of western longitude indicate more easterly positions:\n\
      \   - Keuka College (76-78\xB0W) is further east than Reinhardt University (83-85\xB0\
      W)\n\n# Answer: NO\n\nReinhardt University in Georgia is NOT located east of\
      \ Keuka College in New York. It is actually located to the west of Keuka College."

      in the central part of the country, bordering Lake Michigan to the northwest.


      Vermont is a state in the New England region in the northeastern part of the
      United States. It borders New York to the west and Massachusetts to the south.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Vermont is definitely further east than Indiana.
      On a map of the United States, when we look from west to east, we would encounter
      Indiana before Vermont.


      Since Huntington University is in Indiana (IN) and Norwich University is in
      Vermont (VT), and Indiana is west of Vermont, it follows that Huntington University
      is west of Norwich University.


      Therefore, Huntington University, IN is NOT located east of Norwich University,
      VT. It is located west of Norwich University.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is Huntington University, IN located east of Norwich
      University, VT?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Huntington University is in Indiana (IN)

      - Norwich University is in Vermont (VT)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographical positions of these states

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Vermont is located in the Northeast region (New England) of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - On a U.S. map, Vermont is significantly farther east than Indiana

      - The Midwest (including Indiana) is west of the Northeast region (including
      Vermont)


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion about the universities

      Since Huntington University is in Indiana (a more western state) and Norwich
      University is in Vermont (a more eastern state), Huntington University must
      be west of Norwich University, not east.


      NO, Huntington University is not located east of Norwich University.'

      Rock University of Pennsylvania, PA is located east of College of the Holy Cross,
      MA. This requires me to figure out the locations of these two institutions and
      compare their east-west positions.


      First, let me think about the locations:


      1. Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania is in Pennsylvania (PA), as the
      name indicates. It''s specifically in a town called Slippery Rock.


      2. College of the Holy Cross is in Massachusetts (MA).


      Now I need to determine their east-west relationship. In the United States,
      Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania. Massachusetts is on the Atlantic
      coast in New England, while Pennsylvania is further inland.


      To be more specific:

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern United States, but it doesn''t border
      the Atlantic Ocean directly (except for a small portion on the Delaware River
      leading to the Atlantic)


      Generally speaking, locations in Massachusetts would be east of locations in
      Pennsylvania. However, I should check if there are any unusual geographic arrangements
      here.


      Slippery Rock, PA is in western Pennsylvania, not far from the Ohio border.
      This puts it quite far west within Pennsylvania.


      The College of the Holy Cross is in Worcester, Massachusetts, which is in central/eastern
      Massachusetts.


      Given that:

      1. Massachusetts is already east of Pennsylvania

      2. Slippery Rock is in western Pennsylvania (making it even further west)

      3. Holy Cross is in central/eastern Massachusetts


      It''s clear that College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA is east of Slippery
      Rock University in Slippery Rock, PA.


      Therefore, Slippery Rock University is NOT east of College of the Holy Cross.
      Rather, College of the Holy Cross is east of Slippery Rock University.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania, PA located
      east of College of the Holy Cross, MA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two institutions.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Slippery Rock University is located in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania (PA)

      - College of the Holy Cross is located in Worcester, Massachusetts (MA)


      Next, I need to consider the geographic relationship between these states:

      - Massachusetts is located in New England, on the eastern seaboard of the United
      States

      - Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts


      More specifically:

      - Slippery Rock, PA is in western Pennsylvania, not far from the Ohio border

      - Worcester, MA is in central Massachusetts


      Since Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, and Slippery Rock is in the western
      part of Pennsylvania, College of the Holy Cross must be east of Slippery Rock
      University.


      Therefore, Slippery Rock University is NOT east of College of the Holy Cross;
      it''s the other way around.

      \ (TX).\n2. Lewis University is in Illinois (IL).\n\nGeographically, the United\
      \ States has Texas located in the south-central part of the country, while Illinois\
      \ is in the Midwest. \n\nLet's think about directions. In the US, states to\
      \ the west have larger (more negative) longitudes than states to the east. For\
      \ example, California (west coast) has a more negative longitude than New York\
      \ (east coast).\n\nNow let's think about the relative positions of Texas and\
      \ Illinois:\n- Texas is generally considered to be west of Illinois.\n- This\
      \ means that, in general, locations in Texas would have a more negative longitude\
      \ (be more westward) than locations in Illinois.\n\nHowever, I need to consider\
      \ the specific locations of these universities within their respective states,\
      \ as states cover large areas and the relative positions of specific locations\
      \ can vary.\n\nMidwestern State University of Texas is in Wichita Falls, TX,\
      \ which is in the northern part of Texas, close to the border with Oklahoma.\n\
      \nLewis University is in Romeoville, IL, which is in the northeastern part of\
      \ Illinois, near Chicago.\n\nEven though I don't have the exact longitude coordinates,\
      \ I can reason about this based on the general geography of the US. Texas is\
      \ west of Illinois, and even the easternmost parts of Texas are generally west\
      \ of the westernmost parts of Illinois. \n\nTherefore, Midwestern State University\
      \ of Texas, TX is very likely located west of Lewis University, IL, not east\
      \ of it.\n\nTo double-check, if I were to draw a line directly south from Lewis\
      \ University in Illinois, it would likely pass through the states of Missouri,\
      \ Arkansas, and Louisiana, all of which are east of Texas. This confirms that\
      \ Midwestern State University of Texas is west of Lewis University, not east\
      \ of it.\n\nSo the answer to the question \"Is Midwestern State University of\

      2. Compare their east-west positions (longitudes)


      Let me consider what I know about these locations:


      Baldwin Wallace University is in Ohio. Ohio is in the Midwest region of the
      United States. If I recall correctly, it''s located near Cleveland, in the northeastern

      First, I need to locate both institutions:


      1. Baldwin Wallace University is in Berea, Ohio (OH)

      2. Stony Brook University School of Medicine is in Stony Brook, New York (NY)


      Next, I need to determine their relative locations on an east-west axis:


      Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is in the
      Northeast region.


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Ohio. Let me confirm this with more
      specific geographical knowledge:


      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania to its east

      - Pennsylvania borders New York to its east

      - Therefore, New York is east of Ohio


      Since Baldwin Wallace University is in Ohio and Stony Brook University School
      of Medicine is in New York, and New York is east of Ohio, it follows that Stony
      Brook University School of Medicine is east of Baldwin Wallace University.


      The question asks if Baldwin Wallace University is east of Stony Brook University
      School of Medicine. The answer would be NO, because Baldwin Wallace University
      is west of Stony Brook University School of Medicine, not east of it.</think>#
      Reasoning about geographic locations


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Baldwin Wallace University is located in Berea, Ohio (OH)

      - Stony Brook University School of Medicine is located in Stony Brook, New York
      (NY)


      ## Step 2: Determine east-west relationship

      - New York is located on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region, west of New York

      - When looking at a US map, New York is clearly east of Ohio


      ## Step 3: Make the comparison

      Since Baldwin Wallace University is in Ohio (western location) and Stony Brook
      University School of Medicine is in New York (eastern location), Baldwin Wallace
      is NOT east of Stony Brook. Rather, Baldwin Wallace is west of Stony Brook.

      if Baldwin Wallace University in Ohio is located east of Stony Brook University
      School of Medicine in New York. I''ll think about this in terms of their relative

      First, let me identify their locations:


      1. Baldwin Wallace University is in Ohio (OH)

      2. Stony Brook University School of Medicine is in New York (NY)


      Now, I need to think about the geographic positioning of these states. In the
      United States:

      - New York is on the East Coast

      - Ohio is in the Midwest, west of New York


      More specifically:

      - Baldwin Wallace University is in Berea, Ohio, which is near Cleveland in the
      northern part of the state

      - Stony Brook University is on Long Island, New York, which is in the eastern
      part of New York state


      When considering whether something is "east" of something else in the US, I
      need to compare their longitudinal positions. Things that are "east" have a
      more easterly longitude (closer to the Atlantic Ocean).


      Since New York is east of Ohio, and specifically Stony Brook on Long Island
      is in the eastern part of New York, while Baldwin Wallace is in the Cleveland
      area of Ohio, Baldwin Wallace University would be WEST of Stony Brook University
      School of Medicine, not east.


      Therefore, the answer is NO - Baldwin Wallace University in OH is NOT located

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Baldwin Wallace University is located in Berea, Ohio (near Cleveland)

      - Stony Brook University School of Medicine is located on Long Island, New York


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Ohio and New York.

      - Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - New York state, particularly Long Island where Stony Brook is located, is
      significantly farther east than Ohio

      - Ohio, where Baldwin Wallace is located, is west of New York state


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Ohio is west of New York, Baldwin Wallace University must be west of (not
      east of) Stony Brook University School of Medicine.

    c2c92398-bf76-420c-9318-40befca7965e: '<think>Alright, I need to find out if Colorado
      State University Pueblo (CSU Pueblo) is located east of McNeese State University
      in Louisiana.


      Let me think about the geography:


      1. Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado.

      2. McNeese State University is in Louisiana (LA).


      To determine which one is more east, I need to consider their relative longitudes.
      In the United States, locations further east have lower longitude values (because
      longitude decreases as you move east in the Western Hemisphere).


      Colorado is generally west of Louisiana in the United States. Colorado is in
      the western part of the US, while Louisiana is in the southeastern part.


      So generally speaking, a location in Colorado would be west of a location in
      Louisiana, not east. This means that Colorado State University Pueblo would
      be west of McNeese State University, not east.


      But to be thorough, let''s think about the specific locations within these states:


      - Pueblo, Colorado is in the southern part of Colorado.

      - I''m not sure exactly where in Louisiana McNeese State University is located,
      but Louisiana as a whole is east of Colorado.


      Even if Pueblo is in the eastern part of Colorado and McNeese is in the western
      part of Louisiana, the distance between the states is large enough that a location
      in Colorado would still be west of a location in Louisiana.


      To confirm this, I would need the exact longitudes of both universities, but
      based on the general geography of the United States, I''m confident that Colorado
      State University Pueblo is west of McNeese State University, not east.


      So my answer is NO, Colorado State University Pueblo is not located east of
      McNeese State University. It''s located west of it.


      Actually, let me double-check by thinking a bit more precisely about where these
      two universities are located.


      McNeese State University is located in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which is in
      the western part of Louisiana close to the Texas border.


      Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado, which is in the southern
      part of Colorado.


      Even though McNeese State is in the western part of Louisiana, Louisiana as
      a whole is so far east compared to Colorado that any location in Louisiana would
      be east of any location in Colorado.


      So my answer remains NO, Colorado State University Pueblo is not located east
      of McNeese State University. It''s located west of it.</think># Determining
      if CSU Pueblo is East of McNeese State University


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two universities by understanding
      their geographic locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Colorado State University Pueblo is in Pueblo, Colorado (CO)

      - McNeese State University is in Lake Charles, Louisiana (LA)


      ## Step 2: Consider US geography

      - Colorado is located in the western United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southeastern United States

      - Generally, states further east have lower longitude values in the Western
      Hemisphere


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      - Even though Pueblo is in eastern Colorado and Lake Charles is in western Louisiana,
      the entire state of Colorado is significantly west of Louisiana

      - The Continental US geography places all of Colorado west of all of Louisiana


      ## Conclusion

      NO, Colorado State University Pueblo is NOT located east of McNeese State University.
      It is located west of it.'

      I need to determine if Colorado State University Pueblo is located east of McNeese
      State University.


      First, let me think about the general geographic locations of these states:

      - Colorado (CO) is in the western part of the United States, in the Rocky Mountain
      region

      - Louisiana (LA) is in the southern part of the United States, on the Gulf of
      Mexico


      In terms of east-west positioning in the United States:

      - Louisiana is east of Colorado


      Now, let''s think about the specific cities:

      - Pueblo is a city in Colorado

      - McNeese State University is in Lake Charles, Louisiana


      Since Colorado is west of Louisiana, it follows that Pueblo, CO would be west

      1. First, I need to understand the general geographic relationship between Illinois
      and Pennsylvania in the United States.

      2. Illinois is located in the Midwest of the United States.

      3. Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern part of the United States.

      4. Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Illinois on a map of the United
      States.


      Since Illinois is west of Pennsylvania, Robert Morris University Illinois (which
      is in Illinois) would be west of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania
      (which is in Pennsylvania).


      If something is west of another thing, then it is not east of it. So Robert
      Morris University Illinois is NOT east of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think># Is Robert Morris University Illinois,
      IL located east of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, PA?


      I need to determine the geographic relationship between these two universities
      based on their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (IL)

      - East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Illinois and Pennsylvania.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast region of the United States

      - On a US map, Pennsylvania is east of Illinois


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, their relative
      positions follow the same pattern.

      - Robert Morris University Illinois would be west of East Stroudsburg University

      - Therefore, Robert Morris is NOT east of East Stroudsburg

      of Robert Morris University Illinois (IL) and East Stroudsburg University of
      Pennsylvania (PA), and then determine which is more easterly.


      First, let me think about the states. Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest, while
      Pennsylvania (PA) is on the East Coast. Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is
      east of Illinois.


      But I need to be more specific about the exact locations of these universities:


      1. Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois, likely in or near Chicago
      (which is on the eastern side of Illinois, near Lake Michigan).


      2. East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania is in Pennsylvania, and given
      the name "East Stroudsburg," it''s likely in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Since Pennsylvania is already east of Illinois, and East Stroudsburg is likely
      in eastern Pennsylvania, it''s very likely that East Stroudsburg University
      is east of Robert Morris University Illinois.


      Let''s double-check this logic:

      - Illinois is west of Pennsylvania

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois

      - East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania, likely eastern Pennsylvania


      So, is Robert Morris University Illinois located east of East Stroudsburg University
      of Pennsylvania?

      No, it''s the opposite. Robert Morris University Illinois is west of East Stroudsburg
      University of Pennsylvania.


      The answer is NO.</think># Determining the East-West Relationship Between Two
      Universities


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions
      of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (IL)

      - East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the general geography

      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Pennsylvania is
      on the East Coast. In terms of U.S. geography, Pennsylvania is located east
      of Illinois.


      ## Step 3: Consider specific locations

      - Robert Morris University Illinois would be located in Illinois (likely Chicago
      area)

      - East Stroudsburg University is in East Stroudsburg, which is in eastern Pennsylvania
      near the New Jersey border


      ## Step 4: Compare positions

      Since Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, and East Stroudsburg is specifically
      in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, East Stroudsburg University is definitely
      east of Robert Morris University Illinois.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      \ Robert Morris University Illinois, IL is located east of East Stroudsburg\
      \ University of Pennsylvania, PA. I will need to use my knowledge of US geography\
      \ to determine the relative locations.\n\nStep 1: Let me determine where Robert\
      \ Morris University Illinois is located. It's in Illinois (IL), and given the\
      \ name, it's likely in or near Chicago. Chicago, Illinois is in the Midwest\
      \ region of the United States, on the western shore of Lake Michigan.\n\nStep\
      \ 2: Next, let's determine where East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania\
      \ is located. It's in Pennsylvania (PA), and specifically in East Stroudsburg.\
      \ Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the United States, bordering New\
      \ Jersey to the east, New York to the north, Ohio to the west, and several other\
      \ states. East Stroudsburg is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, actually\
      \ in the Pocono Mountains area, near the border with New Jersey.\n\nStep 3:\
      \ Now let's think about the general east-west positioning of these states. Illinois\
      \ is in the Midwest, while Pennsylvania is in the Northeast. In terms of longitude,\
      \ Illinois is generally west of Pennsylvania. Chicago, IL (where Robert Morris\
      \ University is likely located) is at around 87.6\xB0 W longitude, while East\
      \ Stroudsburg, PA is at around 75.2\xB0 W longitude.\n\nStep 4: Since a lower\
      \ western longitude (less negative) is farther east, and East Stroudsburg, PA\
      \ (75.2\xB0 W) has a lower western longitude than Chicago, IL (87.6\xB0 W),\
      \ East Stroudsburg is farther east than Chicago.\n\nTherefore, Robert Morris\
      \ University Illinois (likely in or near Chicago) is *not* east of East Stroudsburg\
      \ University of Pennsylvania. Rather, it is *west* of East Stroudsburg University.\n\
      \nActually, I should correct myself. Robert Morris University Illinois is located\
      \ in Chicago. Chicago is in the eastern part of Illinois, but Illinois as a\
      \ whole is still west of Pennsylvania. The specific location of Robert Morris\
      \ University Illinois is around longitude -87.6\xB0 (87.6\xB0 W), while East\
      \ Stroudsburg University is at around longitude -75.2\xB0 (75.2\xB0 W). Since\
      \ -87.6\xB0 is further west than -75.2\xB0 (i.e., -87.6 < -75.2), Robert Morris\
      \ University Illinois is west of East Stroudsburg University, not east of it.\n\
      \nLet me just double-check my reasoning here:\n\nIllinois is a Midwestern state,\
      \ and Pennsylvania is a Northeastern state. In general, Midwestern states are\
      \ west of Northeastern states. This reflects my reasoning above that Robert\
      \ Morris University in Illinois is likely west of East Stroudsburg University\
      \ in Pennsylvania.\n\nI believe I got confused because we're using negative\
      \ longitudes (since these are western longitudes), so I need to be careful with\
      \ the comparison. If Robert Morris University Illinois is at -87.6\xB0 longitude\
      \ and East Stroudsburg University is at -75.2\xB0 longitude, then:\n\n-87.6\xB0\
      \ < -75.2\xB0, which means Robert Morris University Illinois is further west,\
      \ not east.\n\nSo, Robert Morris University Illinois is NOT located east of\

      \ Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine if Robert Morris University Illinois\

      \ is located in Chicago, Illinois. Illinois is in the Midwest region of the\
      \ United States.\n\nStep 2: East Stroudsburg University is located in East Stroudsburg,\
      \ Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States.\n\nStep 3:\
      \ Compare the longitudes:\n- Chicago, IL is approximately at longitude 87.6\xB0\

      \ 4: On a map of North America, longitude numbers increase as you move westward.\
      \ Since 87.6\xB0 W is a larger number than 75.2\xB0 W, Chicago is west of East\

      \ in terms of east-west positioning.\nIf we look at a map of the United States,\
      \ we can see that Pennsylvania is considerably east of Illinois. Pennsylvania\
      \ borders the Atlantic Ocean (via Delaware Bay), while Illinois is inland, bordering\
      \ the Mississippi River on its western edge.\n\nSince we're specifically comparing\
      \ their eastward positions, I need to check if Robert Morris University Illinois\
      \ is located east of East Stroudsburg University. Since Pennsylvania is east\
      \ of Illinois, and Robert Morris University is in Illinois while East Stroudsburg\
      \ University is in Pennsylvania, the answer would be NO - Robert Morris University\
      \ Illinois is NOT located east of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania.\n\
      \nActually, let me double-check this by thinking about the longitude values.\
      \ Longitude measures east-west position, with more eastern locations having\
      \ higher longitude values in the United States (since the US is in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, these are actually less negative numbers, but we can just compare\
      \ them directly).\n\nChicago, IL is at approximately 87.6\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      East Stroudsburg, PA is at approximately 75.2\xB0 W longitude.\n\nSince 87.6\xB0\
      \ W is further west than 75.2\xB0 W (the bigger the western longitude number,\
      \ the further west the location), this confirms that Robert Morris University\
      \ Illinois is NOT east of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania. In fact,\
      \ it's the opposite - East Stroudsburg University is east of Robert Morris University\

      \ 75.2\xB0 W\n\nStep 3: Analyze the longitude values.\nSince we're in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, the smaller the longitude number (less negative), the more eastward\
      \ the location. 75.2\xB0 W (East Stroudsburg) is a smaller number than 87.6\xB0\

      1. The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas (TX).

      2. University of Georgia College of Public Health is in Georgia (GA).


      Now I need to determine which one is more easterly. In the United States, Georgia

      Georgia is definitely east of Texas on a map of the United States. Georgia is
      on the Atlantic coast, while Texas extends from the center of the southern US
      to the Gulf of Mexico.


      Since Georgia is east of Texas, and the institutions are in their respective

      of The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More (in Texas).


      Therefore, The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More in TX is NOT located

      1. The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is located in Texas (TX)

      2. University of Georgia College of Public Health is located in Georgia (GA)

      3. Geographically, Georgia is on the Atlantic coast in the southeastern United

      Let''s identify the two institutions:

      1. Miami University Middletown - located in Middletown, Ohio (OH)

      2. Southern Connecticut State University - located in Connecticut (CT)


      To determine which is east of the other, I need to know their relative positions
      on a map of the United States. In the United States, states generally become
      more eastern as you move from west to east.


      Ohio is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Connecticut is in
      the Northeast region, specifically in New England. Connecticut is on the Atlantic
      coast, while Ohio is more inland.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - Connecticut is definitely east of Ohio

      - Connecticut borders the Atlantic Ocean on its southern coast

      - Ohio is more central/midwest, bordering Pennsylvania to its east and the Ohio
      River and Kentucky to its south


      Since Connecticut is east of Ohio, Southern Connecticut State University (in
      Connecticut) would be east of Miami University Middletown (in Ohio).


      So to answer the question: Is Miami University Middletown, OH located east of
      Southern Connecticut State University, CT?

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Miami University Middletown is in Middletown, Ohio (OH)

      - Southern Connecticut State University is in Connecticut (CT)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Connecticut is located in the Northeast region (New England)

      - Connecticut borders the Atlantic Ocean on its east coast

      - Ohio is more inland and is significantly west of Connecticut


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis

      - Connecticut is positioned much further east than Ohio on the US map

      - All of Connecticut is east of all of Ohio


      Since Southern Connecticut State University is in Connecticut (an eastern state)
      and Miami University Middletown is in Ohio (a midwestern state), the Ohio institution
      is west of the Connecticut institution, not east of it.

      locations of Bellarmine University in Kentucky and Hampton University in Virginia,
      and then determine which one is farther east.


      First, let me try to recall the approximate locations of these universities:


      1. Bellarmine University is in Kentucky (KY). Kentucky is generally in the eastern
      part of the United States, but west of Virginia. Specifically, Bellarmine University
      is in Louisville, Kentucky, which is in the northern part of the state along
      the Ohio River.


      2. Hampton University is in Virginia (VA). Virginia is on the eastern seaboard
      of the United States. Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia, which is in
      the eastern part of Virginia near the Atlantic Ocean.


      Now, to determine which one is farther east, I need to compare their longitudes.
      In the United States, the farther east a location is, the lower (or more negative)
      its longitude value.


      Given that Virginia is east of Kentucky, and Hampton is in the eastern part
      of Virginia (near the coast), while Louisville is not at the eastern edge of
      Kentucky, Hampton University should be farther east than Bellarmine University.


      Therefore, Bellarmine University is NOT located east of Hampton University.
      Rather, Hampton University is east of Bellarmine University.


      So the answer is NO, Bellarmine University is not east of Hampton University.</think>#
      Determining if Bellarmine University is East of Hampton University


      To answer this question, I need to identify the locations of both universities
      and compare their positions on an east-west axis.


      ## Step 1: Locate both universities

      - Bellarmine University is in Louisville, Kentucky

      - Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia


      ## Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions

      - Kentucky is located in the eastern United States, but is west of Virginia

      - Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific cities

      - Louisville is in northern Kentucky, along the Ohio River

      - Hampton is in eastern Virginia, in the coastal Hampton Roads region


      ## Step 4: Compare east-west positions

      - Virginia is clearly east of Kentucky

      - Hampton is in the eastern part of Virginia near the coast

      - This places Hampton University significantly east of Bellarmine University


      NO - Bellarmine University in Kentucky is not east of Hampton University in
      Virginia. Hampton University is east of Bellarmine University.'

      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of these
      two universities and compare their east-west positions (longitudes).


      Let me think about the locations:


      1. New Orleans, Louisiana is located in the southeastern United States, along
      the Gulf of Mexico. It''s in the southern part of Louisiana.


      2. Troy, Alabama is also in the southeastern United States. Alabama is located
      east of Louisiana.


      Generally speaking, Louisiana is west of Alabama. On a map of the United States,
      if you move from Louisiana to Alabama, you''re moving eastward.


      Since New Orleans is in Louisiana and Troy is in Alabama, it''s likely that
      New Orleans is west of Troy, not east.


      However, I should be careful about making assumptions based just on state locations,
      because specific cities within states can have different relative positions.
      I need to consider the specific locations of these cities within their states.


      New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast. Troy,
      Alabama is located in the southeastern part of Alabama, but not at the extreme
      eastern edge of the state.


      Based on my knowledge of US geography, New Orleans is still west of Troy, Alabama.
      This is because Louisiana is entirely west of Alabama, and the positions of
      these cities within their states don''t change that relationship.


      Therefore, New Orleans University, LA is NOT located east of Troy University,
      AL. Instead, it''s located WEST of Troy University.


      So the answer to the question "Is New Orleans University, LA located east of
      Troy University, AL?" is NO.


      Wait, I should double-check my reasoning to make sure I''m not making a mistake.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - Louisiana borders Texas to its west and Mississippi to its east

      - Alabama is east of Mississippi

      - So Alabama is definitely east of Louisiana


      Looking at the specific cities:

      - New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast and the Mississippi
      border

      - Troy is in southeastern Alabama, not at the extreme eastern edge


      Given these positions, New Orleans is still west of Troy. So my reasoning stands:
      New Orleans University, LA is NOT located east of Troy University, AL. It''s
      located west of Troy University, AL.


      So my final answer is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if New Orleans University, LA is east of Troy University, AL, I
      need to consider the geographic locations of these universities.


      1. First, let''s identify the states: New Orleans is in Louisiana (LA), and
      Troy is in Alabama (AL).


      2. Looking at the map of the United States, Louisiana is positioned to the west
      of Alabama. Louisiana borders Texas on its west side and Mississippi on its
      east side.


      3. Alabama is located east of Mississippi, which means Alabama is definitely
      east of Louisiana.


      4. New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana, while Troy is in southeastern
      Alabama.


      5. Since Louisiana is entirely west of Alabama, New Orleans must be west of
      Troy - not east of it.


      Therefore, New Orleans University is NOT located east of Troy University.

      \nFirst, let me consider New Orleans, Louisiana. New Orleans is located in the\
      \ southeastern part of Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico. Louisiana is in the\
      \ southern United States.\n\nNext, let's consider Troy, Alabama. Troy is a city\
      \ in Pike County, Alabama, which is in the southeastern part of Alabama. Alabama\
      \ is also in the southern United States, but it's east of Louisiana.\n\nIn terms\
      \ of US geography, Louisiana is west of Alabama. The Mississippi River generally\
      \ forms part of the border between these states (though not directly between\
      \ New Orleans and Troy).\n\nSince New Orleans is in Louisiana (which is west\
      \ of Alabama), and Troy is in Alabama (which is east of Louisiana), New Orleans\

      \ exact locations of these cities within their states, or about the relative\
      \ positions of the states themselves.\n\nLouisiana is definitely west of Alabama.\
      \ If you look at a map of the United States, you'll see that Louisiana is west\
      \ of Mississippi, and Mississippi is west of Alabama. So Louisiana is west of\
      \ Alabama.\n\nNew Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, close to the Gulf Coast.\
      \ Troy, Alabama is in the southeastern part of Alabama.\n\nGiven that Louisiana\

      So generally, locations in Alabama tend to be east of locations in Louisiana.\

      the geographical locations of two universities:

      1. Roseman University of Health Sciences in Nevada (NV)

      2. Adams State University in Colorado (CO)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Roseman University is located east of Adams
      State University.


      To solve this, I need to know the relative positions of these universities.
      Let me think about the relative positions of the states first, and then try
      to pinpoint the locations of these specific universities if needed.


      Nevada (NV) is located west of Colorado (CO) in the United States. Nevada borders
      California to its west and Utah to its east, while Colorado borders Utah to
      its west and Kansas to its east.


      Given that Colorado is east of Nevada on a map of the United States, it''s likely
      that Adams State University in Colorado would be east of Roseman University
      in Nevada.


      However, I should verify this by checking the specific locations of these universities
      within their respective states. It''s possible (though unlikely) that Roseman
      could be at the far eastern edge of Nevada while Adams State could be at the
      far western edge of Colorado, which might change the answer.


      Roseman University of Health Sciences is located in Henderson, Nevada, which
      is in the southern part of Nevada near Las Vegas.


      Adams State University is located in Alamosa, Colorado, which is in the south-central
      part of Colorado.


      Given that Colorado as a whole is east of Nevada, and considering the specific
      locations of these universities within their respective states (Henderson in
      southern Nevada and Alamosa in south-central Colorado), it''s clear that Adams
      State University is east of Roseman University.


      So, the answer to the question "Is Roseman University of Health Sciences, NV
      located east of Adams State University, CO?" is NO. Roseman University is located
      WEST of Adams State University, not east.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if Roseman University of Health Sciences (Nevada) is east of Adams
      State University (Colorado), I need to consider the geographical positions of
      these states and universities.


      ## Step 1: Consider the states'' positions

      Nevada is located west of Colorado on the US map. Nevada shares its eastern
      border with Utah, while Colorado is further east, sharing its western border
      with Utah.


      ## Step 2: Identify specific university locations

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Henderson, Nevada, which is in
      the southern part of Nevada near Las Vegas

      - Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado, which is in south-central
      Colorado


      ## Step 3: Compare the locations

      Since Nevada is entirely west of Colorado on the map of the United States, any
      location in Nevada (including Henderson) would be west of locations in Colorado
      (including Alamosa).


      Therefore, Roseman University of Health Sciences in Nevada is west of Adams
      State University in Colorado, not east.

      To answer this question, I need to consider the relative geographic locations
      of these two universities. In the United States, Nevada is located to the west
      of Colorado. Nevada borders California to the west, Oregon and Idaho to the

      - Colorado is positioned east of Nevada


      Since Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada and Adams State University
      is in Colorado, and Nevada is west of Colorado, it follows that Roseman University

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Nevada and Colorado.

      - Nevada is located to the west of Colorado on the US map

      to:

      1. Find the location of Purdue University Calumet, IN (Indiana)

      2. Find the location of Widener University, DE (Delaware)

      3. Determine which one is further east


      Let me think about the locations of these universities:


      Purdue University Calumet would be in Calumet, Indiana. Indiana is in the Midwest
      of the United States.


      Widener University in Delaware would be located in Delaware, which is on the
      East Coast of the United States.


      Generally speaking, states on the East Coast (like Delaware) are east of Midwestern
      states (like Indiana). So my initial thinking is that Widener University in
      Delaware would be east of Purdue University Calumet in Indiana.


      But let me be more precise about their locations:


      Purdue University Calumet (now actually called Purdue University Northwest)
      is located in Hammond, Indiana, near the Calumet region. Hammond, Indiana is
      in the northwestern part of Indiana, near Chicago, Illinois.


      Widener University is located in Chester, Pennsylvania (not Delaware as stated
      in the question). But if we assume there''s a Widener University campus in Delaware,
      Delaware is still on the East Coast, east of Indiana.


      If we consider the actual locations:

      - Hammond, Indiana (Purdue Calumet) is in the northwestern part of Indiana

      - Chester, Pennsylvania (Widener University) is on the eastern edge of Pennsylvania,
      near the border with New Jersey and Delaware


      So Widener University would definitely be east of Purdue University Calumet.


      Wait, I need to double-check if Widener University is in Delaware or Pennsylvania.
      Let me confirm...


      Widener University''s main campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania. There appears
      to be a Widener University School of Law campus in Wilmington, Delaware. Both
      Pennsylvania and Delaware are on the East Coast and would be east of Indiana.


      So regardless of which Widener campus we''re referring to, Widener University
      (either in Pennsylvania or Delaware) is east of Purdue University Calumet in
      Indiana.


      So the answer is NO - Purdue University Calumet is NOT east of Widener University.
      Rather, Widener University is east of Purdue University Calumet.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      To determine if Purdue University Calumet, IN is east of Widener University,
      DE, I need to identify the geographic locations of both universities and compare
      their positions on a west-east axis.


      Step 1: Locate Purdue University Calumet, Indiana

      - Purdue University Calumet (now part of Purdue University Northwest) is located
      in Hammond, Indiana

      - Indiana is a Midwestern state


      Step 2: Locate Widener University, Delaware

      - Widener University has a campus in Wilmington, Delaware

      - Delaware is an East Coast state


      Step 3: Compare their geographical positions

      - Indiana is significantly west of Delaware

      - The Midwestern states are west of the Eastern Seaboard states

      - Looking at a US map, Delaware''s eastern border is on the Atlantic Ocean,
      while Indiana is several states away from the East Coast


      Step 4: Make the east-west determination

      - Widener University in Delaware is clearly east of Purdue University Calumet
      in Indiana, not the other way around

      2. Determine their relative east-west positioning\n3. Conclude whether Purdue\
      \ University Calumet is east of Widener University\n\nLet's start:\n\nPurdue\
      \ University Calumet is in Indiana (IN). More specifically, I believe it's located\
      \ in Hammond, Indiana, which is in the northwestern corner of Indiana, near\
      \ Chicago, Illinois.\n\nWidener University is in Delaware (DE). I believe it's\
      \ located in Chester, Pennsylvania, which is just outside of Philadelphia near\
      \ the Delaware state border. (There appears to be a discrepancy here as the\
      \ question says DE for Delaware, but I believe Widener is actually in Pennsylvania,\
      \ though very close to Delaware).\n\nNow I need to determine which is further\
      \ east. In the United States:\n- States on the East Coast are the easternmost\n\
      - As you move west, you encounter the Midwest states (which include Indiana)\n\
      - Delaware is on the East Coast\n- Indiana is in the Midwest\n\nLooking at their\
      \ geographical positions:\n- Delaware is located on the East Coast of the United\
      \ States, approximately at longitude 75\xB0 W\n- Indiana is in the Midwest,\
      \ approximately at longitude 86\xB0 W (and northwestern Indiana, where Purdue\
      \ Calumet is, would be around 87\xB0 W)\n\nSince smaller western longitude numbers\
      \ indicate more eastern positions in the United States, Delaware (and Pennsylvania\
      \ which borders it) is east of Indiana.\n\nTherefore, Purdue University Calumet\
      \ in Indiana is located WEST of Widener University in Delaware (or Pennsylvania),\
      \ not east of it.\n\nActually, let me make sure about the exact locations:\n\
      \n1. Purdue University Calumet is now called Purdue University Northwest, and\

      \ in Chester, Pennsylvania, which is near the Pennsylvania-Delaware border.\
      \ The question says \"Widener University, DE\" which suggests it's in Delaware,\

      \ framing, I'll proceed with the understanding that we're referring to Widener\
      \ University and it's being identified as being in Delaware (whether accurately\
      \ or not).\n\nThe key point is the east-west relationship. Pennsylvania and\
      \ Delaware are both on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Indiana\
      \ is in the Midwest. \n\nU.S. states roughly from east to west in this region\
      \ would be:\nDelaware/Pennsylvania (East Coast) \u2192 Ohio \u2192 Indiana (Midwest)\n\
      \nThis confirms that Purdue University Calumet in Indiana is west of Widener\
      \ University in Pennsylvania/Delaware.\n\nSo the answer is NO, Purdue University\
      \ Calumet is NOT located east of Widener University.\n\nActually, before providing\
      \ a definitive answer, let me verify the exact locations of these universities\
      \ to be certain:\n\nPurdue University Calumet (now part of Purdue University\
      \ Northwest) is in Hammond, Indiana, which is in the northwestern corner of\
      \ Indiana.\n\nWidener University is indeed in Chester, Pennsylvania, which is\
      \ in Delaware County, PA (which might explain the DE reference, although it\
      \ could also be an error in the question).\n\nThe approximate longitudes would\
      \ be:\n- Hammond, IN: around 87.5\xB0 W\n- Chester, PA: around 75.4\xB0 W\n\n\
      Since a smaller western longitude number indicates a more eastern location,\
      \ Chester (where Widener is) is east of Hammond (where Purdue Calumet is). \n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is NO, Purdue University Calumet is NOT east of Widener\

      The eastern states like Delaware are further east than midwestern states like\

      \ Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine if Purdue University Calumet, IN is\

      2) Widener University is located in Delaware (DE), a state on the East Coast\

      \ believe it's in Hammond, Indiana, which is in the northwestern part of Indiana\
      \ near Chicago. Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States.\n\nWidener\
      \ University is in Delaware (DE). I believe it's in Chester, Pennsylvania, which\

      \ States broadly runs with the east coast being the easternmost part and the\
      \ west coast being the westernmost part. The Midwest (including Indiana) is\
      \ west of the East Coast (including Delaware).\n\nSo geographically:\n- Indiana\
      \ is west of Delaware\n- Therefore, Purdue University Calumet (in Indiana) is\
      \ west of Widener University (in Delaware)\n\nSo Purdue University Calumet is\
      \ NOT east of Widener University. It's actually west of it.\n\nActually, I need\
      \ to double-check something. The question mentions \"Widener University, DE\"\
      \ but I recalled it being in Chester, Pennsylvania. Let me verify the location\
      \ of Widener University.\n\nWidener University's main campus is indeed in Chester,\
      \ Pennsylvania, just outside of Philadelphia. It's not in Delaware. However,\
      \ Widener University does have a satellite campus in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\
      \nGiven the question specifies \"Widener University, DE\", I'll assume it's\
      \ referring to the Delaware campus.\n\nRegardless, both Pennsylvania and Delaware\
      \ are on the east coast and are east of Indiana, so my conclusion remains the\
      \ same: Purdue University Calumet (in Indiana) is west of Widener University\
      \ (whether in Pennsylvania or Delaware).\n\nActually, I notice something else\
      \ I should verify. The question mentions \"Purdue University Calumet,\" which\
      \ may be a regional campus of Purdue University. Let me verify its location.\n\
      \nPurdue University Calumet was a regional campus of the Purdue University system\
      \ located in Hammond, Indiana. It has since merged with Purdue University North\
      \ Central to form Purdue University Northwest. Hammond, Indiana is in the northwestern\
      \ corner of Indiana, near Chicago.\n\nSo my reasoning stands: \n- Purdue University\
      \ Calumet is in Hammond, Indiana, in the Midwest\n- Widener University (whether\
      \ the main campus in Pennsylvania or a campus in Delaware) is on the East Coast\n\
      - The East Coast is east of the Midwest\n- Therefore, Purdue University Calumet\
      \ is west of Widener University, not east of it\n\nSo the answer is NO, Purdue\
      \ University Calumet, IN is not located east of Widener University, DE.\n\n\
      Actually, let me be even more precise by looking at the approximate longitudes\
      \ of these locations:\n\nHammond, Indiana (where Purdue University Calumet is/was\
      \ located) is at approximately 87.5\xB0 W longitude.\n\nWilmington, Delaware\
      \ (where Widener University's Delaware campus is presumably located) is at approximately\
      \ 75.5\xB0 W longitude.\n\nSince 87.5\xB0 W is further west than 75.5\xB0 W\
      \ (i.e., 87.5 > 75.5 for western longitudes), this confirms that Purdue University\
      \ Calumet is west of Widener University Delaware, not east of it.\n\nSo the\
      \ final answer is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine if Purdue\
      \ University Calumet, IN is east of Widener University, DE, I need to identify\

      Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana (IN). Indiana is in the Midwest region\
      \ of the United States.\n\nWidener University is in Delaware (DE). Delaware\
      \ is on the East Coast of the United States.\n\nGenerally speaking, states on\
      \ the East Coast (like Delaware) are east of Midwestern states (like Indiana).\
      \ This means that Delaware is east of Indiana.\n\nIf Delaware is east of Indiana,\
      \ then Widener University in Delaware would be east of Purdue University Calumet\
      \ in Indiana. This means that Purdue University Calumet would NOT be east of\
      \ Widener University.\n\nSo, the answer would be NO.\n\nHowever, let me double-check\
      \ this by thinking about the actual locations of these universities a bit more\
      \ specifically.\n\nPurdue University Calumet is specifically in Hammond, Indiana,\
      \ which is in the northwestern part of Indiana, near Chicago, Illinois. This\
      \ is in the Midwest region of the United States.\n\nWidener University is in\
      \ Chester, Pennsylvania, which is a suburb of Philadelphia, near the Delaware\
      \ border. This is on the East Coast of the United States.\n\nSo Widener is on\
      \ the East Coast, and Purdue Calumet is in the Midwest.\n\nWait, I made an error.\
      \ I need to check the exact location of Widener University. I said it's in Delaware\
      \ (DE), but I then mentioned it's in Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\nLet me clarify:\
      \ Widener University is indeed in Chester, Pennsylvania (PA), not Delaware (DE).\
      \ The question has an error in it.\n\nGiven that Widener University is in Pennsylvania\
      \ on the East Coast and Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana in the Midwest,\
      \ Purdue University Calumet is still NOT east of Widener University.\n\nSo,\
      \ the answer would still be NO.\n\nActually, I should double-check if there's\
      \ a campus of Widener University in Delaware, since the question seems to indicate\
      \ this.\n\nBased on my knowledge, Widener University has its main campus in\
      \ Chester, Pennsylvania, and has a law school campus in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\
      \nGiven this information, if we're talking about Widener University's campus\
      \ in Delaware, then it's still on the East Coast, and Purdue University Calumet\
      \ in Indiana is still in the Midwest. So, Purdue University Calumet is still\
      \ NOT east of Widener University's Delaware campus.\n\nSo, the answer remains\
      \ NO.\n\nActually, I'm getting confused with the campuses. Let me try to be\
      \ more precise.\n\nPurdue University Calumet is located in Hammond, Indiana,\
      \ which is in the northwestern part of Indiana.\n\nWidener University's main\
      \ campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania, and it has a law school campus in Wilmington,\
      \ Delaware.\n\nRegardless of which campus of Widener University we're referring\
      \ to (the main one in Pennsylvania or the law school in Delaware), both are\
      \ on the East Coast of the United States, and are thus east of Purdue University\
      \ Calumet in Indiana, which is in the Midwest.\n\nSo, the answer is NO, Purdue\
      \ University Calumet, IN is NOT located east of Widener University, DE.\n\n\
      Actually, let me try one more time using longitude. The Earth is roughly speaking\
      \ a sphere, and we can identify locations on it using latitude and longitude.\
      \ Latitude tells us how far north or south a location is (with the equator at\
      \ 0\xB0, the North Pole at 90\xB0 North, and the South Pole at 90\xB0 South).\
      \ Longitude tells us how far east or west a location is (with the Prime Meridian\
      \ at 0\xB0, and degrees going East or West from there up to 180\xB0).\n\nWhen\
      \ we say one location in the US is \"east\" of another, we're typically referring\
      \ to their relative longitude. A location with a more positive (or less negative)\
      \ longitude is east of a location with a less positive (or more negative) longitude.\n\
      \nIn the United States, longitudes are all negative (west of the Prime Meridian,\
      \ which runs through Greenwich, London, UK). The East Coast has longitudes around\
      \ -75\xB0 to -70\xB0, while the Midwest has longitudes around -85\xB0 to -95\xB0\
      . So, a location on the East Coast has a less negative (or more positive) longitude\
      \ than a location in the Midwest, and is therefore east of it.\n\nHammond, Indiana\
      \ (where Purdue University Calumet is located) has a longitude of approximately\
      \ -87.5\xB0. \n\nChester, Pennsylvania (where Widener University's main campus\
      \ is located) has a longitude of approximately -75.4\xB0.\n\nWilmington, Delaware\
      \ (where Widener University's law school is located) has a longitude of approximately\
      \ -75.5\xB0.\n\nSince both of Widener's campuses have a less negative longitude\
      \ (approximately -75.4\xB0 or -75.5\xB0) than Purdue University Calumet (approximately\
      \ -87.5\xB0), both of Widener's campuses are east of Purdue University Calumet.\n\
      \nSo, the answer is NO, Purdue University Calumet, IN is NOT located east of\
      \ Widener University, DE.\n\nActually, let me do one more check. I'm not 100%\
      \ sure, but I think Purdue University Calumet was renamed to Purdue University\
      \ Northwest. If that's the case, the campus in question is likely in Hammond,\
      \ Indiana, which is indeed in the northwestern part of Indiana, near Chicago.\n\
      \nHammond, Indiana has a longitude of approximately -87.5\xB0. Chester, Pennsylvania\
      \ (where Widener University's main campus is) has a longitude of approximately\
      \ -75.4\xB0. Wilmington, Delaware (where Widener's law school is) has a longitude\
      \ of approximately -75.5\xB0.\n\nSince -87.5\xB0 is more negative than both\
      \ -75.4\xB0 and -75.5\xB0, Hammond is west of both Chester and Wilmington. Therefore,\
      \ Purdue University Calumet (in Hammond, Indiana) is west of both of Widener\
      \ University's campuses (in Chester, Pennsylvania and Wilmington, Delaware).\n\
      \nActually, let me just try once more. Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana\
      \ (IN), and Widener University is in Delaware (DE).\n\nIndiana (IN) is in the\
      \ Midwest region of the United States, and Delaware (DE) is on the East Coast.\n\
      \nGenerally, states on the East Coast (like Delaware) are east of Midwestern\
      \ states (like Indiana) in terms of their longitude.\n\nThe longitude of a location\
      \ in Indiana would typically be more negative (more western) than the longitude\
      \ of a location in Delaware.\n\nTherefore, Purdue University Calumet in Indiana\
      \ would be west of Widener University in Delaware, not east of it.\n\nSo, the\
      \ answer is NO, Purdue University Calumet, IN is NOT located east of Widener\
      \ University, DE.\n\nTo recap, I need to determine if Purdue University Calumet,\
      \ IN is east of Widener University, DE. \n\nPurdue University Calumet is in\
      \ Hammond, Indiana, which is in the northwestern part of Indiana. Indiana is\
      \ in the Midwest region of the United States.\n\nWidener University has its\
      \ main campus in Chester, Pennsylvania, and a law school campus in Wilmington,\
      \ Delaware. Both Pennsylvania and Delaware are on the East Coast of the United\
      \ States.\n\nIn the United States, locations on the East Coast (like those in\
      \ Delaware and Pennsylvania) are generally east of locations in the Midwest\
      \ (like those in Indiana).\n\nSpecifically, Hammond, Indiana has a longitude\
      \ of approximately -87.5\xB0, while Wilmington, Delaware has a longitude of\
      \ approximately -75.5\xB0. Since -75.5\xB0 is less negative (more positive)\
      \ than -87.5\xB0, Wilmington is east of Hammond.\n\nTherefore, Widener University\
      \ (whether we're referring to its main campus in Pennsylvania or its law school\
      \ in Delaware) is east of Purdue University Calumet. This means that Purdue\
      \ University Calumet is NOT east of Widener University.\n\nSo, the answer is\
      \ NO.\n\nActually, I see the problem in my reasoning. I misidentified the location\
      \ of Widener University in previous iterations.\n\nWidener University is primarily\
      \ located in Chester, Pennsylvania, not in Delaware. However, the question specifically\
      \ asks about 'Widener University, DE', which suggests it's referring to Widener's\
      \ law school campus in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nRegardless, both Chester, PA\
      \ and Wilmington, DE are on the East Coast, while Hammond, IN (where Purdue\
      \ University Calumet is located) is in the Midwest.\n\nGiven the geographical\
      \ layout of the United States, locations on the East Coast are east of locations\
      \ in the Midwest. Therefore, Widener University (whether in Chester, PA or Wilmington,\
      \ DE) is east of Purdue University Calumet.\n\nThis means that Purdue University\
      \ Calumet is NOT east of Widener University.\n\nSo, the answer is NO.\n\nI apologize\
      \ for the confusion earlier. I somehow managed to confuse myself with circular\
      \ and self-contradictory reasoning. Let's do one final, clean analysis.\n\n\
      Purdue University Calumet is located in Hammond, Indiana. Indiana is in the\
      \ Midwest of the United States, which is west of the East Coast, where Delaware\
      \ is located. \n\nDelaware, where Widener University (or at least the campus\
      \ the question is asking about) is located, is on the East Coast of the United\
      \ States, east of the Midwest, including Indiana.\n\nTherefore, Purdue University\
      \ Calumet is west of Widener University, not east of it. \n\nSo the answer to\

    c787ad94-b1b2-4a43-9809-4921eb7ec44d: "<think>This question is asking about the\
      \ relative locations of two universities: Purdue University Calumet in Indiana\
      \ (IN) and Widener University in Delaware (DE). Specifically, it's asking if\
      \ Purdue University Calumet is located east of Widener University.\n\nTo determine\
      \ the answer, I need to know the locations of both universities and compare\
      \ their east-west positions.\n\n1. Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana (IN).\
      \ Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States.\n\n2. Widener University\
      \ is in Delaware (DE). Delaware is on the East Coast of the United States.\n\
      \nGenerally speaking, states on the East Coast (like Delaware) are east of Midwestern\
      \ states (like Indiana).\n\nSo, if Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana,\
      \ which is to the west of Delaware, then Purdue University Calumet is west of\
      \ Widener University, not east of it.\n\nActually, let me be more precise about\
      \ the locations:\n\nPurdue University Calumet (now called Purdue University\
      \ Northwest) is in Hammond, Indiana. Hammond is in the northwestern part of\
      \ Indiana, near the Illinois border.\n\nWidener University is in Chester, Pennsylvania,\
      \ not Delaware. The question incorrectly states it's in DE (Delaware).\n\nLet's\
      \ correct this: Widener University is in Chester, Pennsylvania, which is near\
      \ the Delaware state border. Chester, PA is on the east coast of the United\
      \ States.\n\nRegardless of the state correction, the relative east-west positioning\
      \ remains the same. Pennsylvania is still east of Indiana on a map of the United\
      \ States.\n\nActually, I just realized it might be possible that there is another\
      \ campus of Widener University that is indeed in Delaware. Let me check...\n\
      \nUpon reflection, I believe Widener University does have a campus in Delaware,\
      \ specifically in Wilmington, Delaware. So the question might be referring to\
      \ Widener University's Delaware campus.\n\nRegardless, Delaware is still on\
      \ the East Coast, east of Indiana. So the relative positions remain the same.\n\
      \nTo verify, let's consider the approximate longitudes:\n\n- Indiana, including\
      \ Hammond where Purdue University Calumet is located, has longitudes around\
      \ 87\xB0 W.\n- Delaware, including Wilmington where Widener University might\
      \ have a campus, has longitudes around the 75\xB0 W.\n\nSince a smaller western\
      \ longitude means further east, Delaware (and Widener University) is east of\
      \ Indiana (and Purdue University Calumet).\n\nSo, is Purdue University Calumet,\
      \ IN located east of Widener University, DE?\n\nNo, Purdue University Calumet\
      \ is not located east of Widener University. It's the opposite: Widener University\
      \ is east of Purdue University Calumet.\n\nSo the answer is NO.\n\nOh wait,\
      \ I made an error. Let me check if Widener University indeed has a campus in\
      \ Delaware, since I previously was uncertain.\n\nWidener University's main campus\
      \ is in Chester, Pennsylvania. It does have additional campuses, but my knowledge\
      \ suggests these are also in Pennsylvania, specifically in Harrisburg and Exton.\
      \ I don't have definitive information about a Widener campus in Delaware.\n\n\
      However, for the purpose of this question, whether Widener is in Pennsylvania\
      \ or Delaware doesn't change the east-west relationship. Both Pennsylvania and\
      \ Delaware are on the East Coast and are east of Indiana.\n\nSo, the answer\
      \ remains: NO, Purdue University Calumet, IN is not located east of Widener\
      \ University, DE (or PA).\n\nActually, let me think one more time. I want to\
      \ make sure I'm addressing the question as asked.\n\nThe question states that\
      \ Widener University is in DE (Delaware). While I initially believed this might\
      \ be incorrect, I should answer the question as presented. The question is asking\
      \ if Purdue University Calumet, IN is east of Widener University, DE.\n\nGiven\
      \ the continental layout of the United States, Delaware is on the East Coast,\
      \ and Indiana is in the Midwest. This means that Delaware is east of Indiana.\
      \ Consequently, Widener University (in Delaware as stated in the question) would\
      \ be east of Purdue University Calumet (in Indiana).\n\nSo, is Purdue University\
      \ Calumet, IN located east of Widener University, DE?\n\nNo, Purdue University\
      \ Calumet, IN is not located east of Widener University, DE. It's the opposite:\
      \ Widener University, DE is east of Purdue University Calumet, IN. This is because\
      \ Delaware is east of Indiana in the United States.\n\nSo the answer is NO.\n\
      \nActually, the answer is a very clear \"NO\", because Indiana is in the Midwest\
      \ and Delaware is on the East Coast. The East Coast is east of the Midwest,\
      \ so Delaware is east of Indiana. Therefore, Widener University in Delaware\
      \ is east of Purdue University Calumet in Indiana, not the other way around.\n\
      \nSo the answer is NO.\n\nBut I'm not actually sure if Widener University has\
      \ a Delaware (DE) campus. Let me look it up...\n\nWidener University's main\
      \ campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania (PA), not Delaware (DE). It does have satellite\
      \ locations, but I'm not aware of a Delaware campus based on my knowledge.\n\
      \nHowever, the question states that Widener University is in DE, and to answer\
      \ the question as asked, I need to proceed with the information given. Whether\
      \ it's accurate or not, the question is asking about the east-west relationship\
      \ between Purdue University Calumet in Indiana and Widener University supposedly\
      \ in Delaware.\n\nDelaware is east of Indiana, so Widener University, as described\
      \ in the question as being in Delaware, would be east of Purdue University Calumet\
      \ in Indiana.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"Is Purdue University Calumet,\
      \ IN located east of Widener University, DE?\" is NO.\n\nActually, to be sure,\
      \ I'll determine the truth about Widener University one more time.\n\nWidener\
      \ University's main campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania. It also has campuses\
      \ in Harrisburg and Exton, Pennsylvania. I'm not aware of a Delaware campus,\
      \ but it's possible that there's one I don't know about, especially since Chester\
      \ is close to the Delaware border.\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, I'll note that\
      \ both Pennsylvania and Delaware are on the East Coast and are east of Indiana.\
      \ So, regardless of whether Widener University is in Pennsylvania or Delaware,\
      \ it's still east of Purdue University Calumet in Indiana.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ answer to the question \"Is Purdue University Calumet, IN located east of\
      \ Widener University, DE?\" is NO, because Purdue University Calumet is west\
      \ of Widener University, not east.\n\nActually, let me check if there's something\
      \ about Widener in Delaware. I see, according to my knowledge, Widener University\
      \ School of Law has a campus in Wilmington, Delaware. So, it's not incorrect\
      \ to talk about \"Widener University, DE.\"\n\nBut since I've already established\
      \ that Delaware is east of Indiana, the answer remains the same. Purdue University\
      \ Calumet, IN is not located east of Widener University, DE. It's located west\
      \ of it.\n\nSo the answer is NO.\n\nActually, wait, I think I've been making\
      \ an error. Purdue University Calumet (now Purdue University Northwest) is in\
      \ Hammond, Indiana, which is in the very northwestern part of Indiana, near\
      \ Chicago. Hammond is at approximately 87.5\xB0 W longitude.\n\nWidener University\
      \ does have a campus in Wilmington, Delaware, which is at approximately 75.5\xB0\
      \ W longitude.\n\nSince a smaller western longitude means further east, Delaware\
      \ (and Widener University's Delaware campus) is east of Indiana (and Purdue\
      \ University Calumet).\n\nSo, is Purdue University Calumet, IN located east\
      \ of Widener University, DE?\n\nNo, Purdue University Calumet is not located\
      \ east of Widener University, DE. It's the opposite: Widener University, DE\
      \ is east of Purdue University Calumet, IN.\n\nThe answer is NO.\n\nActually,\
      \ I think I'm confusing myself. Let me be more systematic in my approach.\n\n\
      The United States, when viewed on a map, has the East Coast (facing the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean) on the right (east) and the West Coast (facing the Pacific Ocean) on\
      \ the left (west).\n\nStates on the East Coast include Delaware, which is where\
      \ the question states Widener University is located. Midwestern states, including\
      \ Indiana, are west of the East Coast. Therefore, Delaware is east of Indiana.\n\
      \nIf Widener University is in Delaware and Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana,\
      \ then Widener University is east of Purdue University Calumet, not the other\
      \ way around.\n\nThe question asks, \"Is Purdue University Calumet, IN located\
      \ east of Widener University, DE?\" The answer is NO.\n\nIn other words, if\
      \ we're looking at a map of the United States, Delaware would be to the right\
      \ (east) of Indiana. This means Widener University, DE is to the right (east)\
      \ of Purdue University Calumet, IN, not the other way around.\n\nI realize that\
      \ I was second-guessing myself regarding whether Widener University has a campus\
      \ in Delaware. But that's not relevant to the question. The question states\
      \ that Widener University is in DE, so I should proceed with that information.\n\
      \nSo, the answer is NO, Purdue University Calumet, IN is not located east of\
      \ Widener University, DE. It's the opposite: Widener University, DE is east\
      \ of Purdue University Calumet, IN.\n\n(Actually, I think Widener University\
      \ School of Law might have had a campus in Wilmington, Delaware, but that's\
      \ not important for this question)</think># Reasoning Step by Step\n\nTo determine\
      \ if Purdue University Calumet, IN is east of Widener University, DE, I need\
      \ to consider the geographic locations of these two universities.\n\nStep 1:\
      \ Identify the locations of both universities.\n- Purdue University Calumet\
      \ (now part of Purdue University Northwest) is located in Hammond, Indiana (IN).\n\
      - Widener University has a campus in Delaware (DE).\n\nStep 2: Consider the\
      \ geographic positions of Indiana and Delaware within the United States.\n-\
      \ Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States.\n- Delaware\
      \ is located on the East Coast of the United States.\n\nStep 3: Compare the\
      \ east-west positioning.\n- On a U.S. map, the East Coast (including Delaware)\
      \ is to the east of the Midwest (including Indiana).\n- Indiana is roughly around\
      \ 86-87\xB0 W longitude.\n- Delaware is roughly around 75-76\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      - A smaller western longitude number indicates a more easterly position.\n\n\
      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these positions.\n- Delaware is east of Indiana.\n\
      - Therefore, Widener University in Delaware is east of Purdue University Calumet\
      \ in Indiana.\n- This means Purdue University Calumet is NOT east of Widener\
      \ University; it's west of it.\n\n# Answer: NO"

      \ the locations of these two universities.\n\nFirst, let me identify the locations:\n\
      \n1. Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana (IN). More specifically, the \"\
      Calumet\" in the name suggests it's in the Calumet region of Indiana, which\
      \ is in the northwestern part of the state, near Chicago. (I believe it's now\
      \ called Purdue University Northwest after a merger, but I'll focus on the Calumet\

      \ positions of these states:\n\n- Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United\
      \ States.\n- Delaware is on the East Coast of the United States.\n\nGiven the\
      \ general geography of the US, Delaware is located east of Indiana. The East\
      \ Coast states (including Delaware) are the easternmost states in the contiguous\
      \ US, while the Midwest states (including Indiana) are more centrally located.\n\
      \nSo, if Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana and Widener University is in\
      \ Delaware, then Widener University would be located east of Purdue University\
      \ Calumet, not the other way around.\n\nActually, let me double-check about\
      \ Widener University. I'm not entirely sure if it's in Delaware or another state.\
      \ Let me think...\n\nWidener University is indeed in Chester, Pennsylvania (PA),\
      \ which is right near the Pennsylvania-Delaware border. The DE in the question\
      \ might be referring to Delaware County, PA, where Chester is located, rather\
      \ than the state of Delaware.\n\nBut even if we're considering Widener University\
      \ to be in Pennsylvania rather than Delaware, Pennsylvania is still east of\
      \ Indiana. The East Coast states, including Pennsylvania, are east of the Midwest\
      \ states, including Indiana.\n\nSo, is Purdue University Calumet, IN located\
      \ east of Widener University, DE (or PA)? No, it's the opposite. Purdue University\
      \ Calumet, IN is located west of Widener University.\n\nAh, I need to be careful\
      \ about the exact phrasing of the question. Let me read it again:\n\n\"Is Purdue\
      \ University Calumet, IN located east of Widener University, DE?\"\n\nThe question\
      \ asks if Purdue University Calumet is east of Widener University, not the other\

      \ of Widener University; it's west of it.\n\nActually, let me reconsider my\
      \ understanding of the locations. \n\nPurdue University Calumet is in Hammond,\
      \ Indiana, which is in the northwestern part of Indiana.\n\nWidener University,\
      \ according to the question, is in DE, which I assume means Delaware (though\
      \ it's possible it could refer to Delaware County, Pennsylvania). Widener University\
      \ is actually in Chester, Pennsylvania, which is close to the Delaware border,\
      \ so there might be some confusion there.\n\nRegardless, the geography of the\
      \ United States places Indiana (and, by extension, Purdue University Calumet)\
      \ to the west of both Pennsylvania and Delaware. So, Purdue University Calumet\
      \ is not east of Widener University; it's west of it.\n\nSo, the answer to the\
      \ question \"Is Purdue University Calumet, IN located east of Widener University,\
      \ DE?\" is NO.\n\nBut I need to double-check my geography. The US states, from\
      \ west to east across the northern part of the country, go roughly: \n... (Midwest\
      \ states) ... Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, ...\n\nSo Indiana\
      \ is indeed west of Delaware, which means Purdue University Calumet (in Indiana)\
      \ is west of Widener University (in Delaware or potentially Pennsylvania), not\
      \ east of it.\n\nActually, let me just make absolutely sure that I have the\
      \ location of Widener University correct. According to my information, Widener\
      \ University's main campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania. However, the question\
      \ specifies \"Widener University, DE.\" It's possible there's a campus of Widener\
      \ in Delaware, or the question might be using DE to refer to Delaware County,\
      \ PA (where Chester is located).\n\nBut even if Widener University has a campus\
      \ in Delaware, both Pennsylvania and Delaware are east of Indiana. So, the conclusion\
      \ remains the same: Purdue University Calumet is west of Widener University,\
      \ not east of it.\n\nLet me quickly confirm the locations of these universities:\n\
      \n1. Purdue University Calumet (now part of Purdue University Northwest) is\
      \ in Hammond, Indiana, which is in the northwestern part of Indiana.\n\n2. Widener\
      \ University's main campus is in Chester, Pennsylvania. I'm not aware of a significant\
      \ campus in Delaware, but even if there is one, Delaware is also east of Indiana.\n\
      \nGiven these locations, and the geography of the United States, Purdue University\
      \ Calumet, IN is located to the west of Widener University (whether in DE or\
      \ PA), not to the east.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"Is Purdue University\
      \ Calumet, IN located east of Widener University, DE?\" is NO.\n\nActually,\
      \ let me try one more time to get a clearer understanding of where these universities\
      \ are.\n\n1. Purdue University Calumet is in Hammond, Indiana, which is in the\
      \ northwestern part of Indiana, near Chicago. \n\n2. Widener University is primarily\
      \ in Chester, Pennsylvania. It's possible there might be a campus or extension\
      \ in Delaware, but I'm not certain. However, both Pennsylvania and Delaware\
      \ are on the East Coast of the US and are east of Indiana.\n\nIf we look at\
      \ a map of the US, Indiana is located to the west of both Pennsylvania and Delaware.\
      \ This means that Purdue University Calumet, being in Indiana, is also to the\
      \ west of Widener University, regardless of whether it's in Pennsylvania or\
      \ Delaware.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"Is Purdue University Calumet,\
      \ IN located east of Widener University, DE?\" is NO.\n\nActually, I want to\
      \ check once more. Let's be precise about the locations:\n\n1. Purdue University\
      \ Calumet (Hammond, Indiana) is roughly at:\n   - Longitude: approximately 87.5\xB0\
      \ W\n   \n2. Widener University (Chester, Pennsylvania or potentially Delaware)\
      \ is roughly at:\n   - Longitude: approximately 75.4\xB0 W (if in Chester, PA)\n\
      \   - If in Delaware, it would be at a similar longitude, as Delaware is adjacent\
      \ to Pennsylvania.\n\nIn terms of longitude, a lower (less negative) western\
      \ longitude indicates a more easterly position. Since 75.4\xB0 W is a lower\
      \ number than 87.5\xB0 W, Widener University is to the east of Purdue University\
      \ Calumet, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question\
      \ \"Is Purdue University Calumet, IN located east of Widener University, DE?\"\
      \ is NO.\n\n(I should note that the exact longitudes I provided are approximate,\
      \ but the relationship\u2014with the East Coast being east of the Midwest\u2014\
      is correct.)\n\nWait, I think I was confused about Widener University being\
      \ in Delaware. I'm more sure now: Widener University's main campus is in Chester,\
      \ Pennsylvania. The \"DE\" in the question might refer to Delaware County, PA\
      \ (where Chester is located), or there might be a Widener campus in Delaware.\
      \ But it doesn't change the answer, since both Delaware and Pennsylvania are\
      \ east of Indiana.\n\nActually, let me search online briefly to see if there's\
      \ a campus of Widener University in Delaware.\n\nI believe Widener University\
      \ has a law school in Wilmington, Delaware. So, the \"DE\" in the question might\
      \ indeed be referring to the state of Delaware, specifically this law school\
      \ campus.\n\nWilmington, Delaware, is roughly at:\n- Longitude: approximately\
      \ 75.5\xB0 W\n\nThis is very close to the longitude of the main campus in Chester,\
      \ PA (about 75.4\xB0 W), but more importantly, both are to the east of Hammond,\
      \ Indiana (about 87.5\xB0 W).\n\nSo, regardless of which campus of Widener University\
      \ the question refers to, Purdue University Calumet is to the west of it, not\
      \ to the east.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is Purdue University\
      \ Calumet, IN located east of Widener University, DE?\" remains NO.\n\nIn terms\
      \ of general geography, Indiana (and, by extension, Purdue University Calumet)\
      \ is in the Midwest region of the US, while both Pennsylvania and Delaware (and,\
      \ by extension, Widener University, whether in PA or DE) are on or near the\

      - Kentucky is more in the eastern half of the contiguous United States.\n\n\
      Looking at the states from east to west, Kentucky is definitely east of Texas.\
      \ This means that institutions in Kentucky, including Morehead State University,\

      - Texas is located in the southern central United States\n- Kentucky is located\
      \ in the eastern central United States\n\n## Step 2: Compare their positions\
      \ on an east-west axis\n- Texas extends approximately from longitude 93\xB0\
      W to 106\xB0W\n- Kentucky extends approximately from longitude 82\xB0W to 89\xB0\
      W\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the longitude values\nLower longitude numbers (when\
      \ west) indicate more eastern positions. Since Kentucky's longitude range is\
      \ lower than Texas's range, Kentucky is east of Texas.\n\n## Step 4: Apply this\
      \ to the specific institutions\nSince Morehead State University is in Kentucky\
      \ and Texas A&M College of Geosciences is in Texas, the Kentucky institution\
