      \    *   USFSP: ~82.6\xB0 W\n    *   Bentley: ~71.2\xB0 W\n\n7.  **Understand\
      \ the relationship between longitude and east/west:** On a map, lines of longitude\
      \ run north-south. As you move *east*, the longitude value *decreases* (gets\
      \ closer to 0\xB0 at the Prime Meridian). As you move *west*, the longitude\
      \ value *increases* (gets further from 0\xB0).\n\n8.  **Apply the comparison\
      \ to the east/west question:**\n    *   USFSP is at ~82.6\xB0 W.\n    *   Bentley\
      \ is at ~71.2\xB0 W.\n    *   Since 82.6 is *greater* than 71.2, USFSP is located\
      \ further *west* than Bentley.\n    *   Therefore, Bentley is located *east*\
      \ of USFSP.\n\n9.  **Formulate the answer:** The question asks if USFSP is *east*\

      \ **Format the output:** First, present the step-by-step reasoning, and then\
      \ provide the final YES/NO answer clearly.\n\n**(Self-Correction/Refinement):**\
      \ Double-check the understanding of longitude and east/west. Yes, larger West\
      \ longitude numbers mean further west. So 82.6\xB0 W is indeed west of 71.2\xB0\
      \ W. The reasoning is sound. Ensure the final answer directly addresses the\

      5.  Compare the longitudes: 82.6\xB0 W (St. Petersburg) vs. 71.2\xB0 W (Waltham).\n\
      6.  Understand that smaller West longitude values are further East.\n7.  Since\
      \ 71.2 is smaller than 82.6, Waltham (and Bentley University) is located further\
      \ East than St. Petersburg (and USFSP).\n8.  Therefore, St. Petersburg (USFSP)\

      \ question: \"Is Texas Southern University, TX located east of Madonna University,\
      \ MI?\"\n\n1.  **Identify the key locations:** I need the locations of two universities:\n\
      \    *   Texas Southern University (TSU)\n    *   Madonna University (MU)\n\n\
      2.  **Determine the state for each university:**\n    *   TSU is in Texas (TX).\n\
      \    *   MU is in Michigan (MI).\n\n3.  **Determine the relative location of\
      \ the states:** I need to know if Texas is generally east or west of Michigan.\n\
      \    *   Michigan is in the Great Lakes region, roughly in the upper Midwest/Northeast\
      \ part of the US.\n    *   Texas is in the South-Central part of the US.\n \
      \   *   Looking at a map of the US, Michigan is significantly further east than\
      \ Texas.\n\n4.  **Consider the specific locations within the states (Optional\
      \ but helpful for confirmation):**\n    *   TSU is in Houston, TX.\n    *  \
      \ MU is in Livonia, MI (a suburb of Detroit).\n    *   Houston is in eastern\
      \ Texas, but Texas itself is a large state located well to the west of the bulk\
      \ of the eastern US.\n    *   Livonia/Detroit is in southeastern Michigan, which\
      \ is relatively far east compared to the rest of the US (especially compared\
      \ to Texas).\n\n5.  **Formulate the comparison:** The question asks if TSU (Texas)\
      \ is *east* of MU (Michigan). Since Michigan is located significantly *east*\
      \ of Texas, Texas must be located *west* of Michigan.\n\n6.  **Reach the conclusion:**\
      \ Texas Southern University (in Texas) is located *west* of Madonna University\
      \ (in Michigan). Therefore, TSU is *not* located east of MU.\n\n7.  **Provide\
      \ the final answer:** Based on the conclusion, the answer is NO.\n\n**Final\
      \ Answer Derivation:**\n*   TSU is in Texas.\n*   MU is in Michigan.\n*   Michigan\
      \ is geographically east of Texas.\n*   Therefore, Texas is geographically west\
      \ of Michigan.\n*   The question is: Is Texas Southern University (Texas) east\
      \ of Madonna University (Michigan)?\n*   Since Texas is west of Michigan, the\

      \ thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify the two locations:** University of Texas\
      \ at San Antonio (UTSA) is in San Antonio, Texas. Benedictine University is\
      \ in Lisle, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago).\n2.  **Determine the general geographic\
      \ position of each city:**\n    *   San Antonio, TX is in the southern part\
      \ of the United States.\n    *   Lisle, IL is in the northern part of the United\
      \ States, in the Midwest.\n3.  **Consider the relative East-West positions:**\
      \ To determine if one is east of the other, we need to think about their longitudes.\n\
      \    *   San Antonio, TX is located roughly around 98.5\xB0 West longitude.\n\
      \    *   Lisle, IL is located roughly around 88.1\xB0 West longitude.\n4.  **Compare\
      \ the longitudes:** A location with a smaller West longitude number is further\
      \ East than a location with a larger West longitude number.\n    *   88.1\xB0\
      \ W is smaller than 98.5\xB0 W.\n    *   Therefore, Lisle, IL is located East\
      \ of San Antonio, TX.\n5.  **Answer the specific question:** The question is\
      \ \"Is University of Texas at San Antonio, TX located east of Benedictine University,\
      \ IL?\". Since San Antonio (98.5\xB0 W) is west of Lisle (88.1\xB0 W), the answer\
      \ is no.\n\nNO"

      \ Meridian (0\xB0). Therefore, a *smaller* west longitude value means the location\
      \ is *further east*.\n7.  **Compare the longitudes:** 79.4\xB0 W (Laurinburg,\
      \ NC) is a larger absolute value than 75.1\xB0 W (Oneonta, NY). This means Laurinburg,\
      \ NC is *further west* than Oneonta, NY.\n8.  **Formulate the answer based on\
      \ the comparison:** Since Laurinburg, NC is west of Oneonta, NY, St. Andrews\
      \ University, NC is *not* located east of State University of New York at Oneonta,\
      \ NY.\n9.  **Final Answer Check:** The question asks \"Is St. Andrews University,\
      \ NC located east of State University of New York at Oneonta, NY?\". My analysis\

      3.  To determine east/west, compare longitudes.\n4.  Laurinburg, NC is approximately\
      \ 79.4\xB0 W longitude.\n5.  Oneonta, NY is approximately 75.1\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      6.  A smaller west longitude means a location is further east.\n7.  75.1\xB0\
      \ W is smaller than 79.4\xB0 W.\n8.  Therefore, Oneonta, NY is east of Laurinburg,\
      \ NC.\n9.  This means Laurinburg, NC is west of Oneonta, NY.\n10. The question\
      \ asks if Laurinburg, NC is *east* of Oneonta, NY. The answer is no.\n\n**Final\
      \ Answer:** Based on the longitude comparison, Laurinburg, NC (where St. Andrews\
      \ University is) is west of Oneonta, NY (where SUNY Oneonta is). Therefore,\

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to determine the approximate geographic
      location of Reinhardt University, GA and Keuka College, NY.

      2.  **Locate Reinhardt University, GA:** Reinhardt University is in Waleska,
      Georgia. Georgia is in the southeastern United States.

      3.  **Locate Keuka College, NY:** Keuka College is in Keuka Park, New York.
      New York is in the northeastern United States.

      4.  **Compare the relative positions:** We need to determine if Waleska, GA
      is located east of Keuka Park, NY.

      5.  **Consider the overall geography:** Georgia is located significantly south
      and generally west of New York state. While specific points within each state
      matter, overall, Georgia is southwest of New York.

      6.  **Refine the comparison (optional but helpful):** To be more precise, consider
      the longitude. Keuka Park, NY is roughly around 77 degrees West longitude. Waleska,
      GA is roughly around 84 degrees West longitude. A higher West longitude means
      the location is further west.

      7.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since 84 degrees West is further west than
      77 degrees West, Waleska, GA is located *west* of Keuka Park, NY.


      Therefore, Reinhardt University, GA is located west of Keuka College, NY, not

      \ 80\xB0 West is further east (less negative on a standard scale, or closer\

      \ Dunwoody College (Minneapolis) is at ~93\xB0 W, and Franciscan University\

      \n2.  **Identify the key locations:**\n    *   Purdue University Calumet, IN\
      \ (Note: This campus is now part of Purdue University Northwest, specifically\
      \ the Hammond, IN campus).\n    *   Widener University, DE (The main campus\
      \ is in Chester, PA, but it has a Delaware campus, which is likely what the\
      \ question refers to, or the question might be slightly imprecise about \"Widener\
      \ University, DE\" meaning the institution which has a presence in DE). For\
      \ geographic comparison, I'll use the location of the Delaware campus or the\
      \ main Chester, PA campus, as they are geographically close and both clearly\
      \ *east* of Indiana. The main campus in Chester, PA is a good reference point.\n\
      \n3.  **Determine the states involved:**\n    *   Purdue University Calumet\
      \ is in Indiana (IN).\n    *   Widener University is in Delaware (DE) and Pennsylvania\
      \ (PA).\n\n4.  **Visualize the geography of the United States:** I need to have\
      \ a general idea of the relative positions of Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.\n\
      \    *   Indiana is in the Midwest.\n    *   Pennsylvania and Delaware are on\
      \ the East Coast.\n\n5.  **Determine the relative east-west position of the\
      \ states:** On a map of the US:\n    *   The East Coast states (like PA and\
      \ DE) are significantly further east than the Midwest states (like IN).\n\n\
      6.  **Confirm the specific locations within the states:**\n    *   Purdue University\
      \ Calumet (now PNW Hammond Campus) is near the border with Illinois, in northwestern\
      \ Indiana. This is still firmly in the Midwest.\n    *   Widener University's\
      \ main campus is in Chester, PA, just south of Philadelphia. Widener's Delaware\
      \ campus is in Wilmington, DE. Both are on or very near the East Coast.\n\n\
      7.  **Compare the longitudinal positions:** Since Indiana is a Midwest state\
      \ and Pennsylvania/Delaware are East Coast states, any point in Indiana will\
      \ be *west* of any point in Pennsylvania or Delaware.\n\n8.  **Formulate the\
      \ conclusion based on the comparison:** Purdue University Calumet, IN is located\
      \ significantly *west* of Widener University, DE. Therefore, it is *not* located\
      \ east of Widener University, DE.\n\n9.  **Check the question format:** The\
      \ question requires a \"YES\" or \"NO\" answer.\n\n10. **Final Answer:** Based\
      \ on the conclusion, the answer is NO.\n\nSelf-Correction/Refinement: Initially,\
      \ I might just think \"East Coast is east of the Midwest, so no.\" But to ensure\
      \ accuracy, I quickly confirm the specific states and their general regions.\
      \ I also consider the possibility of imprecise naming (Widener DE vs. Widener\
      \ main campus), but since both are far east of Indiana, the conclusion holds\
      \ regardless. The key is the state-level geographic relationship."

      \    *   Location 1: Purdue University Calumet, IN.\n    *   Location 2: Widener\

      \    *   Indiana (IN) is a Midwestern state.\n    *   Delaware (DE) is a Mid-Atlantic\
      \ state on the East Coast.\n\n4.  **Visualize or recall the relative position\
      \ of Indiana and Delaware on a map of the US:** Indiana is significantly further\
      \ west than Delaware. Delaware is on the eastern seaboard, while Indiana is\
      \ inland, closer to the center of the country (though still in the eastern half).\n\
      \n5.  **Consider the specific locations within the states:**\n    *   Purdue\

      \ isn't strictly necessary if the states' relative positions are clear, thinking\
      \ in terms of longitude confirms the visual. Indiana is at roughly 84-88 degrees\
      \ West longitude. Delaware is at roughly 75-76 degrees West longitude. A smaller\
      \ West longitude number means further east.\n\n7.  **Formulate the comparison:**\

      \ point in Delaware will be east of any point in Indiana (with very minor potential\
      \ edge cases near state borders, but not relevant given the states' positions).\

      \ location of Indiana (IN) and Delaware (DE) within the United States. Indiana\
      \ is a Midwestern state, while Delaware is a Mid-Atlantic state on the East\
      \ Coast.\nStep 3: Visualize or know the relative east-west positions of Indiana\
      \ and Delaware. Delaware is located significantly further east than Indiana.\n\
      Step 4: Consider the specific locations of the universities within their states\

      \ Calumet is in NW Indiana. Widener has campuses in PA and DE (Wilmington).\
      \ Both are generally located within their states' overall east-west ranges.\n\
      Step 5: Conclude that since Delaware is east of Indiana, Widener University\
      \ in Delaware must be located east of Purdue University Calumet in Indiana.\n\
      Step 6: Rephrase the original question: \"Is Purdue University Calumet, IN located\

      \ relative positions of Texas A&M College of Geosciences, TX and Morehead State\
      \ University, KY.\n2.  **Determine the states:** Texas A&M is in Texas (TX).\
      \ Morehead State University is in Kentucky (KY).\n3.  **Recall/Look up the general\
      \ location of the states:**\n    *   Texas is a large state in the southern/southwestern\
      \ US. Its longitude is generally west.\n    *   Kentucky is a state in the southeastern\
      \ US. Its longitude is generally further east than Texas.\n4.  **Consider the\
      \ specific locations within the states:** While the question specifies \"College\
      \ of Geosciences\" at Texas A&M and \"Morehead State University,\" the *city*\
      \ or *campus* location is what matters for geographical position.\n    *   Texas\
      \ A&M University is in College Station, TX.\n    *   Morehead State University\
      \ is in Morehead, KY.\n5.  **Compare the longitudes:** Mentally (or by looking\
      \ at a map/coordinates), compare the locations of College Station, TX and Morehead,\
      \ KY.\n    *   College Station, TX is located around 96\xB0 W longitude.\n \
      \   *   Morehead, KY is located around 83\xB0 W longitude.\n6.  **Determine\
      \ the east/west relationship:** A lower degree of West longitude means the location\
      \ is further *east*.\n    *   83\xB0 W (Morehead, KY) is less than 96\xB0 W\
      \ (College Station, TX).\n    *   Therefore, Morehead, KY is geographically\
      \ east of College Station, TX.\n7.  **Formulate the answer to the specific question:**\
      \ The question asks if Texas A&M College of Geosciences (in College Station,\
      \ TX) is located *east* of Morehead State University (in Morehead, KY). Based\
      \ on the longitude comparison, College Station is west of Morehead.\n8.  **Final\
      \ check against the question:** The question asks \"Is Texas A&M College of\
      \ Geosciences, TX located east of Morehead State University, KY?\". The answer\
      \ is no, it's located west.\n\n9.  **Provide the YES/NO answer:** Since the\
      \ answer is no, the final output should be NO.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\
      \n1.  Identify the locations: Texas A&M (College Station, TX) and Morehead State\
      \ University (Morehead, KY).\n2.  Determine the longitude of College Station,\
      \ TX (approx. 96\xB0 W).\n3.  Determine the longitude of Morehead, KY (approx.\
      \ 83\xB0 W).\n4.  Compare the longitudes: 96\xB0 W is further west than 83\xB0\
      \ W.\n5.  Therefore, College Station, TX is west of Morehead, KY.\n6.  The question\
      \ asks if College Station, TX is *east* of Morehead, KY.\n7.  The answer is\
      \ no.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nNO"

      \   Texas A&M College of Geosciences, TX (specifically College Station, TX)\n\
      \    *   Morehead State University, KY (specifically Morehead, KY)\n\n2.  **Determine\
      \ the approximate longitude of each location:**\n    *   College Station, TX\
      \ is in Central Time Zone, roughly around 96\xB0 W longitude.\n    *   Morehead,\
      \ KY is in Eastern Time Zone, roughly around 83\xB0 W longitude.\n\n3.  **Compare\
      \ the longitudes:**\n    *   96\xB0 W is west of 83\xB0 W.\n\n4.  **Relate longitude\
      \ to east/west direction:**\n    *   Locations with smaller W longitude values\
      \ are further east.\n    *   Locations with larger W longitude values are further\
      \ west.\n\n5.  **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:** Since College\
      \ Station, TX (96\xB0 W) has a larger W longitude than Morehead, KY (83\xB0\
      \ W), College Station is west of Morehead. The question asks if Texas A&M is\
      \ *east* of Morehead State.\n\n6.  **Final conclusion:** Texas A&M is west of\
      \ Morehead State, not east.\n\nNO"
