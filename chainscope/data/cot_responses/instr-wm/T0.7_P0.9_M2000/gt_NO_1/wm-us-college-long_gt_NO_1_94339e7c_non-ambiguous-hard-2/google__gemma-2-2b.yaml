      Yes, it is possible to determine whether a university is located east or west
      of another university by using the map of the United States.


      The first step is to locate both universities on the map. To do this, you can
      use a map of the United States or an online map service.


      Once both universities are located, you can use a compass to determine the direction
      of each university.


      The direction of a university is determined by the cardinal directions: north,
      south, east, and west.


      For example, if University A is located in the north-west corner of the United
      States, and University B is located in the south-east corner of the United States,
      then University A is located east of University B.


      To determine the direction of a university, you can use a compass. A compass
      is a device that can be used to determine the direction of a point on a map.


      To use a compass, you need to orient it so that the needle points to the north.
      Then, you can use the compass to determine the direction of a university by
      following the directions of the compass.


      Once you have determined the direction of a university, you can use this information
      to answer questions about the location of universities in the United States.


      For example, you can use the direction of a university to determine whether
      a university is located east or west of another university.
