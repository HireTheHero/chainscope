      (including University Park) are significantly east of Tulsa.


      Therefore, based on their locations:


      - Clary Sage College (Tulsa, OK) is west of Governors State University (University
      Park, IL).


      So, the answer is **NO**, Clary Sage College is not located east of Governors
      State University.'

      Texas.


      2. **Locate Morehead State University, KY**: Morehead State University is located
      in Morehead, Kentucky. Morehead is in the northeastern part of Kentucky.


      3. **Compare the longitudes**: Generally, Texas is located west of Kentucky.
      More specifically, College Station, TX, is west of Morehead, KY.


      Based on these steps, Texas A&M College of Geosciences, TX is located west of
      Morehead State University, KY.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'
