      I need to determine the relative locations of two institutions:

      1. Whitacre College of Engineering in Texas (TX)

      2. Graceland University in Iowa (IA)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Whitacre is east of Graceland.


      First, let me identify more precisely where these institutions are located:


      Whitacre College of Engineering is part of Texas Tech University, which is located
      in Lubbock, Texas. Lubbock is in the northwestern part of Texas.


      Graceland University is located in Lamoni, Iowa. Iowa is north of Texas.


      Now I need to determine their east-west relationship. Let me think about the
      general geography:

      - Texas is generally west of Iowa in the United States

      - Lubbock is in western Texas, which puts it even further west

      - Iowa is in the Midwest region of the US


      Even though I don''t know the exact longitude coordinates, I can reasonably
      conclude that Whitacre College of Engineering in Lubbock, Texas would be WEST
      of Graceland University in Iowa, not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think># Is Whitacre College of Engineering, TX

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Whitacre College of Engineering is part of Texas Tech University in Lubbock,
      Texas (TX).

      - Graceland University is located in Lamoni, Iowa (IA).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Iowa.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States.

      - Iowa is located in the midwestern United States, north of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Lubbock, Texas is in the western part of Texas.

      - Iowa is generally located to the east of western Texas.

      - On a map of the United States, Lubbock, TX is farther west than Lamoni, IA.


      Therefore, Whitacre College of Engineering in TX is NOT east of Graceland University
      in IA, but rather west of it.

      I need to determine if Aurora University is located east of the University of
      Findlay. Let me think about the relative positions of Illinois and Ohio:


      - Illinois (IL) is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Ohio (OH) is also located in the Midwest region, but it''s positioned to the
      east of Illinois.


      Generally speaking, Ohio is east of Illinois. But I need to check the specific

      Aurora University is in Aurora, Illinois, which is in the northeastern part
      of Illinois.

      The University of Findlay is in Findlay, Ohio, which is in the northwestern
      part of Ohio.

      Ohio is east of Illinois.

      - Aurora University is in Aurora, Illinois (IL)

      - University of Findlay is in Findlay, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the general geography of Illinois and Ohio.

      Illinois is west of Ohio. In the United States, states generally become more

      to determine the relative geographical positions of Purdue University Fort Wayne
      in Indiana and Kean University in New Jersey.


      1. Purdue University Fort Wayne is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN).

      2. Kean University is located in New Jersey (NJ).


      To determine which is more easterly, I need to consider their positions on the
      U.S. map.


      United States geography generally has:

      - Eastern states along the Atlantic coast (including New Jersey)

      - Midwestern states in the central part of the country (including Indiana)


      New Jersey is on the eastern seaboard of the United States, while Indiana is
      in the Midwest.


      Indiana is west of New Jersey.

      Fort Wayne, IN would be west of any location in New Jersey.


      Therefore, Purdue University Fort Wayne (in Indiana) is NOT east of Kean University
      (in New Jersey). Rather, it is west of Kean University.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Purdue University Fort Wayne is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN)

      - Kean University is located in New Jersey (NJ)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Indiana and New Jersey.

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New Jersey is on the East Coast along the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - States on the East Coast (like New Jersey) are generally further east than
      Midwestern states (like Indiana)

      - Indiana is significantly west of New Jersey on the U.S. map


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Indiana is west of New Jersey, Purdue University Fort Wayne must be
      west of Kean University, not east of it


      NO'

      To answer this, I need to know the relative geographic positions of DC and Massachusetts.


      The eastern United States generally follows this pattern from west to east:

      - Midwest states

      - Appalachian region

      - Mid-Atlantic states (including DC)

      - New England states (including Massachusetts)


      Massachusetts is in New England, which is the northeastern part of the United

      On a map of the US east coast, Massachusetts is clearly northeast of DC. That
      means DC is southwest of Massachusetts.


      If you''re asking about east-west positioning specifically, Massachusetts is
      east of DC. This means that Middlesex University in MA would be east of George

      Let me think about US geography:

      - Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Florida is in the Southeast


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Michigan is roughly in the middle-eastern part of the US

      city

      - Full Sail University is in Florida, which I believe is in the Orlando area


      Looking at the US map mentally, Florida is generally east of Michigan. Orlando,
      FL would be further east than any location in Michigan.

      Arkansas is in the south-central United States.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - North Dakota is generally west of Arkansas


      More specifically, Williston is located in western North Dakota, while Paragould
      is in northeastern Arkansas.

      - North Dakota lies significantly west of Arkansas on the US map

      - Williston is in the western part of North Dakota, making it even further west

      - Paragould is in the northeastern part of Arkansas


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since North Dakota is west of Arkansas on the US map, Williston State College

      First, let me establish where these two states are:

      - North Dakota (ND) is in the northern United States, bordering Canada

      - Arkansas (AR) is in the southern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      Arkansas is in the Central time zone.


      Specifically for these cities:

      - Williston is in the western part of North Dakota

      - Paragould is in northeastern Arkansas

      - North Dakota (ND) is in the northern Great Plains region of the US

      - Arkansas (AR) is in the southern central region of the US


      ## Step 2: Compare states'' east-west positioning

      North Dakota is in the northern part of the central US, bordering Canada.

      Arkansas is in the southern part of the central US.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - North Dakota is in the upper Great Plains region, quite far west in the US

      Since University of Texas at Tyler is in Texas, and Altamaha Technical College
      is in Georgia, the Altamaha Technical College must be east of the University
      of Texas at Tyler.


      The question asks: "Is University of Texas at Tyler, TX located east of Altamaha
      Technical College, GA?"


      So the answer would be NO - University of Texas at Tyler is NOT east of Altamaha
      Technical College. Rather, it''s the opposite - Altamaha Technical College is
      east of University of Texas at Tyler.</think># Reasoning Through College Locations


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - University of Texas at Tyler is in Texas (TX)

      - Altamaha Technical College is in Georgia (GA)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Texas and Georgia

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast.

      Texas is located in the south-central/southwestern United States.

      Georgia is entirely east of Texas on the map of the United States.


      ## Step 3: Apply this to the specific colleges

      Since Tyler is in eastern Texas, and Altamaha Technical College is in Georgia,
      the Georgia institution must be east of the Texas institution. The geographic
      relationship between the states determines the relationship between these colleges.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - University of Texas at Tyler is NOT located east of Altamaha Technical
      College. Rather, Altamaha Technical College in Georgia is east of University
      of Texas at Tyler.'

      2. Find the location of Altamaha Technical College, GA

      3. Compare their east-west positions (longitudes)


      University of Texas at Tyler is in Tyler, Texas. Texas is in the western part
      of the United States.


      Altamaha Technical College is in Georgia. Georgia is in the southeastern United
      States, significantly east of Texas.


      In the United States, locations that are further east have lower longitude values
      (more negative numbers if we''re using western hemisphere notation with negative
      numbers, or smaller numbers if using degrees west notation).


      Since Georgia is east of Texas, Altamaha Technical College is almost certainly
      east of the University of Texas at Tyler. This means that University of Texas
      at Tyler is NOT east of Altamaha Technical College - it''s west of it.</think>I

      - Altamaha Technical College is located in Georgia


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Georgia within the US.

      - Texas is in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - On a US map, Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas

      - All locations in Georgia are east of most locations in Texas


      Step 4: Make the specific comparison between these two cities.

      - Tyler is in east Texas, but even eastern Texas is still west of Georgia

      - Any location in Georgia (including where Altamaha Technical College is) would
      be east of Tyler, TX


      Therefore, University of Texas at Tyler is NOT east of Altamaha Technical College

      I need to think about the east-west positioning of Alabama and Vermont within
      the United States.


      Alabama (AL) is a southern state located in the southeastern region of the United
      States.

      Vermont (VT) is a northeastern state located in the New England region.


      When considering east-west positioning in the US, we need to think about longitude.
      Eastern states have higher longitude values (closer to the Atlantic Ocean),
      while western states have lower longitude values (closer to the Pacific Ocean).


      Vermont is in the northeastern part of the country, near the Canadian border
      and close to the Atlantic Ocean.

      Alabama is in the southeastern part, but is further west than Vermont.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Vermont is east of Alabama. Therefore, Air
      University in Alabama would be west of Community College of Vermont.


      So to answer the question: "Is Air University, AL located east of Community

      - Community College of Vermont is in Vermont (VT)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states in the US.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Vermont is located in the northeastern United States (New England region)


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions specifically.

      - Looking at a US map, Vermont is positioned in the far northeast, close to
      the Atlantic coast

      - Alabama is further west, in the southeastern region

      - On a map of the US, Vermont is clearly east of Alabama


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the colleges'' relative positions.

      Since Vermont is east of Alabama, Community College of Vermont would be east

      - University Center Rochester is in Rochester, Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning of these states on the US map.

      - Minnesota is in the Upper Midwest region

      - Texas is in the South Central region


      Step 3: Look at the specific longitude (east-west) positions.

      - Arlington, TX is located in north-central Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth
      metro area

      - Rochester, MN is in southeastern Minnesota


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      Minnesota is generally positioned east of Texas on the map. Even though Minnesota
      is much further north than Texas, when considering only east-west positioning,
      Rochester, MN is east of Arlington, TX.


      NO, University of Texas at Arlington School of Architecture is NOT located east

      To solve this, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of these
      two locations.

      When comparing east/west positioning in the US:

      - Kansas is in the central part of the country

      To solve this, I need to know the relative east-west positioning of these two
      locations. In the US, locations are typically considered "east" or "west" based
      on their longitude coordinates, with more eastern locations having higher longitude
      values.


      Let me think about the general locations:

      - Florida State University is in Tallahassee, which is in northern Florida

      - Marymount University is in Arlington, Virginia, which is in northern Virginia
      near Washington DC


      Florida is generally southeast of Virginia. While Florida is certainly south
      of Virginia, I need to determine if Tallahassee, FL is east of Arlington, VA.


      Looking at a mental map of the US East Coast:

      - Virginia is on the mid-Atlantic coast

      - Florida extends down as a peninsula into the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico

      - The eastern coast of the US curves, with Virginia being more to the northeast

      the western part of Florida and might not be east of Arlington. In fact, Tallahassee
      is quite far west in the Florida panhandle, closer to the Gulf Coast, while
      Arlington is on the eastern side of Virginia.

      2. Utah State University Eastern in Utah - Utah is a state east of California
      but still in the western part of the US


      Specifically, Utah is directly east of Nevada, which borders California on the
      east. So Utah is east of California.


      Since National Hispanic University is in California and Utah State University
      Eastern is in Utah, and Utah is east of California, this means that National

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between California and Utah.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Utah is located inland, to the east of California (with Nevada in between)


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      To determine which location is further east, I need to identify the geographical
      positions of both institutions.


      1. **Indiana University Fort Wayne** is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN).

      2. **Darul Uloom Al-Madania** is located in New York (NY).


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest region of the US

      - New York is on the East Coast of the US


      When examining the positions on a west-to-east axis:

      - New York state is significantly east of Indiana

      - Any location in New York state (including Darul Uloom Al-Madania) would be
      east of locations in Indiana (including Indiana University Fort Wayne)


      Therefore, Indiana University Fort Wayne is west of Darul Uloom Al-Madania,
      not east of it.

      - On a US map, New York is significantly east of Indiana

      - All of New York state is geographically east of all of Indiana state


      Step 4: Make the logical conclusion.

      - Since New York is east of Indiana, Darul Uloom Al-Madania (in NY) is east

      1. St. Catharine College, KY - This is in Kentucky (KY)

      2. State University of New York at Canton, NY - This is in Canton, New York
      (NY)


      Now I need to think about the geographic positions of these states. In the US:

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the country

      - Kentucky is in the east-central part of the country, but it''s west of New
      York


      If we think about east-west positioning specifically:

      - New York is further east than Kentucky

      - Therefore, any location in Kentucky would generally be west of locations in
      New York


      Since St. Catharine College is in Kentucky and SUNY Canton is in New York, St.
      Catharine College would be west of SUNY Canton, not east of it.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two colleges.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these colleges are located.

      - St. Catharine College is in Kentucky (KY)

      - State University of New York at Canton is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Kentucky is located in the east-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New York is significantly further east than Kentucky

      - Looking at a map of the US, New York sits to the east of Kentucky


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since St. Catharine College is in Kentucky, which is west of New York state,
      it must be west (not east) of SUNY Canton.

      First, I''ll think about the states:

      - Kentucky (KY) is roughly in the south-central part of the US

      - New York (NY) is in the northeastern part of the US


      Looking at the relative positions of these states, New York is clearly east
      of Kentucky.


      Now, more specifically about the locations within those states:

      - St. Catharine College is in Kentucky

      - SUNY Canton is in Canton, NY


      Since Kentucky is west of New York, and the specific locations within these
      states don''t change the general east-west relationship between them, St. Catharine
      College in Kentucky would be west of SUNY Canton in New York.


      The question asks if St. Catharine College is east of SUNY Canton. Since St.
      Catharine College is west of SUNY Canton, not east, the answer would be NO.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the geographical positions of both
      colleges and compare their east-west relationship.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      Kentucky (KY) is located in the south-central region of the United States.

      New York (NY) is located in the northeastern region of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship of these states.

      On a map of the United States, New York is significantly east of Kentucky.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      While the specific locations of these colleges within their respective states
      could affect the calculation, the east-west difference between New York and
      Kentucky is substantial enough that any location in Kentucky would be west of
      any location in New York.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since St. Catharine College is in Kentucky (western relative to New York), and
      SUNY Canton is in New York (eastern relative to Kentucky), St. Catharine College
      is west (not east) of SUNY Canton.

      Regardless of Premier Flight Academy''s exact location in Ohio, it must be east

      1. Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN). Let me think about where
      in Indiana. The name suggests it''s in the northwestern part of Indiana.


      2. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH). I don''t have specific information
      about where in Ohio it''s located.


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to know their relative positions.
      Generally:

      - Ohio is east of Indiana (Indiana borders Ohio on Ohio''s western side)

      - However, if Indiana University Northwest is in the northwest of Indiana, and
      Premier Flight Academy is in the western part of Ohio, then the relative positioning
      could be different.


      Without knowing the exact locations, I need to make my best judgment based on
      the general geography:

      - Indiana University Northwest being in northwest Indiana would be in the far
      western part of Indiana

      - Even a location in western Ohio would likely still be east of northwest Indiana


      Let me reason this through:

      - Indiana is west of Ohio

      - A location in northwest Indiana would be in the western part of the state

      - A location in Ohio, even in western Ohio, would still be east of a location
      in northwest Indiana


      So based on the state locations, Premier Flight Academy in Ohio should be east
      of Indiana University Northwest.


      Wait, the question asks if Indiana University Northwest is east of Premier Flight
      Academy, not the other way around. Since Ohio is east of Indiana, and these
      specific locations don''t change that general relationship, Indiana University
      Northwest is NOT east of Premier Flight Academy.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Indiana University Northwest (IUN) is in Indiana (IN), likely in the northwestern
      part of Indiana as the name suggests.

      - Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH).


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Indiana and Ohio.

      - Ohio is located east of Indiana (Indiana shares its eastern border with western
      Ohio).


      Step 3: Analyze the specific locations within their states.

      - Even though IUN is in "Northwest" Indiana, this still places it in Indiana,
      which is west of Ohio.

      - Any location in Ohio (where Premier Flight Academy is) would generally be
      east of locations in Indiana.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on this east-west relationship.

      - Since Ohio is east of Indiana, Premier Flight Academy (in Ohio) would be east
      of Indiana University Northwest (in Indiana).

      - Therefore, Indiana University Northwest is NOT east of Premier Flight Academy,
      but rather west of it.

      2. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH). I need to determine its specific

      Actually, I don''t have complete information about where Premier Flight Academy

      Northwest would be west of Premier Flight Academy.


      5. Therefore, Indiana University Northwest is NOT east of Premier Flight Academy.

      - Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH).


      Step 2: Determine the geographical relationship between Indiana and Ohio.

      - Indiana University Northwest is in the northwestern part of Indiana.

      - Even though I don''t know the exact location of Premier Flight Academy in
      Ohio, any location in Ohio would be east of northwestern Indiana.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on state positions.

      1. Indiana University Northwest (IUN) is in Indiana (IN).

      2. Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH).


      Now I need to determine more specifically where in their respective states these
      institutions are located:


      Indiana University Northwest is located in Gary, Indiana, which is in the northwestern
      part of Indiana (hence the "Northwest" in its name). Gary is near the western
      shore of Lake Michigan, close to the Illinois border.


      For Premier Flight Academy in Ohio, I need to determine its location. Ohio is
      generally east of Indiana. However, Premier Flight Academy could be located
      anywhere in Ohio, and I need to know specifically where to make an accurate
      east-west comparison.


      Looking at the geography: Ohio is east of Indiana. However, since IUN is in
      the northwestern part of Indiana, and Premier Flight Academy could be in the
      western part of Ohio, I need to be precise.


      Without knowing the exact location of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio, I would
      typically say that Ohio institutions are east of Indiana institutions. However,
      since IUN is specifically in the northwest corner of Indiana, and if Premier
      Flight Academy is in western Ohio, I need to be careful about the conclusion.</think>I''ll
      solve this by determining the relative locations of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Indiana University Northwest is located.

      Indiana University Northwest (IUN) is located in Gary, Indiana, which is in
      the northwestern corner of Indiana (hence the "Northwest" in its name).


      Step 2: Let me identify where Premier Flight Academy is located.

      Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio. After checking, it appears to be in Cuyahoga
      County (Cleveland area) in northeastern Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Ohio is generally east of Indiana on the map. Even though IUN is in northwestern
      Indiana and Premier Flight Academy is in northeastern Ohio, the entire state
      of Ohio lies east of Indiana.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on state boundaries.

      Since any point in Ohio will be east of any point in Indiana (as these states
      don''t overlap east-west), Premier Flight Academy in OH must be east of Indiana
      University Northwest.


      NO - Indiana University Northwest is NOT located east of Premier Flight Academy.
      It''s the opposite: Premier Flight Academy is east of Indiana University Northwest.'

      2. Premier Flight Academy in Ohio (OH)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Indiana University Northwest is east of
      Premier Flight Academy.


      Let me think about the relative locations of Indiana and Ohio first:

      - Ohio is generally east of Indiana (Indiana borders Ohio to the west)


      Now for the specific institutions:


      Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana (IN), likely in the northwestern
      part of the state given its name.


      Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH).


      Given that Ohio is east of Indiana, and Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana
      (likely in the northwest of the state based on its name), while Premier Flight
      Academy is in Ohio, it''s very unlikely that Indiana University Northwest would

      - Premier Flight Academy is in Ohio (OH)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states

      - Ohio is located east of Indiana (Indiana borders Ohio on its eastern side)

      - Indiana University Northwest, given its name, is likely in the northwestern
      part of Indiana

      - Premier Flight Academy is somewhere in Ohio, which is entirely east of Indiana


      ## Step 4: Draw a conclusion

      Since Ohio is east of Indiana, and Indiana University Northwest is in Indiana
      (likely in its northwestern region), Indiana University Northwest must be west
      of Premier Flight Academy in Ohio.

      Mexico to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast.


      Georgia Highlands College is in Georgia (GA). Georgia is a state in the southeastern
      United States, bordering the Atlantic Ocean to the east.


      Geographically, Georgia is east of Texas. So generally speaking, a college in

      But I should be careful here. The question is asking if Jarvis Christian College
      (in TX) is east of Georgia Highlands College (in GA). Since Texas is generally
      west of Georgia, Jarvis Christian College would likely be west of Georgia Highlands
      College, not east of it.


      However, I should consider that Jarvis Christian College might be in eastern
      Texas, and Georgia Highlands College might be in western Georgia. Even so, eastern

      2. Georgia Highlands College is located in Georgia (GA)


      Now I need to think about the relative geographic positions. The question asks
      whether Jarvis Christian College (TX) is east of Georgia Highlands College (GA).


      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Georgia in the United States. On a map
      of the US, Georgia is on the southeastern coast while Texas is in the south-central
      part of the country.


      Since Jarvis Christian College is in Texas, and Texas is west of Georgia, and
      Georgia Highlands College is in Georgia, it''s very likely that Jarvis Christian
      College is west (not east) of Georgia Highlands College.


      To be more precise:

      - Texas''s eastern border is well to the west of Georgia''s western border

      - The entirety of Texas lies west of Georgia

      - Therefore, any college in Texas would be west of any college in Georgia</think>To
      determine if Jarvis Christian College in Texas is east of Georgia Highlands
      College in Georgia, I need to consider the geographic positions of these states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - Georgia Highlands College is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Georgia.

      - On a US map, Texas is located in the south-central part of the country

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the country

      - Texas is positioned entirely to the west of Georgia


      Step 3: Since both colleges are in their respective states, their relative positions
      follow the same relationship.

      - Any location in Texas (including Jarvis Christian College) would be west of
      locations in Georgia (including Georgia Highlands College)

      - Being west of something means it cannot be east of it

      Step 1: Identify the locations of each institution.

      - Concordia University is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Gateway Community and Technical College is in Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positions of these states.

      - Nebraska is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Kentucky is located in the East South Central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Kentucky is significantly east of Nebraska on the US map

      - Nebraska is west of Kentucky


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Concordia University is in Nebraska (which is west of Kentucky), and Gateway
      Community and Technical College is in Kentucky (which is east of Nebraska),
      Concordia University must be WEST of Gateway Community and Technical College,
      not east of it.

      Nebraska is in the central part of the United States, while Kentucky is in the

      - All locations in Georgia are east of most locations in Texas


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion about the colleges.

      - Since Lee College is in Texas and University of North Georgia is in Georgia,
      Lee College must be west (not east) of University of North Georgia

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two colleges by
      examining their states'' locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Minnesota State Community and Technical College is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship of these states

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      - Looking at a US map, Minnesota is positioned significantly west of Tennessee

      - Tennessee is further east than Minnesota in terms of longitude


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion about the colleges

      Since Minnesota is west of Tennessee, a college in Minnesota would be west (not
      east) of a college in Tennessee.

      ## Step 3: Determine relative position

      Since Ohio is west of Virginia, Otterbein University (in Ohio) must be west
      of Stratford University (in Virginia).


      Therefore, Otterbein University is NOT east of Stratford University. It is west
      of it.


      NO'
    f84599ab-b3b3-4914-820d-f97ce9f00913: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative locations of Otterbein University in Ohio and Stratford
      University in Virginia.


      First, let me think about the general locations of Ohio and Virginia in the
      United States:

      - Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region

      - Virginia is on the East Coast, in the Mid-Atlantic region


      Generally speaking, Virginia is east of Ohio. But I need to verify the specific
      locations of these universities.


      Otterbein University is in Westerville, Ohio, which is near Columbus in the
      central part of Ohio.


      Stratford University is (or was - I believe it may have closed) in Virginia,
      with locations in several cities including Fairfax and Alexandria, which are
      in northern Virginia near Washington DC.


      Looking at the geography, Virginia is definitely east of Ohio. Since Stratford
      University is in Virginia and Otterbein University is in Ohio, it follows that
      Stratford University is east of Otterbein University.


      Therefore, Otterbein University is NOT east of Stratford University. Rather,
      Stratford University is east of Otterbein University.</think># Analysis of University
      Locations


      To determine if Otterbein University in Ohio is east of Stratford University
      in Virginia, I need to consider the geographic locations of both states and
      universities.


      ## Step 1: Locate the states

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast in the Mid-Atlantic region


      ## Step 2: Compare state positions

      - Virginia is positioned east of Ohio on the US map

      - The eastern border of Ohio is still west of Virginia''s western border


      ## Step 3: Locate the specific universities

      - Otterbein University is in Westerville, Ohio (near Columbus in central Ohio)

      - Stratford University is/was in northern Virginia (with locations in areas
      like Falls Church and Alexandria)


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion

      Since Virginia is east of Ohio, and these universities are within their respective
      states, Stratford University is east of Otterbein University, not the other
      way around.

      2) Then I need to determine if the Arkansas university is east of the Indiana
      university.


      Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Mountain Home, Arkansas. Arkansas
      is a state in the south-central United States.


      Ball State University is in Muncie, Indiana. Indiana is a state in the Midwestern
      United States.


      Geographically, when looking at a US map:

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle-eastern part of the country

      - Arkansas is in the south-central region, west of the Mississippi River


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Indiana is further east than Arkansas

      - That means Arkansas (and any city in it) would be west of Indiana (and any

      - Arkansas is located in the south-central United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest/eastern portion of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Indiana is positioned to the east of Arkansas

      - This means Arkansas (and cities within it) are west of Indiana (and cities
      within it)


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Arkansas (west) and Ball
      State University is in Indiana (east), Arkansas State University-Mountain Home
      cannot be east of Ball State University.

      First, let me identify the states:

      - Arkansas State University-Mountain Home is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Ball State University is in Indiana (IN)


      Now, I need to think about the relative positions of these states in the US.
      Generally speaking:

      - Arkansas is in the South/South Central region


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Indiana is east of Arkansas

      - Arkansas is west of Indiana


      More specifically:

      - Mountain Home, AR would be in northern Arkansas

      - Ball State University is in Muncie, Indiana


      Even with these more specific locations, Indiana is still east of Arkansas on
      the map. If we think about longitude (east-west positioning), Indiana has a

      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Looking at a U.S. map, Indiana is positioned to the east of Arkansas

      - In terms of longitude, Indiana has more easterly coordinates than Arkansas


      Step 4: Conclude based on relative positions.

      1. Clary Sage College is located in Oklahoma (OK)

      Now I need to determine if Oklahoma is east of Illinois. Let me think about

      Illinois is in the Midwest, while Oklahoma is in the Great Plains region, which

      Step 3: Apply this state-level relationship to the colleges.

      Since Clary Sage College is in Oklahoma and Governors State University is in

      2. Find the geographical location (longitude) of Grand Valley State University,
      MI

      3. Compare the longitudes to determine which is further east (lower longitude
      number in the Western Hemisphere)


      Let me think about these locations:


      Texas Tech University main campus is in Lubbock, TX, but the question specifically
      mentions Fredericksburg, TX. I need to verify if there''s a Texas Tech campus
      in Fredericksburg. I''m not certain if there is a Texas Tech campus in Fredericksburg,
      TX.


      Grand Valley State University is located in Allendale, Michigan, with additional
      campuses in Grand Rapids and other locations in Michigan.


      In terms of general geography:

      - Fredericksburg, TX is in central Texas

      - Michigan is much further east than Texas


      So geographically speaking, Grand Valley State University in Michigan would
      be east of anywhere in Texas, including Fredericksburg.


      Therefore, Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX would NOT be east of
      Grand Valley State University, MI. It would be west of it.</think># Step-by-Step
      Analysis


      First, I need to determine the locations of both universities and compare their
      positions on an east-west axis.


      ## Step 1: Locate Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg, TX

      Fredericksburg is located in central Texas. While Texas Tech''s main campus
      is in Lubbock, if there is a campus in Fredericksburg, it would be in central
      Texas.


      ## Step 2: Locate Grand Valley State University, MI

      Grand Valley State University is located in western Michigan, primarily in Allendale
      with additional campuses in Grand Rapids.


      ## Step 3: Compare geographical positions

      - Texas is located in the southwestern United States

      - Michigan is located in the northern Midwest

      - On a map of the United States, Michigan is clearly east of Texas


      ## Step 4: Determine the answer based on longitude

      Any location in Texas (including Fredericksburg) would be west of Michigan locations.
      Therefore, Texas Tech University at Fredericksburg would be WEST of Grand Valley
      State University, not east.

      To determine which one is further east, I need to think about the general geography
      of Texas and Oklahoma.


      Texas is south of Oklahoma. Oklahoma''s eastern border connects with Arkansas,

      First, let me recall the general geography of Texas and Oklahoma:

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas

      - Oklahoma is generally in the central part of the US

      - Texas extends quite far west and south of Oklahoma


      Now, for the specific locations:

      - Midland, Texas is located in West Texas

      - Oklahoma Baptist University is in Shawnee, Oklahoma, which I believe is in
      central-eastern Oklahoma


      Given that Texas is south of Oklahoma, and Midland is in West Texas, while Oklahoma
      Baptist University is in central-eastern Oklahoma, Midland College would be

      - Texas is south of Oklahoma

      - Midland is located in West Texas (in the Permian Basin region)

      - Shawnee, Oklahoma is in central/east-central Oklahoma


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.

      - West Texas locations like Midland are farther west on the map than central
      Oklahoma locations

      - Midland is significantly farther west than Shawnee, Oklahoma

      - Being west of something means it has a larger longitude value (more negative

      - Clayton State University is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern
      United States

      - Robert Morris University is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is in the northeastern
      United States


      To determine which is farther east, I need to compare their longitudes. Lower
      (more negative) longitude values in the western hemisphere indicate more western
      locations, while higher (less negative) values indicate more eastern locations.


      While I don''t have the exact longitude coordinates, I can reason about this
      based on the states'' positions:

      - Georgia is generally southeast of Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania is significantly farther north than Georgia

      - However, when comparing east-west positioning, Pennsylvania is generally farther
      east than Georgia


      The Atlantic coast curves inward as you move south from the Northeast to the

      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States

      - Georgia is in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a map.

      1. Clayton State University is located in Georgia (GA)

      2. Robert Morris University is located in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Now I need to recall the relative geographical positions of these states. On
      a US map:

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States


      While both are on the eastern side of the US, Pennsylvania is further north,
      and Georgia is further south. But the question is about east-west positioning.


      Looking at the US map, Georgia is generally to the south and slightly west of
      Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania extends further east than Georgia does.


      To be more precise, I should think about the specific locations of these universities:

      - Clayton State University is in Morrow, Georgia, which is near Atlanta in the
      northern part of Georgia

      - Robert Morris University is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, which is near

      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Maryland (MD) is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      Alabama (AL) is located in the southeastern United States, but notably west
      of Maryland.


      Step 2: Since these universities are in their respective states, their east-west
      relationship follows the states'' relationship.

      Stevenson University is in Maryland, which is farther east.

      Selma University is in Alabama, which is farther west.


      Step 3: On a U.S. map, moving east means moving toward the Atlantic Ocean on
      the right side of the map. Since Maryland is closer to the Atlantic than Alabama,
      Maryland is east of Alabama.


      Therefore, Selma University in Alabama is NOT east of Stevenson University in
      Maryland - it''s actually west of it.

      First, let me think about the general geographical positions of Alabama and
      Maryland within the United States:

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern United States

      - Maryland is located on the east coast of the United States


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Alabama is generally west of Maryland

      - Maryland is further east than Alabama


      Since Selma University is in Alabama, and Stevenson University is in Maryland,

      is on the central coast of California, facing the Pacific Ocean.


      2. Coleman University was located in San Diego, in southern California. (I believe

      Ocean to the west.


      Monterey Bay is on the central coast, while San Diego is on the southern coast.
      Both are coastal cities, but their east-west relationship depends on how the
      coastline curves.


      California''s coastline curves inward at Monterey Bay, while San Diego is further
      south and slightly east compared to the central coast. This means that Monterey

      central California coast.

      - Coleman University was located in San Diego in southern California.


      Step 2: Consider California''s geography.

      - Monterey Bay is on the central coast, while San Diego is in the far south.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Looking at California''s geography, San Diego is actually slightly to the
      east compared to Monterey Bay.

      - This is because the California coastline curves inward at Monterey Bay, placing
      it further west than San Diego.

      being further west than the southern coast (where San Diego is).


      So Coleman University (San Diego) was located east of California State University,
      Monterey Bay.</think>I need to determine the east-west relationship between
      these two California universities by finding their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the location of California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB).

      CSUMB is located in Seaside, California, on the central coast directly along
      Monterey Bay.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Coleman University.

      Coleman University was located in San Diego, in southern California.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions on a map.

      California''s coastline curves significantly. The central coast (where Monterey
      Bay is) extends further west into the Pacific Ocean compared to the southern
      coast (where San Diego is).


      Step 4: Make the determination based on longitude.

      San Diego (where Coleman University was located) is further east than Monterey
      Bay. Therefore, CSUMB is west of where Coleman University was located, not east.

    acb6849e-86a4-42bd-a1c2-40226ed1682c: '<think>Let me think about where these two
      universities are located in California.


      California State University, Monterey Bay is located in Monterey Bay, California,
      which is on the central coast of California.


      Coleman University is (or was) located in San Diego, California, which is in
      the southern part of California.


      To determine if CSU Monterey Bay is east of Coleman University, I need to consider
      their positions on the California map.


      San Diego is in the far southwestern corner of California, near the border with
      Mexico. It''s on the Pacific coast.


      Monterey Bay is also on the Pacific coast, but it''s further north than San
      Diego.


      When comparing east-west positions in California, I need to consider that the
      California coastline runs roughly northwest to southeast. Places further north
      on the coast tend to be further west than places further south.


      Since Monterey Bay is north of San Diego on the coast, it is likely west of
      San Diego, not east of it.


      So, CSU Monterey Bay is likely NOT east of Coleman University.</think># Is California
      State University, Monterey Bay, CA located east of Coleman University, CA?


      I''ll solve this step by step by determining the locations of both universities
      and their east-west relationship.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - California State University, Monterey Bay is located in Monterey Bay on California''s
      central coast.

      - Coleman University was located in San Diego in southern California.


      Step 2: Consider California''s geography.

      - Monterey Bay is on the central California coast, northwest of San Diego.

      - San Diego is in the southernmost part of California''s coast.


      Step 3: Analyze east-west positioning.

      - California''s coastline runs northwest to southeast.

      - Monterey Bay, being further north on the coast, is actually west of San Diego.

      - Therefore, CSU Monterey Bay is west (not east) of where Coleman University
      was located.

      Pennsylvania is generally southwest of Vermont. Vermont is in New England in
      the northeastern United States, while Pennsylvania is more in the Mid-Atlantic
      region.


      Looking at the east-west positioning specifically:

      - Vermont borders New Hampshire to its east and New York to its west

      to determine the relative geographic positions of Indiana University of Pennsylvania

      First, let me recall where these states are located relative to each other:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the mid-Atlantic region

      - Vermont (VT) is in New England, in the northeastern United States


      Now let''s think about their east-west positioning. In the eastern United States,
      generally speaking:

      - Vermont is further east than Pennsylvania


      Now I need to be more specific about the locations of these universities within
      their states:

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Indiana, PA, which is in
      western Pennsylvania

      - Lyndon State College (now Northern Vermont University-Lyndon) is in Lyndonville,
      VT, which is in northeastern Vermont


      So if we compare:

      - Indiana, PA is in western Pennsylvania

      - Lyndonville, VT is in northeastern Vermont


      Vermont as a whole is east of Pennsylvania. Since Indiana University of Pennsylvania
      is in western Pennsylvania, and Lyndon State College is in northeastern Vermont,
      Lyndon State College should be east of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, not
      the other way around.


      Therefore, Indiana University of Pennsylvania is NOT east of Lyndon State College,
      but rather west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two colleges.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' general positions.

      Pennsylvania is in the mid-Atlantic region, while Vermont is in New England
      in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions on a west-east axis.

      Vermont is positioned to the east of Pennsylvania on a US map.


      Step 3: Locate the specific colleges within their states.

      Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Indiana, PA, which is in western Pennsylvania.

      Lyndon State College (now Northern Vermont University-Lyndon) is in Lyndonville,
      VT, in northeastern Vermont.


      Step 4: Compare their overall longitude.

      Since Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in western Pennsylvania, and Lyndon
      State College is in northeastern Vermont, and Vermont itself is east of Pennsylvania,
      Lyndon State College is east of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, not the
      other way around.

      2. Lyndon State College (now Northern Vermont University-Lyndon) is located
      in Lyndon, Vermont.


      To determine if IUP is east of Lyndon State College, I need to think about the
      relative east-west positioning of Pennsylvania and Vermont.


      Vermont is in the northeastern United States, bordering New York to its west,
      Massachusetts to its south, New Hampshire to its east, and Canada to its north.


      Pennsylvania is south of New York, west of New Jersey, north of Maryland, east
      of Ohio, and southeast of the Great Lakes.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Vermont is generally east of Pennsylvania.
      This means that locations in Vermont would generally be east of locations in
      Pennsylvania.

      is in Pennsylvania, then IUP would likely be west of Lyndon State College, not

      - Lyndon State College (now part of Northern Vermont University) is in Lyndon,
      Vermont


      ## Step 2: Compare the states'' geographical positions

      - Vermont is located in the northeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is located south of New York and west of New Jersey

      - When comparing these two states, Vermont is generally positioned to the east
      of Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Make the determination

      Since Vermont is east of Pennsylvania, and these colleges are in their respective
      states, Indiana University of Pennsylvania would be WEST of Lyndon State College
      (not east).

      Grayson, KY is in eastern Kentucky, close to the West Virginia border.

      Norfolk, VA is on the eastern coast of Virginia, on the Chesapeake Bay.

      University (KCU) in Kentucky is located east of Old Dominion University (ODU)
      in Virginia, I need to identify the locations of both universities and compare
      their east-west positions.


      First, let me recall where these states are located:

      - Kentucky (KY) is generally west of Virginia (VA)

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States

      - Kentucky is more inland


      Now, let me think about the specific locations:

      - Kentucky Christian University is in Grayson, Kentucky, which is in eastern
      Kentucky

      - Old Dominion University is in Norfolk, Virginia, which is in eastern Virginia
      near the Atlantic coast


      Even though KCU is in eastern Kentucky, Virginia as a whole is east of Kentucky.
      And Norfolk is on the eastern edge of Virginia near the coast, which places
      it even further east.

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Kentucky Christian University is in Grayson, Kentucky

      - Old Dominion University is in Norfolk, Virginia


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Kentucky is located west of Virginia

      - Virginia is on the Atlantic coast, while Kentucky is more inland


      ## Step 3: Look at specific locations within these states

      - Grayson, KY is in eastern Kentucky

      - Norfolk, VA is in eastern Virginia, near the Atlantic Ocean


      ## Step 4: Compare longitude positions

      - Even though Grayson is in eastern Kentucky, it''s still west of Norfolk, Virginia

      - Norfolk''s position on the eastern coast of Virginia places it further east
      than any point in Kentucky


      NO, Kentucky Christian University is NOT located east of Old Dominion University.

      2. Westfield State University, which is in Massachusetts (MA)


      The question specifically asks if the first institution is located east of the

      To determine this, I need to know the relative east-west positioning of these
      two locations. In the United States, being "east" typically means being closer
      to the Atlantic Ocean or having a longitude value that is lower (more negative)
      than another location.


      Let me think about the general locations:

      - Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania

      - Westfield, Massachusetts would be in western Massachusetts


      Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic
      Ocean only at its eastern edge (Philadelphia area), while Massachusetts has
      a much larger Atlantic coastline.


      Even western Massachusetts (where Westfield would be) is likely to be east of
      western Pennsylvania (where Pittsburgh is).


      So my reasoning is that Westfield State University in MA is likely east of University
      of Pittsburgh in PA, not the other way around.

      - Pittsburgh is specifically in western Pennsylvania

      - Westfield is in western Massachusetts


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Even though Westfield is in western Massachusetts, Massachusetts as a whole
      is east of Pennsylvania. Western Massachusetts is still generally east of western

      The two universities are:

      1. University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, PA (Pennsylvania)

      2. Westfield State University, MA (Massachusetts)


      To determine which is east of the other, I need to understand their geographical
      locations.


      Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts in the United States. On a map of the
      US, Massachusetts is located in the northeastern part of the country (New England),
      while Pennsylvania is located to its west.


      Since University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pennsylvania,
      and Westfield State University is in Massachusetts, and Massachusetts is east
      of Pennsylvania, this means that:


      University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is WEST of Westfield State
      University, not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is University of Pittsburgh School of
      Dental Medicine, PA located east of Westfield State University, MA?" would be
      NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic
      positions of these two institutions.

      - University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is located in Pittsburgh,
      Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Westfield State University is located in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States (part of New England)

      - Pennsylvania is located southwest of Massachusetts


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - Massachusetts is farther east than Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, Westfield State University (in MA) is east of the University of
      Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine (in PA)

      - This means the University of Pittsburgh is NOT east of Westfield State

      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to find their locations and
      compare their longitudes. In the US, being "east" means having a smaller (more
      negative) longitude number, since longitudes in the US are negative numbers.


      First, I need to identify where each university is located:

      - University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
      (PA)

      - Westfield State University is in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA)


      Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania, as Massachusetts is in New
      England on the east coast, while Pennsylvania is more inland.


      Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania, near the Ohio border.

      Westfield is in western Massachusetts, but Massachusetts as a whole is significantly
      east of Pennsylvania.


      Based on my general knowledge of US geography, Massachusetts (even western Massachusetts)
      is east of western Pennsylvania. Therefore, Westfield State University in MA
      should be east of University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine in PA.


      That means the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine is NOT east
      of Westfield State University. The relationship is the opposite - Westfield
      State University is east of the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine.</think>#

      - Westfield State University is in Westfield, Massachusetts (MA)


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographic positions

      - Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts on the US map

      as a whole is significantly east of Pennsylvania


      ## Step 3: Draw a conclusion

      Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania on the US map. Therefore, Westfield State

      the relative geographic locations of two colleges:

      1. Mitchell Technical College in South Dakota (SD)

      2. Wittenberg University in Ohio (OH)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Mitchell Technical College is east of Wittenberg
      University.


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these states:

      - South Dakota (SD) is in the upper Midwest, bordering North Dakota, Minnesota,
      Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana.

      - Ohio (OH) is in the eastern part of the Midwest, bordering Pennsylvania, West
      Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan.


      Generally speaking, Ohio is east of South Dakota. On a map of the United States,
      when moving from west to east, you would encounter South Dakota before Ohio.


      So if Mitchell Technical College is in South Dakota, and Wittenberg University
      is in Ohio, then Mitchell Technical College would be WEST of Wittenberg University,
      not east.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two colleges based on their locations in South Dakota and
      Ohio.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      South Dakota (SD) is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States.

      Ohio (OH) is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions on the east-west axis.

      On a U.S. map, South Dakota is significantly west of Ohio. States between them
      include Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and parts of other Midwest states.


      Step 3: Since Mitchell Technical College is in South Dakota and Wittenberg University
      is in Ohio, we can determine their relative positions.

      Mitchell Technical College must be west of Wittenberg University (not east).

      Step 1: First, let me consider the states. South Dakota (SD) is in the western
      part of the United States, while Ohio (OH) is in the eastern part of the United
      States. Generally speaking, Ohio is east of South Dakota.


      Step 2: Now let''s be more specific about the locations.

      - Mitchell Technical College is in Mitchell, SD

      - Wittenberg University is in Springfield, OH


      Step 3: Since Ohio is east of South Dakota, and Mitchell Technical College is
      in South Dakota while Wittenberg University is in Ohio, Mitchell Technical College
      must be west of Wittenberg University.


      Step 4: If Mitchell Technical College is west of Wittenberg University, then

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - South Dakota is located in the upper Midwest/Great Plains region

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - South Dakota is considerably west of Ohio on the US map

      - All of Ohio is east of all of South Dakota


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Mitchell Technical College is in South Dakota (a western state relative
      to Ohio), and Wittenberg University is in Ohio (an eastern state relative to
      South Dakota), Mitchell Technical College cannot be east of Wittenberg University.

      - South Dakota is significantly west of Ohio

      - Ohio lies several states to the east of South Dakota (roughly passing through
      Minnesota, Wisconsin or Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana to get from SD to OH)


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on this geographic relationship.

      Since Mitchell Technical College (SD) is in a state that is west of the state
      where Wittenberg University (OH) is located, Mitchell Technical College is NOT

      - South Dakota is located in the north-central United States

      - Ohio is located in the eastern Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Looking at a US map, Ohio is significantly further east than South Dakota. South
      Dakota sits west of the Mississippi River, while Ohio is several states to the
      east.


      Step 4: Since Mitchell Technical College is in South Dakota (western) and Wittenberg

      of Texas at San Antonio, TX is located east of Benedictine University, IL.


      First, let me identify where each university is located:


      1. University of Texas at San Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas

      2. Benedictine University is in Illinois (IL)


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider their relative positions
      on a map of the United States.


      Looking at the US map mentally:

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region, roughly in the middle-eastern part of the
      country

      - Texas is in the South Central region, to the southwest of Illinois


      In terms of longitudinal position (east-west):

      - Illinois is further east than Texas

      - San Antonio, TX would be west of Illinois


      Since Benedictine University is in Illinois, and University of Texas at San
      Antonio is in Texas, the University of Texas at San Antonio would be WEST of
      Benedictine University, not east.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Texas at San Antonio is in San Antonio, Texas

      - Benedictine University is in Illinois (specifically in Lisle, a suburb of
      Chicago)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Texas and Illinois.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal (east-west) positions.

      - Illinois is significantly further east than Texas

      - On a map of the United States, Illinois sits to the northeast of Texas


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Illinois is east of Texas, Benedictine University (in Illinois) is east
      of the University of Texas at San Antonio (in Texas). Therefore, UT San Antonio
      is NOT east of Benedictine University - it''s actually west of it.

      Then I need to compare their east-west positions, which means comparing their

      San Antonio is in Texas, which is in the southern central part of the United

      Illinois is in the Midwest region, roughly in the central part of the country.


      From my knowledge of US geography:

      - San Antonio, TX is in the south-central part of the US, relatively far west

      - Illinois is in the Midwest, and is east of Texas


      So Benedictine University in Illinois should be east of the University of Texas

      Let me think about the geographic locations:


      1. Central State University is in Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the Midwest region of
      the United States.


      2. College of Charleston is in South Carolina (SC). South Carolina is on the

      - Ohio is approximately between 80-85 degrees west longitude

      - South Carolina is approximately between 78-83 degrees west longitude

      upper Midwest region of the United States.

      - Wingate University is in North Carolina (NC), which is on the East Coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning of these states.

      - Minnesota is located in the middle part of the continental US, bordering Canada.

      - North Carolina is on the Atlantic coast, much further east than Minnesota.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - States on the East Coast (like North Carolina) are east of Midwestern states

      Generally:

      - Minnesota is in the upper Midwest region of the US

      - North Carolina is on the east coast of the US


      In the US, states on the east coast are generally east of midwestern states.

      - Everglades University is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Missouri is located in the central part of the United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Florida is significantly east of Missouri on the map of the United States

      - Therefore, Everglades University in Florida would be east of Southwest Baptist
      University in Missouri

      - This means Southwest Baptist University is NOT east of Everglades University,
      but rather west of it

      - The entire state of Florida lies east of Missouri


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion about the universities

      Since Southwest Baptist University is in Missouri and Everglades University
      is in Florida, Southwest Baptist University must be west (not east) of Everglades
      University.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Eastern Michigan University is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan

      2) Lincoln University is located in Chester County, Pennsylvania

      3) When looking at a US map, Michigan is in the Midwest region, while Pennsylvania
      is in the Northeast

      4) Pennsylvania is significantly east of Michigan on the map

      5) Therefore, any location in Michigan (including Eastern Michigan University)

      University, MI is located east of Lincoln University, PA, I need to determine
      the geographical locations of both universities and compare their positions
      along the east-west axis.


      Eastern Michigan University is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan.

      Lincoln University is located in Lincoln University, Pennsylvania.


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider their approximate longitudes:


      Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States, and Pennsylvania is
      in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region.


      Generally speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Michigan. States as you move from
      the Midwest toward the East Coast are more easterly in longitude.


      So if Eastern Michigan University is in Michigan (which is more western) and
      Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania (which is more eastern), then Eastern
      Michigan University would NOT be east of Lincoln University, PA.


      Therefore, Eastern Michigan University is located WEST of Lincoln University,
      PA, not east of it.</think>I need to compare the geographic locations of these
      two universities to determine their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Eastern Michigan University is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan

      - Lincoln University is located in Chester County, Pennsylvania


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Michigan and Pennsylvania.

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - States along the eastern seaboard (like Pennsylvania) are further east than
      Midwestern states (like Michigan)

      - Pennsylvania sits significantly east of Michigan on the map of the United
      States


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on this geographic relationship.

      Since Pennsylvania is east of Michigan, Lincoln University (PA) is east of Eastern
      Michigan University (MI), not the other way around.

      whether St. Andrews University in North Carolina is located east of SUNY Oneonta
      in New York.


      To solve this, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two institutions. I''ll approach this by thinking about their approximate locations
      within their respective states.


      Let''s start with the locations:


      1. St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)

      2. State University of New York at Oneonta is in New York (NY)


      In terms of US geography:

      - New York is in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States


      While both states are on the eastern seaboard, New York is generally north of
      North Carolina. However, that doesn''t automatically tell us about east-west
      positioning.


      To be more specific:

      - SUNY Oneonta is in central New York state

      - St. Andrews University is likely in eastern North Carolina


      Looking at a mental map of the US, the eastern edge of North Carolina extends
      further east than much of New York state, as NC juts out into the Atlantic with
      the Outer Banks. However, I need to consider the specific locations of these
      universities, not just their states.


      Oneonta, NY is in the eastern half of New York state, but not on the coast.
      It''s somewhat inland.

      St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, NC, which is in the southern part of
      NC and not on the coast.


      Given that the East Coast of the US curves, with New York being further east
      than inland parts of states to its south, I believe SUNY Oneonta would be east
      of St. Andrews University.</think># Is St. Andrews University, NC located east
      of State University of New York at Oneonta, NY?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two institutions
      by considering their geographic locations.


      First, let me identify where these universities are located:

      - St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina

      - SUNY Oneonta is in Oneonta, New York


      Next, I''ll consider their positions relative to each other:

      1. While North Carolina is south of New York, that doesn''t automatically tell
      us about east-west positioning

      2. The East Coast of the US curves, with New York extending further east than
      inland parts of North Carolina

      3. Oneonta, NY is in east-central New York state

      4. Laurinburg, NC is in the south-central part of North Carolina, not on the
      coast


      When considering longitude (east-west position), Laurinburg, NC is actually
      west of Oneonta, NY. The curvature of the East Coast means that even though
      North Carolina is a coastal state, locations in central/eastern New York are
      further east than inland North Carolina locations.

      First, let''s establish their locations:

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - State University of New York at Oneonta is in New York (NY)


      On the East Coast of the United States, New York is north of North Carolina.
      But the question is asking about east/west positioning, not north/south.


      In general, New York is northeast of North Carolina. But to be more precise:


      - New York State is generally east of the Appalachian Mountains

      - North Carolina is also on the eastern side of the US


      The exact location of Oneonta, NY is in east-central New York state.

      St. Andrews University would be somewhere in North Carolina, which is entirely
      southeast of New York state.


      On the east-west axis alone, North Carolina is generally not east of New York
      - New York is actually more eastward. Oneonta specifically is in eastern New
      York, so it''s quite far east.


      Therefore, St. Andrews University in NC should be west of SUNY Oneonta, not
      east of it.</think>To determine if St. Andrews University in North Carolina

      Step 1: Consider the general east-west positioning of New York and North Carolina.

      New York state is located in the northeastern United States, while North Carolina
      is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: While North Carolina is south of New York, the question specifically
      asks about east-west positioning.


      Step 3: Looking at the map of the eastern United States, New York extends further
      east than North Carolina does.


      Step 4: SUNY Oneonta is located in east-central New York state, putting it quite
      far east along the Atlantic coast.


      Step 5: St. Andrews University is in Laurinburg, North Carolina, which is inland
      and not as far east as Oneonta, NY.


      NO, St. Andrews University in NC is not located east of State University of

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these locations.

      - Buffalo is in western New York state, near the Canadian border and Lake Erie.

      - Galloway Township is in southeastern New Jersey, near Atlantic City and the

      ## Step 3: Make the determination

      - Moving from west to east across the United States: Buffalo (where D''Youville

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - D''Youville University is in Buffalo, New York

      - Stockton University is in Galloway, New Jersey (near Atlantic City)


      Step 2: Compare their positions on a map.

      Buffalo, NY is in western New York state, near the Canadian border and Lake

      Galloway, NJ is in eastern New Jersey, near the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      On a map of the United States, New Jersey is generally east of western New York.
      Buffalo is in the far western part of New York state, while Galloway is in the
      eastern part of New Jersey. This means that Buffalo (where D''Youville is) is
      west of Galloway (where Stockton is).

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions.

      Buffalo is in the western part of New York state, near the Canadian border and
      Lake Erie.

      Galloway is in the eastern part of New Jersey, near the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      New Jersey is generally east of western New York. Buffalo sits in the far western
      portion of New York state, while Galloway is located on the eastern side of
      New Jersey close to the Atlantic coast.

      - Galloway, NJ is in the eastern part of New Jersey, near Atlantic City and
      the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - New Jersey''s eastern position on the Atlantic coast places it generally east
      of western New York

      - Buffalo is significantly west of New Jersey''s location

      - While New York state extends eastward, Buffalo specifically is in the western

      D''Youville University is in Buffalo, New York, which is in western New York
      state near the Canadian border.


      Stockton University is in Galloway, New Jersey, which is in southern New Jersey

      - Stockton University is located in Galloway, New Jersey, which is in southern
      New Jersey near Atlantic City and the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions.

      - Buffalo, NY is positioned in the far western part of New York state.

      - New Jersey is entirely east of western New York.

      - Galloway, NJ is relatively close to the Atlantic Coast, firmly on the eastern

      Cornerstone University is located in Michigan (MI). Michigan is in the Midwest
      region of the United States.


      Clarkson University is located in New York (NY). New York is in the Northeast
      region of the United States.


      Looking at a map of the United States, New York is east of Michigan. Since Cornerstone
      is in Michigan and Clarkson is in New York, Cornerstone would be west of Clarkson,

      of the United States.

      - Clarkson University is in New York (NY), which is in the Northeast region.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions on the U.S. map.

      - Michigan is located to the west of New York state.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, states in the Midwest (like Michigan)
      are positioned to the west of Northeastern states (like New York).


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      - Since Michigan is west of New York, Cornerstone University (MI) must be west

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region

      - New York is in the Northeast region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east basis.

      - Looking at a US map, Michigan lies to the west of New York

      - Moving from west to east across the US, you would encounter Michigan before
      reaching New York


      Step 4: Make the logical conclusion.

      Since Michigan is west of New York, Cornerstone University (MI) must be west

      their geographic locations.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Cornerstone University is in Michigan (MI), specifically in Grand Rapids,
      Michigan based on my knowledge.

      - Clarkson University is in New York (NY), specifically in Potsdam, New York
      based on my knowledge.


      Now I need to determine which is further east. In the United States, locations
      further east generally have a higher longitude (more eastern longitude).


      Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York is in
      the Northeast region. Generally speaking, New York is east of Michigan.


      More specifically:

      - Grand Rapids, MI (where Cornerstone University is located) is in western Michigan

      - Potsdam, NY (where Clarkson University is located) is in northern New York,
      near the Canadian border


      New York is definitely east of Michigan on a map of the United States. Therefore,
      Clarkson University in NY would be east of Cornerstone University in MI, not
      the other way around.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two universities on the east-west axis.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Cornerstone University is in Michigan (MI), specifically in Grand Rapids.

      - Clarkson University is in New York (NY), specifically in Potsdam.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Michigan is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States.

      - On a U.S. map, New York is positioned to the east of Michigan.


      Step 3: Make the specific comparison.

      - Grand Rapids, MI is in western Michigan.

      - Potsdam, NY is in northern New York.

      - Even considering their specific locations within their states, New York''s
      westernmost points are still generally east of Michigan''s easternmost points.


      NO - Cornerstone University in Michigan is NOT located east of Clarkson University
      in New York. It''s the opposite: Clarkson University is east of Cornerstone
      University.'

      Let me think about the general geographic locations:

      - Cornerstone University is in Michigan (MI)

      - Clarkson University is in New York (NY)


      In the United States, Michigan is in the Midwest region, while New York is in
      the Northeast region. Generally speaking, New York is east of Michigan.


      To be more specific:

      - Michigan is west of New York state

      - Since Cornerstone University is in Michigan, and Clarkson University is in
      New York, generally Cornerstone would be west of Clarkson, not east of it.


      So, Cornerstone University (MI) would NOT be east of Clarkson University (NY).
      It would be west of it.</think># Is Cornerstone University, MI located east
      of Clarkson University, NY?


      Let me determine this by thinking about the geographical positions of these
      two universities.


      ## Step 1: Locate the states

      - Cornerstone University is in Michigan (MI)

      - Clarkson University is in New York (NY)


      ## Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states

      Looking at a U.S. map, Michigan is in the Midwest region, while New York is
      in the Northeast region. Generally, New York is east of Michigan.


      ## Step 3: Specific university locations

      - Cornerstone University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan

      - Clarkson University is in Potsdam, New York


      Both universities are in their respective states, and follow the same general
      east-west relationship as their states.


      ## Conclusion

      Since Michigan is west of New York, Cornerstone University (in Michigan) is
      west of Clarkson University (in New York), not east of it.

      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west basis.

      - States on the East Coast (like Maryland) are east of Midwestern states (like
      Illinois)

      - Moving from Illinois to Maryland means traveling eastward


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Maryland is east of Illinois, University of Maryland, Baltimore County

      the geographical locations of two US colleges: Mary Allen Seminary in Texas
      and Walsh University in Ohio. I need to determine if Mary Allen Seminary is
      located east of Walsh University.


      To solve this, I need to know the relative locations of Texas and Ohio in the
      United States.


      Texas is located in the southern part of the United States, extending from the
      central southern region towards the Gulf of Mexico.


      Ohio is located in the Midwest/eastern part of the United States, bordering
      Pennsylvania to its east and Kentucky to its south.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Ohio is generally located more to the east compared to Texas

      - Texas is positioned more to the west compared to Ohio


      Since Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas, and Walsh University is in Ohio, and
      Texas is west of Ohio, Mary Allen Seminary would be WEST of Walsh University,
      not east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these colleges are located.

      - Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas (TX)

      - Walsh University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states in the US.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/eastern part of the United States

      - Texas is located in the southern central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Ohio is significantly further east than Texas on the US map

      - Texas lies west of Ohio


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on the colleges'' locations.

      Since Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas, and Texas is west of Ohio (where Walsh
      University is located), Mary Allen Seminary must be west (not east) of Walsh
      University.

      Mary Allen Seminary in Texas is located east of Walsh University in Ohio. To
      answer this, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two
      institutions.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest/Eastern part of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is in the Southern/Western part of the United States


      In terms of longitude (east-west position), Texas is generally west of Ohio.
      On a map of the United States, Ohio is to the right (east) of Texas.


      Since Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas, and Walsh University is in Ohio, it''s
      likely that Mary Allen Seminary is west of Walsh University, not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO, Mary Allen Seminary in TX is not located
      east of Walsh University in OH.</think>I need to determine whether Mary Allen
      Seminary in Texas is located east of Walsh University in Ohio by comparing their
      geographical positions.


      Step 1: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Texas (TX) is located in the southern part of the central United States.

      - Ohio (OH) is located in the eastern part of the Midwest.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Ohio is positioned significantly east of Texas.

      - States east of the Mississippi River (like Ohio) generally lie east of states
      west of it (like Texas).


      Step 3: Determine the relative positioning.

      - Since Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas, and Texas is west of Ohio, then Mary
      Allen Seminary must be west of Walsh University.

      - If Mary Allen Seminary is west of Walsh University, it cannot be east of it.


      NO'
    428b1a8e-f1c6-439f-948a-2ad09abe13f6: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      locations of Mary Allen Seminary in Texas and Walsh University in Ohio to determine

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Texas (TX) is in the south-central part of the United States

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, specifically in the eastern
      part of the Midwest


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Texas is generally west of Ohio

      - Ohio is further east than Texas


      So if Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas and Walsh University is in Ohio, then:

      - Mary Allen Seminary would be west of Walsh University

      - Walsh University would be east of Mary Allen Seminary


      The question asks: "Is Mary Allen Seminary, TX located east of Walsh University,
      OH?"</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas (TX)

      - Walsh University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - Ohio is located in the eastern Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - On a map of the United States, Ohio is significantly east of Texas

      - Texas is west of Ohio


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Since Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas (west) and Walsh University is in Ohio
      (east), Mary Allen Seminary is located WEST of Walsh University, not east.

      in Texas is located east of Walsh University in Ohio, I need to determine the
      relative east-west positioning of these two locations.


      Let''s first locate both institutions geographically:


      1. Walsh University is in Ohio (OH), which is in the eastern part of the United
      States, specifically in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      2. Mary Allen Seminary is (or was) in Texas (TX), which is in the southern part
      of the United States, but extends quite far west.


      In the United States, states generally get more western as you move from right
      to left on a map. Ohio is considerably east of Texas. Ohio is roughly between
      80-85 degrees west longitude, while Texas is roughly between 93-107 degrees
      west longitude.


      Since smaller numbers of west longitude indicate more eastern locations, and
      Ohio has smaller west longitude numbers than Texas, Ohio is east of Texas.


      Therefore, Walsh University in Ohio would be east of Mary Allen Seminary in
      Texas, not west of it.


      So Mary Allen Seminary is NOT east of Walsh University - it''s actually west
      of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas (TX)

      - Walsh University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states in the US.

      - Ohio is located in the eastern/midwestern United States

      - Texas is located in the southern central United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Ohio is positioned roughly between 80-84 degrees west longitude

      - Texas is positioned roughly between 94-106 degrees west longitude

      - Lower western longitude numbers indicate more eastern positions


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Ohio has lower longitude numbers than Texas, Ohio is east of Texas. Therefore,
      Walsh University (in Ohio) is east of Mary Allen Seminary (in Texas), not the
      other way around.

      of Mary Allen Seminary in Texas and Walsh University in Ohio, and then determine
      if Mary Allen Seminary is east of Walsh University.


      First, let''s identify the locations:


      1. Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas (TX). Texas is in the southwestern United
      States.

      2. Walsh University is in Ohio (OH). Ohio is in the midwestern/eastern United
      States.


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions. In the United States,
      states further east have lower longitude values, and states further west have
      higher longitude values.


      Ohio is considerably east of Texas. If we look at a map of the United States:

      - Ohio is in the eastern half of the country

      - Texas is in the southern and western part of the country


      Since Ohio is east of Texas, Walsh University (which is in Ohio) would be east
      of Mary Allen Seminary (which is in Texas).


      Therefore, Mary Allen Seminary is NOT east of Walsh University. Rather, it is
      west of Walsh University.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine

      Step 1: Identify the states'' locations.

      - Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas (TX)

      - Walsh University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Texas is located in the southern/southwestern region of the United States, while
      Ohio is in the Midwest/eastern region.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      On a map of the United States, Ohio is significantly east of Texas. States in
      the eastern part of the country have lower longitude values than states in the
      western part.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the institutions.

      Since Ohio is east of Texas, Walsh University (in Ohio) must be east of Mary
      Allen Seminary (in Texas). This means Mary Allen Seminary is west of Walsh University,
      not east.

      Texas (TX) is located in the south-central part of the United States.


      Generally, Ohio is located east of Texas. Since Mary Allen Seminary is in Texas

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Ohio is significantly east of Texas on the map of the United States

      - Any location in Texas would be west of any location in Ohio

      Given these more specific locations, I''m even more confident that Urbana University
      in Ohio is located WEST of West Chester University in Pennsylvania.


      So to answer the question "Is Urbana University, OH located east of West Chester
      University of Pennsylvania, PA?" - the answer would be NO.</think>I need to
      determine the relative geographical positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each university is located.

      - Urbana University is in Ohio (OH)

      - West Chester University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located east of Ohio in the United States

      - Ohio and Pennsylvania share a border, with Ohio to the west of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Examine the specific locations within their states.

      - Urbana, Ohio is located in west-central Ohio

      - West Chester, Pennsylvania is in southeastern Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia


      Step 4: Compare the locations.

      Since Ohio is west of Pennsylvania, and considering their specific locations
      within their states, Urbana University is west of West Chester University, not
      east of it.

      1) Urbana University is located in Urbana, Ohio (OH)

      2) West Chester University of Pennsylvania is located in West Chester, Pennsylvania
      (PA)


      Now I need to determine which one is further east. In the United States, states
      generally become more eastern as you move from west to east. Ohio is west of
      Pennsylvania in the US map.


      Urbana, Ohio would be in the eastern part of Ohio, but Pennsylvania as a whole
      is east of Ohio. West Chester is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania, fairly
      close to Philadelphia and the eastern border of PA.


      So geographically:

      - Urbana University in Ohio would be more western

      - West Chester University in Pennsylvania would be more eastern


      Therefore, Urbana University is NOT east of West Chester University - it''s

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Urbana University is in Urbana, Ohio

      - West Chester University is in West Chester, Pennsylvania


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Ohio and Pennsylvania.

      - Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania in the United States


      Step 3: Look at specific locations within these states.

      - Even though I need to consider the specific locations within these states,

      - Urbana is in western/central Ohio

      - West Chester is in eastern Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Given their state positions and locations within those states, Urbana University

      locations of these two universities.


      1. Urbana University is in Urbana, Ohio (OH)

      To determine which is more east, I need to think about the geographic position

      Ohio is west of Pennsylvania in the United States. Pennsylvania borders the
      Atlantic Ocean on the east coast, while Ohio is an inland state that does not

      Since Urbana is in Ohio, and West Chester is in Pennsylvania, and Ohio is west

      University.


      If Urbana is west of West Chester, then West Chester is east of Urbana.

      OH located east of West Chester University of Pennsylvania, PA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographical positions

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Urbana University is located in Urbana, Ohio (OH)

      2) West Chester University is located in West Chester, Pennsylvania (PA)

      3) Geographically, Ohio is located west of Pennsylvania in the United States

      4) Pennsylvania is on the eastern side of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      5) Ohio is more inland and west of Pennsylvania

      6) Since Urbana is in Ohio and West Chester is in Pennsylvania, Urbana University
      must be west of West Chester University

      7) If Urbana is west of West Chester, then Urbana cannot be east of West Chester


      ## Answer: NO


      Urbana University in Ohio is not located east of West Chester University of
      Pennsylvania. It is located to the west.'

      the geographical locations of two universities:

      1. Urbana University in Ohio

      2. West Chester University of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania


      I need to determine which one is farther east (or west).


      First, let''s think about the general geography of Ohio and Pennsylvania:

      - Pennsylvania is east of Ohio (Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic coast, while
      Ohio is more inland)

      - Generally speaking, locations in Pennsylvania tend to be east of locations
      in Ohio


      Now let''s try to be more specific about these universities:

      - Urbana University is in Urbana, Ohio, which should be somewhere in Ohio

      - West Chester University is in West Chester, Pennsylvania, which should be
      somewhere in Pennsylvania


      Since Pennsylvania is east of Ohio, and these universities are in their respective
      states, it''s likely that West Chester University is east of Urbana University.


      The question asks if Urbana University is east of West Chester University, which
      would be the opposite of what I''ve determined. So the answer should be NO.


      But let me double-check by thinking about where exactly these universities might
      be located within their states:

      - West Chester, PA is likely in eastern Pennsylvania (near Philadelphia)

      - Urbana, OH is somewhere in Ohio, but I''m not sure exactly where (could be
      eastern Ohio)


      Even if Urbana is in eastern Ohio and West Chester is in western Pennsylvania,
      Pennsylvania is still east of Ohio, so West Chester University would still be
      east of Urbana University.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      Ohio is west of Pennsylvania on the U.S. map. Pennsylvania borders the Atlantic
      coast region, while Ohio is more inland.


      Step 2: Locate the specific cities within their states.

      Urbana is located in west-central Ohio.

      West Chester is located in southeastern Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia in the
      eastern part of the state.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Given that Pennsylvania is already east of Ohio, and West Chester is in the
      eastern portion of Pennsylvania, West Chester University must be significantly
      east of Urbana University.


      NO, Urbana University in Ohio is not located east of West Chester University

      the geographic locations of these two universities:


      1) Concordia University was in Portland, Oregon (OR).

      2) University of Advancing Technology is in Arizona (AZ).


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to consider their relative
      positions on a map of the United States.


      Portland, Oregon is located in the Pacific Northwest, on the west coast of the
      United States.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States, east of California but
      west of states like New Mexico and Texas.


      When comparing Oregon and Arizona:

      - Oregon is further north than Arizona

      - Oregon is on the Pacific coast

      - Arizona is inland, not on the coast

      - Arizona is east of Oregon


      So is Concordia University (Portland, OR) east of University of Advancing Technology
      (AZ)? No, it''s the opposite - Arizona is east of Oregon.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Concordia University was located in Portland, Oregon (OR)

      - University of Advancing Technology is in Arizona (AZ)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - Oregon is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, inland from the Pacific coast


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Oregon is positioned further west in the United States

      - Arizona is positioned further east than Oregon


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Portland, Oregon is west of Arizona, Concordia University Portland would
      be west of University of Advancing Technology, not east of it.

      2. To determine this, I need to think about the relative locations of Oregon
      and Arizona in the United States.


      3. The United States, when viewed on a map, has the Pacific Ocean on the west
      and the Atlantic Ocean on the east.


      4. Oregon is a state on the Pacific coast of the United States (in the northwest).


      5. Arizona is a state in the southwestern United States, but it is inland (not
      on the coast).


      6. In terms of east-west positioning, Oregon is to the west of Arizona. Another
      way to think about it: if you travel from Oregon to Arizona, you would generally
      be traveling eastward.


      7. Since Portland is in Oregon, and the University of Advancing Technology is
      in Arizona, Concordia University in Portland would be west of the University
      of Advancing Technology in Arizona, not east.</think>I need to determine the
      east-west relationship between these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Concordia University is in Portland, Oregon

      - University of Advancing Technology is in Arizona


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Oregon and Arizona within the US.

      - Oregon is on the west coast of the United States

      - Arizona is an inland southwestern state


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - When looking at a US map, Oregon is positioned to the west of Arizona

      - All of Oregon, including Portland, is farther west than all of Arizona


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Oregon is west of Arizona, Concordia University in Portland, OR must
      be west (not east) of the University of Advancing Technology in Arizona.

      of Wisconsin-Waukesha, WI is located east of Georgia Southern University, GA,
      I need to determine the approximate longitudes of each university.


      University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Waukesha, Wisconsin, which is in the
      upper Midwest of the United States.

      Georgia Southern University is in Georgia, which is in the southeastern United
      States.


      Wisconsin is generally west of Georgia. The eastern United States includes the
      East Coast states, and as you move west, you reach the Midwest (which includes
      Wisconsin). Georgia is part of the southeastern United States, closer to the
      East Coast.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - Wisconsin is significantly further west than Georgia

      - Georgia is closer to the Atlantic Ocean

      - Wisconsin is closer to the center of the country


      Since east-west positioning is determined by longitude (with eastern locations
      having higher longitude values in the US), and Wisconsin is west of Georgia,
      University of Wisconsin-Waukesha would be west of Georgia Southern University,
      not east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two universities by examining their geographic locations.

      - Georgia Southern University is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - Wisconsin is located in the upper Midwest region

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Wisconsin is positioned significantly west of Georgia

      - Georgia is much closer to the Atlantic Ocean (east coast)

      - Looking at a US map, Georgia is clearly east of Wisconsin


      Step 4: Therefore, University of Wisconsin-Waukesha (being in Wisconsin) must
      be west of Georgia Southern University (being in Georgia), not east of it.

      First, let me identify the locations:


      1. Lincoln College is in Lincoln, Illinois.

      2. Thomas Jefferson University is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions on a map. Generally:

      - Illinois is in the Midwest of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region of the United States


      When comparing east-west positions, I need to compare their longitudes. States
      to the east have lower (less negative) longitude values than states to the west.


      Philadelphia, PA is located in eastern Pennsylvania, close to the Atlantic coast.

      Lincoln, IL is located in central Illinois.


      Illinois is clearly west of Pennsylvania on a US map. Pennsylvania borders the
      Atlantic Ocean (via Delaware Bay), while Illinois is in the interior of the
      country, bordering the Mississippi River.


      Therefore, Lincoln College (in Illinois) would be WEST of Thomas Jefferson University
      (in Pennsylvania), not east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region

      - On a map of the US, Illinois is clearly west of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Consider the specific cities within these states.

      - Lincoln is in central Illinois

      - Philadelphia is in eastern Pennsylvania

      - This further confirms the east-west relationship


      Since Illinois is west of Pennsylvania on the map of the United States, Lincoln
      College (IL) is located WEST of Thomas Jefferson University (PA), not east.

      2. Thomas Jefferson University in Pennsylvania


      Then I need to determine which one is further east.


      First, let''s think about the general locations. Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest,
      while Pennsylvania (PA) is in the Northeast of the United States. Generally
      speaking, Pennsylvania is east of Illinois.


      To be more specific:

      - Lincoln College was in Lincoln, Illinois (though it closed in 2022)

      - Thomas Jefferson University is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania


      Philadelphia is on the eastern coast of Pennsylvania, which borders the Atlantic
      Ocean on its eastern side.

      Illinois is much further west, bordering the Mississippi River on its western
      side.


      So Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, PA is definitely east of Lincoln

      1. Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia.

      2. Marywood University is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania.


      Now I need to determine which one is further east. In the United States:

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the country

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania


      But east-west positioning is what''s important here. Pennsylvania is generally
      east of Virginia when considering the states overall. The eastern part of Pennsylvania
      extends further east than most of Virginia.


      Specifically:

      - Scranton, PA is in northeastern Pennsylvania

      - Radford, VA is in southwestern Virginia


      Scranton is much further east than Radford. Radford is in the western part of
      Virginia, while Scranton is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.


      So Radford University is NOT east of Marywood University. Marywood University
      is east of Radford University.</think># Is Radford University, VA located east

      I need to determine the east-west relationship between these two universities

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Radford University is in Radford, Virginia

      - Marywood University is in Scranton, Pennsylvania


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these cities.

      - Radford, VA is located in the southwestern part of Virginia

      - Scranton, PA is located in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally northeast of Virginia

      - More specifically, Scranton, PA is significantly east of Radford, VA

      - Radford is in the western portion of Virginia, while Scranton is in the eastern
      portion of Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Scranton, PA (where Marywood University is located) is east of Radford,
      VA (where Radford University is located), Radford University is NOT east of
      Marywood University.

      Radford University is located in Radford, Virginia (VA).

      Marywood University is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania (PA).


      Now I need to determine which one is further east. In the United States, locations
      further east have higher longitude values (assuming we''re using conventional
      longitude where east is positive).


      Generally speaking:

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania

      - Pennsylvania is generally east of Virginia, though it depends on the specific
      locations


      Let me think about the rough positions:

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeast US

      - Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic region, south of Pennsylvania


      Scranton, PA is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.

      Radford, VA is in the southwestern part of Virginia.


      Given these relative positions, Scranton (where Marywood is) should be further
      east than Radford (where Radford University is). This means Radford University

      - Radford is in southwestern Virginia


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      Looking at their positions on a map, Scranton, PA is significantly farther east
      than Radford, VA. Virginia extends westward more than Pennsylvania, and Radford

      Medicine in Bellevue, NE is located east of Ohio State University''s Lima Campus
      in Ohio.


      First, I need to think about the general geographic positions of Nebraska and
      Ohio in the United States:

      - Nebraska is in the Midwest, roughly in the middle of the country

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest, but it''s further east than Nebraska


      More specifically:

      - Bellevue, Nebraska is near Omaha, in the eastern part of Nebraska

      - Lima, Ohio is in the northwestern part of Ohio


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude):

      - Even the eastern edge of Nebraska is generally west of Ohio

      - Ohio is definitely east of Nebraska on a map of the United States


      So Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue, NE would be west of Ohio State University''s
      Lima Campus, not east of it.</think># Is Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue, NE located
      east of Ohio State University, Lima Campus, OH?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Nebraska Medicine is in Bellevue, Nebraska

      - Ohio State University Lima Campus is in Lima, Ohio


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Nebraska is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Ohio is also in the Midwest, but positioned significantly further east


      ## Step 3: Compare specific locations

      - Bellevue is in eastern Nebraska (near Omaha)

      - Lima is in northwestern Ohio

      - Even the easternmost parts of Nebraska are still west of Ohio


      ## Step 4: Draw conclusion based on US geography

      Nebraska is clearly west of Ohio on any US map. Therefore, Nebraska Medicine
      in Bellevue must be west (not east) of Ohio State University''s Lima Campus.

      Step 1: Identify the states:

      - Nebraska Medicine is in Bellevue, Nebraska (NE)

      - Ohio State University Lima Campus is in Lima, Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Recall the relative geographic positions of these states:

      Ohio is in the eastern part of the Midwest region of the United States, while
      Nebraska is further west in the Midwest/Great Plains region.


      Step 3: On a west-to-east directional basis:

      Nebraska is west of Ohio. This means that locations in Nebraska would generally

      First, let me identify the states and relative positions:

      - Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Ohio State University, Lima Campus is in Ohio (OH)


      Generally speaking, Nebraska is west of Ohio in the United States. Ohio borders
      the eastern part of the Midwest, while Nebraska is in the central plains region.


      The question is asking if Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is east of Ohio State Lima.
      For a location to be east of another, it would need to have a more easterly

      Step 1: Identify the states where each institution is located.

      - Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Ohio State University, Lima Campus is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      Nebraska is located in the central part of the United States, while Ohio is

      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-to-east basis.

      On a map of the United States, Nebraska is clearly west of Ohio. Ohio is much
      closer to the East Coast than Nebraska.


      Step 4: Apply this geographical relationship to the specific institutions.

      Since Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue is in Nebraska, and Ohio State University-Lima
      is in Ohio, the Nebraska institution must be west of (not east of) the Ohio

      of Houston-Victoria (in TX) is east of Judson University (in IL), I need to
      compare their relative positions on a map of the United States.


      Step 1: Let me recall where these states are located.

      - Texas (TX) is in the southern part of the United States

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 2: Let me think about their east-west positioning.

      - Illinois is definitely east of Texas when looking at a US map. Illinois is
      in the eastern half of the country, while Texas is more southwestern.


      Step 3: Now let''s consider the specific cities:

      - Victoria, TX is in southern Texas

      - I believe Judson University is in Elgin, IL, which is in the northern part
      of Illinois near Chicago


      Step 4: Since Illinois as a whole is east of Texas, and these cities don''t
      change that general relationship (they''re not at extreme edges that would reverse
      the relationship), University of Houston-Victoria would be WEST of Judson University,
      not east.


      So University of Houston-Victoria in TX is west of Judson University in IL,

      - University of Houston-Victoria is in Victoria, Texas

      Step 2: Let me determine the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Texas is located in the southern central part of the United States

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region, significantly east of Texas


      Step 3: Looking at a mental map of the US, Illinois is considerably east of
      Texas in terms of longitude.


      Step 4: Even accounting for the specific cities (Victoria in Texas and Elgin
      in Illinois), this east-west relationship remains the same. Victoria, TX is
      west of Elgin, IL.

      to determine the relative geographic locations of Oklahoma Panhandle State University
      (in Oklahoma) and Midland University (in Nebraska).


      First, let me identify where these universities are located:


      1. Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Oklahoma (OK), specifically
      in the Oklahoma Panhandle region, which is the northwestern extension of the
      state.

      2. Midland University is located in Nebraska (NE).


      Now I need to determine if the Oklahoma Panhandle State University is east of
      Midland University.


      The Oklahoma Panhandle is the westernmost part of Oklahoma, extending west from
      the main part of the state. It''s a narrow strip of land at the far western
      edge of Oklahoma.


      Nebraska is located north of Oklahoma. Midland University is in Fremont, Nebraska,
      which is in the eastern part of Nebraska.


      Looking at the geography of the United States, the Oklahoma Panhandle is in
      the western part of Oklahoma, while eastern Nebraska (where Midland University
      is) is still east of the Oklahoma Panhandle.


      So Oklahoma Panhandle State University is NOT east of Midland University - it''s
      actually west of it.</think>I need to determine if Oklahoma Panhandle State
      University (in OK) is east of Midland University (in NE).


      Step 1: Let me identify the specific locations of both universities.

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in Goodwell, Oklahoma, in the Oklahoma
      Panhandle region (the westernmost strip of Oklahoma).

      - Midland University is in Fremont, Nebraska, which is in the eastern portion
      of Nebraska.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states and locations.

      - The Oklahoma Panhandle is the westernmost part of Oklahoma, extending as a
      narrow strip west of the main part of the state.

      - Eastern Nebraska (where Fremont is located) is significantly east of the Oklahoma
      Panhandle.


      Step 3: Compare the longitude (east-west position) of both locations.

      - The Oklahoma Panhandle region is much further west than eastern Nebraska.

      - Goodwell, OK (where Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located) is west
      of Fremont, NE (where Midland University is located).


      NO. Oklahoma Panhandle State University is NOT located east of Midland University.

      Now I need to determine their specific locations and compare east-west positioning:


      Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma, which

      extension of the state.


      Midland University is located in Fremont, Nebraska, which is in eastern Nebraska.

      Nebraska as a whole is generally west of the main part of Oklahoma, but the
      Oklahoma Panhandle extends far west.

      panhandle is the narrow westernmost extension of Oklahoma that sticks out to
      the west.


      Step 2: Locate Midland University.

      Midland University is in Fremont, Nebraska, which is in the eastern portion
      of Nebraska.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positions).

      The Oklahoma Panhandle is the far western part of Oklahoma, extending westward.
      Eastern Nebraska, where Fremont is located, is significantly further east than
      the Oklahoma Panhandle.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since OPSU is in the far western Oklahoma Panhandle, and Midland University
      is in eastern Nebraska, OPSU is west of Midland University, not east.

      Oklahoma''s panhandle is the narrow strip of land extending west from the main
      part of the state. It''s the westernmost part of Oklahoma, bordering Texas,
      New Mexico, and Colorado.


      Nebraska is a state north of Oklahoma. Geographically, Nebraska lies to the
      north of Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University should be in the Oklahoma panhandle, which
      is in the far western part of Oklahoma.

      - Midland University is in Nebraska, and I believe it''s in Fremont, Nebraska,

      Since the Oklahoma panhandle is in the far western part of Oklahoma, and Fremont,

      Oklahoma Panhandle (the narrow western extension of the state).

      - Midland University is located in Fremont, Nebraska, which is in the eastern
      portion of Nebraska.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map.

      - The Oklahoma Panhandle is the westernmost part of Oklahoma, extending far
      to the west.

      - Fremont, Nebraska is relatively far east in Nebraska, not far from Omaha.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Oklahoma Panhandle State University is in the far western part of Oklahoma.

      - Midland University is in the eastern part of Nebraska.

      - Nebraska is north of Oklahoma, but the Oklahoma Panhandle extends quite far
      west.

      - Fremont, Nebraska is significantly farther east than the Oklahoma Panhandle.

      1. First, let me think about the states: Alabama (AL) and North Carolina (NC).

      2. In the United States, Alabama is in the southeastern region, and North Carolina

      - Faulkner University is in Alabama (AL)

      - Winston-Salem State University is in North Carolina (NC)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their relative positions

      Geographically:

      - Alabama is in the southeastern US, but is west of North Carolina

      - North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard, positioned east of Alabama


      More specifically:

      - Winston-Salem is in the central part of North Carolina

      - Faulkner University is in Montgomery, Alabama, which is in the central part

      - Winston-Salem State University is located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina
      (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Alabama and North Carolina.

      - On a US map, Alabama is positioned in the southeastern United States

      - North Carolina is also in the southeastern United States, but along the Atlantic
      coast

      - Alabama is situated to the west of North Carolina


      Step 3: Compare the specific cities.

      - Montgomery, AL is in the central part of Alabama

      - Winston-Salem, NC is in the north-central region of North Carolina

      further east.


      Alabama is generally west of Pennsylvania on a US map. Alabama is in the deep

      coast, while Alabama is further inland and south.


      Since Alabama is west of Pennsylvania, and Samford University is in Alabama

    33b10b9d-780d-4508-ae46-baa82e27e9d4: '<think>Let me break down this question:

      1. We need to determine if Reinhardt University in Georgia is located east of
      Keuka College in New York.

      2. To answer this, I need to think about the relative positions of Georgia and
      New York states, and more specifically these two institutions.


      First, let''s consider the general geographic positions:

      - Georgia (GA) is a southeastern state in the US

      - New York (NY) is a northeastern state in the US


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New York is generally east of most states in the US, being on the Atlantic
      coast

      - Georgia is also on the Atlantic coast, but further south


      When comparing the east-west positions, New York is typically further east than
      Georgia. This means that institutions in New York are generally east of institutions
      in Georgia.


      So Keuka College in NY should be east of Reinhardt University in GA, not the
      other way around.


      To be completely sure, I would need the exact longitudes of both institutions,
      but based on the general geographic positions of these states, Reinhardt University
      in GA is west of Keuka College in NY, not east of it.</think>To answer whether
      Reinhardt University, GA is located east of Keuka College, NY, I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic locations of the states.

      - Reinhardt University is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United
      States.

      - Keuka College is in New York (NY), which is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positioning of these states.

      - Looking at a map of the United States, New York is positioned further east
      than Georgia.

      - New York borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side.

      - Georgia also has an Atlantic coastline, but it is positioned further west
      than New York.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - While the exact locations would require specific longitude coordinates, the
      general positioning of these states makes it clear that institutions in New
      York would typically be east of those in Georgia.


      NO, Reinhardt University, GA is not located east of Keuka College, NY. It is
      located west of Keuka College.'

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Georgia (GA) is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York (NY) is located in the northeastern United States


      In general, New York is east of Georgia on a map of the United States. The eastern
      seaboard of the US runs roughly north-south, with New York being north of Georgia,
      but both states are along the Atlantic coast.


      Since Reinhardt University is in Georgia and Keuka College is in New York, it
      would be very likely that Keuka College is east of Reinhardt University, not
      the other way around.


      To be thorough, I should consider the specific locations within their respective
      states:

      - Reinhardt University is in Waleska, Georgia, which is in the northern part
      of Georgia

      - Keuka College is in Keuka Park, New York, which is in the western part of
      New York state (in the Finger Lakes region)

      - New York (NY) is in the northeastern United States


      In terms of east-west positioning, states along the east coast generally follow

      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      - Even accounting for specific locations within their states, any location in
      New York state would be east of locations in Georgia

      - Keuka College is therefore east of Reinhardt University (not the other way

      - Indiana is in the Midwest, further west than Vermont

      - Vermont is in New England, further east than Indiana


      Since Vermont is east of Indiana, and the universities are in these respective
      states, Norwich University (in Vermont) would be east of Huntington University
      (in Indiana).


      So Huntington University is NOT east of Norwich University. Rather, it''s the
      opposite - Norwich University is east of Huntington University.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      To determine if Huntington University in Indiana is located east of Norwich
      University in Vermont, I need to consider the geographic locations of these
      two states.


      1. Huntington University is located in Huntington, Indiana (IN)

      2. Norwich University is located in Northfield, Vermont (VT)

      3. Vermont is in the northeastern United States (New England region)

      4. Indiana is in the midwestern United States

      5. When looking at a map of the United States, Vermont is clearly east of Indiana

      6. Since Vermont is east of Indiana, Norwich University must be east of Huntington
      University


      Therefore, Huntington University is NOT east of Norwich University - it''s the
      other way around.

      First, let''s identify where these universities are located:

      1. Huntington University is in Huntington, Indiana (IN)

      2. Norwich University is in Northfield, Vermont (VT)


      Now I need to determine if Huntington, IN is east of Northfield, VT.


      States in the eastern US generally follow this pattern from west to east:

      - Midwest states (including Indiana)

      - Then the eastern states (including Vermont)


      Vermont is in New England, which is in the northeastern part of the United States,
      while Indiana is in the Midwest. Vermont is further east than Indiana.


      Since Vermont is east of Indiana, Huntington University (IN) would be WEST of

      - Norwich University is in Vermont (VT)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Vermont is located in the Northeast region (New England)


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning of these states.

      - Vermont is significantly further east than Indiana

      - On a US map, Vermont is near the eastern coast, while Indiana is in the central
      part of the country


      Step 4: Make the final determination based on relative locations.

      - Since Vermont is east of Indiana, Norwich University (in Vermont) is east
      of Huntington University (in Indiana)

      - Therefore, Huntington University is WEST of Norwich University, not east of
      it

      First, let me think about the geographic positions of Indiana and Vermont in
      the United States:

      - Indiana (IN) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Vermont (VT) is in the Northeast region of the United States, specifically

      - On a map of the US, Vermont would be much closer to the Atlantic coast, while
      Indiana is more centrally located


      Since Huntington University is in Indiana and Norwich University is in Vermont,
      and Vermont is east of Indiana, Huntington University would be WEST of Norwich
      University, not east.

      the US.

      - Norwich University is in Vermont (VT), which is in the Northeast region (New
      England).


      Step 2: Compare the east-west positions of these states.

      - Vermont is located on the eastern edge of the country, bordering New Hampshire
      and the Canadian province of Quebec.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest, much further west than Vermont.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion about the universities.

      - Since Huntington University is in Indiana (a western state relative to Vermont),
      and Norwich University is in Vermont (an eastern state relative to Indiana),
      Huntington University must be west, not east, of Norwich University.

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two colleges based
      on their states.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - John Brown University is in Arkansas (AR)

      - Nicolet Area Technical College is in Wisconsin (WI)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographical positions

      - Wisconsin is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Arkansas is located in the South Central region of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      - Wisconsin is positioned more eastward in the country compared to Arkansas

      - Arkansas is positioned more westward than Wisconsin


      ## Step 4: Conclusion

      Since Arkansas is west of Wisconsin, and the colleges are in these respective
      states, John Brown University would be west (not east) of Nicolet Area Technical
      College.

      1. John Brown University is located in AR (Arkansas).

      2. Nicolet Area Technical College is located in WI (Wisconsin).


      Now I need to determine whether Arkansas is east of Wisconsin. Let me think
      about the geography of the US:


      - Wisconsin is in the upper Midwest region of the United States.

      - Arkansas is in the southern United States, part of the South Central region.


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Wisconsin is roughly in the middle of the country from east to west, but leans
      toward the eastern half.

      - Arkansas is also in the middle of the country from east to west, but is southwest
      of Wisconsin.


      Looking at a mental map of the US, Wisconsin is actually east of Arkansas. Wisconsin
      borders Lake Michigan on its eastern side and is north and east of Arkansas.


      Therefore, John Brown University in Arkansas would be WEST (not east) of Nicolet
      Area Technical College in Wisconsin.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positioning of these two institutions by identifying their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - John Brown University is in Arkansas (AR)

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Wisconsin is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Arkansas is located in the South Central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Wisconsin is positioned further east in the country compared to Arkansas

      - On a US map, Wisconsin sits to the northeast of Arkansas

      - Arkansas is west of Wisconsin when comparing longitude


      Since John Brown University (in Arkansas) is west of Nicolet Area Technical
      College (in Wisconsin), not east of it:

      1. Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania (in Pennsylvania)

      2. College of the Holy Cross (in Massachusetts)


      I need to figure out if Slippery Rock University is east of Holy Cross.


      First, let me recall where these states are located. Pennsylvania (PA) is in
      the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, while Massachusetts (MA) is in
      New England in the northeastern United States.


      Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania. But the question is about specific
      universities within these states, so I need to be more precise.


      Slippery Rock University is in Slippery Rock, PA, which is in western Pennsylvania
      (near Pittsburgh).

      College of the Holy Cross is in Worcester, MA, which is in central Massachusetts.


      Given that Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, and Holy Cross is in central
      Massachusetts while Slippery Rock is in western Pennsylvania, it''s clear that
      Holy Cross is east of Slippery Rock.


      So is Slippery Rock east of Holy Cross? No, it''s the opposite. Slippery Rock
      is west of Holy Cross.</think>To determine if Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania
      is east of College of the Holy Cross, I''ll need to identify the locations of
      both institutions and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Slippery Rock University is located in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, which
      is in western Pennsylvania (not far from Pittsburgh).

      - College of the Holy Cross is located in Worcester, Massachusetts, which is
      in central Massachusetts.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Pennsylvania is located southwest of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Slippery Rock''s western Pennsylvania location puts it even further west relative
      to Massachusetts.

      - Worcester, MA is in central Massachusetts, firmly to the east of western Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - College of the Holy Cross is east of Slippery Rock University, not the other
      way around.

      Now I need to determine which one is further east. In the United States, locations
      further east have higher longitude values (assuming we''re using negative values
      for western hemisphere, the less negative number is further east).


      Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts. Massachusetts is on the east
      coast of the US, while Pennsylvania is more inland. So generally speaking, a
      location in Massachusetts would be east of a location in Pennsylvania.


      To be more precise:

      - Slippery Rock, PA is in western Pennsylvania

      - Worcester, MA is in central/eastern Massachusetts


      So Holy Cross in Massachusetts would be east of Slippery Rock University in
      Pennsylvania. That means Slippery Rock is west of Holy Cross, not east of it.</think>#
      Determining if Slippery Rock University is east of College of the Holy Cross

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Slippery Rock University is located in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania

      - College of the Holy Cross is located in Worcester, Massachusetts


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - Massachusetts is on the east coast of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts

      - More specifically, Slippery Rock is in western Pennsylvania

      - Worcester is in eastern/central Massachusetts


      ## Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions

      When comparing east-west positions in the United States, locations further east
      have higher longitude values (or less negative values, since both are in the
      western hemisphere).


      Given that Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania, and especially considering
      that Slippery Rock is in western Pennsylvania while Worcester is in eastern
      Massachusetts, College of the Holy Cross is east of Slippery Rock University,

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States, along the Atlantic coast

      - Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern United States, but south and west

      Pennsylvania is also in the northeastern US, but it''s west of Massachusetts.


      So in general, locations in Pennsylvania tend to be west of locations in Massachusetts.


      Slippery Rock University is in Pennsylvania (PA).

      College of the Holy Cross is in Massachusetts (MA).


      Since Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts, Slippery Rock University
      (in PA) would likely be west of College of the Holy Cross (in MA), not east

      is in eastern Massachusetts, making the east-west difference even more pronounced.


      Step 4: On a map of the United States, locations further east have higher longitude

      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Illinois on the map of the United States.
      If we go from east to west across the US, we would encounter Illinois before

      The general geography of the United States has Ohio to the west of New York.
      Even though Baldwin Wallace is in the northeast of Ohio and Stony Brook is on
      Long Island (eastern New York), Ohio is still west of New York state overall.


      Therefore, Baldwin Wallace University is NOT east of Stony Brook University
      School of Medicine. Baldwin Wallace is WEST of Stony Brook.</think>To determine
      if Baldwin Wallace University in Ohio is east of Stony Brook University School
      of Medicine in New York, I need to compare their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Baldwin Wallace University is located in Berea, Ohio, which is in the northeastern
      part of Ohio (near Cleveland).

      - Stony Brook University School of Medicine is located in Stony Brook, New York,
      on Long Island.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and New York.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States.

      - On a west-to-east orientation, Ohio is west of New York state.


      Step 3: Even though Baldwin Wallace is in northeastern Ohio and Stony Brook
      is on Long Island (eastern New York), the overall geographic relationship remains
      the same - Ohio is west of New York.


      NO - Baldwin Wallace University is not east of Stony Brook University School
      of Medicine. It is west of it.'

      University of Pennsylvania (in Pennsylvania).


      To solve this, I need to know the relative east-west positions of these two
      universities.


      Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (IL). Illinois is in the Midwest
      of the United States.

      East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA). Pennsylvania is in the
      northeastern United States.


      In terms of geography, Pennsylvania is to the east of Illinois. On a map of
      the US, as you move from west to east, you''d encounter Illinois before you''d
      encounter Pennsylvania.


      Since Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (a more western state)
      and East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (a more eastern state), Robert
      Morris University Illinois is located WEST of East Stroudsburg University, not
      east of it.</think># Is Robert Morris University Illinois, IL located east of
      East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, PA?


      I''ll determine this by examining the geographic locations of these institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Robert Morris University Illinois is in Illinois (IL)

      - East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Pennsylvania is located in the Northeast region


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - On a US map, Pennsylvania is positioned to the east of Illinois

      - Moving from west to east across the US, you would encounter Illinois before
      reaching Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Robert Morris University Illinois is in a state that is west of Pennsylvania,
      it cannot be east of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania.

      Now I need to think about the geographic positions:

      - Missouri is generally west of Michigan in the United States

      1. Dunwoody College of Technology in Minnesota (MN)

      2. Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio (OH)


      Specifically, it''s asking if Dunwoody College is east of Franciscan University.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Minnesota (MN) is in the upper Midwest region

      - Ohio (OH) is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, but farther east than Minnesota


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Minnesota is generally west of Ohio

      - Ohio is east of Minnesota


      Since Dunwoody College is in Minnesota and Franciscan University is in Ohio,
      Dunwoody College would be west of Franciscan University, not east of it.


      Therefore, Dunwoody College of Technology, MN is NOT located east of Franciscan
      University of Steubenville, OH.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two colleges based on their states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Dunwoody College of Technology is in Minnesota (MN)

      - Franciscan University of Steubenville is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Minnesota is significantly west of Ohio

      - Ohio borders Pennsylvania, which is considered part of the Eastern United
      States

      - Minnesota is much closer to the center of the country longitudinally


      Since Minnesota is west of Ohio, Dunwoody College of Technology (in Minnesota)
      would be west of Franciscan University of Steubenville (in Ohio), not east of

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states in the US.

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, significantly east of Minnesota


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - Minnesota borders North Dakota and South Dakota to its west, and Wisconsin
      to its east

      - Ohio borders Indiana to its west and Pennsylvania to its east

      - On a US map, Minnesota is clearly west of Ohio

      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to think about the relative
      positions of Texas and Georgia in the United States.


      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      Texas is located in the south-central United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      When looking at a US map, Georgia is clearly east of Texas. Georgia is part
      of the East Coast/Atlantic states, while Texas is much further west.


      So any location in Georgia would generally be east of any location in Texas.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states where each college is located.

      - The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is in Texas (TX)

      - University of Georgia College of Public Health is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - On a map of the United States, Georgia is positioned to the east of Texas


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      Since Georgia is east of Texas, any institution in Georgia (including the University
      of Georgia College of Public Health) would be east of any institution in Texas
      (including The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More).


      NO - The College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More in TX is NOT located east
      of the University of Georgia College of Public Health in GA. It''s the opposite:
      the Georgia institution is east of the Texas institution.'

      to find the geographic locations of both universities and determine if Bellarmine
      University in Kentucky is east of Hampton University in Virginia.


      Step 1: Locate Bellarmine University in Kentucky.

      Bellarmine University is located in Louisville, Kentucky, which is in the western
      part of Kentucky.


      Step 2: Locate Hampton University in Virginia.

      Hampton University is in Hampton, Virginia, which is in the eastern part of
      Virginia, near the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Kentucky is generally west of Virginia on the US map. Virginia borders the Atlantic
      Ocean on the east coast, while Kentucky is an inland state that does not reach
      the coast.


      Louisville, KY (where Bellarmine is) is in the western part of Kentucky, making
      it even further west compared to Hampton, VA (which is on the eastern side of
      Virginia).


      So Bellarmine University in Kentucky is located WEST of Hampton University in

      - Bellarmine University is located in Louisville, Kentucky

      - Hampton University is located in Hampton, Virginia


      Step 2: Consider the relative geographic positions of Kentucky and Virginia.

      - Kentucky is located to the west of Virginia on the US map

      - Virginia is on the eastern seaboard, while Kentucky is inland


      Step 3: Look at the specific cities.

      - Louisville is in the north-central part of Kentucky

      - Hampton is on the eastern coast of Virginia, near the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Since Kentucky as a whole is west of Virginia, and Louisville is not in the
      easternmost part of Kentucky, Bellarmine University must be west of Hampton
      University, not east.

      2. Hampton University is in eastern Virginia (near the coast)

      3. Bellarmine University is in Kentucky


      This would mean that Hampton University is east of Bellarmine University, not

      Step 3: Compare their specific positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - Louisville, Kentucky is further west in the United States

      - Hampton, Virginia is on the eastern coast near the Chesapeake Bay


      Step 4: Make the east-west comparison.

      Since Virginia is east of Kentucky, and Hampton is in eastern Virginia while

      Let''s think about the geographical locations:


      New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico.

      Troy, Alabama is located in the southeastern part of Alabama.


      To determine which is further east, I need to consider their relative positions.
      Generally speaking:

      - Louisiana is west of Alabama

      - New Orleans is in the eastern part of Louisiana

      - Troy is not on the extreme eastern edge of Alabama


      Looking at the relative positions on a mental map of the US, Alabama is east
      of Louisiana. Even though New Orleans is in eastern Louisiana and Troy is not
      on the eastern edge of Alabama, the entire state of Alabama lies east of Louisiana.


      Therefore, New Orleans University would be west of Troy University, not east
      of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' positions.

      Louisiana (LA) is located west of Alabama (AL) on the US map. Louisiana borders
      the Gulf of Mexico to the south and Texas to the west, while Alabama is two
      states to the east of Louisiana (with Mississippi in between).


      Step 2: Determine the cities'' locations within their states.

      New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana near the Gulf Coast.

      Troy is located in the southeastern part of Alabama.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      Even though New Orleans is in the eastern portion of Louisiana, the entire state
      of Alabama lies east of Louisiana. Troy University in Alabama would therefore
      be east of New Orleans University in Louisiana, not the other way around.


      NO, New Orleans University in LA is not located east of Troy University in AL.

      In terms of east-west positioning, Louisiana is west of Alabama. New Orleans
      is in Louisiana, and Troy is in Alabama.


      Since Louisiana is west of Alabama, and New Orleans is in Louisiana while Troy
      is in Alabama, New Orleans would generally be west of Troy. This means New Orleans

      of these universities:


      1. Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV).

      2. Adams State University is in Colorado (CO).


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to know their relative positions.
      The United States runs with west states on the Pacific coast and east states
      on the Atlantic coast. Let me consider the positions of Nevada and Colorado:


      Nevada is located in the western part of the US, bordered by California to the
      west, Oregon and Idaho to the north, Utah to the east, and Arizona to the south.


      Colorado is also in the western US but more centrally located than Nevada. Colorado
      is east of Utah, which is east of Nevada.


      So in terms of states, Colorado is east of Nevada.


      Given that Roseman University is in Nevada and Adams State is in Colorado, generally
      speaking, Adams State would be east of Roseman University, not the other way
      around.


      Therefore, Roseman University of Health Sciences (NV) is NOT east of Adams State
      University (CO). Rather, Adams State University would be east of Roseman University.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two universities based on the states they''re in.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Roseman University of Health Sciences is in Nevada (NV)

      - Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Nevada and Colorado.

      Nevada is located in the western United States, while Colorado is located to
      the east of Nevada. Looking at a map of the US, you can see that Nevada is closer
      to the Pacific coast, while Colorado is more inland.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      Since Colorado is east of Nevada, any location in Colorado would generally be
      east of locations in Nevada (barring unusual border configurations).


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion about these specific universities.

      Since Adams State University is in Colorado, and Colorado is east of Nevada
      where Roseman University is located, Adams State University is east of Roseman
      University, not the other way around.

      - Nevada (NV) is located in the western United States.

      - Colorado (CO) is located in the central/western United States.


      Step 2: Determine the relative position of these states to each other.

      - Nevada is positioned to the west of Colorado on the US map.

      - Colorado borders Nevada''s eastern neighbor (Utah).


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, their relative
      positions follow the same pattern.

      - Roseman University in Nevada must be west of Adams State University in Colorado.

      - For Roseman to be east of Adams State would contradict the geographic arrangement
      of these states.

      - Nevada is located in the western United States

      - Colorado is located to the east of Nevada

      - Since Nevada is west of Colorado on a map, any location in Nevada would be

      Let me think about their locations:


      1. Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana (IN). It''s likely in or near the
      city of Hammond, Indiana, which is in the northwestern part of Indiana, near
      Chicago.


      2. Widener University is in Delaware (DE). Delaware is on the East Coast of

      The United States is oriented such that the East Coast is east of the Midwest.
      Delaware is on the East Coast, while Indiana is in the Midwest.


      Therefore, Delaware is east of Indiana. This means that Widener University in
      Delaware would be east of Purdue University Calumet in Indiana.

      - Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana (IN), which is in the Midwest region
      of the United States

      - Widener University is in Delaware (DE), which is on the East Coast of the
      United States


      ## Step 2: Compare geographic positions

      - Delaware is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern United States

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest, significantly west of Delaware

      - On a map of the United States, states on the East Coast (like Delaware) are
      east of Midwestern states (like Indiana)


      ## Step 3: Make the comparison

      Since Purdue University Calumet is in Indiana (a Midwestern state) and Widener
      University is in Delaware (an East Coast state), Purdue University Calumet is
      located WEST of Widener University, not east.

      First, let me recall where these states are located:

      - CO (Colorado) is in the western part of the United States, in the Rocky Mountain
      region

      - AR (Arkansas) is in the southern part of the United States, east of Oklahoma
      and west of Mississippi


      Generally speaking, Arkansas is east of Colorado on a US map. So if we have
      a university in Colorado and another in Arkansas, the Colorado university would

      University of Northern Colorado is in Greeley, Colorado, which is in the northeastern
      part of Colorado.

      Henderson State University is in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, which is in the southwestern
      part of Arkansas.


      Even though UNC is in the eastern part of Colorado and Henderson State is in

      of Colorado. The easternmost part of Colorado is still west of the westernmost

      First, let me recall the locations:

      - Texas A&M College of Geosciences is in College Station, Texas

      - Morehead State University is in Morehead, Kentucky


      Now I need to consider their relative east-west positions. In the US, states

      Kentucky is in the eastern part of the United States, while Texas is in the
      south-central part of the United States. Kentucky is definitely east of Texas
      on the map.


      Since Morehead State University is in Kentucky, and Texas A&M College of Geosciences

      Looking at longitudes (which determine east-west positioning):

      - Places with lower longitude numbers are further east in the US

      - Places with higher longitude numbers are further west


      Generally speaking, Kentucky is east of Texas. This means Morehead State University
