      a smaller (i.e., more eastern) longitude is farther east.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Concordia University, Nebraska.

      - It is located in Seward, Nebraska.

      - Seward, NE is in the eastern part of Nebraska.

      California. Specifically, it is in Seaside, CA, near the central coast of California.

      - Coleman University was a private university located in San Diego, California.
      (Note: Coleman University closed in 2018, but for geographical purposes, we
      can still consider its last known location.)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of Seaside (Monterey Bay) and San Diego
      on a map of California.


      - Seaside (Monterey Bay) is along the central coast of California.

      - San Diego is in the far southern part of California, near the border with
      Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes of the two cities to determine which is farther
      east.


      - San Diego is located further east than Seaside. Although San Diego is farther
      south, it is also slightly farther east on the map.

      - Monterey Bay is farther west along the coast compared to San Diego.


      Conclusion: California State University, Monterey Bay is located west of Coleman
      University.

      1. **University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine** is located in Pittsburgh,

      the border with Ohio.


      2. **Westfield State University** is located in Westfield, Massachusetts. Westfield

      4. Specifically, Pittsburgh, PA is at a longitude of approximately 80 degrees
      west, while Westfield, MA is around 72.75 degrees west. Since lower longitude
