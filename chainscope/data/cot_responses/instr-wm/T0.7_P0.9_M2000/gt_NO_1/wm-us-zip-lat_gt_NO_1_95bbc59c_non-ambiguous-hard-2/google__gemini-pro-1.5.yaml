      2. **General US Geography:** New York is on the East Coast, and Washington is

      how far north or south a location is. Higher latitude means further north.

      4. **East Coast vs. West Coast Latitude:** While the US isn''t perfectly aligned
      east-west, generally speaking, locations on the East Coast share roughly similar
      latitudes with many locations on the West Coast.  The critical factor is that
      they are at very different *longitudes*.

      5. **Relevance of Zip Codes within States:**  11501 is within New York, and
      99301 is within Washington.  Their relative positions *within* their respective
      states don''t heavily influence their overall north/south positioning relative
      to each other.


      Therefore, the question is essentially asking if New York is north of Washington.  NY
      and WA span a range of latitudes, and parts of WA are north of parts of NY.

      is generally east of Texas, but a significant portion of Florida is also north
      of a significant portion of Texas.  Gainesville is in northern Florida.

      3. **Compare the latitudes:**  Since Gainesville is in northern Florida and
      Dallas is in northern Texas, a more precise comparison is needed. Looking up
      the latitudes confirms Gainesville is further north.

      north) than Western states at similar zip codes.
