      of 54180, WI, we first need to identify the geographical locations of both zip
      codes.


      1. **Locate 11767, NY**: This zip code corresponds to an area in New York, specifically
      in the town of Smithtown on Long Island. Long Island is situated to the southeast
      of New York City.


      2. **Locate 54180, WI**: This zip code is associated with an area in Wisconsin,
      specifically in the town of Waupaca, which is located in the central part of
      the state.


      3. **Compare their latitudes**: Long Island, where 11767 is located, has a latitude
      of approximately 40.9 degrees North. On the other hand, Waupaca, WI, where 54180
      is located, has a latitude of about 44.3 degrees North.


      4. **Determine their relative positions**: Since 40.9 degrees North (11767,
      NY) is less than 44.3 degrees North (54180, WI), it means that 11767 is further
      south than 54180.

      1. **Locate 24179, VA**: This zip code is in Virginia, specifically in the area
      of the town of New Castle.


      2. **Locate 03784, NH**: This zip code is in New Hampshire, specifically in
      the area of the town of Hanover.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Virginia is generally located to the south of
      New Hampshire on the map of the United States. New Hampshire is further north
      than Virginia.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 24179, VA is in Virginia and 03784, NH is in New Hampshire,
      and considering the general geography of these states, it is clear that Virginia
      is south of New Hampshire.


      Therefore, 24179, VA is not located north of 03784, NH.


      The answer is NO.'
