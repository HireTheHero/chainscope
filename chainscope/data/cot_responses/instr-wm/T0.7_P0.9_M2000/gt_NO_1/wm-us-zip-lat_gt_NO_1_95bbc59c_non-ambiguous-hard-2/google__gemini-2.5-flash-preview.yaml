      \ specific US zip code (77044, TX) is located geographically north of another\
      \ specific US zip code (90037, CA).\n\n2.  **Understand what determines \"north\
      \ of\" in a geographical context:** To determine if one location is north of\
      \ another, we need to compare their latitudes. A higher latitude means a location\
      \ is further north.\n\n3.  **Recognize the information provided:** We are given\
      \ two zip codes: 77044 (Texas) and 90037 (California). We are *not* directly\
      \ given their latitude and longitude coordinates.\n\n4.  **Determine how to\
      \ find the necessary information:** Zip codes are geographical areas. To compare\
      \ their locations (specifically their latitude), we need to find representative\
      \ coordinates for each zip code. The centroid (approximate center) of a zip\
      \ code is a common way to do this.\n\n5.  **Find the coordinates for 77044,\
      \ TX:**\n    *   Search for \"latitude longitude 77044 TX\".\n    *   Common\

      \ ~34.01\xB0 N\n\n8.  **Interpret the comparison:** Since 34.01 is greater than\
      \ 29.93, 90037, CA is located at a higher latitude than 77044, TX. A higher\
      \ latitude means it is further north.\n\n9.  **Formulate the answer based on\
      \ the interpretation:** The question asks if 77044, TX is *north* of 90037,\

      \ 77044, TX is *south* of 90037, CA.\n\n10. **Convert the conclusion to a YES/NO\
      \ answer:** The conclusion is that 77044, TX is *not* north of 90037, CA. Thus,\
      \ the answer is NO.\n\n11. **Final check:** Does the reasoning directly lead\

    a0be59e8-789a-43e5-91ee-fa7a0ab7419b: 'Step 1: Identify the locations corresponding
      to the zip codes.

      86326 is in Clarkdale, Arizona.

      94544 is in Hayward, California.


      Step 2: Determine the general latitude of each location.

      Clarkdale, AZ is located in central Arizona.

      Hayward, CA is located in the San Francisco Bay Area.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Arizona is generally located further south than Northern California. Central
      Arizona is roughly at the same latitude or slightly south of the San Francisco
      Bay Area.


      Step 4: To be more precise, find the approximate latitude of each location.

      Clarkdale, AZ latitude is approximately 34.77 degrees North.

      Hayward, CA latitude is approximately 37.67 degrees North.


      Step 5: Compare the latitudes directly.

      34.77 is less than 37.67. A lower latitude means a location is further south.


      Step 6: Based on the latitude comparison, determine which location is north
      of the other.

      Since 86326 (Clarkdale, AZ) has a lower latitude than 94544 (Hayward, CA), 86326
      is located south of 94544.

      asks about 40422, KY and 10457, NY.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Kentucky (KY) is typically
      considered a Southern or East South Central state. New York (NY) is a Northeastern
      state.

      3.  **Consider the relative latitude of the states:** States in the Northeast
      are generally at higher latitudes (further north) than states in the South/East
      South Central region.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** Since New York is north of Kentucky, any location
      in New York will be north of any location in Kentucky, assuming we are talking
      about the main contiguous parts of the states.

      5.  **Specific zip codes within states:** While zip codes represent specific
      areas, the general geographic position of the states dictates the overall north/south
      relationship. 10457 is in the Bronx, NY. 40422 is in Danville, KY.

      6.  **Conclusion based on state locations:** New York State is located north
      of Kentucky. Therefore, any location in New York will be north of any location
      in Kentucky.

      \ Both New York and Washington state are located in the northern part of the\
      \ continental US. However, Washington state is generally further north than\
      \ New York state. For example, the northern border of Washington is at the US-Canada\

      Carolina. North Carolina is also in the southeastern United States, located
      north of Florida.

      3.  **Consider the typical structure of US ZIP codes:** While ZIP codes are
      primarily for mail delivery and don''t perfectly align with latitude, they generally
      follow a geographical pattern. Lower ZIP codes in the eastern US tend to be
      further north, and higher ZIP codes tend to be further south (though there are
      many exceptions and edge cases, especially within states).

      of the US. Virginia (VA) is on the east coast of the US.

      3.  **Consider the general north/south relationship:** In the continental US,
      moving from the west coast to the east coast involves primarily moving eastward,
      not significantly northward or southward across the entire country.

      4.  **Find the latitude of 92887, CA:** 92887 is in Corona, California. The
      approximate latitude of Corona, CA is around 33.8 degrees North.

      \   *   03303 is in New Hampshire (NH).\n    *   98229 is in Washington (WA).\n\
      \n4.  **Locate the states geographically (roughly):**\n    *   New Hampshire\

      \ Washington (WA) is on the west coast of the US, in the northwestern region.\n\
      \n5.  **Compare the *general* latitude of the states:** The northeastern US\
      \ (where NH is) is generally at a lower latitude (further south) than the northwestern\
      \ US (where WA is). Think of the US map: the northern border of Washington is\
      \ the Canadian border, while the northern border of New Hampshire is also the\
      \ Canadian border, but significantly further south than the WA/Canada border.\n\
      \n6.  **Consider potential edge cases/details (optional but good for confirmation):**\
      \ While zip codes can represent specific points, the question is about the *location*\

      \ state compared to the span of the US latitude. Washington is also a state.\
      \ The northernmost point of NH is considerably south of the northernmost point\
      \ of WA. Even the southernmost point of WA is likely north of the southernmost\
      \ point of NH.\n\n7.  **Formulate the answer based on the latitude comparison:**\
      \ New Hampshire is located in the northeastern US, which is generally south\

      \ question asks if 03303, NH is *north* of 98229, WA.\n7. Since NH is south\
      \ of WA, the answer is no.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:** Since New Hampshire\
      \ is located in a more southerly latitude range than Washington, a location\
      \ in New Hampshire (like 03303) will be south of a location in Washington (like\
      \ 98229). Therefore, 03303, NH is *not* north of 98229, WA.\n\n**YES/NO Answer:**\
      \ Based on the reasoning, the answer is NO.\n\nStep 1: Identify the states associated\

      \ (WA).\n\nStep 2: Determine the general geographical location of each state\
      \ within the US.\n- New Hampshire (NH) is located in the northeastern United\
      \ States.\n- Washington (WA) is located in the northwestern United States.\n\
      \nStep 3: Compare the relative latitudes of the northeastern and northwestern\
      \ regions of the US.\n- The northwestern US (where WA is) extends significantly\
      \ further north than the northeastern US (where NH is). Think of the US map;\
      \ the northern border of Washington is much further north than the northern\
      \ border of New Hampshire.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the relative north-south position\
      \ of a location in NH compared to a location in WA.\n- Because Washington is\
      \ located at a higher latitude range than New Hampshire, a location in New Hampshire\
      \ will generally be south of a location in Washington.\n\nStep 5: Apply the\
      \ conclusion to the specific question.\n- The question asks if 03303, NH is\

      4.  **Compare the latitudinal position:** Both states are in the southern half
      of the US, but South Carolina is generally at a similar or slightly lower latitude
      than northern California. However, the question asks about *north* of.

      5.  **Consider the overall geography:** Due to the vast distance across the

      north of a location in California. California is significantly further west
      and generally at a similar or higher latitude in its northern parts compared
      to South Carolina. The question asks if SC is north of CA, which it is not.

      \ KY is around 37.7\xB0N, and American Fork, UT is around 40.4\xB0N.\n6.  Compare\
      \ the latitudes: 40.4\xB0N (Utah) is higher than 37.7\xB0N (Kentucky).\n7. \
      \ Therefore, 84009, UT is north of 40475, KY.\n8.  The question asks if 40475,\
      \ KY is north of 84009, UT. Since 84009, UT is north of 40475, KY, then 40475,\
      \ KY must be south of 84009, UT.\n9.  The answer to the question \"Is 40475,\
      \ KY located north of 84009, UT?\" is NO.\n\nNO"

      asks about the relative position of 76148, TX and 87301, NM.

      2. **Determine the general location of each state:** Texas is generally south
      of New Mexico.

      3. **Consider the specific zip codes:** While general state positions are helpful,
      specific locations within states can vary significantly. However, without looking
      up the exact latitudes, the general north-south relationship of the states is
      a strong indicator.

      4. **Infer relative positions:** Since Texas is generally south of New Mexico,
      a zip code in Texas is likely to be south of a zip code in New Mexico.


      Therefore, 76148, TX is likely located south of 87301, NM.

      code is associated with Gallup, New Mexico. Gallup is located in northwestern
      New Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare the latitude of Fort Worth, TX, and Gallup, NM. Fort Worth has
      a latitude of approximately 32.75 degrees North. Gallup has a latitude of approximately
      35.52 degrees North.


      Step 4: A location with a higher North latitude is located further north than
      a location with a lower North latitude.

      state, known for being quite far south. Louisiana (LA) is a state in the southern
      US, west of Florida.

      3.  **Compare the latitude of the states:** Generally, Louisiana is situated
      further north than the southern parts of Florida.

      4.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** 33187 is located in Miami-Dade County,
      Florida, which is in the very southern part of the state. 70062 is located in
      Metairie, Louisiana, near New Orleans.

      \ While they generally correspond to a region, they don't tell you the exact\
      \ latitude or longitude of a single point within that region.\n\n3.  **Determine\
      \ the General Location of each Zip Code:**\n    *   14892 is in New York (NY).\n\
      \    *   97227 is in Oregon (OR).\n\n4.  **Consider the Relative Geographic\
      \ Positions of New York and Oregon:** New York is located on the East Coast\
      \ of the United States. Oregon is located on the West Coast of the United States.\n\
      \n5.  **Consider Latitude:** To determine if one location is north of another,\
      \ we need to compare their latitudes. While we don't have exact latitudes for\
      \ the zip codes, we know the general latitude ranges of the states.\n    * \
      \  New York's latitude generally ranges from around 40\xB0 N to 45\xB0 N.\n\
      \    *   Oregon's latitude generally ranges from around 42\xB0 N to 46\xB0 N.\n\
      \n6.  **Compare the General Latitudes:** There is significant overlap in the\
      \ latitude ranges of New York and Oregon. Some parts of New York are further\
      \ south than some parts of Oregon, and some parts of Oregon are further north\
      \ than some parts of New York.\n\n7.  **Find More Specific Location Information\
      \ (if necessary):** Since the general state latitudes overlap, we need to be\
      \ more specific about the zip codes.\n    *   14892 is the zip code for Waverly,\
      \ New York. Waverly is located near the Pennsylvania border in the southern\
      \ part of New York. Its approximate latitude is around 41.98\xB0 N.\n    * \
      \  97227 is a zip code in the Portland, Oregon area. Its approximate latitude\
      \ is around 45.55\xB0 N.\n\n8.  **Compare the Specific Latitudes:**\n    * \
      \  14892 (Waverly, NY): ~41.98\xB0 N\n    *   97227 (Portland, OR area): ~45.55\xB0\
      \ N\n\n9.  **Draw the Conclusion:** A higher latitude indicates a location further\
      \ north. Since 45.55\xB0 N is greater than 41.98\xB0 N, 97227, OR is located\
      \ north of 14892, NY.\n\n10. **Formulate the Final Answer:** The question asks\

      state in the US. Kentucky is a southern state in the US, located south of states
      like Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, which are themselves south of New York.


      4.  **Compare the general latitudes:** New York is generally located at a higher
      latitude (further north) than Kentucky.


      5.  **Apply to specific zip codes:** While specific points within a state can
      vary, the vast majority of locations in Kentucky will be south of the vast majority
      of locations in New York due to the overall geographic position of the states.
      It is highly improbable that a location in Kentucky would be north of a location
      in New York.


      6.  **Conclusion:** A location in Kentucky is almost certainly south of a location
      in New York. Therefore, 42420, KY is located south of 14204, NY.

      the question:


      1.  **Determine the location of 91356, CA:** The "CA" indicates California.
      To determine if it''s north of the other location, we need to find its approximate
      latitude. 91356 is in the Los Angeles area (specifically, Stevenson Ranch).
      The Los Angeles area is in Southern California.


      2.  **Determine the location of 61610, IL:** The "IL" indicates Illinois. To
      determine if 91356 is north of it, we need to find the approximate latitude
      of this Illinois location. 61610 is in the Peoria, Illinois area.


      3.  **Compare the latitudes:** Southern California (Los Angeles area) is at
      a relatively southern latitude in the continental US. Illinois, particularly
      the central part where Peoria is located, is significantly further north than
      Southern California.


      4.  **Conclusion based on latitude:** A location at a more southern latitude
      is geographically south of a location at a more northern latitude. Since Los
      Angeles (91356) is south of Peoria (61610) in terms of latitude, 91356 CA is

      asks about 85131, AZ and 22134, VA.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** AZ (Arizona) is in the
      southwestern United States. VA (Virginia) is in the eastern United States.

      3.  **Determine the general latitude of each state:** Arizona is generally located
      at lower latitudes (closer to the equator, further south) than Virginia. Virginia
      is further north than Arizona.

      4.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While zip codes don''t directly correspond
      to latitude in a simple linear way across the entire country, the state location
      is the primary factor determining the general north-south position.

      5.  **Compare the general latitudes:** Virginia is generally north of Arizona.

      6.  **Conclusion based on state location:** Therefore, a location in Arizona
      (like 85131) is likely south of a location in Virginia (like 22134).

      \ We need to confirm the latitude of these specific locations.\n    *   Sandy\
      \ Springs, GA (30350) is a northern suburb of Atlanta, located around 33.9 degrees\

      \ the latitudes:** A location further north has a higher latitude number (in\
      \ the Northern Hemisphere). Since 38.2 is greater than 33.9, Staunton, VA (24482)\
      \ is geographically north of Sandy Springs, GA (30350).\n\n5.  **Answer the\
      \ question:** The question asks if 30350, GA is *north* of 24482, VA. Based\
      \ on the comparison, 30350, GA is *south* of 24482, VA.\n\nNO"

      asks about the relative north-south position of two locations, identified by
      their zip codes and states: 30350, GA and 24482, VA.


      2. **Determine the general location of each state:** Georgia (GA) is in the
      southeastern United States. Virginia (VA) is in the mid-Atlantic region of the
      United States, generally north of Georgia.


      3. **Consider the impact of specific zip codes:** While states have a general
      north-south relationship, specific zip codes represent smaller areas within
      those states. It''s possible that a very northern point in Georgia could be
      north of a very southern point in Virginia, or vice versa.


      4. **Mentally visualize or look up the locations:** A general mental map or
      a quick search of the zip codes on a mapping service would confirm the relative
      positions.


      5. **Compare the latitudes:** While not strictly necessary for a simple comparison,
      knowing that Virginia is generally north of Georgia confirms that most locations
      in Virginia will be at a higher latitude (further north) than most locations
      in Georgia.


      6. **Conclude the relative position:** Based on the general locations of the
      states and the typical north-south orientation of the US, a location in Virginia
      is likely to be north of a location in Georgia.


      7. **Formulate the final answer:** Since 24482 is in Virginia and 30350 is in
      Georgia, and Virginia is generally north of Georgia, 30350, GA is located south
      of 24482, VA.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is 30350, GA located north of 24482,
      VA?" is NO.

      4. **Compare the general latitudes:** Based on the general location of the states,
      Virginia is further north than Georgia.


      5. **Relate the zip codes to the state locations:** Therefore, a location in
      Virginia (24482) is likely to be north of a location in Georgia (30350).


      6. **Formulate the answer:** Based on the above reasoning, 30350, GA is located
      south of 24482, VA. Therefore, 30350, GA is *not* located north of 24482, VA.

      1.  **Identify the locations:** We need to compare the locations of the zip
      code 30350 in Georgia (GA) and the zip code 24482 in Virginia (VA).

      2.  **Approximate Location for 30350, GA:** Zip code 30350 is in Sandy Springs,
      a northern suburb of Atlanta, GA. Atlanta is in the northern part of Georgia.

      3.  **Approximate Location for 24482, VA:** Zip code 24482 is in Staunton, Virginia,
      which is in the Shenandoah Valley region, roughly in the northwestern part of
      Virginia.

      4.  **Compare the general geographical positions:** Georgia is located south
      of Virginia in the United States.

      5.  **Determine the relative north/south position:** Since Georgia is south
      of Virginia, *any* location in Georgia will be south of *any* location in Virginia,
      assuming they are within their respective state boundaries.


      Therefore, 30350, GA is located south of 24482, VA.

      4.  **Focus on latitude:** The question asks about *north* of. This relates
      to latitude. States further south are at lower latitudes than states further
      north. Nebraska is generally south of New York.

      5.  **Conclusion:** A specific location within Nebraska (like 68506) will be
      at a lower latitude (further south) than a specific location within New York
      (like 13502). Therefore, 68506, NE is *south* of 13502, NY.

      2. **Determine the general location of each state:** Mississippi is in the Southern
      US. Pennsylvania is in the Northeastern US.

      3. **Compare the latitude:** States in the Southern US are generally at lower
      latitudes (further south) than states in the Northeastern US. Therefore, Mississippi
      is generally south of Pennsylvania.

      4. **Consider the specific zip codes within the states:** While individual zip
      codes within a large state can vary in their precise north-south position, the
      overall position of the states is the primary factor here. A zip code in the

      30566 is in Georgia (GA).

      07852 is in New Jersey (NJ).


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic location of each state within the US.

      Georgia is located in the southeastern United States.

      New Jersey is located in the northeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare the general latitude of the southeastern US to the northeastern
      US.

      The northeastern US is generally located at a higher latitude (further north)
      than the southeastern US.


      Step 4: Therefore, New Jersey is generally located north of Georgia.


      Step 5: Since New Jersey is generally north of Georgia, a location in Georgia
      is generally south of a location in New Jersey.


      Step 6: The question asks if 30566, GA is located *north* of 07852, NJ. Based
      on the general location of the states, this is unlikely. While there can be
      slight variations within states, the overall latitudinal difference between

      asks about the relative location of two zip codes: 37127, TN and 95605, CA.

      2.  **Determine the states:** 37127 is in Tennessee (TN). 95605 is in California
      (CA).

      3.  **Determine the general geographical locations of the states:** Tennessee
      is located in the southeastern United States. California is located on the west
      coast of the United States.

      4.  **Compare the latitudes:** States in the southeastern US (like Tennessee)
      are generally located at more northerly latitudes than states on the southern
      part of the west coast (like California). While latitude varies within states,
      comparing the general positions on a map or considering that Tennessee is further
      inland and north compared to California''s southern coastal region is sufficient
      for a general comparison. Tennessee''s average latitude is higher (further north)
      than California''s average latitude.

      5.  **Confirm the relative position:** Based on the general geographical location
      of the states, Tennessee is situated significantly further north than California.
      Therefore, any location within Tennessee will be north of any location within
      California.

      2.  **Recognize the need for geographical location:** Zip codes are postal codes,
      but they correspond to geographical areas. To compare their relative north/south
      positions, I need to know where these areas are.

      3.  **Determine the location of 34108, FL:** A quick search or general knowledge
      indicates 34108 is in Naples, Florida. Naples is on the southwest coast of Florida.

      4.  **Determine the location of 29404, SC:** A quick search or general knowledge
      indicates 29404 is in Charleston, South Carolina. Charleston is on the coast
      of South Carolina.

      5.  **Compare the latitudes:** Florida is generally south of South Carolina.
      Naples, Florida, is in the southern half of Florida. Charleston, South Carolina,
      is in South Carolina.

      6.  **Visualize or confirm on a map:** Mentally picture or look at a map of

      the general geographic locations of 27707 (Durham, NC) and 11782 (Stony Brook,
      NY).

      3.  **Determine the relative latitude:** North/south relationships are determined
      by latitude. We need to compare the latitude of Durham, NC with the latitude
      of Stony Brook, NY.

      4.  **Recall or look up general locations:** North Carolina is a state south
      of New York. Durham, NC is in North Carolina. Stony Brook, NY is on Long Island
      in New York.

      5.  **Infer the latitude relationship:** Since NC is south of NY, a location
      in NC (like Durham) will be at a lower latitude (further south) than a location
      in NY (like Stony Brook).

      6.  **Compare latitudes:** A lower latitude means further south. Therefore,
      27707 (Durham, NC) is south of 11782 (Stony Brook, NY).

      \ the general location of California:** California is a western state in the\
      \ United States.\n3.  **Determine the general location of New Jersey:** New\
      \ Jersey is an eastern state in the United States.\n4.  **Understand \"north\
      \ of\":** In geography, \"north of\" means having a higher latitude. The higher\
      \ the latitude number (positive values for the Northern Hemisphere), the further\
      \ north a location is.\n5.  **Consider the relative positions on a map:** The\
      \ continental United States is roughly rectangular. California is on the west\
      \ coast, and New Jersey is on the east coast. There's a significant distance\
      \ east-west.\n6.  **Compare latitudes:** While specific latitude data for these\
      \ zip codes isn't immediately available without looking it up, we can reason\

      zip codes are specific to smaller areas, the state in which a zip code is located
      provides a strong indication of its general latitude.


      4. **Compare the general locations based on the states:** Since Georgia is south
      of North Carolina, it is highly likely that a location within Georgia will be
      south of a location within North Carolina.


      5. **Confirm with a quick mental check or map if necessary:** A quick mental
      visualization or glance at a map confirms that GA is indeed south of NC.


      6. **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:** Since 31206 is in GA and
      28602 is in NC, and GA is south of NC, 31206, GA is located south of 28602,
      NC.

      is in North Carolina (NC).

      3. **Consider the relative geographic positions of Georgia and North Carolina:**
      Georgia is located to the south of North Carolina.

      4. **Reason about the relative locations of the zip codes within their states:**
      While we can''t pinpoint the exact locations within the states just from the

      \ is a state in the Southeastern United States.\n    *   New York (NY) is a\
      \ state in the Northeastern United States.\n\n4.  **Compare the general latitude\
      \ of the states:** New York is generally located further north than Virginia.\n\
      \n5.  **Consider the specific zip codes:** While we don't need the exact coordinates,\
      \ knowing the state is usually sufficient for a YES/NO question like this, especially\
      \ when comparing states with such a clear north-south relationship. The 22124\
      \ zip code is in Fairfax County, Virginia, near Washington D.C. The 10927 zip\
      \ code is in Orange County, New York, near West Point. Both zip codes are representative\
      \ of their respective states' general latitude range.\n\n6.  **Formulate the\
      \ conclusion:** Since New York is located north of Virginia, a location in New\
      \ York (10927) will be located north of a location in Virginia (22124). Therefore,\
      \ the statement \"22124, VA is located north of 10927, NY\" is false.\n\n7.\
      \  **Determine the final answer:** The question asks if 22124, VA is *north\
      \ of* 10927, NY. Our conclusion is the opposite: 10927, NY is north of 22124,\
      \ VA. Therefore, 22124, VA is *south of* 10927, NY.\n\nNO"
    fdafcead-e170-431a-a116-00d635ab6af1: '1. **Identify the states:** The question
      asks about a zip code in Virginia (VA) and a zip code in New York (NY).

      2. **Determine the general location of each state:** New York is a state in
      the northeastern United States. Virginia is a state in the mid-Atlantic/southeastern
      United States.

      3. **Compare the general locations:** New York is generally located north of
      Virginia.

      4. **Consider whether specific zip codes within these states would alter this
      general relationship:** While there might be slight variations within each state,
      it is highly unlikely that a location in Virginia would be geographically north
      of a location in New York given the overall positions of the states.


      Therefore, based on the general geographical relationship between New York and
      Virginia, 22124, VA is not located north of 10927, NY.


      The answer is NO.'
