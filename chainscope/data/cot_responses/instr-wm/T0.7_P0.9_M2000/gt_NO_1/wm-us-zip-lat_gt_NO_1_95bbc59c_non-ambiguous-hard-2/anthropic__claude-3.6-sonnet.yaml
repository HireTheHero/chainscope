      1. Let me identify these locations:

      - 46013 is in Anderson, Indiana (IN)

      - 54143 is in Marinette, Wisconsin (WI)


      2. Let me consider their relative positions:

      - Indiana is located in the central part of the United States

      - Wisconsin is located north of Indiana

      - Marinette, WI (54143) is in the northeastern part of Wisconsin

      - Anderson, IN (46013) is in central Indiana


      3. Since Wisconsin is entirely north of Indiana, and any point in Wisconsin
      (including Marinette) must be north of any point in Indiana (including Anderson),
      then 54143 must be north of 46013.


      4. Therefore, 46013 (IN) is NOT north of 54143 (WI) - it''s the other way around.

      1) First, let me identify these locations:

      - 24179 is in Roanoke, Virginia (VA)

      - 03784 is in West Lebanon, New Hampshire (NH)


      2) Looking at the US map:

      - Virginia is in the southeastern United States

      - New Hampshire is in the northeastern United States


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - New Hampshire is one of the northernmost states in the continental US

      - Virginia is significantly further south than New Hampshire


      4) Therefore, any location in Virginia (including 24179) must be south of any
      location in New Hampshire (including 03784)


      NO (24179, VA is not located north of 03784, NH)'
