      the locations of the two zip codes and compare their positions.


      1. **Identify the states**: The first zip code, 25601, is located in West Virginia
      (WV), and the second zip code, 49445, is located in Michigan (MI).


      2. **General geographic knowledge**: West Virginia is generally southeast of
      Michigan. However, to determine if 25601 is north of 49445, we need more specific
      information about their latitudes.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: Without exact coordinates, we can use general knowledge
      that Michigan is at a higher latitude than West Virginia. This is because Michigan
      is located in the northern United States, and West Virginia is considered part
      of the southeastern or northeastern United States, depending on the context,
      but it is south of Michigan.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic locations of West Virginia
      and Michigan, and knowing that 25601 is in West Virginia and 49445 is in Michigan,
      it is reasonable to conclude that 25601, WV is south of 49445, MI, given Michigan''s

      \ based on the general geographical relationship between Virginia and Pennsylvania,\
      \ would lean towards \"NO\", 23832, VA is not located north of 15061, PA, due\

      of 03079, NH, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the states**: 40108 is located in Kentucky (KY), and 03079 is
      located in New Hampshire (NH).

      2. **General geographic knowledge**: Kentucky is generally considered to be
      in the southeastern part of the United States, while New Hampshire is in the
      northeastern part.

      3. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one is north of the other, we need
      to compare their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use general knowledge
      that Kentucky is at a lower latitude than New Hampshire because it is farther
      south.

      4. **Conclusion**: Since Kentucky is south of New Hampshire, any point in Kentucky,
      including the zip code 40108, will be south of any point in New Hampshire, including
      the zip code 03079.

      (SC) and 19031 in Pennsylvania (PA), and then compare their positions to determine
      if 29033 is located north of 19031.


      1. **Identify the states and their general locations**: South Carolina is located

      part of the country.


      2. **Understand the general latitude of each state**: Generally, South Carolina

      and 19031 is in Pennsylvania. Given the general positions of these states, it''s

      to each other, specifically in terms of north-south orientation.


      1. **Identify the states**: The zip code 70711 is located in Louisiana (LA),
      and the zip code 37128 is located in Tennessee (TN).


      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Louisiana is generally south of Tennessee.
      Louisiana is located in the southeastern part of the United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico, while Tennessee is located further north, also in the eastern
      part of the U.S.


      3. **Specific zip code locations**: Without specific city names provided, we
      still need to understand that zip codes are assigned based on postal regions
      and do not strictly follow state borders or perfectly align with geographical
      features. However, they generally reflect the urban and rural distribution within
      states.


      4. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of the other,
      we can compare their latitudes. Generally, the farther north a location is,
      the higher its latitude. Without looking up the exact cities for these zip codes,
      we can infer based on state locations that Tennessee is north of Louisiana.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Louisiana (LA) is south of Tennessee (TN), any
      location within Louisiana, such as the area covered by the 70711 zip code, would
      be south of any location in Tennessee, such as the area covered by the 37128
      zip code.


      Therefore, the answer to whether 70711, LA is located north of 37128, TN is:
      **NO**.'

      1. **Identify the states**: 70067 is in Louisiana (LA), and 28401 is in North
      Carolina (NC).


      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Louisiana is generally southwest of North
      Carolina in the United States. This suggests that Louisiana is likely south
      of North Carolina, given the general geography of the eastern United States.


      3. **Specific locations**: The zip code 70067 refers to a location in Louisiana.
      Without specific city knowledge, we know it''s in LA. The zip code 28401 refers
      to a location in North Carolina, specifically in or around Wilmington, NC, which
      is in the southeastern part of the state, near the coast.


      4. **Latitude comparison**: To be north of a location, an area must have a higher
      latitude. Louisiana''s latitude ranges are generally lower than North Carolina''s
      because it is located further south.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Louisiana is south of North Carolina and considering
      the general latitude differences, 70067, LA would be south of 28401, NC, not
