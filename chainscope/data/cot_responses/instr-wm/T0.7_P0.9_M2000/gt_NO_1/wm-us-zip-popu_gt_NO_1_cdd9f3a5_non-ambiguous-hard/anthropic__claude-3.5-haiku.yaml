    9de0f4b8-7bbd-41ed-92b8-77d53762d365: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll need to find the population of zip code 76009 in Texas

      2. Then, I''ll find the population of zip code 48309 in Michigan

      3. Then I''ll compare their populations


      Step 1: 76009 is a zip code for Arlington, Texas

      - Arlington is a significant city in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex

      - As of the 2020 census, Arlington has a population of around 394,000


      Step 2: 48309 is a zip code for Rochester Hills, Michigan

      - Rochester Hills is a suburb of Detroit

      - As of the 2020 census, Rochester Hills has a population of around 74,000


      Step 3: Comparing populations

      - Arlington (76009): ~394,000

      - Rochester Hills (48309): ~74,000

      - 394,000 is significantly larger than 74,000


      Therefore, 76009, TX is more populous than 48309, MI.

    21fe0dd8-1265-4249-b551-ab5e03986ddc: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look up the population of the area with zip code 15063 in Pennsylvania

      - 15063 is the zip code for Monaca, Pennsylvania

      - Monaca is a small borough in Beaver County

      - Its population is approximately 6,200 people


      2. Next, I''ll look up the population of the area with zip code 95945 in California

      - 95945 is the zip code for Nevada City, California

      - Nevada City is a small historic town in Nevada County

      - Its population is approximately 3,100 people


      3. Comparing the populations:

      - Monaca, PA (15063): ~6,200 people

      - Nevada City, CA (95945): ~3,100 people


      4. Conclusion:

      Since Monaca, PA has about twice the population of Nevada City, CA, 15063 is
      more populous than 95945.

      1. First, I''ll need to look up the population of the areas associated with
      these zip codes.


      2. 15063 is a zip code in Pennsylvania, specifically in Sewickley, which is
      near Pittsburgh.


      3. 95945 is a zip code in California, located in Nevada County.


      4. To determine which is more populous, I''ll need population data.


      5. Sewickley (15063) is a relatively small suburban area near Pittsburgh.


      6. Nevada County (95945) is a rural area in California''s Sierra Nevada foothills.

    fabf9905-12bb-4c39-9bcb-4f4f47387241: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look up the population of 10920, NY (Monroe, Orange County)

      - This zip code is in a relatively rural area

      - Population is approximately 4,500-5,000 people


      2. Next, I''ll look up the population of 29406, SC (North Charleston area)

      - This zip code is in a more urban/suburban region

      - Population is approximately 20,000-25,000 people


      3. Comparing the two populations:

      - 29406, SC has significantly more people than 10920, NY

      - The South Carolina zip code is about 4-5 times more populous
