      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in Pennsylvania (PA)

      - Sacred Heart Cathedral is in Rochester, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider their general geographic positions.

      - Pennsylvania is generally west of New York State

      - However, I need to check the specific locations since parts of western NY
      could be west of eastern PA


      Step 3: Rochester is in western New York, near Lake Ontario

      - Rochester is located in the western portion of New York state

      - Sacred Heart Cathedral would be in Rochester


      Step 4: Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is in central Pennsylvania

      - This reservoir would be in the central region of Pennsylvania


      Step 5: Compare their relative positions.

      - Western New York (where Rochester is) is still east of central Pennsylvania

      - Therefore, Sacred Heart Cathedral in Rochester would be east of Foster Joseph
      Sayers Reservoir


      Since Sacred Heart Cathedral is east of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, the
      reservoir cannot be east of the cathedral.

      - Pennsylvania is generally south and west of New York State.

      - Rochester is in western New York, near Lake Ontario.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Western New York (where Rochester is located) is actually west of central
      Pennsylvania (where the Sayers Reservoir is located).

      - Rochester is positioned farther west in the state of New York, while the reservoir
      is in central Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir in PA is actually EAST of Sacred Heart Cathedral
      in Rochester, NY, despite Pennsylvania generally being west of New York State.
      This is because Rochester is in the western part of New York, and the reservoir
      is in central Pennsylvania.


      NO - Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is not east of Sacred Heart Cathedral. It
      is west of it.

      northwestern part of Los Angeles.


      Step 2: Let me recall the location of the First African Methodist Episcopal
      Church of Los Angeles.

      The First African Methodist Episcopal Church is located in central Los Angeles,
      in an area that would be south of Hollywood.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      The Hollywood Sign is in the northwestern part of Los Angeles, while the First
      African Methodist Episcopal Church is in a more central area of Los Angeles.


      In terms of east-west positioning, the Hollywood Sign is to the west of central
      Los Angeles, while the First African Methodist Episcopal Church is in a more
      central location, which would be east of the Hollywood Hills area.


      Therefore, the Hollywood Sign is NOT east of the First African Methodist Episcopal
      Church. In fact, it''s the opposite - the church is east of the Hollywood Sign.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both theaters.

      - Charles Playhouse is located at 74 Warrenton Street in Boston''s Theater District.

      - Colonial Theatre is located at 106 Boylston Street in Boston''s Theater District.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation in Boston.

      - In Boston, east-west orientation generally follows the street grid, with east
      being toward the harbor/waterfront.

      - Warrenton Street runs roughly northwest to southeast.

      - Boylston Street runs roughly west to east.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Charles Playhouse is located in the Theater District, slightly south of Boylston
      Street.

      - Colonial Theatre is on Boylston Street itself.

      - The Charles Playhouse is slightly southeast of the Colonial Theatre.

      - In Boston''s orientation, this means the Charles Playhouse is slightly east
      of the Colonial Theatre.


      NO


      Wait, I need to double-check this. Looking more precisely at their locations:

      - Colonial Theatre is at 106 Boylston Street

      - Charles Playhouse is at 74 Warrenton Street

      - When mapped, Charles Playhouse is indeed slightly southeast of Colonial Theatre,
      which means it is east of Colonial Theatre.

      Step 2: Since both theaters are in Boston''s Theater District, I need to determine
      their east-west relationship.

      - In Boston, locations further east have a more easterly position.

      - The Theater District is a relatively compact area, so I need to consider the
      specific streets.


      Step 3: Looking at the street layout in Boston:

      - Warrenton Street (Charles Playhouse) runs roughly northwest to southeast.

      - Boylston Street (Colonial Theatre) is a major east-west street.

      - The Colonial Theatre is slightly west of Charles Playhouse within the Theater
      District.

      South Dakota is north of Kansas, and both states are in the central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning.

      South Dakota and Kansas both span similar longitudes, but I need to determine
      the specific locations of these lakes within their states.


      Step 3: Lake Francis Case is a reservoir on the Missouri River in south-central
      South Dakota.

      Wilson Lake is a reservoir in central Kansas.


      Step 4: The Missouri River generally flows from northwest to southeast through
      South Dakota, and Lake Francis Case would be in the central or slightly eastern
      part of South Dakota.


      Step 5: Wilson Lake in Kansas is located in the central part of the state.


      Step 6: Comparing the two locations, Lake Francis Case in South Dakota would
      be slightly east of Wilson Lake in Kansas, as the Missouri River basin tends
      to be in the eastern half of the Great Plains.


      NO, Lake Francis Case, SD is not located east of Wilson Lake, KS. Lake Francis
      Case is actually slightly west of Wilson Lake when comparing their longitudes.'

      NW, which intersects with 16th Street, I need to determine if All Souls is east
      or west of 16th Street.


      All Souls Church (1500 Harvard St NW) is located near the intersection of 16th
      Street and Harvard Street, specifically at Harvard and 15th Streets NW. Since
      15th Street is east of 16th Street, All Souls is east of 16th Street where Foundry
      is located.


      Therefore, Foundry United Methodist Church is NOT east of All Souls Church,
      but rather west of it.


      NO'

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both churches in Washington, DC.

      - Foundry United Methodist Church is located at 1500 16th St NW, Washington,
      DC

      - All Souls Church, Unitarian is located at 1500 Harvard St NW, Washington,
      DC


      Step 2: I need to understand the DC street grid system.

      - In DC, numbered streets (like 16th St) run north-south

      - Lettered and named streets (like Harvard St) run east-west

      - NW indicates the northwest quadrant of the city


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - Both churches are on streets that are in the NW quadrant

      - Foundry United Methodist is on 16th St NW

      - All Souls Church is on Harvard St NW, near 16th St NW


      Step 4: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - Since both are essentially along 16th St NW, they are roughly aligned on the
      north-south axis

      - Neither church is significantly east or west of the other


      Step 5: Based on their exact locations, Foundry United Methodist Church is not
      east of All Souls Church. If anything, they are approximately on the same north-south
      line (16th St), with All Souls being further north.


      NO'

      Foundry United Methodist Church is located at 1500 16th Street NW, Washington,
      DC.


      Step 2: Identify the location of All Souls Church, Unitarian.

      All Souls Church, Unitarian is located at 1500 Harvard Street NW, Washington,
      DC.


      Step 3: Understand DC''s street layout.

      In Washington DC''s grid system, numbered streets run north-south, with numbers
      increasing as you move west. Streets labeled "NW" are in the northwest quadrant
      of the city.


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positions.

      Both churches are on streets with "NW" designations. Foundry is on 16th Street
      NW, while All Souls is near the intersection of 16th Street and Harvard Street
      NW.


      Step 5: Make the determination.

      Since both churches are essentially along 16th Street NW, with Foundry at 16th
      and P Street and All Souls at 16th and Harvard Street (which is further north),
      they are aligned on roughly the same north-south axis. Foundry is not east of
      All Souls - they are approximately on the same north-south street.


      NO, Foundry United Methodist Church is not located east of All Souls Church,
      Unitarian.'

      - Kentucky is positioned more inland and to the west compared to coastal Florida

      - St. Petersburg is on Florida''s west coast, but Florida as a whole extends
      quite far east


      Step 4: Check more precise coordinates.

      - Alice Lloyd College is in Pippa Passes, KY, in the eastern part of Kentucky

      - St. Petersburg is on the western coast of Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico


      Based on their positions, Alice Lloyd College in eastern Kentucky would be east
      of St. Petersburg, Florida, which is on Florida''s western coast.


      YES, Alice Lloyd College, KY is located east of Cathedral of Saint Jude the

      - Alice Lloyd College is located in Pippa Passes, Kentucky.

      - Cathedral of Saint Jude the Apostle is in St. Petersburg, Florida.


      Step 2: Now I need to determine their relative east-west positions.

      - Kentucky is generally north of Florida.

      - Florida extends into the southeastern part of the US.


      Step 3: Let me think about the specific locations within their states.

      - Pippa Passes, KY (where Alice Lloyd College is) is in eastern Kentucky.

      - St. Petersburg, FL is on the western coast of Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 4: Comparing the longitudes:

      - Eastern Kentucky is further east than western Florida.

      - St. Petersburg is on Florida''s western peninsula, which puts it further west

    239f41a7-fcbe-42ec-99d6-efe0aebb9bdf: 'I need to determine the relative locations
      of Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon and Camanche Reservoir in California.


      Step 1: Let me identify the general locations.

      - Charles E. Nelson House is in Oregon (OR), which is a state north of California.

      - Camanche Reservoir is in California (CA).


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning.

      - Oregon is generally north of California, but the question is about east-west
      positioning.

      - Oregon extends from the Pacific Ocean in the west to its eastern border with
      Idaho.

      - California also extends from the Pacific Ocean in the west to its eastern
      border with Nevada and Arizona.


      Step 3: Determine more specific locations.

      - Camanche Reservoir is in the central part of California, in the foothills
      of the Sierra Nevada.

      - Without specific information about where in Oregon the Charles E. Nelson House
      is located, I need to consider Oregon''s position relative to Camanche Reservoir.

      - Even the westernmost parts of Oregon are generally east of Camanche Reservoir''s
      longitude.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the general geography.

      - Since Oregon is entirely north of California, and Camanche Reservoir is in
      central California, the Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon would be northeast
      of Camanche Reservoir.

      - Being northeast means it is both north and east of the reservoir.


      NO, the Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon is not east of Camanche Reservoir
      in California. It is northeast of the reservoir, which means it has both an
      eastern and northern component to its relative position.


      Wait, I need to reconsider. The question specifically asks about east-west positioning,
      not northeast. If the Charles E. Nelson House is northeast of Camanche Reservoir,
      then it is indeed east of it.


      YES, the Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon is located east of Camanche Reservoir
      in California.'

      Step 2: Determine their general geographic positions.

      - Oregon is located north of California on the west coast of the United States

      - In terms of east-west positioning, Oregon and California share roughly the
      same longitude range


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Without specific city/county information for the Charles E. Nelson House in
      Oregon, I can only use the state-level positioning

      - Camanche Reservoir is in the central-eastern part of California


      Step 4: Apply geographic reasoning.

      - When comparing locations in the western United States on an east-west basis,
      locations in the same approximate longitude range would not be significantly
      east or west of each other

      - There might be slight east-west variations, but these would be minor compared
      to their north-south difference


      Based on this analysis, Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon would be north of
      Camanche Reservoir, but not necessarily east of it. Without specific coordinates,
      I cannot definitively say it''s east of the reservoir.

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of Oregon and California.

      - Oregon is located directly north of California

      - Oregon''s eastern border aligns roughly with California''s eastern border


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Since both states have roughly similar east-west extents, a location in Oregon
      could be either east, west, or directly north of a location in California.

      - Without specific coordinates, I need to consider the general position within
      their respective states.


      Step 4: The Charles E. Nelson House is in Oregon, which is north of California.
      But the question asks specifically about east-west positioning, not north-south.

      - Both states share the Pacific coastline on their western borders

      - Both states extend eastward from the Pacific Ocean


      Step 4: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since Oregon is directly north of California, and both states have similar
      east-west extents, locations in Oregon would be north of locations in California,
      not east of them

      - For a location in Oregon to be east of a location in California, it would

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states. Washington is located
      in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, bordering Canada to the north.
      California is located on the west coast of the United States, south of Washington.


      Step 3: Within the United States, Washington state is entirely north of California.


      Step 4: In terms of east-west positioning, both Washington and California border
      the Pacific Ocean on their western sides. The states generally occupy similar
      longitudes, though they have different shapes and extents.


      Step 5: Baker Lake in Washington would be somewhere within Washington state''s
      boundaries. Anderson Lake in California would be somewhere within California''s
      boundaries.


      Step 6: Since both states are on the Pacific coast and have roughly similar
      east-west extents, without specific information about the exact locations of

      - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

      - California is located south of Washington along the west coast.


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning of these states.

      - Both Washington and California border the Pacific Ocean on their western sides.

      - Both states extend eastward from the coast.

      - Washington and California largely share the same longitude range, with some
      variation.


      Step 3: Without specific coordinates for these lakes, I need to use general
      state positioning.

      - Lakes in Washington would generally be in the same longitude range as lakes
      in California.

      - There''s no inherent reason why a lake in Washington would be east of a lake
      in California based solely on the state locations.

      - In fact, since both states border the Pacific Ocean, lakes in both states
      could be at similar longitudes.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on the available information.

      - Without specific coordinates, I cannot definitively state that Baker Lake
      (WA) is east of Anderson Lake (CA).

      - Given that Washington is not generally east of California (they''re aligned

      east of Anderson Lake.


      NO, based on general geographical knowledge, Baker Lake (Washington) is not
      located east of Anderson Lake (California). Washington is north of California,
      not east of it, and without specific evidence showing an unusual positioning

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the western United States. Washington

      Step 3: In terms of east-west positioning, Washington and California both span
      from the Pacific Ocean on the west to further inland on the east, but they largely

      western part of Washington state.


      Step 6: Anderson Lake in California could be in various locations, but regardless
      of its specific location in California, the key fact is that Washington and
      California have similar east-west extents, with both having their western borders
      at the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 7: Given that Baker Lake is in the western part of Washington, and California
      does not extend significantly further west than Washington (both border the
      Pacific), Baker Lake would not be east of Anderson Lake.


      NO, Baker Lake (Washington) is not located east of Anderson Lake (California).'
    c229a0f6-4e11-44d6-ba18-7488f273def2: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      First, I need to determine the locations of both lakes:


      1. Baker Lake is in Washington state, which is in the northwestern United States.

      2. Anderson Lake is in California, which is along the western coast of the United
      States, south of Washington.


      Now I need to consider their east-west positioning:

      - Washington state is entirely north of California

      - Both states border the Pacific Ocean on their western sides

      - Washington extends from the Pacific Ocean eastward

      - California also extends from the Pacific Ocean eastward


      In terms of east-west positioning, both lakes are in states that span from the
      Pacific coast eastward. However, the question is specifically about whether
      Baker Lake (WA) is east of Anderson Lake (CA).


      Since Washington is directly north of California, and both states have similar
      east-west extents from the Pacific Ocean, the east-west positioning of the lakes
      depends on their specific locations within their respective states.


      Without specific coordinates, I can use general geographic knowledge: Baker
      Lake in Washington is in the Cascade Mountains in the western part of the state.
      Anderson Lake in California is likely also in the western portion of California
      (as most lakes in California are).


      Since both lakes are likely in the western portions of their states, and Washington
      and California have roughly similar east-west extents, there''s no reason to
      believe Baker Lake would be significantly east of Anderson Lake.


      NO, Baker Lake (Washington) is not located east of Anderson Lake (California).
      They are roughly in the same east-west alignment, with Baker Lake being north

      - Baker Lake is in Washington state (WA)

      - Anderson Lake is in California state (CA)

      - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast, south of Washington

      - In general, Washington is north of California, but both states are along the
      west coast


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Both Washington and California border the Pacific Ocean on their western sides

      - Neither state extends significantly further east than the other in a way that
      would make lakes in one state consistently east of lakes in the other

      - The east-west position depends on the specific locations of these lakes within
      their states


      Step 4: Without specific coordinates for these particular lakes, I need to rely
      on the general geography.

      - Lakes in Washington are not generally east of lakes in California

      - Both states occupy similar longitudinal ranges along the west coast


      Based on this reasoning, Baker Lake in Washington would typically be north of
      Anderson Lake in California, but not east of it.

      across similar longitudes on the west coast, though parts of Washington extend
      further east than the western portions of California, and parts of California
      extend further east than the western portions of Washington.


      Step 6: Baker Lake in Washington would be in the western half of the United

      Manhattan.

      - There isn''t a specific "Comedy Theatre" with that exact name in New York
      City''s history. The closest match might be the Majestic Theatre (now called
      the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre), but without clear information about a "Comedy
      Theatre," I can''t make a definitive comparison.


      Step 2: Since I don''t have confirmed information about the "Comedy Theatre"
      in New York City, I cannot determine its location relative to the Gaiety Theatre.

      Step 1: Let me check if I know the specific locations of these theaters in New
      York City.


      The Gaiety Theatre was a burlesque theater located on Broadway in Times Square,
      at 1547 Broadway in Manhattan.


      The Comedy Theatre (later renamed the Mercury Theatre) was located at 110 West
      41st Street in Manhattan.


      Step 2: In Manhattan, the street grid system is organized so that:

      - Broadway runs diagonally across Manhattan

      - "West" numbered streets are west of 5th Avenue

      - Broadway in Times Square is generally west of 5th Avenue


      Step 3: Compare the locations:

      - Gaiety Theatre: 1547 Broadway (in Times Square)

      - Comedy Theatre: 110 West 41st Street


      In Manhattan''s grid system, a location on Broadway in Times Square would be
      west of a location on West 41st Street with a low street number. Broadway in
      the Times Square area is on the western side of Manhattan''s midtown.


      Therefore, the Gaiety Theatre would be west of the Comedy Theatre, not east
      of it.

      The Gaiety Theatre was a Broadway theater located at 1547 Broadway in Times
      Square, Manhattan.


      Step 2: I need to identify the location of the Comedy Theatre.

      The Comedy Theatre (later renamed the Mercury Theatre) was located at 110 West
      41st Street in Manhattan.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      Broadway runs north-south through Manhattan, with Times Square being around
      the area where Broadway intersects with 7th Avenue in the mid-40s streets.

      The address 1547 Broadway would be on the east side of Broadway in Times Square.

      110 West 41st Street would be west of Broadway (as indicated by "West" in the
      address).


      Step 4: Determine east-west relationship.

      In Manhattan, locations west of Broadway are generally considered to be west
      of locations on Broadway itself. Since the Gaiety was on Broadway and the Comedy
      was west of Broadway, the Gaiety would be east of the Comedy.


      NO, the Gaiety Theatre is not located east of the Comedy Theatre. The Gaiety
      Theatre is located west of the Comedy Theatre.


      Wait, I need to double-check my reasoning. Broadway runs at an angle through
      Manhattan, and in the Times Square area, Broadway is actually to the west of
      locations on West 41st Street. The Gaiety on Broadway would be west of the Comedy
      Theatre on West 41st Street.


      YES, the Gaiety Theatre is located east of the Comedy Theatre.


      Actually, I made an error in my analysis. Let me be more precise:

      - Broadway runs diagonally northwest-southeast through Manhattan

      - West 41st Street runs east-west

      - The Comedy Theatre at 110 West 41st Street would be west of 7th Avenue

      - The Gaiety at 1547 Broadway would be near 46th Street and Broadway


      Looking at the map orientation of Manhattan, the Gaiety Theatre would be northeast
      of the Comedy Theatre, which means it is indeed east of the Comedy Theatre.

      Step 1: First, I need to identify if these are actual theaters in New York City.

      The Gaiety Theatre was a real theater in New York City, located in Times Square
      at 1547 Broadway (at West 46th Street).


      Step 2: I need to identify the Comedy Theatre in New York City.

      There was a Comedy Theatre in New York City that was later renamed the Mercury
      Theatre. It was located at 110 West 41st Street.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - Gaiety Theatre: 1547 Broadway (at West 46th Street)

      - Comedy Theatre: 110 West 41st Street


      Step 4: Determine east-west positioning.

      In Manhattan, Broadway runs at an angle, but in the Times Square area, Broadway
      is slightly to the west of 6th Avenue. The numbered streets run east-west, with
      west addresses being west of 5th Avenue.


      The Gaiety at 1547 Broadway would be on the east side of Broadway, while the
      Comedy at 110 West 41st Street would be west of 6th Avenue.


      Step 5: Make the comparison.

      Since Broadway in this area is west of 6th Avenue, and the Comedy Theatre is
      further west (as indicated by the "West" in its address), the Gaiety Theatre
      would be east of the Comedy Theatre.


      NO, the Gaiety Theatre is not located east of the Comedy Theatre. The Gaiety
      Theatre is located west of the Comedy Theatre.


      Wait, I need to double-check my reasoning about Manhattan geography. Broadway
      runs diagonally and in Times Square area, it''s actually between 7th and 8th
      Avenues. "110 West 41st Street" means it''s west of 5th Avenue, specifically
      between 6th and 7th Avenues. 1547 Broadway at 46th Street would place the Gaiety
      further west than the Comedy Theatre.


      YES, the Gaiety Theatre is located east of the Comedy Theatre.


      Actually, I made an error in my geographic reasoning. Let me correct this:

      - Broadway in the Times Square area runs between 7th Avenue and 8th Avenue

      - "110 West 41st Street" would be between 6th and 7th Avenues

      - Therefore, the Gaiety Theatre on Broadway would be west of the Comedy Theatre

      (between 45th and 46th Streets).


      Step 2: I need to identify the Comedy Theatre.

      The Comedy Theatre in New York City was renamed several times. It was originally
      called the Bijou Theatre, then became the Comedy Theatre in 1909, later the
      Mercury Theatre, and eventually the First Avenue Playhouse. It was located at
      1187 First Avenue.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning.

      In Manhattan, the avenues run north-south, with First Avenue being on the east
      side of Manhattan and Broadway being more central/western. Broadway runs diagonally
      through Manhattan but is generally considered west of First Avenue.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      First Avenue is east of Broadway in Manhattan''s grid system. Therefore, the
      Comedy Theatre on First Avenue would be east of the Gaiety Theatre on Broadway.


      NO, the Gaiety Theatre is NOT located east of the Comedy Theatre. The Comedy
      Theatre is east of the Gaiety Theatre.'

      - West 41st Street indicates the western portion of 41st Street


      Step 4: Comparing the locations:

      - The Gaiety Theatre on Broadway would be slightly west of 7th Avenue

      - The Comedy Theatre at 110 West 41st Street would be west of 6th Avenue (Avenue
      of the Americas) but east of 7th Avenue


      Step 5: In Manhattan''s grid system, locations further east have lower "West"
      numbers or are on the "East" side. Since the Comedy Theatre is at 110 West 41st
      Street, and the Gaiety Theatre is on Broadway (which is west of 6th Avenue but

      Step 1: Let me identify where Point Beach Nuclear Plant is located in Wisconsin.

      Point Beach Nuclear Plant is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan in
      Two Creeks, Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Kewaunee Power Station is located in Wisconsin.

      Kewaunee Power Station is also located on the western shore of Lake Michigan,
      in Carlton, Wisconsin.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions along the Lake Michigan shoreline.

      Point Beach Nuclear Plant is located in Two Creeks, which is north of Carlton
      (where Kewaunee is located).


      Step 4: Translate this north-south relationship to east-west orientation.

      Since both plants are on the western shore of Lake Michigan, which runs approximately
      north-south in this area, a plant that is north of another would be neither
      significantly east nor west of it, but rather directly north.


      Step 5: Looking more precisely at their exact locations, Point Beach is slightly
      northeast of Kewaunee, which would place it slightly to the east.


      NO


      Point Beach Nuclear Plant is not located east of Kewaunee Power Station. It

      shore of Lake Michigan.

      - Kewaunee Power Station is also located on the western shore of Lake Michigan,
      in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Both plants are on Lake Michigan''s western shoreline in eastern Wisconsin.

      - Point Beach Nuclear Plant is in Manitowoc County.

      - Kewaunee Power Station is in Kewaunee County.

      - Geographically, Kewaunee County is north of Manitowoc County.


      Step 3: Consider the shoreline orientation.

      - The western shore of Lake Michigan in this area curves slightly, with the
      shoreline running roughly north-northeast to south-southwest.

      - This means that as you move north along the shoreline from Manitowoc County
      to Kewaunee County, you also move slightly east.


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion about east-west positioning.

      - Since Point Beach is south of Kewaunee Power Station, and the shoreline curves
      in this area, Point Beach would be slightly west of Kewaunee, not east of it.

      Syracuse and DeWitt are located east of the Thousand Islands region where Boldt
      Castle is situated. The Thousand Islands area is in the northwestern part of
      New York state, while Syracuse is more centrally located but definitely eastward
      of that region.

      - This means Oklahoma is southwest of Minnesota

      - When comparing east-west positioning specifically, Oklahoma is west of Minnesota


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Tulsa is in northeastern Oklahoma

      - Lac qui Parle is in western Minnesota

      - Even though Tulsa is in the eastern part of Oklahoma, it''s still west of
      western Minnesota

      - WA is Washington state, located in the Pacific Northwest.

      - CA is California, located on the west coast south of Washington.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west relationship of these states.

      - Washington and California are both on the west coast, but Washington is north
      of California.

      - In the United States, locations in the same coastal region generally have
      similar longitudes (east-west positions).


      Step 3: Identify more specific locations.

      - Lake Steilacoom is in Washington state, likely in the western part of the
      state near Puget Sound.

      - Terrapin Crossroads is in California, which could be anywhere in the state.


      Step 4: Consider the geography of the west coast.

      - The west coast of the US curves slightly, with Washington state actually being
      slightly more westward than most of California.

      - However, without specific longitude coordinates, I need to rely on general
      geographic knowledge.


      Based on the general geography of the west coast, Lake Steilacoom in Washington
      would typically be slightly west of or approximately at the same longitude as
      locations in California, not east of them.


      NO, Lake Steilacoom, WA is not located east of Terrapin Crossroads, CA.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lake Steilacoom is in Washington state (WA)

      - Terrapin Crossroads is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on the US map.

      - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest, in the upper left (northwest)
      corner of the contiguous United States.

      - California is located on the west coast, south of Washington state.


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Both Washington and California are on the west coast.

      - When comparing locations in these states, I need to consider their specific
      positions.

      - Generally, locations in Washington would be north of locations in California,
      but not necessarily east of them.


      Step 4: Analyze more precisely.

      - Lake Steilacoom is in western Washington, near Tacoma and Puget Sound.

      - Terrapin Crossroads is (was) in San Rafael, California, in the Bay Area.

      - Both are near the Pacific coast, with Lake Steilacoom slightly more inland.

      - When comparing east-west positioning, Lake Steilacoom is slightly east of
      Terrapin Crossroads, as the coastline angles slightly from northwest to southeast.


      NO - Lake Steilacoom, WA is not located east of Terrapin Crossroads, CA. It
      is northwest of it.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lake Steilacoom is in Washington state (WA)

      - Terrapin Crossroads is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Determine their general geographic positions.

      - Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest, along the west coast
      of the United States.

      - California is also on the west coast, but south of Washington.


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Both states are on the west coast, so their east-west positioning isn''t immediately
      obvious from state locations alone.

      - Lake Steilacoom is in western Washington, near Tacoma.

      - Terrapin Crossroads was a music venue/restaurant in San Rafael, California,
      which is in the San Francisco Bay Area in western California.


      Step 4: Compare longitudinal positions.

      - Western Washington and the San Francisco Bay Area are both coastal regions.

      - Generally, the Pacific coastline runs northwest to southeast, meaning Washington''s
      western areas are typically west of California''s western areas.

      - Lake Steilacoom is slightly inland but still in western Washington.

      - San Rafael (location of Terrapin Crossroads) is slightly inland in the Bay
      Area.


      NO - Lake Steilacoom, WA is not located east of Terrapin Crossroads, CA. It
      is located northwest of Terrapin Crossroads, placing it west (not east) of the

      - New Hope Baptist Church is located in Newark, NJ

      - Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart is also located in Newark, NJ


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative positions to each other.

      - In the United States, locations that are "east" of each other means one is
      closer to the Atlantic Ocean (eastern coast).

      - Newark is in northeastern New Jersey, near New York City.


      Step 3: Looking at specific locations:

      - New Hope Baptist Church in Newark is located at 106 Sussex Avenue in the Central
      Ward area.

      1) First, I need to identify the locations of both Playwrights Horizons and
      VIA 57 West in New York.


      2) Playwrights Horizons is a theater located at 416 W 42nd St, New York, in
      the Midtown/Hell''s Kitchen area.


      3) VIA 57 West is a residential building located at 625 W 57th St, New York,
      in the Hell''s Kitchen neighborhood.


      4) In Manhattan''s grid system, addresses with "West" in them are west of 5th
      Avenue, and the street numbers increase as you go farther west.


      5) Playwrights Horizons is at W 42nd St, while VIA 57 West is at W 57th St,
      so they''re on different cross streets.


      6) Looking at the specific addresses: Playwrights Horizons is at 416 W 42nd
      St, and VIA 57 West is at 625 W 57th St.


      7) The number 416 indicates it''s closer to the middle of the island than 625,
      which is farther west.

    7f189b3d-0fbd-4d40-b21d-629b5b8829de: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Playwrights Horizons is a theater located at 416 W 42nd St, New York, NY.

      - VIA 57 West is a residential building located at 625 W 57th St, New York,
      NY.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - In Manhattan, streets run east-west, with street numbers increasing as you
      go north.

      - Avenues run north-south, with avenue numbers increasing as you go west.

      - "West" in an address means it''s west of 5th Avenue.


      Step 3: Compare their locations.

      - Playwrights Horizons is on 42nd Street (between 9th and 10th Avenues)

      - VIA 57 West is on 57th Street (near the West Side Highway)

      - Both are on the west side of Manhattan

      - 57th Street is north of 42nd Street, but that''s not relevant to east-west
      positioning


      Step 4: Determine east-west positioning.

      - In Manhattan''s grid system, locations with similar avenue positions can be
      compared for east-west positioning

      - VIA 57 West is further west (closer to the Hudson River) than Playwrights
      Horizons

      - Therefore, Playwrights Horizons would be east of VIA 57 West

      - Playwrights Horizons is a theater located at 416 W 42nd St, New York, NY.

      - VIA 57 West is a residential building located at 625 W 57th St, New York,
      NY.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - In Manhattan, streets run east-west, with street numbers increasing as you
      go north.

      - Avenues run north-south, with "West" in the address indicating the western
      side of Manhattan.

      - Playwrights Horizons is on 42nd Street, which is south of 57th Street.

      - Both addresses have "W" (West) in them, placing them on the western side of
      Manhattan.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - In Manhattan''s grid system, locations further west have higher avenue numbers
      or are further along West streets.

      - Since both are on the west side, I need to compare their exact positions.

      - Playwrights Horizons at 416 W 42nd St is closer to the center of Manhattan
      than VIA 57 West at 625 W 57th St.

      - The "625" in VIA 57 West''s address indicates it''s further west than Playwrights

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both structures.

      - Playwrights Horizons is a theater located at 416 W 42nd Street in Manhattan.

      - VIA 57 West is a residential building located at 625 West 57th Street in Manhattan.


      Step 2: Understand Manhattan''s grid system.

      - In Manhattan, streets run east-west, with street numbers increasing as you
      go north.

      - Avenues run north-south, with "West" addresses being west of 5th Avenue.

      - "East" is to the right on a map, "West" is to the left.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - Both are on the west side of Manhattan (both have "West" in their addresses).

      - Playwrights Horizons is on 42nd Street, while VIA 57 West is on 57th Street.

      - Both have similar "West" positions (416 W vs. 625 W), but the exact avenue
      matters.


      Step 4: Determine relative east-west positioning.

      - In Manhattan''s grid system, addresses with "West" in them are measured by
      how far west they are from 5th Avenue.

      - 416 W 42nd Street means Playwrights Horizons is between 9th and 10th Avenues.

      - 625 W 57th Street means VIA 57 West is between 11th and 12th Avenues.

      - This places VIA 57 West further west than Playwrights Horizons.


      Since VIA 57 West is further west, Playwrights Horizons must be further east.


      NO - Playwrights Horizons is NOT located east of VIA 57 West. It is located
      WEST of VIA 57 West.


      Wait, I made an error in my analysis. Let me correct:


      Since addresses increase as you move west from 5th Avenue, 416 W is closer to
      5th Avenue than 625 W. This means Playwrights Horizons (416 W) is further east
      than VIA 57 West (625 W).

      - Playwrights Horizons is on West 42nd Street

      - VIA 57 West is on West 57th Street

      - Both have "West" addresses, so they''re both west of 5th Avenue

      - Playwrights Horizons has address 416 West, while VIA 57 West has address 625
      West

      - The higher "West" number (625) indicates VIA 57 West is further west


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      - Triumph Church has multiple locations in Michigan, but they are primarily
      in the Detroit metropolitan area in southeastern Michigan


      Step 4: Compare the east-west positions.

      - Toledo, Ohio (where Rosary Cathedral is) is west of Detroit and its suburbs
      (where Triumph Church locations are)

      - Therefore, Rosary Cathedral is west of Triumph Church, not east


      NO'

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both churches.

      - Rosary Cathedral is in Toledo, Ohio (OH)

      - Triumph Church is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Toledo, Ohio is in northwest Ohio, near the Michigan border

      - Michigan is generally north of Ohio

      - For a church in Michigan to be west of a church in Toledo, it would need to
      be in the southwestern part of Michigan


      Step 3: Consider the geography.

      - Toledo is in the western part of Ohio, close to the Michigan border

      - Michigan extends west of Ohio''s western border

      - Therefore, most locations in Michigan would be north and/or west of Toledo


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on cardinal directions.

      - Since Toledo is in the northwestern corner of Ohio, and Michigan extends westward
      from there, Triumph Church in Michigan is almost certainly west (or northwest)
      of Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, not east of it.


      NO (Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio is not located east of Triumph Church in
      Michigan)'

      Step 4: In the American street numbering system, on a north-south street like
      Orange Avenue:

      - Numbers increase as you move north

      - This means the courthouse is north of the cathedral


      Step 5: Determine if north means east in this context.

      - In Orlando, Orange Avenue runs primarily north-south

      - Being north of something on Orange Avenue doesn''t make it east of that location

      Ave.

      - In American street numbering, higher numbers typically indicate greater distance

      south.

      - New Haven Harbor is on the southern edge of the city.

      - Long Wharf is at the harbor, south of downtown.

      - Yale''s campus, including Horchow Hall, is in downtown New Haven.

      - In New Haven, locations near the harbor would be south/southeast of downtown

      I apologize for the confusion. After careful consideration of New Haven''s geography,
      Long Wharf is located along the southwest portion of New Haven Harbor, while
      Horchow Hall is in the downtown area. Looking at maps of New Haven, Long Wharf

      Yale''s campus is more inland, north of the harbor area. Since Long Wharf is
      closer to the water/harbor and Yale''s campus (including Horchow Hall) is more
      inland, Long Wharf would be south of Horchow Hall, not east or west.

      Step 1: Let me identify the location of Steppenwolf Theatre Company.

      Steppenwolf Theatre Company is located in Chicago, Illinois, in the Lincoln
      Park neighborhood at 1650 N Halsted St.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Presidential Towers.

      Presidential Towers is a residential complex located in Chicago, Illinois, in
      the West Loop neighborhood at 555 W Madison St.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      In Chicago''s grid system, addresses with "N" (north) and "W" (west) designations
      help determine relative positions. Halsted Street runs north-south, while Madison
      Street runs east-west.


      The key indicator here is that Halsted Street (where Steppenwolf is located)
      is further east than the West Loop area where Presidential Towers stands. Additionally,
      Presidential Towers has a "W" in its address (555 W Madison), indicating it''s
      west of the city''s north-south dividing line, while Halsted Street is closer
      to the center of Chicago.


      NO, Steppenwolf Theatre Company is not located east of Presidential Towers.
      It is actually located northeast of Presidential Towers.'

      of Steppenwolf Theatre Company and Presidential Towers in Illinois to answer
      this question.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Steppenwolf Theatre Company is located.

      Steppenwolf Theatre Company is located in Chicago, Illinois, specifically in
      the Lincoln Park neighborhood at 1650 N Halsted St.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Presidential Towers is located.

      Presidential Towers is a residential complex located in Chicago''s West Loop
      neighborhood at 555 W Madison St.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      In Chicago, addresses with "W" (west) in them are west of the city''s north-south
      dividing line, while Halsted Street runs north-south. Looking at their specific
      locations, Halsted Street is east of the West Loop area where Presidential Towers
      is located.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on Chicago''s grid system.

      In Chicago''s grid system, Halsted Street (where Steppenwolf is located) is
      at 800 West, while Presidential Towers at 555 W Madison would be between Jefferson
      (500 W) and Clinton (540 W). This means Steppenwolf Theatre (at 800 W) is actually
      WEST of Presidential Towers (around 550 W).


      NO, Steppenwolf Theatre Company is not located east of Presidential Towers.
      It is located west of Presidential Towers.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Pathfinder Reservoir is in Wyoming (WY)

      - Basilica of San Albino is in New Mexico (NM)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of US states.

      - Wyoming is in the northwest part of the United States

      - New Mexico is in the southwest part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Wyoming is approximately in the same longitudinal range as New Mexico

      - However, Wyoming is generally positioned slightly to the east of New Mexico''s
      western portions


      Step 4: More specific analysis of these locations.

      - Pathfinder Reservoir is in central Wyoming

      - The Basilica of San Albino is likely in eastern or central New Mexico (specifically
      in Mesilla, NM)


      When comparing locations on the same longitude, the one further west has a higher
      longitude value. Wyoming and New Mexico are close in longitude, but Wyoming
      is generally to the east of New Mexico.


      NO, Pathfinder Reservoir, WY is not located east of Basilica of San Albino,

      Wyoming is located in the western United States, north of Colorado.

      New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States, south of Colorado.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      Wyoming and New Mexico have similar east-west positioning, with both being in
      the Mountain Time Zone. However, Wyoming is generally slightly west of New Mexico
      when looking at a map.


      Step 3: Without knowing the exact locations of these specific places within
      their states, I need to think about their likely positions.

      - Pathfinder Reservoir would be somewhere within Wyoming

      - Basilica of San Albino would be somewhere in New Mexico


      Step 4: Based on the general geography of the western United States, Wyoming
      is slightly west of New Mexico, not east of it. Therefore, Pathfinder Reservoir
      in Wyoming would likely be west of the Basilica of San Albino in New Mexico,
      not east of it.

      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both Pittsburgh Playhouse and Benedum
      Center in Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Pittsburgh Playhouse is located in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh,

      facility at Point Park University''s campus.


      Step 3: Benedum Center is located in the Cultural District of downtown Pittsburgh,

      Step 5: Since Pittsburgh Playhouse is in Oakland and Benedum Center is in the
      Cultural District downtown, and Oakland is east of downtown Pittsburgh, the
      Pittsburgh Playhouse is east of Benedum Center.


      NO.

      Wait, I need to reconsider. Without specific coordinates, I can''t be certain
      of the east-west relationship. Let me revise:


      Fourmile Lake is in southern Oregon, and Our Lady of the Wayside Church is in
      Portola Valley, CA, which is near the California coast. Since Oregon is north
      of California, and Fourmile Lake is in the Cascade Range in the eastern part
      of southern Oregon, while Portola Valley is near the western coast, Fourmile
      Lake would be northeast of the church.


      So to answer specifically about the east-west relationship: YES, Fourmile Lake
      is east of Our Lady of the Wayside Church.'
    d0277606-e526-4d66-869b-b192c3496649: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of Fourmile Lake in Oregon and Our
      Lady of the Wayside Church in California.


      Step 2: Fourmile Lake is located in Oregon, which is a state on the west coast
      of the United States, north of California.


      Step 3: Our Lady of the Wayside Church is in California, which is also on the
      west coast, south of Oregon.


      Step 4: When comparing east-west positions in the United States, I need to consider
      that Oregon is generally in the same longitudinal range as California, with
      both states spanning from the Pacific Ocean eastward.


      Step 5: Fourmile Lake is likely in the Cascade Range of Oregon, which would
      place it in the eastern portion of western Oregon.


      Step 6: Our Lady of the Wayside Church in California could be located anywhere
      in the state, but many Catholic churches in California are in populated areas,
      often closer to the coast.


      Step 7: Given the general geography of the western United States, a location
      in eastern Oregon would typically be east of most locations in California, especially
      those near the coast.


      Based on this reasoning, Fourmile Lake in Oregon is most likely east of Our
      Lady of the Wayside Church in California.

      - Fourmile Lake is in Oregon (OR)

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Oregon and California.

      - Oregon is located north of California

      - California is located to the west coast of the United States

      - Oregon is also on the west coast, directly north of California


      Step 3: Consider east-west positioning.

      - Both states are on the west coast

      - Oregon and California share a north-south border, not an east-west border

      - When two places are in these adjacent western states, their east-west relationship
      depends on their specific locations within their states

      - Fourmile Lake is in Oregon, likely in the Cascade Range area

      - Our Lady of the Wayside Church in California is likely near the coast (based

      - Kansas is generally positioned to the north of Texas

      - In terms of east-west positioning, Kansas is primarily to the west of the
      eastern portions of Texas and to the east of the western portions of Texas


      Step 4: Since I don''t have the exact coordinates of these specific locations,
      I need to use general geographic knowledge.

      - Cheney Reservoir is in south-central Kansas

      - Without specific information about the Judge Sebron G. Sneed House''s location
      in Texas, I can''t make a precise determination

      - However, most of Kansas is west of most of Texas on an east-west axis


      Based on the general geographic relationship between Kansas and Texas, and without
      specific coordinates for the Judge Sebron G. Sneed House in Texas, it''s more
      likely that Cheney Reservoir in Kansas would be west of a location in Texas,
      not east.


      NO'

      positions of Cheney Reservoir in Kansas and the Judge Sebron G. Sneed House
      in Texas.


      Step 1: Consider the general geography of Kansas and Texas.

      - Kansas is located north of Texas

      - Kansas generally lies to the east of western Texas, but to the west of eastern
      Texas


      Step 2: More specifically, I need to determine where in their respective states
      these landmarks are located.

      - Cheney Reservoir is in south-central Kansas, west of Wichita

      - The Judge Sebron G. Sneed House is in Texas, but I need to determine its specific
      location


      Step 3: Based on general knowledge of US geography:

      - Kansas as a whole is positioned in the central United States

      - Texas extends further east than Kansas does

      - Most historical houses and buildings in Texas would be in the eastern or central
      portions of the state, as these were settled earlier


      Step 4: Considering longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Cheney Reservoir is in the central part of Kansas, which would place it roughly
      in the middle of the continental US longitudinally

      - The Judge Sebron G. Sneed House, if located in central or eastern Texas, would
      likely be east of Cheney Reservoir


      Based on this reasoning about the typical locations of these types of landmarks
      and the general geography of Kansas and Texas, I believe the Judge Sebron G.
      Sneed House in Texas is likely east of Cheney Reservoir in Kansas.


      NO, Cheney Reservoir, KS is not located east of Judge Sebron G. Sneed House,

      - Without knowing the specific location of the Judge Sebron G. Sneed House in

      Step 4: Cheney Reservoir is likely in central or western Kansas, while Texas
      extends further east than Kansas does.

      - Even if Cheney Reservoir is in eastern Kansas, Texas''s eastern portions extend
      further east than Kansas

    ab3eb0b5-9270-428c-92ef-bfe4e0c2c19f: 'I need to determine the relative locations
      of Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Denver, CO and Rampart
      Reservoir, CO.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Denver is located in Colorado.

      Denver is located in the central-eastern part of Colorado, near the eastern
      edge of the Rocky Mountains.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Rampart Reservoir is located.

      Rampart Reservoir is located in Pike National Forest, west of Colorado Springs,
      in the Rocky Mountains.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Denver is east of the Rocky Mountains, while Rampart Reservoir is in the Rocky
      Mountains.

      Colorado Springs is south of Denver but also east of the main Rocky Mountain
      range, and Rampart Reservoir is west of Colorado Springs in the mountains.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Denver is on the eastern side of the Rockies, and the Cathedral Basilica
      is in Denver, while Rampart Reservoir is in the mountains west of Colorado Springs,
      the Cathedral Basilica must be east of Rampart Reservoir.


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. The question asks if the Cathedral is
      east of the Reservoir, and my reasoning shows that Denver (where the Cathedral
      is) is indeed east of Rampart Reservoir. So the correct answer is:


      YES'
