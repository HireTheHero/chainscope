      \ a state located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.\n  \
      \ - California is a state located on the West Coast of the United States, south\
      \ of Washington.\n\n3. **Relative Positions**:\n   - Since Washington is north\
      \ of California, any point in Washington is generally north (and possibly slightly\
      \ east or west) of points in California.\n\n4. **East/West Orientation**:\n\
      \   - To be east of Bel Air Church, the Lower Monumental Dam would need to be\
      \ not only in a longitudinal position that is east but also consider that it\
      \ is in a different state that is generally north.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n \
      \  - Without exact coordinates, we rely on general geography. Washington is\
      \ north of California, and for a location in Washington to be east of a location\
      \ in California, it would have to be significantly east, considering the general\
      \ north-south alignment of the state borders. However, given the typical width\
      \ of states and their general east-west alignment, a location in the northern\
      \ state (Washington) would likely be north and possibly slightly east or west\
      \ of a location in the southern state (California), depending on their exact\
      \ longitudes.\n\nHowever, considering the general geography and without precise\
      \ locations, it's reasonable to infer that a location in Washington would not\
      \ typically be described as east of a location in California due to their north-south\
      \ relationship. Thus, the precise answer to whether Lower Monumental Dam in\
      \ Washington is east of Bel Air Church in California cannot be definitively\
      \ determined without exact coordinates, but based on the typical understanding\
      \ of these states' positions, it is unlikely.\n\nGiven the information and the\

      \ is located east of Bel Air Church, CA, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify\
      \ Locations**: Lower Monumental Dam is in Washington (WA), and Bel Air Church\
      \ is in California (CA).\n\n2. **Understand Geography**: In the United States,\
      \ moving from west to east, you would generally go through states in a sequence\
      \ that reflects their geographical positioning.\n\n3. **Specific Locations**:\
      \ \n   - Lower Monumental Dam is in southeastern Washington, close to the border\
      \ with Oregon.\n   - Bel Air Church is in California, which is generally to\
      \ the south of Washington.\n\n4. **Relative Positioning**: \n   - Washington\
      \ is directly north of California.\n   - Considering the eastern part of Washington\
      \ and the general southern extension of California, the question becomes whether\
      \ Lower Monumental Dam's position in southeastern Washington places it east\
      \ of Bel Air Church in California.\n\n5. **Geographical Reference**: \n   -\
      \ California is to the south of Washington, and parts of California extend eastward\
      \ beyond the easternmost points of Washington.\n   - Lower Monumental Dam is\
      \ in the southeastern part of Washington, which suggests it could be east or\
      \ southeast of parts of California, depending on the specific location within\
      \ California.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - Given that Lower Monumental Dam is\
      \ in southeastern Washington and considering the geography, it is likely that\
      \ Lower Monumental Dam is southeast of Bel Air Church, CA. However, \"east\"\
      \ is a directional term that might not perfectly capture the relationship since\
      \ \"southeast\" implies both an eastern and southern direction relative to a\
      \ point.\n   - Since southeast encompasses an eastern direction, and considering\
      \ the question asks if it's \"east\" of Bel Air Church, the answer hinges on\
      \ interpreting \"east\" in a broad sense, including southeastern directions\
      \ as generally being in an easterly direction relative to a point.\n\nBased\
      \ on these steps and considering the broad interpretation of \"east\" to include\
      \ a southeastern direction, the answer would be:\n\nYES"

      3. **Relative Positions**: Without specific coordinates, we can assume that
      if two locations are in the same state and one is described as being east of
      the other, it means it is generally to the east within the state''s boundaries.

      4. **Conclusion**: Since both Milford Lake and El Dorado Lake are in Kansas,
      and the question specifically asks if Milford Lake is east of El Dorado Lake,
      it implies that Milford Lake is generally to the east within the state of Kansas
      relative to El Dorado Lake.


      Based on the information provided and the understanding of geographical relationships
      within Kansas, the answer to the question is:


      YES'

      1. **Identify Locations**: Both the Blackstone Hotel and the Flatiron Building
      are in Fort Worth, Texas. The specific addresses or coordinates are not provided,
      so we''ll consider their general positions within the city.


      2. **Consider City Layout**: Fort Worth is a city in Texas with a grid-like
      street layout. Generally, in a grid system, streets running north-south are
      numbered or named, while streets running east-west are also numbered or named.


      3. **Determine Relative Positions**: Without specific addresses, we can assume
      that both buildings are located within the city''s grid system. To be east of
      each other, the Blackstone Hotel would need to be on a street with a higher
      number or a name that suggests an easterly direction compared to the Flatiron
      Building.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since both buildings are in Fort Worth, and without specific
      addresses or coordinates, we can''t definitively say which is east of the other.
      The answer would depend on their exact locations within the city''s street grid.


      Given the lack of specific information, the answer to whether the Blackstone

      more specific information about their precise locations within the city, it''s
      challenging to determine with certainty whether the Orange County Courthouse
      is east of the St. James Cathedral. The term "east" can be ambiguous in this
      context, especially if the structures are relatively close to each other.


      Without additional information, it''s difficult to definitively say whether
      the Orange County Courthouse is east of the St. James Cathedral. The answer
      would depend on their precise locations within Orlando, which are not provided
      in the question. Therefore, the answer is:

      down the process:


      1. **Identify Locations**: Both the Mission Theater and Pub and the Keller Auditorium
      are located in Oregon (OR). The specific cities or regions are not mentioned,
      but they are both within the same state.


      2. **Oregon''s Geography**: Oregon is a state located in the Pacific Northwest
      region of the United States. It stretches from the Pacific Ocean in the west
      to the eastern border with Idaho. The state has a north-south orientation, with
      its northern border being the Columbia River and its southern border being the
      border with California and Nevada.


      3. **Relative Positions**: Since both locations are in Oregon, we can consider
      the general layout of the state. Oregon is relatively narrow in an east-west
      direction compared to its north-south extent. This means that most locations
      in Oregon are relatively close in longitude (east-west distance) compared to
      their north-south distance.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that both locations are in Oregon and considering the
      state''s geography, it''s unlikely that the Mission Theater and Pub would be
      significantly east of the Keller Auditorium. They are more likely to be in the
      same general area, possibly with a slight difference in longitude but not a
