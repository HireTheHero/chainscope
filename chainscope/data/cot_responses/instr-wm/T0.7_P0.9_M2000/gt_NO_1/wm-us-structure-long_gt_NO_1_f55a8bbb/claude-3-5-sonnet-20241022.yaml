      border

      - Copper Mountain Solar Facility is near Boulder City, Nevada, southeast of
      Las Vegas


      3. When comparing their positions:

      - Brock Reservoir is in far southeastern California

      - Copper Mountain Solar Facility is in southern Nevada


      4. Looking at relative positions:

      - Brock Reservoir is farther west than Copper Mountain Solar Facility

      - Nevada is east of California in this region


      Therefore: NO, Brock Reservoir is not east of Copper Mountain Solar Facility.
      It is west of it.

      - Both churches are east of Fifth Avenue


      6. Since both churches are on the east side, we need to compare their specific
      addresses:

      - All Saints: 47 East

      - Mount Carmel: 448 East


      7. 47 East is closer to Fifth Avenue than 448 East, meaning Mount Carmel is
      further east


      NO - All Saints Church is NOT located east of Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
      It is actually located west of it.'

      - Both are on East streets

      - All Saints is on 129th Street

      - Mount Carmel is on 116th Street

      - Looking at their street addresses, All Saints is at 47 East

      - Mount Carmel is at 448 East


      4) Comparing positions:

      - Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is at #448


      5) In Manhattan''s address system, higher numbers indicate more easterly locations


      6) Since 448 is a much higher number than 47, Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel

      1) First, I need to locate these two churches:

      - Rosary Cathedral is in Toledo, Ohio

      - Triumph Church is in Michigan


      2) Toledo, Ohio is in the northwestern part of Ohio, near the Michigan border


      3) Michigan is directly north of Ohio


      4) When comparing east-west positions:

      - Triumph Church would be somewhere in Michigan

      - Toledo (and thus Rosary Cathedral) is in the western part of Ohio


      5) Given their relative state positions, a location in Michigan would generally
      be west of a location in Ohio, unless the Ohio location is in the far western
      part of the state (which Toledo is) and the Michigan location is in the eastern
      part of Michigan.


      Since Toledo is so far west in Ohio, and without more specific location information
      about which Triumph Church in Michigan, I cannot definitively determine the
      east-west relationship.


      NO - I cannot confidently say that Rosary Cathedral is east of Triumph Church.'

      4) Final reasoning:

      - Since Triumph Church is likely in the Detroit area, which is northeast of

      - Then Rosary Cathedral would be southwest of Triumph Church

      1) Both buildings are in Orlando, Florida.


      2) The Orange County Courthouse is located at 425 N Orange Ave, Orlando, FL
      32801.


      3) St. James Cathedral is located at 215 N Orange Ave, Orlando, FL 32801.


      4) Both buildings are on Orange Avenue, with the Courthouse at 425 N and the
      Cathedral at 215 N.


      5) In street numbering systems, higher numbers typically indicate greater distance
      from a center point.


      6) Since both are on the same street (N Orange Ave), and they only differ in
      their street number, we can determine their relative position.


      7) The buildings are on the same side of Orange Avenue (both are N Orange Ave).


      8) The Courthouse (425) has a higher street number than the Cathedral (215),
      meaning it''s further north on the same street.


      9) Being further north or south on the same street does not affect east/west
      positioning.


      NO - The Orange County Courthouse is not east of St. James Cathedral. They are
      on the same street (Orange Avenue) and thus have the same east/west positioning.'

      1) First, let me identify both locations in Orlando:

      - Orange County Courthouse is located in downtown Orlando

      - St. James Cathedral is also located in downtown Orlando


      2) Looking at their specific locations:

      - Orange County Courthouse is at 425 N Orange Ave

      - St. James Cathedral is at 215 N Orange Ave


      3) Since they''re both on Orange Avenue, and the courthouse is at 425 N while
      the cathedral is at 215 N, we can compare their relative positions:

      - The courthouse has a higher street number (425)

      - In Orlando''s street numbering system, numbers increase going north

      - Therefore, the courthouse is north of the cathedral, not east


      4) Their east-west position is essentially the same since they''re on the same
      avenue.
