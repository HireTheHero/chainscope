      Step 2: Copper Mountain Solar Facility is located in Clark County, Nevada, which
      is in the southeastern part of Nevada.


      Step 3: Comparing their locations, Brock Reservoir is west of Copper Mountain
      Solar Facility. Since the question asks if Brock Reservoir is east of the solar
      facility, the answer is:


      NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate San Diego Civic Theatre and Balboa Theatre in San Diego,
      California.


      2. San Diego Civic Theatre is located at 1100 3rd Ave, in downtown San Diego.


      3. Balboa Theatre is located at 868 4th Ave, also in downtown San Diego.


      4. Looking at the street addresses, San Diego Civic Theatre is at 3rd Avenue,

      1. First, I''ll locate Mammy''s Cupboard, MS (Mississippi)

      - This is a restaurant/landmark located near Natchez, Mississippi

      - It''s in southwestern Mississippi


      2. Next, I''ll locate Lake Onalaska, MN (Minnesota)

      1. First, I''ll locate Actors Theatre of Louisville

      - It is located at 316 W Main St, Louisville, KY 40202


      2. Next, I''ll locate The Green Building

      - It is located at 732 E Market St, Louisville, KY 40202


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Actors Theatre is on West Main Street

      - The Green Building is on East Market Street


      4. Determining east/west positioning:

      - West Main St is west of East Market St

      - This means The Green Building is east of Actors Theatre


      5. Therefore, the answer is: YES, Actors Theatre of Louisville is located west
      of The Green Building.


      However, the original question asked if Actors Theatre is east of The Green
      Building, which would be the opposite.


      So the answer is: NO.'
