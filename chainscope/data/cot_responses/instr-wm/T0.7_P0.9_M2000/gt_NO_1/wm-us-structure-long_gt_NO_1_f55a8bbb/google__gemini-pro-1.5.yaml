      need to determine the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of both
      Charles Playhouse and the Colonial Theatre.

      2. **Compare longitudes:** Since the question is about East/West, longitude
      is the relevant coordinate.  A location further East will have a higher longitude
      value (more positive).

      3. **Determine East/West based on longitude comparison:** If Charles Playhouse
      has a higher longitude than the Colonial Theatre, it is east of it.


      Using a search engine, I find:

      * Charles Playhouse is in Boston, MA.

      * Colonial Theatre is also in Boston, MA.


      Searching for their specific locations shows they are very close to each other.
      Charles Playhouse is slightly east.

    83ebb44b-79bd-4a29-bba5-f3e762af82e0: '1. **Locate Lake Francis Case:** Lake Francis
      Case is in south-central South Dakota, formed by the Fort Randall Dam on the
      Missouri River.

      the Wilson Dam on the Saline River, a tributary of the Smoky Hill River, which
      itself is part of the Kansas River system.

      to north through eastern South Dakota.  The Kansas River flows generally east
      to west through Kansas and joins the Missouri River at Kansas City, Missouri.


      4. **Relative positions:** Since the Missouri River flows south to north in
      South Dakota, and Kansas is south of South Dakota, Lake Francis Case must be
      north of the point where the Kansas and Missouri Rivers meet. Since Wilson Lake
      is part of the Kansas River system, it is upstream (west) of this confluence.

      3. **Compare and Answer:** If 32 Old Slip has a higher longitude than Mineshaft,
      the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer is NO.



      Using online search engines:


      * 32 Old Slip is in the Financial District.

      * Mineshaft, a former gay club in NYC, was located at 835 Washington Street
      in the Meatpacking District.


      Looking at a map or comparing their longitudes confirms that the Financial District
      (32 Old Slip) is east of the Meatpacking District (Mineshaft).


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      District.


      2. **Mineshaft:** This was a famous gay BDSM club in New York City.  While it''s
      now closed, its location was in the Meatpacking District in Manhattan.


      3. **General Knowledge/Manhattan Geography:** The Financial District is generally

      2. **Determine the relevant directional relationship.**  Since both theaters

      * St. Athanasius Church:  888 Baychester Ave, Bronx, NY

      * Christian Cultural Center:  12020 Flatlands Ave, Brooklyn, NY


      Baychester Avenue is in the northeast Bronx, while Flatlands Avenue is in eastern
      Brooklyn.  Brooklyn is generally west of the Bronx.  Therefore, St. Athanasius
      Church is likely east of the Christian Cultural Center.

      4. **Conclude based on address numbers:** Since the Blackstone Hotel has a lower
      address number than the Flatiron Building on the same north-south street, it
      is located south of the Flatiron Building, not east.

      in Brooklyn will be east of any structure in Manhattan.


      3. **Apply to the specific structures:** The Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph is in
      Brooklyn and the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer is in Manhattan.

      4. **Determine East/West relative position:** Since both are on "East" streets,
      they are both east of 5th Avenue. The question is whether one is further East
      than the other.  Since the addresses don''t give avenue information and only

      Playwrights Horizons is east of VIA 57 West. This means Playwrights Horizons
      would need to have a higher longitude coordinate.


      Using a map or online search:


      * Playwrights Horizons is located at 416 West 42nd Street.

      * VIA 57 West is located at 625 West 57th Street.


      Both are on West streets, meaning they are west of 5th Avenue.  VIA 57 West
      is further north than Playwrights Horizons, but more importantly, it''s on 57th
      street while Playwrights is on 42nd street. Lower street numbers are further
      east in Manhattan.


      Therefore, Playwrights Horizons is east of VIA 57 West.

      is on 55th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues.  The Ziegfeld Theatre (demolished
      in 2016) was on 6th Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets.


      4. **Compare locations:** Since City Center is between 6th and 7th Avenues,
      and the Ziegfeld was *on* 6th Avenue, City Center is east of where the Ziegfeld
      stood.

    83b33340-9630-4329-b529-95a5ce4d804d: '1. **Identify the locations:** We need
      to find the locations of New York City Center and the (former) Ziegfeld Theatre.
      Both are in New York City.

      2. **More specific locations:**  New York City Center is on 55th Street between
      6th and 7th Avenues. The Ziegfeld Theatre was located at 141 West 54th Street,
      between 6th and 7th Avenues.

      3. **East vs. West:**  Since both are between 6th and 7th Avenues, and addresses
      increase as you go west, City Center being on 55th Street places it further
      north than the Ziegfeld Theatre, which was on 54th Street.  East and West are
      relative to avenues running North/South. Streets run East/West. Therefore, being
      on a different street doesn''t directly tell us about East/West positioning.  However,
      both buildings were between 6th and 7th Avenues.

      4. **Determine relative position:** Since both are between the same avenues,
      the question becomes irrelevant.  One building had a higher numbered street
      address (55th) and was therefore north of the other building (54th).

      Manhattan.


      3. **Determine East/West Relationship:**  Since both are on 6th Avenue, with
      City Center slightly north of the Ziegfeld''s former location, the question
      of east/west is moot.  They were essentially on the same north-south line.


      4. **Consider Street Numbering Convention:** In Manhattan, higher numbered avenues
      are further East.  Since they were both on 6th Avenue, neither is east of the
      other.

      2. **Compare Longitudes:**  Since the question is about East/West, we will focus
      on longitude.  A location further East will have a higher longitude value.


      3. **Determine East/West:** Compare the longitude of New York City Center to
      the longitude of the Ziegfeld Theatre.  If City Center''s longitude is greater,
      it is East.

      need the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of both theaters.


      2. **Compare longitudes:**  Longitude determines east/west position. A location
      further east will have a higher longitude value (more positive degrees East,
      or less negative degrees West).


      3. **Determine if Guthrie Theater has a higher longitude:** If Guthrie Theater''s
      longitude is greater than In the Heart of the Beast''s longitude, then it is
      east.


      After performing these steps (using a map or online search), I find that Guthrie
      Theater is indeed east of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.
