      Lake Beshear in Kentucky.


      1. **Locate St. Nicholas Cathedral, Chicago, IL**: St. Nicholas Cathedral is
      located in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is situated in the northeastern part of
      Illinois along the shores of Lake Michigan.


      2. **Locate Lake Beshear, KY**: Lake Beshear is located in the western part
      of Kentucky.


      3. **Compare their relative positions**: Chicago, Illinois, is north and significantly
      east of western Kentucky. Given the general layout of the United States, with
      Illinois being north and Chicago being in the northeastern part of Illinois,
      it is east of most locations in Kentucky, especially those in the western part

      Thus, the answer to the question is **NO**.'
    61a90508-ed72-42bd-9bb2-3fb56ba1915a: 'To determine whether the Gaiety Theatre
      is located east of the Comedy Theatre, we need to establish the historical locations
      of both theaters in New York City.


      1. **Gaiety Theatre Location**: The Gaiety Theatre was located at 1547 Broadway,
      near 45th Street, in Manhattan, New York City.


      2. **Comedy Theatre Location**: The Comedy Theatre was located at 110 West 41st
      Street, also in Manhattan, New York City.


      3. **Determine East/West Direction**: In Manhattan, the street numbers increase
      as you move from east to west. Therefore, a location with a higher street number
      is west of a location with a lower street number.


      4. **Comparison**: The Gaiety Theatre was on Broadway near 45th Street, while
      the Comedy Theatre was on West 41st Street. Since Broadway is a diagonal street,
      exact east/west comparison can be tricky, but generally, 1547 Broadway is west
      of 110 West 41st Street.


      Based on this information, the Gaiety Theatre was located west of the Comedy
      Theatre.


      **Answer**: NO'

      in New York City is located east of the Comedy Theatre in New York City, we
      need to consider their respective locations:


      1. **Identify the location of the Gaiety Theatre:** Historically, the Gaiety
      Theatre was located at 1547 Broadway, which is near Times Square in Manhattan.


      2. **Identify the location of the Comedy Theatre:** The Comedy Theatre was located
      at 110 West 41st Street, also in Manhattan.


      3. **Determine the relative east-west positioning:** In Manhattan, streets are
      generally numbered such that lower numbers are to the east and higher numbers
      are to the west. Broadway runs diagonally across Manhattan, but 1547 Broadway
      is located on the west side and intersects with streets around Times Square,
      like 46th Street.


      4. **Compare the two locations:** The Comedy Theatre on West 41st Street is
      further east compared to the Gaiety Theatre at 1547 Broadway, as West 41st Street
      runs east-west and intersects with Broadway further east than 46th Street.


      Based on these considerations, the Gaiety Theatre is not located east of the
      Comedy Theatre.

      one is definitively east of the other based solely on the information provided
      here.


      Thus, without specific location data, the question cannot be answered with a
      clear YES or NO solely based on their city locations. However, if you have access
      to a map or detailed addresses, you could use that to determine their relative

      is located east of The Green Building in Louisville, Kentucky, we need to identify
      the locations of both structures and compare their longitudinal coordinates
      or relative positions on a map.


      1. **Location of Actors Theatre of Louisville**: The Actors Theatre of Louisville
      is located at 316 West Main Street, Louisville, KY.


      2. **Location of The Green Building**: The Green Building is located at 732
      East Market Street, Louisville, KY.


      3. **Comparison**: In Louisville, streets labeled "West" typically indicate
      that they are located to the west of the central north-south axis of the city
      (often near Main Street), while streets labeled "East" are to the east of this
      axis. Since 316 West Main Street is labeled as "West" and 732 East Market Street
      is labeled as "East," we can conclude that the Actors Theatre of Louisville
      is located to the west of The Green Building.


      Therefore, based on these locations, Actors Theatre of Louisville is not located
      east of The Green Building.

      the geographical locations of both places.


      1. **Identify the location of San Andreas Lake**: San Andreas Lake is located
      on the San Francisco Peninsula in San Mateo County, California. It is situated
      to the west of the city of San Francisco.


      2. **Identify the location of St. Paul''s Catholic Church**: St. Paul''s Catholic
      Church is located in San Francisco, which is in the northern part of the San
      Francisco Peninsula.


      3. **Compare their positions**: San Francisco, where St. Paul''s Catholic Church
      is located, is generally to the northeast of San Andreas Lake. Specifically,
      since the church is in the city of San Francisco itself, which is to the east
      of San Andreas Lake, the church is therefore east of the lake.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: YES.'

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the location of Steppenwolf Theatre Company**: The Steppenwolf
      Theatre Company is located in Chicago, Illinois, specifically at 1650 N. Halsted
      Street.


      2. **Identify the location of Presidential Towers**: Presidential Towers is
      a residential building complex located in Chicago, Illinois, at 555 W. Madison
      Street.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: In terms of Chicago''s street grid
      system, streets like Halsted run north-south, and streets like Madison run east-west.
      Halsted Street is west of the Chicago River, while Madison Street is closer
      to the downtown area, also west of the river. However, Halsted is further west
      than the location of Presidential Towers.


      4. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Since Halsted Street is further west
      than Presidential Towers'' location on Madison Street, the Steppenwolf Theatre
      Company is west of the Presidential Towers.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is:


      NO.'

      1. **Location of the Basilica**: The Basilica of the National Shrine of the
      Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is located at 409 Cathedral Street, Baltimore,
      Maryland.


      2. **Location of the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre**: The Morris A. Mechanic Theatre

      has been demolished, but we can still use its historical location for this comparison.


      3. **Geographic Orientation**: Cathedral Street, where the Basilica is located,
      is to the north of the central downtown area, while Charles Street is more centrally
      located within downtown Baltimore.


      4. **Relative Position**: The Basilica is generally situated to the north of
      where the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre was located. To determine the east-west
      relationship, we observe that the Basilica is slightly west of Charles Street,
      making it west of the theatre''s location.


      Based on these observations, the Basilica is located to the west of the Morris
