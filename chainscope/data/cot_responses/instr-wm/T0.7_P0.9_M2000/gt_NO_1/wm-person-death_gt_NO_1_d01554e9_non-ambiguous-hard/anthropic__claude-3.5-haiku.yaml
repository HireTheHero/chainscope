      2. Then I''ll find out when Petrus Cunaeus lived.

      Step 1: Antoine de Challant

      - He was a noble from the Challant family in medieval Italy/France

      - He lived in the late 15th/early 16th century

      - I know he died sometime around 1500-1530

      - He was a Dutch humanist and scholar

      - He lived from 1586 to 1638

      - His date of death is clearly 1638


      Step 3: Comparison

      - Antoine de Challant died around 1500-1530

      - Petrus Cunaeus died in 1638

      - 1638 is later than 1500-1530

      After careful research:

      1517 is earlier than 1638.

      1. First, I''ll need to research when Hu Yin lived and died.

      2. Then I''ll research when Guillaume de Harsigny lived and died.

      3. Then I''ll compare their dates of death.


      After careful research:

      - Hu Yin was a Chinese historical figure who lived during the Tang Dynasty (618-907
      AD)

      - Guillaume de Harsigny was a French medieval physician who lived in the late
      13th/early 14th century (approximately 1260-1325)


      Comparing their death dates:

      - Hu Yin would have died sometime between 618-907 AD

      - Guillaume de Harsigny died around 1325 AD


      Since Guillaume de Harsigny died later in history than Hu Yin, Hu Yin did NOT
      die at a later date than Guillaume de Harsigny.

      1. First, I''ll find out when Nicholas Eymerich lived:

      - Nicholas Eymerich was a Spanish inquisitor and theologian

      - He lived from approximately 1320 to 1393


      2. Next, I''ll find out when Sebastian Brant lived:

      - Sebastian Brant was a German humanist, satirist, and lawyer

      3. Compare their lifespans:

      - Eymerich died in 1393

      - Brant was born in 1457, which is 64 years after Eymerich''s death


      4. Therefore, Eymerich died BEFORE Brant was even born.
