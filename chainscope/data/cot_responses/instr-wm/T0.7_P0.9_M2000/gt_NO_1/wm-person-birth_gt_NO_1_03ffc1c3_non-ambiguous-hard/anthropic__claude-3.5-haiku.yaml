      1. First, I''ll need to find out when Johannes Jetzer was born.

      2. Then I''ll find out when Johann Karl Zeune was born.

      3. Then I''ll compare their birth years.


      After careful research:

      - Johannes Jetzer was a Swiss mystic who lived from around 1465 to 1523

      - Johann Karl Zeune was a German pedagogue who lived from 1736 to 1788


      Comparing their birth years:

      - Jetzer: born around 1465

      - Zeune: born in 1736


      1465 is earlier than 1736.


      Therefore, Johannes Jetzer was NOT born later than Johann Karl Zeune.


      The answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll need to determine the time periods when Hartwig von Passau and

      2. Hartwig von Passau was a medieval German bishop who lived in the late 11th/early
      12th century. Specifically, he was Bishop of Passau from around 1106 to 1126.


      3. Roger FitzJohn was an Anglo-Norman nobleman who lived in the late 11th/early
      12th century as well. He was the son of John de Monmouth and died around 1137.
