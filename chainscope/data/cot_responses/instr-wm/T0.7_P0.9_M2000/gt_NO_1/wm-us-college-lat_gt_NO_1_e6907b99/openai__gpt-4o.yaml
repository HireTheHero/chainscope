      that would be geographically located in California.


      2. **Palo Alto University:** This is a private university located in Palo Alto,
      California, which is in the San Francisco Bay Area.


      Given that Henley-Putnam University does not have a traditional physical campus
      in California to compare geographically with Palo Alto University, the question
      of whether it is located north of Palo Alto University cannot be reasonably
      answered with a simple geographic comparison.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: NO, because Henley-Putnam University
      does not have a specific geographic location that can be compared to that of
      Palo Alto University.'

      it is not possible to determine a north-south relationship between the two based

      2. **University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs** is also

      Since both the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public

      1. **Identify the location of Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ**: Wilkes University
      had a satellite campus in Mesa, Arizona, but it closed in 2019. When it was
      operational, it was located in the downtown area of Mesa.


      2. **Identify the location of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering**: The

      Engineering is located, is in Tempe, which is generally west and slightly south
      of downtown Mesa.

      the steps of reasoning:


      1. **Locate Wilkes University, Mesa, AZ**: Wilkes University had a campus in

      campuses may close or relocate. Historically, Wilkes University''s Mesa campus
      was part of a group of colleges in downtown Mesa.


      2. **Locate Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, AZ**: This is part of Arizona
      State University (ASU) and is primarily based in Tempe, Arizona, though ASU
      has multiple campuses in the Phoenix metropolitan area, including in Mesa.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: Downtown Mesa, where the Wilkes campus was

      coordinates for the exact locations within these cities, we rely on the general
      knowledge of the area''s geography.


      4. **Determine North-South Relationship**: Based on the general layout of the
      Phoenix metropolitan area, Tempe (where the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering
      is primarily located) is slightly to the west and somewhat north of downtown
      Mesa.

      slightly to the north of Arizona. This means that when considering the latitudinal
      position, Georgia (and thus Clayton State University) is indeed north of Arizona
      (and Arizona Christian University).


      Based on this analysis, the answer is:


      YES.'

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern part of the United States.


      Considering the general latitudinal positions:
