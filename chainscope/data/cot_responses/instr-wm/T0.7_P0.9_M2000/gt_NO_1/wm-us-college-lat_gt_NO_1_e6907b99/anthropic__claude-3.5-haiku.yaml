      2. Next, I''ll locate University of Central Arkansas:

      - It is located in Conway, Arkansas (AR)


      3. Now I''ll consider their geographical positions:

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast, in the southeastern United States

      - Arkansas is in the central southern part of the United States

      - North Carolina is geographically east and north of Arkansas


      4. Therefore, Fayetteville, NC is indeed north of Conway, AR.

      1. First, let me clarify that Kate Gleason College of Engineering is actually
      part of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), located in Rochester, NY.


      2. Since it''s part of the same campus and institution, it cannot be located
      north or south of RIT - it is at the same location.


      3. Therefore, the statement "Kate Gleason College of Engineering is located
