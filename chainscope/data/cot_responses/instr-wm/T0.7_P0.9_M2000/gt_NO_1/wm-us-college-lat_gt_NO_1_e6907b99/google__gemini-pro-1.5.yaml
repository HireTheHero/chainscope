      of Louisiana State University Shreveport (LSUS) and McMurry University.  LSUS
      is in Shreveport, Louisiana, which is in the northern part of the state. McMurry
      University is in Abilene, Texas.


      2. We need to figure out if Shreveport, LA is north of Abilene, TX.  Looking
      at a map, or considering the geography of the two states, Shreveport is indeed
      north of Abilene.

      3. **Research specific addresses (if possible):**  I do not have real-time access

      in Chicago, it''s unlikely one was significantly "north" of the other in the

      latitude means further north.


      3. **Determine which university has a higher latitude:** The university with
      the higher latitude is further north.


      Using a map or online search, we can see that the University of Miami is in
      Coral Gables, south of downtown Miami. Miami International University of Art
      & Design is located in downtown Miami. Therefore, the University of Miami is

      School of Biomedical Engineering and Purdue University College of Agriculture

      of the other.

      and maps show these buildings are relatively close and somewhat intertwined,
      not in a clear north/south relationship.


      3. **Precise directions might vary by building:** Specific buildings within
      each school/department might have slight directional differences, but overall,
      the question about one school being *north* of the other is not a straightforward
      yes or no.

      Corcoran College of Art and Design was located at 500 17th Street NW, Washington,
      D.C..  It merged with George Washington University in 2014.  GW''s School of
      Nursing is located at 2600 Virginia Avenue NW.


      17th Street NW is west of Virginia Avenue NW.  Virginia Avenue runs diagonally,
      southwest to northeast. 2600 Virginia Ave NW is further north along the avenue
      than 500 17th St NW is.
