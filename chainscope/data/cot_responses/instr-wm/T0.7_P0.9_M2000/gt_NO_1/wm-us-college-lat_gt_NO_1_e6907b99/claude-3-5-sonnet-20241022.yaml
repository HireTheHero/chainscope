      - Since Davis is north of Sacramento

      - And D-Q University is in Davis

      - While University of Sacramento is in Sacramento

      - Therefore D-Q University is north of University of Sacramento

      1. First, let me identify the locations of both universities:

      - D-Q University was located in Davis, California

      - University of Sacramento was located in Sacramento, California


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Davis is located approximately 15 miles west of Sacramento

      - Davis is slightly north of Sacramento, but the difference in latitude is minimal


      3. D-Q University was specifically located west of Davis

      - This puts it roughly at the same latitude as Sacramento, or very slightly
      north


      4. Given the minimal latitude difference between these locations, and considering
      the margin of error in exact campus locations, we can''t definitively say D-Q
      University was north of University of Sacramento.

      1. Robert Morris University Illinois was located in Chicago, IL before it closed
      in 2020.


      2. La Salle Extension University was a correspondence school also based in Chicago,
      IL before it closed in 1982.


      3. Since both institutions were located in Chicago and La Salle Extension University
      was a correspondence school without a traditional campus, it''s not possible
      to definitively determine their relative north-south positioning.


      4. Without being able to determine their exact locations within Chicago relative
      to each other, I cannot make a valid north-south comparison.


      Answer: NO ANSWER POSSIBLE - There isn''t enough information to determine their
      relative north-south positions within Chicago, and one was a correspondence
      school without a physical campus.'

      2. Illinois College of Optometry (ICO) is also located in Chicago, at 3241 South
      Michigan Avenue.


      3. Looking at the street addresses:

      - IIT: 3300 South Federal Street

      - ICO: 3241 South Michigan Avenue


      4. Both are on South streets, with IIT at 3300 and ICO at 3241.

      - A higher number on a South street means it''s further south

      - 3300 is a higher number than 3241


      5. Therefore, IIT is slightly further south than ICO.


      NO (IIT is not north of ICO, it''s actually slightly south of it)'

      - Illinois College of Optometry (ICO) is also in Chicago, located at 3241 S

      2. Looking at their street addresses:

      - Both are on South streets (S Federal and S Michigan)

      - Their street numbers are very close (3300 vs 3241)

      - Both are actually just a few blocks from each other


      3. Checking their exact locations:

      - IIT is slightly south of ICO

      - They are practically neighbors, with ICO being just north of IIT''s main campus

      1) First, let me recall the locations of both institutions:

      - Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) is located in Chicago, in the Bronzeville
      neighborhood

      - Illinois College of Optometry (ICO) is also located in Chicago


      2) More specifically:

      - IIT is located at 3300 South Federal Street

      - ICO is located at 3241 South Michigan Avenue


      3) Looking at these addresses:

      - Both are on South streets

      - Both are in the 3200-3300 block range

      - They are actually very close to each other, just a few blocks apart


      4) In fact, IIT and ICO are practically neighbors in Chicago''s South Side:

      - ICO is slightly east of IIT (Michigan Ave vs Federal St)

      - Their street numbers indicate they are at almost the same latitude

      - IIT is at 3300 South while ICO is at 3241 South

      - A lower "South" number means slightly more north


      5) Since ICO''s address is 3241 South and IIT''s is 3300 South, ICO is actually
      slightly north of IIT.


      Answer: NO'

      2. Looking at their relative positions on a map:

      - Anacapa Street runs east-west in downtown Santa Barbara

      - De la Vina Street is several blocks west and slightly north of Anacapa Street

      - Antioch University is located in the downtown area

      - Fielding Graduate University is located in the upper State Street area


      3. Comparing their north-south positions:

      - Antioch University is slightly south of Fielding Graduate University


      Therefore: NO, Antioch University Santa Barbara is not located north of Fielding
      Graduate University.'

      of St. Thomas


      Therefore, since University of St. Thomas is southwest of UH-Downtown, it cannot

      FL


      2) The Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is located at 2033 Mowry Road


      3) The Southwest Recreation Center is located at 3150 Hull Road


      4) Looking at a UF campus map:

      - The Cancer and Genetics Complex is in the Health Science/Medical area

      - The Southwest Recreation Center is in the southwest part of campus, near student
      housing


      5) The Cancer and Genetics Complex is north of Hull Road, while the Southwest
      Rec Center is south of Hull Road


      Therefore: YES, the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is located north of
      the Southwest Recreation Center.'
