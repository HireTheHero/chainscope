      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      colleges. The Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is part of the University
      of Georgia, which is located in Athens, Georgia. The University of Georgia School
      of Public and International Affairs is also located in Athens, Georgia.


      2. **Compare the Locations**: Since both colleges are in the same city, we need
      to consider their specific locations within Athens.


      3. **Determine the Direction**: We need to determine if the Franklin College
      of Arts and Sciences is located north of the University of Georgia School of
      Public and International Affairs. To do this, we need to understand the relative
      positions of these colleges within Athens.


      4. **Campus Layout**: The University of Georgia has a large campus in Athens.
      The Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is located on the main campus, while
      the School of Public and International Affairs is part of the main campus but
      may have a specific location within it.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the understanding that
      both colleges are on the same campus in Athens, Georgia, it is reasonable to
      conclude that the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is **NOT** located north
      of the University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs. The
      specific locations of these colleges within the campus are not mentioned, and
      they are likely in close proximity to each other.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Indiana State University is located in Terre
      Haute, Indiana, which is in the western part of the state. Sonnencroft is located
      in West Virginia, but the specific location within the state is not mentioned.


      2. **Understand the general locations**: Indiana is located in the Midwest region
      of the United States, while West Virginia is in the Appalachian region, which
      is to the east of Indiana.


      3. **Consider the relative positions**: Generally, when we think of locations
      in the United States, the farther west you go, the higher the latitude (the
      farther north). However, this is a very general rule and does not always hold
      true, especially when dealing with specific locations within states.


      4. **Latitude comparison**: To determine if one location is north of another,
      we need to compare their latitudes. Without specific coordinates for Sonnencroft,
      WV, it''s challenging to make a definitive comparison.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information and considering the general
      rule of latitude increasing as you move west in the United States, it''s likely
      that Indiana State University, located in western Indiana, would be north of
      a location in West Virginia. However, without more specific details about Sonnencroft''s

    5de136ce-a87a-4d84-a872-7e36f813907b: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the geographical locations of Kingston University LA and Charles R. Drew University
      of Medicine and Science, both in California, and then compare their positions
      relative to each other, specifically in terms of north-south orientation.


      1. **Kingston University LA** is located in Van Nuys, California. Van Nuys is
      a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, which is in
      the southern part of California.


      2. **Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science** is located in the
      Willowbrook neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Willowbrook is also in
      the southern part of California, south of downtown Los Angeles.


      Given these locations:

      - Van Nuys (where Kingston University LA is located) is generally north of Willowbrook
      (where Charles R. Drew University is located).


      Therefore, based on the relative positions of Van Nuys and Willowbrook, the
      answer to whether Kingston University LA is located north of Charles R. Drew
      University of Medicine and Science is: **YES**'
    643ef3b4-1d23-460f-8af8-12fb2f1b3b77: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Kingston University LA is located in Los Angeles,
      California, and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science is also located
      in Los Angeles, California.


      2. **Determine relative positions**: Since both universities are located in
      the same city, we need to compare their relative positions within Los Angeles.


      3. **Use map resources**: To determine the relative positions, we can use map
      resources like Google Maps or other mapping tools. By searching for Kingston
      University LA and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science on a map,
      we can see their relative positions within Los Angeles.


      4. **Compare positions**: After locating both universities on the map, we can
      see that Kingston University LA is generally north of Charles R. Drew University
      of Medicine and Science. However, the difference in latitude between the two
      universities is relatively small.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative positions and the small difference
      in latitude, it is reasonable to say that Kingston University LA is located
      north of Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, although the difference
      is not significant in terms of distance.

      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
      universities. California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) is located in
      Los Angeles, California. New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT)
      is located in Socorro, New Mexico.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Next, we compare the locations. Los Angeles is
      in southern California, while Socorro is in central New Mexico.


      3. **Determine the direction**: We need to determine if CSULA is north of NMT.
      Generally, California is west of New Mexico, so the main directional difference
      is east-west, not north-south.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions, since Los Angeles (where
      CSULA is located) is not north of Socorro (where NMT is located), the answer

      institutions. Portland State University is located in Portland, Oregon, and
      Pacific University Health Professions Campus is located in Hillsboro, Oregon.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Next, we compare the locations. Hillsboro is located
      west of Portland and slightly south of it, but it''s still in the same general

      Louisiana, while Louisiana Tech University is located in Ruston, Louisiana.


      2. **Understand geographical positions**: We need to understand the relative
      positions of Monroe and Ruston. Monroe is in northeastern Louisiana, and Ruston
      is in northern Louisiana. This means that both cities are in the northern part
      of the state.


      3. **Compare north-south positions**: To determine if the University of Louisiana
      at Monroe is located north of Louisiana Tech University, we need to compare
      their north-south positions. Since both universities are in the northern part
      of Louisiana, we can''t simply say that one is "north of" the other. They are
      both in the same general northern region.


      4. **Consider specific locations**: To get a more precise answer, we can look
      at the specific locations of the universities within their respective cities.
      The University of Louisiana at Monroe is located on the northern edge of Monroe,
      while Louisiana Tech University is located in the center of Ruston. This suggests
      that the University of Louisiana at Monroe might be slightly more northern than
      Louisiana Tech University within their respective cities.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the specific locations within their cities, it''s
      reasonable to say that the University of Louisiana at Monroe is located slightly
      north of Louisiana Tech University. However, since both universities are in
      the northern part of Louisiana, the difference in their north-south positions
      is relatively small.


      In summary, while the University of Louisiana at Monroe is technically located
      slightly north of Louisiana Tech University due to their specific locations
      within their respective cities, the difference is relatively minor. Both universities
      are in the northern part of Louisiana, making them both in the same general
      northern region.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

      institutions. The Askew School of Public Administration and Policy is part of
      Florida State University (FSU) and is located in Tallahassee, Florida. The Florida
      State University College of Social Sciences is also part of FSU and is located
      in Tallahassee, Florida.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Since both institutions are located in the same
      city (Tallahassee), we can conclude that they are not significantly north or
      south of each other. They are essentially in the same location.


      3. **Determine the direction**: Given that they are in the same location, the
      question of whether one is "north of" the other becomes less meaningful. They
      are not geographically separated enough to have a significant north-south relationship.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the locations and the fact that they are both part
      of the same university (FSU) in the same city (Tallahassee), the answer to whether
      the Florida State University College of Social Sciences is located north of
      the Askew School of Public Administration and Policy is: $\boxed{NO}$

      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to determine the locations of
      McNeese State University and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. McNeese
      State University is located in Lake Charles, Louisiana, while the University
      of Louisiana at Lafayette is located in Lafayette, Louisiana.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Next, we compare the locations. Lake Charles is
      located in southwestern Louisiana, while Lafayette is located in southern Louisiana.


      3. **Determine the direction**: We need to determine if McNeese State University
      (in Lake Charles) is north of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (in Lafayette).
      Based on the locations, Lake Charles is generally west of Lafayette.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Lake Charles (where McNeese State University is
      located) is not directly north of Lafayette (where the University of Louisiana
      at Lafayette is located), the answer to whether McNeese State University is
