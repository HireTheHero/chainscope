      is asking about the age of the historical figures at the time of their deaths.


      Step 1: Find the age of Karl Josef von Bachmann at the time of their death.

      To find this, we need to know the year of their death. Unfortunately, the passage
      doesn''t provide this information. However, we can assume that Karl Josef von
      Bachmann died around the same time as Bernard of Vienne, who died in 1568. Therefore,
      we can assume that Karl Josef von Bachmann died in the 1560s or 1570s.


      Step 2: Find the age of Bernard of Vienne at the time of their death.

      Bernard of Vienne died in 1568. Therefore, his age at the time of his death
      was 57 years old.

      57 years old at the time of his death. Therefore, he was older than Bernard
