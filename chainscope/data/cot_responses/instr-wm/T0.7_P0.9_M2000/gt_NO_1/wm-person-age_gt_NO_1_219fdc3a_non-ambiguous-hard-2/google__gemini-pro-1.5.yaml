    650cfb6d-d016-4997-b51e-ebdd1de3fe61: '1. **Find the death dates of Hugh the Great
      and Jacques Perret.**  There are multiple people named Jacques Perret, so we
      need to be specific.  The most commonly known Hugh the Great died in 956. Let''s
      assume, for the sake of this exercise, we''re talking about the Robertian Hugh
      the Great (died 956).  We need more information about *which* Jacques Perret
      to compare him to.


      2. **Let''s assume we''re talking about Jacques Perret, the French architect
      (1900-1992).**


      3. **Compare their ages at death.** Hugh the Great died in 956.  We don''t know
      his birth date, but he was certainly less than 956 years old. Jacques Perret
      died in 1992 at the age of 92.


      4. **Determine who was older at death.**  Since Hugh the Great was definitely
      younger than 956 when he died and Jacques Perret was 92 when he died, we can''t
      say for certain who was older at their time of death without knowing Hugh the
      Great''s birth year. However, it''s highly probable that Hugh the Great was
      *younger* than 956 at his death, making Jacques Perret likely older at his time
      of death.


      5.  If we assume Hugh the Great was younger than 92 at the time of his death,
      the answer is YES.  If we assume he lived to be older than 92, the answer would
      be NO. Since we don''t have his birth date, we can''t definitively answer the
      question.


      However, given the high probability that Hugh the Great was younger than 92
      at his death, I will answer based on that probability:


      YES

      Since Claudius Colas died in 1540 and John of Ibelin died in 1236, Claudius
      Colas lived *after* John of Ibelin. While we don''t know Claudius Colas'' birth
      date, we know he lived past the year John of Ibelin died.  This makes him older

      lived in the 16th century long enough to be older than Mickiewicz was in the
      19th century when he died.

      very first day of 1535, he could not have been older than Mickiewicz at death,
      since Mickiewicz lived in a later century.
