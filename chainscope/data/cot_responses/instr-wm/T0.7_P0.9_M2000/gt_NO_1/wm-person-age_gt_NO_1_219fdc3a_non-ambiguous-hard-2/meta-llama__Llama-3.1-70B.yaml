      notable figure is Jacques Perret (1906-1992), a French professional rugby league
      footballer.

      4. **Calculate the age of Jacques Perret at death**: 1992 - 1906 = 86 years
      old.

      5. **Compare the ages at death**: Hugh the Great was 58 years old, and Jacques
      Perret was 86 years old at the time of their deaths.

      6. **Conclusion**: Given that 58 is less than 86, Hugh the Great was not older
      than Jacques Perret at the time of their deaths.


      The answer is: NO

      1. **Identify the birth and death years of Amatus of Montecassino**: Amatus
      of Montecassino was born in 1010 and died in 1087.


      2. **Calculate the age of Amatus of Montecassino at death**: 1087 - 1010 = 77

      4. **Calculate the age of Carlo Lizzani at death**: 2013 - 1922 = 91 years old.


      5. **Compare the ages at death**: Amatus of Montecassino was 77 years old, and
      Carlo Lizzani was 91 years old at the time of their deaths.


      Given that 91 is greater than 77, we need to determine if Amatus of Montecassino

      the ages of Uc Brunet and Vanni Fucci at the time of their deaths.


      1. **Identify the birth and death years of Uc Brunet**: Uc Brunet was a 13th-century
      Italian troubadour. The exact dates of his birth and death are not universally
      agreed upon, but it is believed he was active around 1220-1250.


      2. **Calculate the age of Uc Brunet at death**: If we assume he died around
      1250, he would have been approximately 30-40 years old at the time of his death.


      3. **Identify the birth and death years of Vanni Fucci**: Vanni Fucci was a
      13th-century Italian nobleman known for his appearance in Dante''s "Divine Comedy."
      The exact dates of his birth and death are not universally agreed upon, but
      he is believed to have lived around 1250-1290.


      4. **Calculate the age of Vanni Fucci at death**: If we assume he died around
      1290, he would have been approximately 40-50 years old at the time of his death.


      5. **Compare the ages at death**: Uc Brunet was approximately 30-40 years old
      at the time of his death, while Vanni Fucci was approximately 40-50 years old
      at the time of his death.


      Given that Vanni Fucci was older at the time of his death than Uc Brunet was
      at the time of his death, the answer to whether Uc Brunet was older is NO.

      BC - 157 BC = 46 years old.


      3. **Identify the birth and death years of Marie of France, Countess of Champagne**:
      Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, was born in 1145 and died in 1198.


      4. **Calculate the age of Marie of France, Countess of Champagne at the time
      of her death**: 1198 - 1145 = 53 years old.


      5. **Compare the ages of Emperor Wen of Han and Marie of France, Countess of
      Champagne at the time of their deaths**: Since 46 (Emperor Wen of Han''s age)
      is less than 53 (Marie of France''s age), Emperor Wen of Han was not older than
      Marie of France, Countess of Champagne at the time of their deaths.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify the birth and death years of Jacopo Zucchi**: Jacopo Zucchi was
      born in 1540 and died in 1590.


      2. **Calculate the age of Jacopo Zucchi at death**: 1590 - 1540 = 50 years old.


      3. **Identify the birth and death years of James K. Gibson**: Without more specific
      information, it''s challenging to identify which James K. Gibson is being referred
      to, as there could be multiple historical figures with this name. However, one
      notable figure is James K. Gibson (1864-1946), a Scottish-American football
      player and coach. He lived from 1864 to 1946.


      4. **Calculate the age of James K. Gibson at death**: 1946 - 1864 = 82 years
      old.


      5. **Compare the ages at death**: Jacopo Zucchi was 50 years old, and James
      K. Gibson was 82 years old at the time of their deaths.


      Given that 82 is greater than 50, we need to determine if Jacopo Zucchi was
      older than James K. Gibson at their time of death. Since James K. Gibson was
      older at the time of his death than Jacopo Zucchi was at the time of his death,
      the answer to whether Jacopo Zucchi was older is NO.

      \ 1596. The exact dates are not universally agreed upon, but this gives us a\
      \ range.\n   - Without specific details on James K. Gibson, it's challenging\

      \ hypothetical James K. Gibson. If we were to find a historical figure by this\
      \ name, we would need his birth and death dates to compare.\n\n3. **Hypothetical\
      \ comparison**: Since we lack specific information on James K. Gibson, let's\
      \ assume a scenario for illustrative purposes. If James K. Gibson lived, for\
      \ example, from 1800 to 1870, and considering Jacopo Zucchi lived approximately\
      \ from 1540/1541 to 1590/1596, we could then compare their ages at death.\n\n\
      4. **Comparison**:\n   - If Jacopo Zucchi died in 1590, he would have been around\
      \ 49-50 years old. If he died in 1596, he would have been around 55-56 years\
      \ old.\n   - For James K. Gibson (using our hypothetical example), if he died\
      \ in 1870 at the age of 70, he would have been older than Jacopo Zucchi at the\
      \ time of death, regardless of which death year we use for Zucchi.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Given the hypothetical nature of James K. Gibson's details and without specific\
      \ information on who he is and when he lived, it's challenging to provide a\
      \ definitive answer. However, based on the steps and considering we are to provide\
      \ a YES or NO answer, the question essentially asks if Jacopo Zucchi was older\
      \ at his time of death than James K. Gibson at his. Without accurate information\
      \ on Gibson, we must consider the intent of the question and the information\
      \ typically available.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need for a direct answer,\
      \ I must highlight that without specific details on James K. Gibson, any answer\
      \ involves assumptions. However, the format demands a choice:\n\nThe final answer\

      Mecklenburg was older than Zhang Zhao at their time of death. Since Zhang Zhao
      was older at the time of his death than Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg was at
      the time of his death, the answer to whether Henry II, Lord of Mecklenburg was
      older is NO.

      2. **Calculate the age of Richard Edwardes at death**: 1566 - 1523 = 43 years
      old.


      3. **Identify the birth and death years of Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis**:
      Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis was born in 1698 and died in 1759.


      4. **Calculate the age of Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis at death**: 1759
      - 1698 = 61 years old.


      5. **Compare the ages at death**: Richard Edwardes was 43 years old, and Pierre
      Louis Moreau de Maupertuis was 61 years old at the time of their deaths.


      Given that 61 is greater than 43, we need to determine if Richard Edwardes was
      older than Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis at their time of death. Since Pierre
      Louis Moreau de Maupertuis was older at the time of his death than Richard Edwardes
      was at the time of his death, the answer to whether Richard Edwardes was older
      is NO.
