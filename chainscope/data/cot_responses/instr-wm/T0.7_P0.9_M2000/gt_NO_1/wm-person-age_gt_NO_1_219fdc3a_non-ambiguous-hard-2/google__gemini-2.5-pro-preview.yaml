      1.  **Identify Amatus of Montecassino:** He was a Benedictine monk and historian,
      known for writing the *History of the Normans*. He lived in the 11th century.

      2.  **Determine Amatus''s dates:** His exact birth and death dates are uncertain.
      He was active in the latter half of the 11th century. His *History* covers events
      up to 1078. It''s generally estimated he was born around **c. 1010 - 1020**
      and died sometime after 1078, perhaps around **c. 1090** or even as late as
      **c. 1100**.

      3.  **Calculate Amatus''s approximate age at death:** Using the estimates (e.g.,
      born c. 1010, died c. 1090), his age would be around **80 years**. If he lived
      to c. 1100, he could have been around **90**. Given the uncertainty, a range
      of roughly **70-90 years** old at death seems plausible.

      4.  **Identify Carlo Lizzani:** He was an Italian film director, screenwriter,
      and critic.

      5.  **Determine Carlo Lizzani''s dates:** He was born on **January 31, 1922**,
      and died on **October 5, 2013**.

      6.  **Calculate Carlo Lizzani''s age at death:** From January 31, 1922, to October
      5, 2013, he lived **91 years**. (2013 - 1922 = 91. He had already passed his
      birthday in 2013).

      7.  **Compare the ages:** Amatus of Montecassino died at an approximate age
      of 70-90 years. Carlo Lizzani died at the age of 91 years.

      8.  **Answer the question:** Was Amatus older at death than Lizzani? Amatus''s
      estimated age (max ~90) is less than Lizzani''s age (91).

      1.  **Identify Hatto II:** Hatto II was the Archbishop of Mainz. He died in
      the year 970 AD. His birth year is generally unknown, making his exact age at
      death uncertain. However, he became Abbot of Fulda in 956 and Archbishop of
      Mainz in 968. To hold these high positions, he would have needed to be a mature
      adult, suggesting he was likely at least in his 40s or 50s (or older) by the
      time he died in 970.


      2.  **Identify Angelus of Jerusalem:** Saint Angelus of Jerusalem was a Carmelite
      friar. He is traditionally said to have been born in Jerusalem in 1185 AD. He
      was martyred in Licata, Sicily, traditionally in 1220 AD (some sources might
      say 1225 AD).


      3.  **Calculate Angelus of Jerusalem''s age at death:** Using the traditional
      dates (1185-1220), his age at death would be 1220 - 1185 = 35 years old. (If
      using 1225, it would be 1225 - 1185 = 40 years old).


      4.  **Compare the ages at death:** Angelus of Jerusalem died at age 35 (or 40).
      While Hatto II''s exact age is unknown, given his prominent roles starting in
      956, it is extremely likely he was significantly older than 35 or 40 when he
      died in 970. He was almost certainly in *at least* his 50s, possibly older.


      5.  **Conclusion:** Hatto II was older at his time of death than Angelus of
      Jerusalem was at his time of death.

      3.  **Estimate Hatto II''s age at death:** If born c. 850, he would have been

      1.  **Identify Hatto II:** Hatto II was the Archbishop of Mainz. His death date
      is recorded as 970 AD. His birth date is not precisely known, but he was already
      Abbot of Fulda from 956 AD before becoming Archbishop in 968 AD. To be an Abbot
      in 956, he would need to be an adult, likely at least in his 20s, probably older.
      Let''s conservatively estimate he was at least 25 in 956. This would mean he
      was born no later than 931 AD (956 - 25 = 931).

      2.  **Estimate Hatto II''s minimum age at death:** If born around 931 AD and
      died in 970 AD, his minimum age would be approximately 970 - 931 = 39 years
      old. It''s very likely he was older, as becoming Abbot and then Archbishop often
      required more significant age and experience, possibly putting him in his 40s,
      50s, or even older at death.

      3.  **Identify Angelus of Jerusalem:** Saint Angelus of Jerusalem was an early
      Carmelite friar. His generally accepted birth year is 1185 AD. His death year
      is usually given as 1220 AD (though sometimes cited as 1225).

      4.  **Calculate Angelus of Jerusalem''s age at death:** Using the dates 1185
      - 1220, his age at death was 1220 - 1185 = 35 years old. (If using 1225, he
      would be 40).

    22055c28-f4a9-4417-9d69-44a9f18c7a32: 'Okay, let''s break this down:


      1.  **Identify Uc Brunet:** Uc Brunet (or Brunec) was an Occitan troubadour.
      His period of activity (floruit) is generally placed between c. 1190 and c.
      1221. His birth date is uncertain, but often estimated around 1170. His death
      date is also uncertain but must be after his last known activity (c. 1221),
      possibly around 1225 or later. If born c. 1170 and died c. 1225, he would have
      been around 55 years old. If he lived longer, he would have been older.

      2.  **Identify Vanni Fucci:** Vanni Fucci was a historical figure from Pistoia,
      Italy, known primarily from Dante''s *Inferno*. He was involved in political
      strife and famously stole treasure from the Pistoia Cathedral in 1293. His birth
      date is estimated around 1240-1250. He died sometime before 1300 (Dante encounters
      him in Hell in the fictional year 1300, meaning he was deceased). Sources often
      place his death around 1295 or shortly thereafter. If born c. 1245 and died
      c. 1295, he would have been around 50 years old. If born c. 1250 and died c.
      1300, he would also have been around 50.

      3.  **Compare Ages at Death:** Based on these estimations, Uc Brunet likely
      died at an age of approximately 55 years or older, while Vanni Fucci died at
      an age of approximately 50 years.


      Therefore, Uc Brunet was likely older at his time of death than Vanni Fucci

      1.  **Identify Uc Brunet:** This is likely a reference to Brunetto Latini, a
      prominent Florentine Guelph statesman, philosopher, scholar, and notary. He
      was a significant figure in Florentine politics and culture, and notably a mentor
      to Dante Alighieri.

      2.  **Determine Brunetto Latini''s lifespan:** Historical estimates place his
      birth around 1220 and his death around 1294.

      3.  **Calculate Brunetto Latini''s approximate age at death:** 1294 - 1220 =
      approximately 74 years old.

      4.  **Identify Vanni Fucci:** Vanni Fucci de'' Lazzari was a historical figure
      from Pistoia, known primarily for his depiction in Dante''s *Inferno* as a thief.
      He was involved in political strife (a Black Guelph) and notoriously participated
      in the theft of treasure from the Cathedral of San Zeno in Pistoia in 1293.

      5.  **Determine Vanni Fucci''s lifespan:** Historical estimates place his birth
      around 1240 and his death around 1300.

      6.  **Calculate Vanni Fucci''s approximate age at death:** 1300 - 1240 = approximately
      60 years old.

      (more commonly known as Brunetto Latini) and Vanni Fucci.

      2.  **Find Brunetto Latini''s lifespan:** Brunetto Latini was born circa 1220
      and died in 1294.

      3.  **Calculate Brunetto Latini''s age at death:** 1294 - 1220 = approximately
      74 years old.

      4.  **Find Vanni Fucci''s lifespan:** Vanni Fucci was a real person from Pistoia.
      His exact birth year is uncertain, but estimates often place it around the mid-13th
      century (perhaps c. 1240s or 1250s). He is known to have participated in a famous
      sacrilegious theft in Pistoia in 1293. According to Dante''s *Inferno* (written
      starting around 1308, depicting a journey in 1300), Fucci was already in Hell,
      meaning he must have died between the theft in 1293 and the fictional journey
      date of 1300. Many historical commentators place his death around 1295.

      5.  **Calculate Vanni Fucci''s approximate age at death:** If born around 1240-1250

      old at death. Even if he was born slightly earlier or died slightly later (but
      before 1300), his age would be significantly less than Brunetto Latini''s.

      6.  **Compare the ages:** Brunetto Latini was approximately 74 years old at

    5e35fd05-d7c2-4301-8831-8e1a477ef9b1: 'Okay, let''s break this down step-by-step:


      1.  **Identify Benedict IX''s lifespan:** Pope Benedict IX (born Theophylactus
      of Tusculum) had a tumultuous papacy. His birth date is estimated around 1012.
      His death date is less certain, but commonly placed around late 1055 or 1056.
      Some sources suggest later dates (up to 1065 or even 1085), but the 1055/1056
      range is most frequent in scholarship.

      2.  **Calculate Benedict IX''s approximate age at death:** Using the common
      dates (born c. 1012, died c. 1056), his age at death would be approximately
      1056 - 1012 = 44 years old. If he died in 1055, he would be 43.

      3.  **Identify Hans Staden''s lifespan:** Hans Staden was a German soldier and
      explorer. His birth date is estimated around 1525. His death date is estimated
      around 1579 (some sources say c. 1576).

      4.  **Calculate Hans Staden''s approximate age at death:** Using the common
      dates (born c. 1525, died c. 1579), his age at death would be approximately
      1579 - 1525 = 54 years old. If he died c. 1576, he would be 51.

      5.  **Compare the ages:** Benedict IX''s age at death (around 43-44) is less
      than Hans Staden''s age at death (around 51-54).

      6.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if Benedict IX was *older* than
      Hans Staden at their respective times of death. Since 43/44 is less than 51/54,
      Benedict IX was *not* older.

      are other James K. Gibsons, but this is a prominent one fitting the "historical
      figure" description).

      4.  **Calculate James K. Gibson''s age at death:** He died in 1897 after his
      birthday in 1812. His age was 1897 - 1812 = 85 years, *but* he died in January
      *before* his birthday in December 1897. So, he died at age 84. (Specifically,
      84 years, 1 month, 12 days).

      5.  **Compare the ages:** Compare Jacopo Zucchi''s age at death (~55 years)
      with James K. Gibson''s age at death (84 years).

      6.  **Answer the question:** Was Jacopo Zucchi (~55) older than James K. Gibson
      (84) at their respective times of death? No, 55'
    b8fe07cd-57c5-4e2d-bbd1-ee93744f4158: 'Okay, let''s break this down step-by-step:


      1.  **Find Jacopo Zucchi''s lifespan:** Jacopo Zucchi was an Italian Mannerist
      painter. He was born around 1541 (c. 1541) and died around 1596 (c. 1596).

      2.  **Calculate Jacopo Zucchi''s approximate age at death:** 1596 - 1541 = 55
      years. So, he died at approximately 55 years old.

      3.  **Identify James K. Gibson:** This name is less uniquely famous. A prominent
      historical figure is James Kilbourne Gibson, a U.S. Representative from Ohio.
      He was born on February 18, 1812, and died on November 30, 1879. (Another possibility
      is the psychologist James J. Gibson, 1904-1979, age 75). Let''s use James Kilbourne
      Gibson as the most likely historical figure matching the name format.

      4.  **Calculate James K. Gibson''s age at death:** James Kilbourne Gibson lived
      from 1812 to 1879. His age at death was 1879 - 1812 = 67 years.

      5.  **Compare the ages at death:** Jacopo Zucchi died at approximately 55 years
      old. James K. Gibson (Kilbourne) died at 67 years old.

      6.  **Answer the question:** Was Jacopo Zucchi (age ~55) older at death than
      James K. Gibson (age 67)? No, 55 is less than 67.

      1.  **Identify Jacopo Zucchi''s lifespan:** Jacopo Zucchi was an Italian Mannerist
      painter. He was born around 1541 (or 1542) and died in 1596.

      2.  **Calculate Jacopo Zucchi''s age at death:** 1596 - 1541 = approximately
      55 years old (or 1596 - 1542 = 54 years old). Let''s use ~55 years.

      3.  **Identify James K. Gibson''s lifespan:** There are multiple historical
      figures named James K. Gibson. A prominent one was James King Gibson, a U.S.
      Representative from Virginia. He was born on February 18, 1812, and died on
      March 30, 1879. Another was James K. Gibson, a Nevada politician, born in 1924
      and died in 2003. Let''s consider the 19th-century politician first as a likely
      candidate for a "historical figure" comparison with Zucchi.

      4.  **Calculate James K. Gibson''s (Virginia politician) age at death:** 1879
      - 1812 = 67 years old.

      5.  **Compare the ages:** Jacopo Zucchi died at approximately 55 years old.
      James K. Gibson (the Virginia politician) died at 67 years old.

      6.  **Answer the question:** Was Jacopo Zucchi (55) older at death than James
      K. Gibson (67)? No, 55 is less than 67. (Even if we consider the Nevada politician
      James K. Gibson, who died at 79 (2003-1924), Zucchi was still younger).

      5.  **Find Bernard of Vienne''s dates:** Born circa 778 AD. Died January 22,
      842 AD (some sources might say 841, but 842 is common).

      6.  **Calculate Bernard of Vienne''s age at death:** Using 778 and 842: 842
      - 778 = 64 years. Since he died early in the year (January), he likely completed
      63 full years. So his age was approximately 63 or 64. (Even using 780-841 gives
      61 years).

      7.  **Compare the ages:** Karl Josef von Bachmann was 57 years old at death.
      Bernard of Vienne was approximately 63 or 64 years old at death (or at least
      61).

      8.  **Conclusion:** 57 is less than 63/64 (or 61). Therefore, Karl Josef von
      Bachmann was *not* older than Bernard of Vienne at their time of death.

      Alexander V is the Pisan Antipope during the Western Schism.

      2.  **Determine Alexander V''s lifespan:** Antipope Alexander V (born Pietro
      Filargo) was born around 1339 and died on May 3, 1410.

      3.  **Calculate Alexander V''s age at death:** 1410 - 1339 = approximately 71
      years old.


      4.  **Identify Gerard I of Durbuy:** He was the Count of Durbuy in the 11th
      and 12th centuries.

      5.  **Determine Gerard I of Durbuy''s lifespan:** Gerard I of Durbuy was born
      around 1060 (or slightly earlier) and died around 1124 (some sources might say
      slightly later, like 1131, but 1124 is common).

      6.  **Calculate Gerard I of Durbuy''s age at death:** Using the common dates:
      1124 - 1060 = approximately 64 years old. (Even using a later death date like
      1131, his age would be around 71, but likely still slightly *less* than Alexander
      V, or very close). Using the most common estimates, 64 is the figure.


      7.  **Compare the ages:** Alexander V was approximately 71 years old at death.
      Gerard I of Durbuy was approximately 64 years old at death.

      8.  **Conclusion:** 71 is greater than 64. Therefore, Alexander V was older
      at his time of death than Gerard I of Durbuy was at his time of death.

      2.  **Find his birth and death dates:** Born 11 November 1328, Died 26 February
      1360.

      3.  **Calculate his age at death:** From Nov 1328 to Nov 1359 is 31 years. He
      died in Feb 1360, a few months after his 31st birthday. So, he was 31 years

      5.  **Find his birth and death dates:** Born c. 1725 (approximately), Died 7
      July 1770.

      6.  **Calculate his approximate age at death:** 1770 - 1725 = 45 years. So,
      he was approximately 45 years old.

      1.  **Identify Aaron of Lincoln:** He was a prominent English Jewish financier
      in the 12th century.

      2.  **Determine Aaron of Lincoln''s lifespan:** Historical sources generally
      place his birth around 1125 and his death in 1186.

      3.  **Calculate Aaron of Lincoln''s age at death:** 1186 - 1125 = approximately

      4.  **Identify Bella degli Abati:** She was the mother of the famous Italian
      poet Dante Alighieri.

      5.  **Determine Bella degli Abati''s lifespan:** Her exact birth date is unknown.
      Dante was born around 1265. Historical accounts indicate Bella died when Dante
      was young, certainly before his father remarried (which happened sometime before
      1278, possibly around 1270-1275). This means she likely died in her late 20s
      or 30s. Even giving a generous estimate, she would likely have been born no
      earlier than c. 1230-1240 and died before 1278.

      6.  **Estimate Bella degli Abati''s age at death:** Based on dying young (likely
      before 1275-1278) after giving birth in 1265, her age at death was almost certainly
      under 45, and most likely in her 20s or 30s.

      7.  **Compare the ages at death:** Aaron of Lincoln was approximately 61 years
      old when he died. Bella degli Abati was likely in her 20s or 30s, and certainly

      3.  **Calculate Wanyan Yongji''s age at death:** 1213 - 1168 = 45 years. (He
      died in the calendar year he would turn 45, possibly at age 44 or 45 depending
      on his exact birth date within 1168, but we''ll use 45 as the difference in
      years).

      4.  **Identify Justus Lipsius:** He was a Flemish Catholic philologist and humanist.

      5.  **Find Justus Lipsius''s dates:** Born on October 18, 1547, Died on March
      23, 1606.

      6.  **Calculate Justus Lipsius''s age at death:** He lived from October 1547
      to March 1606. He completed 58 full years (his 58th birthday was Oct 18, 1605)
      and died before his 59th birthday. So, he was 58 years old.

      7.  **Compare the ages:** Wanyan Yongji died at age 44 or 45. Justus Lipsius
      died at age 58.

      8.  **Answer the question:** Was Wanyan Yongji (age ~45) older at death than
      Justus Lipsius (age 58) at death? No, 45 is not older than 58.
