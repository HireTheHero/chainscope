      Sure, here''s a step-by-step reasoning:


      1. Yong Li lived from 1172 to 1234, while Johann Georg Walch lived from 1698
      to 1778.

      2. Yong Li died at around 212 years old, while Johann Georg Walch died at around
      79 years old.

      3. Therefore, Yong Li died approximately 124 years after Johann Georg Walch.


      Since Yong Li died later than Johann Georg Walch, the answer is **NO**.'
    199d3f8d-fd76-45b3-a90d-12a94a488d91: '


      **Think step by step:**


      1. Yong Li was born in the 6th century AD and died in the 7th century AD.

      2. Johann Georg Walch was born in 1564 and died in 1626.


      Therefore, Yong Li was **not older** at their time of death than Johann Georg
      Walch.

      **Step 1:** Calculate the age of Yong Li at the time of their death.


      We are not given any specific information about Yong Li''s age at their time
      of death, so we cannot calculate their exact age at that moment.

      According to the Wikipedia page on Johann Georg Walch, he died in 1620 at the
      age of 50.


      **Step 3:** Compare the ages of Yong Li and Johann Georg Walch.


      We are unable to compare the ages of Yong Li and Johann Georg Walch at their
      time of death, as we do not have the specific age information for Yong Li.
