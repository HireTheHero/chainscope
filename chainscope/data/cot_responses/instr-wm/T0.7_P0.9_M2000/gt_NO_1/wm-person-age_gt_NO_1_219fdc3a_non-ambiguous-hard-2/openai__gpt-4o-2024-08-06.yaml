      documented, but it is assumed he was born in the late 12th century, possibly
      around 1170-1180.


      2. **Vanni Fucci**: He is a character from Dante Alighieri''s "Divine Comedy,"
      specifically in the "Inferno" section. Vanni Fucci was a historical figure who
      lived in Pistoia, Italy, and was known as a thief. He died around 1295. The
      exact birth date of Vanni Fucci is not well-documented, but he is presumed to
      have been born in the latter half of the 13th century, possibly around 1250-1260.


      Given these estimates, Uc Brunet lived approximately from 1170-1180 to around
      1220, making him about 40-50 years old at his death. Vanni Fucci, on the other
      hand, lived approximately from 1250-1260 to 1295, making him about 35-45 years
      old at his death.


      Based on these estimations, Uc Brunet was likely older at the time of his death
      than Vanni Fucci was at the time of his death.

      1. Yong Li (also known as the Yongli Emperor) was born on November 23, 1623,
