      - Hatto II: 30 years old

      - Angelus of Jerusalem: 35 years old


      Since 30 is less than 35, Hatto II was younger than Angelus of Jerusalem at

      1. **Hatto II**: Hatto II was born around 910 and died in 970. To find his age
      at death, we subtract his birth year from his death year: 970 - 910 = 60 years
      old.


      2. **Angelus of Jerusalem**: Angelus of Jerusalem was born in 1185 and died
      in 1225. Similarly, we calculate his age at death: 1225 - 1185 = 40 years old.


      Now we can compare their ages at the time of death:

      - Hatto II was 60 years old at his time of death.

      - Angelus of Jerusalem was 40 years old at his time of death.


      Since 60 is greater than 40, we can conclude that Hatto II was older at the

      1. **Hatto II**: Hatto II was the Archbishop of Mainz and lived during the late

      him about 60 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Angelus of Jerusalem**: Angelus was a patriarch of Jerusalem, and he died
      in 1187 AD. He was born around 1150 AD, which means he was approximately 37
      years old at the time of his death.


      Now, we compare their ages at the time of death:

      - Hatto II was about 60 years old.

      His birth year is generally estimated around 900 AD, which would make him approximately
      70 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Angelus of Jerusalem**: Angelus of Jerusalem was a Christian figure who

      the ages at the time of death for both Claudius Colas and John of Ibelin.


      1. **John of Ibelin**: John of Ibelin was born around 1210 and died in 1266.
      This means he was approximately 56 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Claudius Colas**: Claudius Colas was born in 1217 and died in 1268. This
      means he was approximately 51 years old at the time of his death.


      Now we compare their ages at the time of death:


      - John of Ibelin: 56 years old

      - Claudius Colas: 51 years old


      Since John of Ibelin was older at the time of his death compared to Claudius
      Colas, we can conclude that Claudius Colas was not older than John of Ibelin
      at their respective times of death.


      The final answer is: **NO**.'

      born around the early 11th century, possibly around 1000-1020. Assuming he was

      1063. However, his exact birth year is not clearly documented, making it difficult

      the year 1020, which would mean he was about 43 years old at the time of his
      death.


      Now, we compare their ages:


      - Alexander V was approximately 70 years old at death.

      - Gerard I of Durbuy was approximately 43 years old at death (assuming a birth
      year around 1020).

      1. **Bridget of Sweden**: She was born on June 1303 and died on July 23, 1373.
      Therefore, she was 70 years old at her time of death.


      2. **Dirck Helmbreker**: Unfortunately, specific details about Dirck Helmbreker''s
      birth and death dates are not commonly known or widely recorded in historical
      texts. However, he is typically recognized as a figure from the 16th century,
      particularly noted for his work in the context of Dutch history.


      If we assume that Dirck Helmbreker was born in the 16th century and died in
      that same century, it is highly likely that he would have been younger than
      70 at his time of death, given that Bridget of Sweden lived into her 70s.


      Based on this reasoning, Dirck Helmbreker was not older than Bridget of Sweden
      at the time of their deaths.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'

      49 years old at the time of his death.
