      Perret. The most notable ones include:

      - Jacques Perret (1906-1992), a French writer, who would have been about 86
      at death

      - Jacques Perret (1901-1992), a French architect, who would have been about
      91 at death

      - Jacques Perret (1583-1658), a French humanist, who would have been about 75
      at death


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      All the notable Jacques Perrets I can identify lived longer than Hugh the Great''s
      58 years.

      Step 1: Let me identify who Uc Brunet was.

      Uc Brunet was a troubadour from Occitania who lived in the 13th century. However,
      specific dates for his birth and death are not well-documented in historical
      records.


      Step 2: Let me identify who Vanni Fucci was.

      Vanni Fucci was a historical figure from Pistoia, Italy, who lived in the late
      13th century. He is known for being mentioned in Dante''s Inferno as "the beast."
      He was likely born around 1250-1260 and died around 1295-1300.


      Step 3: Compare the available information.

      Unfortunately, we don''t have reliable birth and death dates for Uc Brunet to
      determine his age at death. For Vanni Fucci, if we use the estimated dates,
      he likely died in his 30s or 40s, but this is also uncertain.


      Given the lack of specific historical documentation about the birth and death
      dates of both individuals, I cannot make a definitive comparison of their ages

      If he was born around 1125 and died in 1186, he would have been approximately
      60-61 years old at death.


      Step 3: Identify who Bella degli Abati was and when she lived.

      Bella degli Abati was a Florentine noblewoman, most famous for being the mother
      of Dante Alighieri (born in 1265). She died when Dante was quite young, likely
      in the late 13th century.


      Step 4: Estimate Bella degli Abati''s age at death.

      Historical records suggest she died when Dante was very young, possibly when
      he was around 5-7 years old (around 1270-1272). If she was a typical age for
      marriage and childbearing in medieval times (late teens to early twenties when
      Dante was born), she would have been in her mid-to-late 20s when she died.


      Step 5: Compare the ages.

      Aaron of Lincoln: approximately 60-61 years at death

      Bella degli Abati: approximately 25-30 years at death


      NO, Aaron of Lincoln was not older than Bella degli Abati at their time of death.
      In fact, it appears that Aaron of Lincoln lived to a much greater age than Bella
      degli Abati before dying.


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. The question asks if Aaron was older
      at death than Bella was at her death. Since Aaron was approximately 60-61 at
      death and Bella was approximately 25-30 at death, Aaron was indeed older at
      his time of death.


      The correct answer is: YES'

      Step 1: Identify who Aaron of Lincoln was and when he died.

      Aaron of Lincoln was a Jewish financier in medieval England who died around
      1186 CE. Most sources indicate he was an older man at his death, likely in his
      60s or 70s, though the exact age isn''t precisely documented.


      Step 2: Identify who Bella degli Abati was and when she died.

      Bella degli Abati was an Italian noblewoman from Florence, most famous for being
      the mother of Dante Alighieri (who was born in 1265). She died when Dante was
      quite young, likely in the late 1270s. Historical records suggest she was relatively
      young at death, probably in her 30s.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      While we don''t have exact birth dates for either figure, the historical context
      suggests Aaron of Lincoln lived to be significantly older (likely 60s-70s) than
      Bella degli Abati (likely 30s) at their respective times of death.


      NO - Bella degli Abati was not older than Aaron of Lincoln at their respective
