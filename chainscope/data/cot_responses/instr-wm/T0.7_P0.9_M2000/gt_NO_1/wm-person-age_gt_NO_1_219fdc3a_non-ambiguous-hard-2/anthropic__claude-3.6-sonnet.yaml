      1. First, let me find Ptolemy XIV''s age at death:

      - Ptolemy XIV was born around 59 BC

      - He died in 44 BC

      - This means he was approximately 15 years old when he died


      2. Now, let me find Muhammad al-Jawad''s age at death:

      - Muhammad al-Jawad was born in 811 CE

      - He died in 835 CE

      - This means he was 25 years old when he died


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Ptolemy XIV: 15 years

      - Muhammad al-Jawad: 25 years

      - 15 is less than 25


      Therefore, Ptolemy XIV was NOT older at his time of death than Muhammad al-Jawad.

      1. First, I need to find when Humphrey of Hauteville was born and died

      - Humphrey of Hauteville died in 1057

      - His birth date is not precisely known, but estimated around 1010


      2. Next, I need to find when Hippoliet Van Peene was born and died

      - Hippoliet Van Peene lived from 1811 to 1864


      3. Now I can calculate their ages at death:

      - Humphrey of Hauteville: ~47 years old (approximately, based on estimated birth
      year)

      - Hippoliet Van Peene: 53 years old


      4. Comparing the ages:

      47 < 53


      Therefore, Humphrey of Hauteville was NOT older at their time of death than
      Hippoliet Van Peene.

      - This makes him approximately 49 years old at death


      2) Next, let me find when Petrus Armengol lived and died:

      - Petrus Armengol was born in 1238

      - He died in 1304

      - This makes him approximately 66 years old at death


      3) Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - Ojeda: ~49 years

      - Armengol: ~66 years

      - 49 is less than 66


      NO (Alonso de Ojeda was younger at his time of death than Petrus Armengol)'
