      the answer.


      Step 1: Find the birth and death years of Yi Chong-jun.

      Yi Chong-jun was born in 1939 and died in 2008.


      So, his age at death = 2008 - 1939 = 69 years old.


      Step 2: Find the birth and death years of Wolfgang Clement.

      Wolfgang Clement was born in 1940 and died in 2020.


      So, his age at death = 2020 - 1940 = 80 years old.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      Yi Chong-jun died at 69, while Wolfgang Clement died at 80.


      So, Yi Chong-jun was younger at the time of death than Wolfgang Clement.

      older at the time of his death than Jacques Perret, we need to:


      1. Identify the birth and death years of Hugh the Great.

      2. Identify the birth and death years of Jacques Perret.

      3. Calculate their ages at death.

      4. Compare their ages.


      **Step 1: Hugh the Great**


      - Hugh the Great was born around 898.

      - He died in 956.

      - So, his approximate age at death = 956 - 898 = 58 years old.


      **Step 2: Jacques Perret**


      - Jacques Perret was a French architect and military engineer active in the
      late 16th and early 17th centuries.

      - His exact birth and death years are not precisely known, but historical records
      suggest he was active around 1600.

      him around 50 years old at death (this is an estimate due to lack of precise

      **Step 3: Comparison**


      - Hugh the Great: ~58 years old.

      - Jacques Perret: estimated ~50 years old.

      3. Calculate the age at death for each.

      4. Compare the two ages.


      **Step 1: Hugh the Great**

      - Hugh the Great was born around 898 AD.

      - He died in 956 AD.

      - So, his age at death was approximately 956 - 898 = 58 years old.


      **Step 2: Jacques Perret**

      - Jacques Perret was a French architect and engineer.

      - His exact birth and death dates are not precisely known, but he was active
      around the late 16th century.

      - He published a work in 1601, so he was clearly alive then.

      - Estimates place his birth around 1550 and death possibly after 1601.


      Assuming he was born around 1550 and died shortly after 1601 (say, around 1610

      **Step 3: Compare ages**

      - Hugh the Great: ~58 years old.

      - Jacques Perret: Possibly ~60 or older.

      \n- There is no specific evidence indicating Jacques Perret lived longer than\

      \ time of publication, and depending on when he died, it would be speculative.\
      \ However, there is no evidence that he lived significantly beyond the 1600s.\
      \ If we assume he died before 1650 and had been born around 1560\u20131570,\

      **Step 1: Identify who Amatus of Montecassino was and when he lived.**


      Amatus of Montecassino was an 11th-century monk and historian. His exact birth
      and death years are not precisely known, but he was active around the mid-11th
      century. Some historical estimates suggest he died around 1090. However, his
      exact birth year is unknown, so calculating his age at death is difficult.


      **Step 2: Identify who Carlo Lizzani was and when he lived.**


      Carlo Lizzani was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and critic. He was
      born on April 3, 1922, and died on October 5, 2013.


      So, his age at death can be calculated:


      2013 - 1922 = 91 years old.


      **Step 3: Compare the ages at death.**


      Since Carlo Lizzani lived to be 91 years old, we need to compare that to Amatus
      of Montecassino.


      Amatus'' exact age is unknown because his birth date is not known. However,
      given the life expectancy and historical context of the 11th century, it is
      highly unlikely he lived to be 91.


      Most people in that era did not live that long, and monks who lived into their
      70s or 80s were considered quite old.


      Therefore, it is very unlikely that Amatus of Montecassino lived longer than
      Carlo Lizzani.

      **Final Answer: NO**'
    f6b05f76-28f0-4bf8-98a1-61bc0ec4f508: 'To answer whether Robert Dowland was older
      at the time of death than Charlotte, Princess Royal, we need to determine the
      age at death for both individuals.


      **Step 1: Determine Robert Dowland''s age at death.**


      - Robert Dowland was born in 1591 and died in 1641.

      - Age at death = 1641 - 1591 = **50 years old**


      **Step 2: Determine Charlotte, Princess Royal''s age at death.**


      - Charlotte, Princess Royal, was born in 1630 and died in 1660.

      - Age at death = 1660 - 1630 = **30 years old**


      **Step 3: Compare the two ages.**


      - Robert Dowland: 50 years old

      - Charlotte, Princess Royal: 30 years old


      **Conclusion:**


      Robert Dowland was older at the time of his death than Charlotte, Princess Royal.

    18f20839-c9d9-473a-8d61-f9c13f2103f3: 'Sure, let''s solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Find the birth and death dates of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke
      of Portland.

      - Born: 14 April 1738

      - Died: 30 October 1809


      Age at death: 1809 - 1738 = 71 years old (He died after his birthday in 1809,
      so no need to subtract a year.)


      Step 2: Find the birth and death dates of Cordelia Edvardson.

      - Born: 1 January 1929

      - Died: 29 October 2012


      Age at death: 2012 - 1929 = 83 years old (She died after her birthday in 2012,
      so no need to subtract a year.)


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death:

      - William Cavendish-Bentinck: 71

      - Cordelia Edvardson: 83


      83 > 71, so Cordelia Edvardson was older at her time of death.

    6fc891df-baf0-41f7-bdaa-896c78a62e80: 'Sure, let''s go step by step to determine
      the answer.


      Step 1: Find out the birth and death dates of Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March.


      - Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March was born on November 11, 1328.

      - He died on February 26, 1360.


      To calculate his age at death:

      From November 11, 1328 to November 11, 1359 is 31 years.

      He died in February 1360, about 3.5 months after his 31st birthday.

      So, he was 31 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Find out the birth and death dates of Suzuki Harunobu.


      - Suzuki Harunobu was born around 1725 (exact date unknown).

      - He died in 1770.


      Because the birth year is approximate, let''s assume 1725 as the most accepted
      estimate.


      To calculate his age at death:

      1770 - 1725 = 45 years old (approximately).


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.


      - Roger Mortimer: 31 years old.

      - Suzuki Harunobu: approximately 45 years old.


      Therefore, Harunobu was older at the time of death.


      Final Answer: NO.'

      the ages at death of both Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March, and Suzuki Harunobu,
      and compare them.


      **Step 1: Determine the lifespan of Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March.**

      - Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March, was born on November 11, 1328.

      - He died on February 26, 1360.

      - So, he lived from November 1328 to February 1360.

      - From November 1328 to November 1359 is 31 years.

      - He died a few months after his 31st birthday, so he was 31 years old at the
      time of his death.


      **Step 2: Determine the lifespan of Suzuki Harunobu.**

      - Suzuki Harunobu, a Japanese ukiyo-e artist, is believed to have been born
      around 1725.

      - He died in 1770.

      - If he was born in 1725 and died in 1770, then he would have been approximately
      45 years old at the time of his death.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**

      - Roger Mortimer: 31 years old.

      - Suzuki Harunobu: ~45 years old.

      the ages at death of both Beatrice Portinari and Sir John Grey of Groby, and
      then compare them.


      **Step 1: Determine Beatrice Portinari''s age at death**


      Beatrice Portinari is best known as the woman who inspired Dante Alighieri''s
      works, particularly "La Vita Nuova" and "The Divine Comedy." Historical records
      suggest:

      - Born: 1266

      - Died: 1290


      So, her age at death:

      1290 - 1266 = **24 years old**


      **Step 2: Determine Sir John Grey of Groby''s age at death**


      Sir John Grey of Groby was the first husband of Elizabeth Woodville, who later
      became queen consort of Edward IV of England. Historical records suggest:

      - Born: circa 1432

      - Died: 1461 (at the Second Battle of St Albans)


      So, his age at death:

      1461 - 1432 = **approximately 29 years old**


      **Step 3: Compare the two ages**


      - Beatrice Portinari: 24 years old

      - Sir John Grey of Groby: ~29 years old


      Therefore, Sir John Grey of Groby was older at death than Beatrice Portinari.
