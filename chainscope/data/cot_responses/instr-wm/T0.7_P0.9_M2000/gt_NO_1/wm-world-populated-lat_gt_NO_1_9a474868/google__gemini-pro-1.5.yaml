      Western Sydney and Kings Cross is in the inner-city, eastern side of Sydney.
      Berala is generally west of Kings Cross, not north.

      Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.** This simplifies the problem to relative
      locations within the same city.

      3. **Berala is in the western suburbs of Sydney.**


      4. **Generally, locations west of a central-east point would be considered south-west,

      comparison.

      2. **Generally, Sydney suburbs increase in number as you go westward.** Berala
      is numerically higher than surrounding suburbs, suggesting it''s further west.
      Kings Cross is a much older, lower-numbered area, suggesting it''s closer to
      the city center.

      3. **Kings Cross is known to be in the eastern part of Sydney, close to the
      harbor and city center.**

      Therefore, Berala is NOT north of Kings Cross. It''s west.

      3. **Compare latitudes:**  Since Vulcano is further north in the Mediterranean
      than Amarynthos is in the Aegean, it''s likely Vulcano is north of Amarynthos.  A
      quick check confirms this.

      east of mainland Greece. The Aeolian Islands (and thus Vulcano) are in the Tyrrhenian
      Sea, west of mainland Italy.  While Vulcano is at a higher latitude than Amarynthos,
      it''s significantly further west.  "North" generally refers to a higher latitude,

      2. **Determine their latitudes:**  Latitude is the key to determining north/south
      position.  A higher latitude means further north.


      3. **Compare latitudes:** Once we have the latitudes of both places, we can
      compare them to see which is further north.


      Rainbow Beach, Queensland is at approximately -25.90 latitude.

      The Reeds, Victoria is at approximately -38.27 latitude.


      Since -25.90 is a larger number than -38.27, Rainbow Beach is further north.


      YES

    f2fadb6c-9f57-40a0-a50e-466e1bc73b59: '1. **Identify the locations:** Rainbow
      Beach is in Queensland, Australia.  We need to determine where "The Reeds" is.  Assuming
      "The Reeds" refers to a place also in Queensland, as the question implies a
      comparison within the same state.  If "The Reeds" is somewhere else entirely,
      the question becomes more complex.


      2. **Find more specific locations:**  A quick search reveals a "The Reeds" near
      Noosa, Queensland, Australia.  This is likely the intended location for comparison.


      3. **Compare their latitudes:** Rainbow Beach is further north than Noosa (and
      therefore "The Reeds" near Noosa).
