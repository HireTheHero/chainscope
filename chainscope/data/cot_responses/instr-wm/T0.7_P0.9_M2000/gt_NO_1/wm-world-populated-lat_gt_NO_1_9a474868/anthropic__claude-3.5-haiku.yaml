      1. First, Ukhrul is a town located in the state of Manipur, India. It is in
      the northeastern part of India.


      2. Monroe County, Florida is located in the southeastern United States, specifically
      in the Florida Keys.

      2. Then, locate Catford on a map of England

      3. Determine their relative positions by comparing their latitudes


      Step 1: Stone is a village in Kent, located in the southeastern part of England.


      Step 2: Catford is a district in southeast London, also in southeastern England.


      Step 3: Comparing their latitudes:

      - Stone, Kent is located further south than Catford

      - This means Stone is NOT north of Catford
