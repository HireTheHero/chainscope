      United States, in the state of Illinois. It is located at approximately 40.5
      degrees north latitude.


      2. **Identify the Location of Cellino San Marco, Italy**: Cellino San Marco

      3. **Compare the Latitudes**: Both Gibson City and Cellino San Marco are situated
      near the same latitude of approximately 40.5 degrees north.


      Given that both locations share a similar latitude, neither is distinctly north
      of the other. However, due to the curvature of the Earth and the way latitudinal
      lines run, we would consider them approximately at the same latitude, meaning
      one is not definitively north of the other.

      is located north of Misiones Province, we need to consider the geographical
      locations of both places.


      1. **Location of Condamine, Queensland**: Condamine is a town in the Western
      Downs Region of Queensland, Australia. Queensland is in the northeastern part
      of Australia.


      2. **Location of Misiones Province**: Misiones is a province in Argentina. It
      is located in the northeastern part of Argentina, bordering Brazil and Paraguay.


      3. **Relative Latitude**: Queensland, Australia, is generally located at a higher
      latitude (further north) compared to Misiones Province in Argentina. However,
      since Queensland covers a large area, we need to specifically consider Condamine''s
      latitude.


      4. **Conclusion**: Condamine, Queensland, is located at approximately 26.9 degrees
      South latitude. Misiones Province is located around 26.9 to 28 degrees South
      latitude. Since Condamine is at the same latitude as the northern part of Misiones,
      but slightly further north than the central and southern parts of Misiones,
      it is technically north of most of Misiones Province.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.'

      the locations of Argentine Antarctica and the Rothera Research Station:


      1. **Location of Argentine Antarctica**: Argentine Antarctica is a sector claimed
      by Argentina as part of its national territory. It is located in the Antarctic
      Peninsula region, which is generally north of most of the Antarctic continent.


      2. **Location of Rothera Research Station**: The Rothera Research Station is
      a British research station located on Adelaide Island, which is situated to
      the west of the Antarctic Peninsula.


      3. **Comparing Latitudes**: Argentine Antarctica encompasses a broad area, but
      a significant portion of it includes the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula.
      Rothera Research Station, being on Adelaide Island, is situated further south
      compared to the northern parts of the Antarctic Peninsula.


      Based on this reasoning, Argentine Antarctica is indeed located to the north
      of the Rothera Research Station.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      Therefore, when comparing the two locations on a north-south axis, Sarsuna (Kolkata)
      is north of Sandwip.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question "Is Sandwip located north
      of Sarsuna?" is **NO**.'
