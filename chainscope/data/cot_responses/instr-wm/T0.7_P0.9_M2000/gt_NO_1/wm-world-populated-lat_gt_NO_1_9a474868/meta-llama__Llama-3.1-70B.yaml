      in the same county, it''s likely that Cookstown and Coagh have very similar
      latitudes, and it might be challenging to determine definitively if one is strictly
      north of the other without specific coordinates or a detailed map. However,
      based on general knowledge and considering the close proximity of the two places,
      it''s reasonable to assume that Cookstown is not significantly north of Coagh.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Cookstown located north of Coagh?"
      is: **NO**'
