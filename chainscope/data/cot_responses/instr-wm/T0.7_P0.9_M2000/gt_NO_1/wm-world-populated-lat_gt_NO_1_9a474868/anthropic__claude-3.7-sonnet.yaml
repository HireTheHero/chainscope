      the relative positions of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Litlington is in East Sussex, which is a county in southeastern England.

      - Bettiscombe is a village in Dorset, which is a county in southern England.


      Step 2: Determine their general positions.

      - East Sussex is located in the southeastern part of England.

      - Dorset is located in the southwestern part of England.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Locations in southeastern England (like East Sussex) tend to be at similar
      latitudes to southwestern England (like Dorset).

      - However, Dorset extends further south than most of East Sussex.


      Step 4: Check specific locations.

      - Litlington, East Sussex is located near the south coast of England.

      - Bettiscombe is located in northern Dorset, somewhat inland from the coast.

      - This means Bettiscombe is likely further north than Litlington.


      Based on this analysis, Litlington in East Sussex is located SOUTH of Bettiscombe,
      not north.

      Step 1: Let me identify what Thiruvananthapuram is. Thiruvananthapuram (formerly
      known as Trivandrum) is the capital city of the Indian state of Kerala.

      its surrounding suburbs, satellite towns, and areas that are socially and economically
      integrated with the core city.


      Step 3: For a metropolitan area to be "north of" the city itself, the city would
      need to be at the southern end of its own metropolitan area, with most of the
      metropolitan region extending northward.

      Step 1: Identify what Thiruvananthapuram is.

      Thiruvananthapuram (formerly known as Trivandrum) is the capital city of the
      Indian state of Kerala.


      Step 2: Consider what a metropolitan area is.

      A metropolitan area typically includes the core city (in this case Thiruvananthapuram)
      plus adjacent suburbs, towns, and areas that are socially and economically integrated
      with the core city.


      Step 3: Analyze the spatial relationship.

      The Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area would include Thiruvananthapuram city
      itself as its core, plus surrounding areas in multiple directions (which could
      be north, south, east, and west of the city center).


      Step 4: Determine if the metropolitan area is specifically north of the city.

      Since Thiruvananthapuram city is the central core of the Thiruvananthapuram
      metropolitan area, the metropolitan area cannot be exclusively north of itself.
      The metropolitan area extends in multiple directions from the city center, including
      north, but also south, east, and west.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places in Florida.

      - Leon County is in northern Florida, containing the state capital Tallahassee.

      - Bellview (sometimes spelled Belleview) is a community in Marion County, which
      is in central Florida.

      - Johor (where Kulai is) is at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula.

      - Sumatra (where Bangkinang is) is an island southwest of the Malay Peninsula.

      - Geographically, Malaysia''s Johor state is north of Singapore, while Sumatra
      (Indonesia) is west and south of the Malay Peninsula.

      - Specifically, Bangkinang in Sumatra is south of Kulai District in Malaysia.


      Therefore, Kulai District is located north of Bangkinang.

      Step 2: Let me identify where Qabu Shamsiyah is located.

      Qabu Shamsiyah (also sometimes spelled Qabu Shamsia or similar variations) is
      a location in Syria, in the central-western part of the country, likely in Homs
      Governorate.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine north-south positioning.

      Idlib Governorate is generally located in the northwestern part of Syria, while
      Homs Governorate is in the central-western part of Syria. Geographically, Idlib
      is north of Homs.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Deir Huwayt is in Idlib which is in northern Syria, and Qabu Shamsiyah
      is in the more central part of western Syria, Deir Huwayt would be north of
      Qabu Shamsiyah.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify this more carefully. Let me reconsider...


      Actually, without precise coordinates for these specific locations, I cannot
      definitively determine their exact north-south relationship. While Idlib is
      generally north of Homs, the specific locations within these governorates could
      have different relative positions.


      Given the uncertainty and lack of precise geographical data for these specific
      locations, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer.'

      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine north/south positioning.

      Idlib Governorate is in the northern part of Syria, while Daraa Governorate
      is in the southern part of Syria. Since Deir Huwayt is in Idlib (north) and
      Qabu Shamsiyah is in Daraa (south), Deir Huwayt would be located north of Qabu

      Appledore in Torridge is a small coastal town in North Devon, in the southwestern

      When comparing locations in England, places in the southeast are generally south
      of places in the southwest, as we move from south to north in England. Sussex

      Step 2: Let me identify where Kings Cross is located in New South Wales.

      Kings Cross is an inner-city locality of Sydney, located in the eastern suburbs.


      Step 3: Let me determine their relative positions.

      Sydney''s geography has the eastern suburbs closer to the coast, while western
      suburbs are further inland. In terms of north-south orientation, western Sydney
      suburbs like Berala are generally located to the west and slightly south of
      the central and eastern parts of Sydney where Kings Cross is located.


      Step 4: Specifically comparing their north-south positions:

      Berala is located in the western suburbs, approximately 16-17 km west of Sydney''s
      CBD.

      Kings Cross is in the eastern suburbs, very close to Sydney''s CBD.

      Berala is actually slightly south of Kings Cross in terms of latitude.


      NO, Berala is not located north of Kings Cross. It is located southwest of Kings
      Cross.'

      Step 4: Considering north-south orientation specifically.

      Berala is in western Sydney, approximately 20 km west of the CBD, but it''s
      also slightly to the south-west of the city center.

      Kings Cross is just east of the CBD, but in terms of north-south positioning,

      - Muttom, Thodupuzha is in Kerala, India (specifically in the southern part
      of India)

      - Zulia is a state in northwestern Venezuela (in South America)


      Step 2: Determine their approximate latitudes.

      - Muttom, Thodupuzha is located at approximately 9-10 degrees North latitude

      - Zulia state in Venezuela is located at approximately 9-11 degrees North latitude

      - Both locations are in similar latitude ranges in the Northern Hemisphere

      - However, Muttom in Kerala, India is generally slightly south of most of Zulia
      state


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Muttom, Thodupuzha is generally at a slightly lower latitude than Zulia
      state, it is not north of Zulia.

      Zhongshan District is a district in Dalian, which is a city in northeastern
      China, specifically in Liaoning Province.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      Italy is in southern Europe, while northeastern China is in East Asia. On a
      global map:

      - Italy (including Calabria) is roughly between 36-47 degrees North latitude

      - Dalian (including Zhongshan District) is around 39 degrees North latitude


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      Calabria, being at the southern tip of Italy, is approximately at 38-39 degrees
      North latitude.

      Zhongshan District in Dalian is at approximately 39 degrees North latitude.


      Since Calabria is slightly south of (or at a similar latitude to) Zhongshan
      District in Dalian, Calabria is NOT located north of Zhongshan District.


      NO'

      Step 1: I need to identify what "Conflict Group" is and where it''s located.

      The Conflict Group (also known as the Conflict Islands) is an atoll group in
      Papua New Guinea, located in the Solomon Sea.


      Step 2: I need to identify where "Temotu Province" is located.

      Temotu Province is the easternmost province of the Solomon Islands, a country
      separate from Papua New Guinea.


      Step 3: I need to determine their relative positions.

      The Conflict Islands are located in southeastern Papua New Guinea.

      Temotu Province is located in the far eastern part of the Solomon Islands.

      Geographically, the Solomon Islands lie to the east and southeast of Papua New
      Guinea.

      Temotu Province, being the easternmost province of the Solomon Islands, is further
      east than the Conflict Islands.


      Step 4: Determine north/south positioning.

      When comparing north/south positioning, the Conflict Islands are slightly north
      of the general latitude of Temotu Province.


      Based on this analysis: YES, the Conflict Group is located north of Temotu Province.'

      Rainbow Beach is a coastal town and locality in the Gympie Region, Queensland,
      Australia. It''s located on the east coast of Queensland.


      Step 2: Identify "The Reeds."

      This is challenging because "The Reeds" is not a universally recognized major
      geographical location. It could refer to several places:

      - It might be a small locality in Australia or elsewhere

      - It could be a natural feature like a reed bed

      - It could be a specific place with this name in various countries


      Step 3: Without definitive information about "The Reeds" as a specific place,
      I cannot determine its location relative to Rainbow Beach.


      Since I cannot establish the location of "The Reeds" with certainty, I cannot
      determine whether Rainbow Beach, Queensland is north of it.


      NO definitive answer can be provided without clarification on which "The Reeds"
      is being referenced.'

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both Rainbow Beach, Queensland and
      The Reeds.


      Step 2: Rainbow Beach is a coastal town in Queensland, Australia, located on
      the eastern coast of Australia, north of Brisbane.


      Step 3: I need to determine where "The Reeds" is located. This is challenging
      because "The Reeds" could refer to multiple locations globally.


      Step 4: Without specific information about which "The Reeds" is being referenced
      (as there are places with this name in different countries), I cannot make a
      definitive geographic comparison.


      Step 5: If "The Reeds" refers to a specific location in Australia, I would need
      its precise coordinates to determine if Rainbow Beach is north of it.


      Since I cannot definitively determine the location of "The Reeds" with the information
      provided, I cannot give a reliable YES or NO answer to whether Rainbow Beach,
      Queensland is located north of The Reeds.'

      of Lutterworth and Santon Downham to answer whether Lutterworth is north of
      Santon Downham.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Lutterworth is a market town in Leicestershire, England, located in the Midlands
      region.

      - Santon Downham is a village in Suffolk, England, located in East Anglia.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate geographical coordinates.

      - Lutterworth is located in south Leicestershire, approximately in central England.

      - Santon Downham is located in northwest Suffolk, in eastern England.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Leicestershire is generally north of Suffolk in England.

      - Lutterworth, being in Leicestershire, would be north of places in Suffolk.

      - Santon Downham, being in Suffolk, would be south of places in Leicestershire.


      Based on the general geography of English counties, Lutterworth (in Leicestershire)
      is indeed north of Santon Downham (in Suffolk).


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. If Lutterworth is north of Santon Downham,
      the answer should be YES, not NO. Let me correct this.


      YES'
