      1) First, let me identify these locations:

      - Bekwai Municipal Assembly is in Ghana, in the Ashanti Region

      - Apapa is in Lagos, Nigeria


      2) Looking at their locations:

      - Bekwai is located in central Ghana

      - Apapa is in southern Nigeria


      3) Comparing their positions:

      - Ghana is located west of Nigeria

      - Both locations are in a similar latitudinal zone

      - Bekwai is slightly north of the coast

      - Apapa is right on the coast


      4) Final analysis:

      - Since Bekwai is slightly inland and Apapa is coastal, Bekwai is indeed slightly
      north of Apapa

      1. First, I need to locate both places in India:

      - Gauri Bazar is in Uttar Pradesh

      - Azamgarh is a district in Uttar Pradesh


      2. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Gauri Bazar is located in Deoria district

      - Deoria district is located northeast of Azamgarh district


      3. More specifically:

      - Gauri Bazar lies in the southern part of Deoria district

      - When looking at its exact position relative to Azamgarh district, it is to
      the northeast of Azamgarh district


      4. Final check:

      - While Gauri Bazar is slightly to the northeast, the question specifically
      asks about "north"

      - Being northeast means it has both northern and eastern components in its relative
      position


      Answer: NO (because it''s specifically northeast, not directly north)'
