      **Step 1: Locate University of North Carolina at Pembroke, NC**

      *   Pembroke, NC is in the southeastern part of North Carolina.

      *   Mountain State University was located in Beckley, WV. (Note: Mountain State
      University is now defunct, having merged with and been absorbed by the University
      of Charleston. However, for the purpose of this question, we consider its historical
      location.)

      *   Beckley, WV is in the southern part of West Virginia.


      **Step 3: Compare Latitudes**

      To determine if one is "north" of the other, we compare their latitudes.


      *   **Pembroke, NC (UNC Pembroke):** Roughly 34.6 degrees North Latitude.

      *   **Beckley, WV (Mountain State University):** Roughly 37.8 degrees North
      Latitude.

      A higher North Latitude means a location is further north.

      *   Therefore, Beckley, WV is north of Pembroke, NC.

      1.  **Locate Bryant University, RI:** Bryant University is in Smithfield, Rhode
      Island. Rhode Island is in the southern part of New England.

      2.  **Locate Husson University, ME:** Husson University is in Bangor, Maine.
      Maine is the northernmost state in New England.

      3.  **Compare Latitudes:** Generally, states further north have higher latitudes.
      Maine is geographically north of Rhode Island. Therefore, a university in Maine
      (especially one as far north as Bangor) will almost certainly be north of a
      university in Rhode Island.

      **Step 1: Locate St. Andrews University, NC.**

      St. Andrews University is located in Laurinburg, North Carolina.


      **Step 2: Locate Ohio Valley University, WV.**

      Ohio Valley University was located in Vienna, West Virginia. (Note: Ohio Valley
      University closed in 2022, but for the purpose of geographical comparison, its

      **Step 3: Determine the relative latitude of Laurinburg, NC and Vienna, WV.**

      *   Laurinburg, NC is in the southern part of North Carolina.

      *   Vienna, WV is in the the western part of West Virginia, along the Ohio River.


      If you visualize a map, North Carolina is predominantly south of West Virginia.
      While there can be slight variations in longitude, the general latitudinal position
      of North Carolina is south of West Virginia. Therefore, Laurinburg, NC is generally
      *south* of Vienna, WV.


      **Step 4: Answer the question.**

      The question asks: "Is St. Andrews University, NC located north of Ohio Valley
      University, WV?"


      Since St. Andrews University, NC (Laurinburg) is located *south* of Ohio Valley
      University, WV (Vienna), the answer to the question is the opposite of what
      is asked.

      1.  **Locate Kennesaw State University (KSU):** KSU is in Kennesaw, Georgia.

      2.  **Determine KSU''s approximate latitude:** Georgia is in the southeastern
      US. Kennesaw is north of Atlanta.

      3.  **Locate Capital University:** Capital University is in Bexley, Ohio (a
      suburb of Columbus, Ohio).

      4.  **Determine Capital University''s approximate latitude:** Ohio is in the
      Midwest. Columbus is roughly in the center of Ohio.

      5.  **Compare latitudes:** Ohio is generally north of Georgia. Therefore, Columbus,
      OH, is north of Kennesaw, GA.


      Since Capital University is located in Ohio and Kennesaw State University is
      located in Georgia, and Ohio is geographically north of Georgia, Capital University
      is north of Kennesaw State University.


      The question asks if Kennesaw State University is located north of Capital University.
      The answer to that is the opposite.


      Therefore, Kennesaw State University is *not* located north of Capital University.
