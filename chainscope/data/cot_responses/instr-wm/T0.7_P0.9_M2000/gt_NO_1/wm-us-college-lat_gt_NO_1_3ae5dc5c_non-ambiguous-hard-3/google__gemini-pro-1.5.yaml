      be in the far northern part of Indiana and Milwaukee could be in the far southern

      south of Michigan.


      3. **Consider if there are any exceptions:** While most of Ohio is south of
      most of Michigan, some parts of Ohio *might* be at a similar latitude or even
      slightly north of *some* parts of Michigan.  However, Springfield, OH is definitely
      south of Grand Rapids, MI.


      4. **Conclusion:** Wittenberg University is south of Calvin University.

      south of Michigan.


      3. **Consider the specific locations within the states:** While Springfield,
      OH is in the southern half of Ohio, Grand Rapids, MI is in the western, and
      generally more southern part of Michigan.  However, Michigan still extends further
      north than all of Ohio.


      4. **Conclusion:** Even though Grand Rapids is in the southern part of Michigan,
      it is still likely north of Springfield, Ohio.
