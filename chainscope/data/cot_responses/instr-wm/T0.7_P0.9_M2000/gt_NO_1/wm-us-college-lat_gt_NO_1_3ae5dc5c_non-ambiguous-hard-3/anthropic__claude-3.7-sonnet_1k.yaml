      1. Huntington University is located in Huntington, Indiana (IN).

      2. Wisconsin Lutheran College is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (WI).


      Now I need to determine which one is further north. Wisconsin is generally north
      of Indiana, so my initial expectation is that Wisconsin Lutheran College would
      be north of Huntington University.


      Let me think about the geography more specifically:

      - Wisconsin borders the northern edge of Illinois

      - Indiana is east of Illinois

      - Milwaukee is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan

      - Huntington, Indiana would be in the northeastern part of Indiana


      Given this geographic arrangement, Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee,
      WI should be north of Huntington University in Huntington, IN.</think>I need
      to determine the relative north-south positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Huntington University is in Huntington, Indiana (IN)

      - Wisconsin Lutheran College is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (WI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Wisconsin is generally north of Indiana

      - Wisconsin borders the northern edge of Illinois, while Indiana is east of
      Illinois


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Milwaukee is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan

      - Huntington is in the northeastern part of Indiana


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Even though Huntington is in the northern part of Indiana, Wisconsin''s southern
      border is still north of Indiana''s northern border

      - Milwaukee''s position in southeastern Wisconsin would still put it north of
      any location in Indiana


      NO, Huntington University is not located north of Wisconsin Lutheran College.
      The Wisconsin institution is farther north.'

      1. Huntington University is located in Huntington, Indiana (IN).

      Now I need to determine which one is further north. Looking at a mental map
      of the United States:


      - Wisconsin is generally north of Indiana. Wisconsin borders the northern part
      of Lake Michigan, while Indiana is south of Michigan.

      - Milwaukee, WI (where Wisconsin Lutheran College is located) is in the southeastern
      part of Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan.

      - Huntington, IN (where Huntington University is located) is in the northeastern

      Even though Huntington is in the northern part of Indiana, Wisconsin is entirely
      north of Indiana. Milwaukee, being in southern Wisconsin, should still be north

      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Indiana is located south of Wisconsin

      - Wisconsin borders Lake Michigan to the north, while Indiana is further south


      Step 3: Even though Huntington is in northern Indiana, and Milwaukee is in southern
      Wisconsin, the entire state of Wisconsin lies north of Indiana geographically.


      Step 4: Therefore, Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee, WI must be located

      - Since Grand View University is in Des Moines, Iowa, and Washburn University
      is in Topeka, Kansas, Grand View University is positioned further north than
      Washburn University.


      NO, Washburn University is not located north of Grand View University. Rather,

      First, let me recall the general geographic relationship between Virginia and

      - Pennsylvania is north of Virginia in the United States.


      Now, let''s think about the specific locations:

      - Shenandoah University is located in Winchester, Virginia, which is in the
      northern part of Virginia.

      - PennWest Edinboro (formerly Edinboro University) is located in Edinboro, Pennsylvania,
      which is in the northwestern part of Pennsylvania.


      Even though Shenandoah is in northern Virginia, Pennsylvania as a whole is north
      of Virginia. Edinboro is in the northwestern part of Pennsylvania, which puts
      it even further north than many parts of Pennsylvania.


      So, Shenandoah University in VA would be south of PennWest Edinboro in PA, not
      north of it.</think># Is Shenandoah University, VA located north of PennWest
      Edinboro, PA?


      To answer this question, I need to compare the geographical locations of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Shenandoah University is located in Winchester, Virginia (VA)

      - PennWest Edinboro is located in Edinboro, Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Virginia and Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is a state that borders Virginia to the north

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - While Shenandoah University is in northern Virginia (Winchester area)

      - PennWest Edinboro is in northwestern Pennsylvania

      - Even the northernmost parts of Virginia are generally south of Pennsylvania


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since Pennsylvania is north of Virginia, and PennWest Edinboro is in Pennsylvania
      while Shenandoah University is in Virginia, Shenandoah University is not north
      of PennWest Edinboro.

      Now I need to determine which one is further north. In California, the general

      Looking at California''s geography, Fresno is definitely north of San Bernardino.
      San Bernardino is much closer to the Mexican border and Los Angeles, while Fresno
      is closer to the middle of the state, heading toward Sacramento and San Francisco.


      So if I''m asked "Is California State University, San Bernardino, CA located

      the locations of these two universities.


      1. First, I need to identify where Southern Polytechnic State University in
      Georgia is located.

      Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) is located in Marietta, Georgia,
      which is in the northern part of Georgia near Atlanta.


      2. Next, I need to identify where Thomas More University in Kentucky is located.

      Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, which is in
      northern Kentucky near Cincinnati, Ohio.


      3. Now I need to compare their latitudes to determine which one is further north.

      - Georgia is generally south of Kentucky in the United States

      - Marietta, GA is in northern Georgia

      - Crestview Hills, KY is in northern Kentucky, right near the Ohio border


      Generally speaking, even northern Georgia would be south of most or all of Kentucky,
      because Kentucky as a whole is north of Georgia. Kentucky''s southern border
      is north of Georgia''s northern border.


      So Southern Polytechnic State University in Georgia would be south of Thomas
      More University in Kentucky.</think># Determining the North-South Relationship
      Between Two Universities


      I need to determine which university is located farther north by examining their
      locations.


      ## Step 1: Locate Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU)

      SPSU is located in Marietta, Georgia, which is in the northern part of Georgia
      near Atlanta.


      ## Step 2: Locate Thomas More University

      Thomas More University is in Crestview Hills, Kentucky, which is in northern
      Kentucky near Cincinnati, Ohio.


      ## Step 3: Compare their geographical positions

      - Georgia is a southern state that borders Florida

      - Kentucky is considerably farther north, positioned between Tennessee and Ohio

      - Even though SPSU is in northern Georgia, the entire state of Georgia lies
      south of Kentucky

      - Northern Kentucky (where Thomas More is located) is even farther north, near
      the Ohio border


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Southern Polytechnic State University in Georgia is NOT located north of
      Thomas More University in Kentucky. The Georgia university is farther south.'

      location)

      2. Thomas More University is located in Crestview Hills, Kentucky.


      Let me think about the general geography of Georgia and Kentucky:

      - Georgia is generally south of Kentucky in the United States.

      - Kentucky is north of Georgia.


      Based on this general understanding, a university in Georgia would typically
      be south of a university in Kentucky. Therefore, Southern Polytechnic State
      University in Georgia would be south of Thomas More University in Kentucky,
      not north of it.


      So the answer would be NO, Southern Polytechnic State University is not located

      - Georgia is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States.

      - Kentucky is located north of Georgia, in the east-central part of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Georgia is south of Kentucky on the map, a university in Georgia would
      be south of a university in Kentucky.

      - Southern Polytechnic State University in Georgia would therefore be south
      of Thomas More University in Kentucky.

      Michigan is in the northern part of the United States, bordering Canada and

      in Tennessee is located north of Andrews University in Michigan. Let me work
      through this step by step by identifying where each university is located.


      1. Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN), which is a state in the southeastern
      United States.

      2. Andrews University is in Michigan (MI), which is a state in the northern
      Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Michigan is north of Tennessee. Michigan borders Canada
      to the north, while Tennessee is much further south, bordering states like Alabama
      and Georgia.


      So if Michigan is north of Tennessee, then Andrews University (in Michigan)
      would be north of Bethel University (in Tennessee), not the other way around.


      Therefore, Bethel University, TN is NOT located north of Andrews University,
      MI. Rather, it''s the opposite - Andrews University is north of Bethel University.</think>To
      determine if Bethel University in Tennessee is located north of Andrews University
      in Michigan, I need to consider the geographic locations of these two states.


      Step 1: Identify the general geographic positions of Tennessee and Michigan.

      - Tennessee (TN) is located in the southeastern United States.

      - Michigan (MI) is located in the northern Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      Step 2: Compare their relative north-south positions.

      - Michigan is significantly further north than Tennessee.

      - Michigan borders Canada and the Great Lakes in the north.

      - Tennessee is much further south, positioned between Kentucky (to its north)
      and Alabama/Mississippi (to its south).


      Step 3: Reach a conclusion about the universities'' relative positions.

      - Since Bethel University is in Tennessee and Andrews University is in Michigan,
      and Michigan is north of Tennessee, Andrews University must be north of Bethel
      University, not the other way around.


      NO, Bethel University in Tennessee is not located north of Andrews University
      in Michigan.'

      First, let''s identify where these universities are located:

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Andrews University is in Michigan (MI)


      Generally speaking, Michigan is a northern state bordering Canada, while Tennessee
      is in the southeastern United States. Looking at a mental map of the US:


      - Michigan is in the northern part of the US, bordering the Great Lakes

      - Tennessee is significantly further south, in the southeastern US


      Based on general geographic knowledge, Michigan is definitely north of Tennessee.
      Therefore, Andrews University in Michigan would almost certainly be north of
      Bethel University in Tennessee.


      To answer the question "Is Bethel University, TN located north of Andrews University,
      MI?" - the answer would be NO, because Michigan is north of Tennessee.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Bethel University is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Andrews University is in Michigan (MI)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Michigan is located in the northern United States, bordering the Great Lakes
      region

      - Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Michigan is significantly further north than Tennessee

      - Michigan borders Canada to the north, while Tennessee is several states south
      of Michigan


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      Since Bethel University is in Tennessee (a southern state) and Andrews University
      is in Michigan (a northern state), Bethel University must be south of Andrews
      University, not north of it.

      University in Ohio is located north of Calvin University in Michigan.


      First, let me think about where these universities are located:


      1. Wittenberg University is in Ohio (OH)

      2. Calvin University is in Michigan (MI)


      To determine which is further north, I need to know the specific locations within
      these states.


      Wittenberg University is located in Springfield, Ohio. Springfield is in central/western
      Ohio.


      Calvin University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Grand Rapids is in western
      Michigan.


      Michigan is generally north of Ohio, as Ohio borders Michigan''s southern border.
      So typically, locations in Michigan would be north of locations in Ohio.


      However, Michigan''s southern border dips down, and Ohio''s northern border
      extends up, so I need to be more precise about the exact locations.


      Let me think about the general geography: Grand Rapids, MI is in the western
      part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, and it''s definitely north of the Ohio
      border. Springfield, OH is not at the very northern edge of Ohio, but rather
      in the central to southern portion of the state.


      Based on this geographic understanding, Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan
      would be north of Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these
      two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Wittenberg University is in Springfield, Ohio

      - Calvin University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Ohio and Michigan.

      - Michigan is generally positioned north of Ohio

      - Ohio borders Michigan''s southern border


      Step 3: Look at the specific cities within their states.

      - Springfield, Ohio is located in the central/western part of Ohio

      - Grand Rapids, Michigan is in the western part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Grand Rapids is well into Michigan''s territory, north of Ohio''s border

      - Springfield is not near Ohio''s northern border, but rather in the central
      portion of the state


      Based on this analysis, Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan is located
      north of Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio.


      NO'

      of Wittenberg University in Ohio and Calvin University in Michigan, and then
      compare their geographic positions to determine which one is more north.


      First, let me think about where these universities are located:


      Wittenberg University is in Springfield, Ohio. Ohio is generally south of Michigan,
      since Michigan is directly north of Ohio.


      Calvin University is in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Michigan is north of Ohio.


      Since Michigan is north of Ohio, and Wittenberg is in Ohio while Calvin is in
      Michigan, it would seem that Wittenberg University is south of Calvin University,
      not north of it.


      However, I should be careful about making this conclusion just based on the
      states, because some parts of a southern state could be further north than some
      parts of a northern state, especially near the borders. I need to consider the
      specific locations within their states.


      Springfield, OH (where Wittenberg is located) is in the western part of central
      Ohio.

      Grand Rapids, MI (where Calvin is located) is in the western part of southern
      Michigan.


      Given these more specific locations, Calvin University in Grand Rapids, MI would
      still be north of Wittenberg University in Springfield, OH.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these

      - Calvin University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and Michigan.

      - Michigan is generally located north of Ohio

      - Ohio borders Michigan''s southern border


      Step 3: Look at the specific cities within these states.

      - Springfield, Ohio is in the west-central part of Ohio

      - Grand Rapids, Michigan is in the southwestern part of Michigan


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Even though Grand Rapids is in southern Michigan, it is still north of Springfield,
      Ohio

      - The entire state of Michigan is generally north of most of Ohio


      Therefore, Wittenberg University in Ohio is NOT located north of Calvin University
      in Michigan. Instead, Calvin University is north of Wittenberg University.

      to determine the locations of Wittenberg University in Ohio and Calvin University
      in Michigan, and then compare their latitudes to see which one is further north.


      Step 1: Locate Wittenberg University, OH.

      Wittenberg University is located in Springfield, Ohio, which is in the southwestern
      part of Ohio.


      Step 2: Locate Calvin University, MI.

      Calvin University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is in the western
      part of Michigan.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Michigan is generally north of Ohio, as it borders Ohio''s northern edge. Grand
      Rapids, MI is in the lower peninsula of Michigan, but still north of most of
      Ohio. Springfield, OH is in southwestern Ohio, which is definitely south of
      Michigan.


      Therefore, Wittenberg University in Springfield, OH would be south of Calvin
      University in Grand Rapids, MI.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Wittenberg University is located in Springfield, Ohio

      - Calvin University is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Ohio and Michigan.

      Michigan is generally positioned north of Ohio. Ohio borders Michigan''s southern
      border (specifically Ohio borders Michigan''s Lower Peninsula).


      Step 3: Compare the specific cities.

      Springfield, Ohio is located in the southwestern part of Ohio, while Grand Rapids,
      Michigan is in the western part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      Since Michigan is north of Ohio, and considering the specific locations within
      their respective states, Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan is north
      of Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio.

      1. Texas A&M University-San Antonio, TX

      2. East Central University, OK (Oklahoma)


      I need to determine which one is located further north.


      San Antonio is in southern Texas, near the border with Mexico. Texas is generally
      south of Oklahoma.


      East Central University is in Oklahoma. The full name includes "OK" which indicates
      it''s in Oklahoma.


      Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas on a map of the United States. Even the

      Therefore, East Central University in Oklahoma would be located north of Texas
      A&M University-San Antonio.


      So, is Texas A&M University-San Antonio north of East Central University? No,

      Step 2: Determine their relative geographic positions.

      - Texas is located south of Oklahoma on the US map

      - San Antonio is in southern Texas, relatively far south in the state

      - Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Since Oklahoma is entirely north of Texas, and San Antonio is in southern Texas,
      East Central University in Oklahoma must be north of Texas A&M University-San
      Antonio.


      Therefore, Texas A&M University-San Antonio is NOT north of East Central University.

      I need to figure out if Johnson University in TN is located north of Ohio Dominican
      University in OH.


      Let me think about the general locations first:

      - Tennessee (TN) is a state in the southeastern United States.

      - Ohio (OH) is a state in the midwestern United States.


      Generally speaking, Ohio is north of Tennessee. Ohio borders Lake Erie to the
      north and Kentucky to the south, while Tennessee borders Kentucky to the north.


      So in terms of states, Tennessee is south of Ohio, not north of it.


      Since Johnson University is in Tennessee and Ohio Dominican University is in
      Ohio, it''s very likely that Johnson University is south of Ohio Dominican University,
      not north of it.


      Therefore, the answer would be NO, Johnson University in TN is not located north
      of Ohio Dominican University in OH.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative geographic positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the states where these universities are located.

      - Johnson University is in Tennessee (TN)

      - Ohio Dominican University is in Ohio (OH)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States, while Ohio is in the
      Midwest/Great Lakes region. Ohio is positioned north of Tennessee on a map.


      Step 3: Apply this state-level geographic relationship to the universities.

      Since Tennessee is south of Ohio, and these universities are within their respective
      states, Johnson University (TN) would be south of Ohio Dominican University
      (OH), not north of it.


      NO'

      Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Tennessee is located in the Southeastern region of the United States

      - Looking at a map of the US, Ohio is positioned north of Tennessee


      Step 3: Since the universities are in their respective states, their north-south
      relationship would follow the same pattern as their states.

      - Ohio Dominican University (in Ohio) would be north of Johnson University (in

      - Therefore, Johnson University is NOT north of Ohio Dominican University

      - Rhode Island is located in southern New England, significantly south of Maine


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Maine extends much further north than Rhode Island

      - Bangor, Maine is at a higher latitude than any location in Rhode Island


      NO. Bryant University in Rhode Island is not located north of Husson University

      Maine (ME) is the northernmost state in New England, located at the very top
      of the northeast region.

      Rhode Island (RI) is located in southern New England, south of Massachusetts.


      So in terms of states, Maine is definitely north of Rhode Island.

      To be precise:

      - Bryant University is in Smithfield, Rhode Island

      - Husson University is in Bangor, Maine


      Bangor, Maine is definitely farther north than Smithfield, Rhode Island.

      Let me think about the general geography of the northeastern United States:

      - Maine (ME) is the northernmost state in New England, bordering Canada

      - Rhode Island (RI) is one of the southernmost states in New England, located

      1. Alcorn State University is located in Mississippi (MS).

      2. Harding University is located in Arkansas (AR).


      To compare their north-south positions, I need to know their specific locations
      within their states.


      Alcorn State University is located in Lorman, Mississippi, which is in the southwestern
      part of Mississippi, near the Mississippi River and the border with Louisiana.


      Harding University is located in Searcy, Arkansas, which is in the central part
      of Arkansas.


      Generally speaking:

      - Mississippi is east and somewhat south of Arkansas

      - Arkansas is directly north of Louisiana

      - The southwestern part of Mississippi where Alcorn State is located is in the
      southern portion of the state


      Based on geography knowledge, Searcy, Arkansas (where Harding is) would be further
      north than Lorman, Mississippi (where Alcorn State is). The southern part of
      Mississippi is definitely south of central Arkansas.


      Therefore, Alcorn State University is NOT north of Harding University. It is
      south of Harding University.</think># Is Alcorn State University, MS located
      north of Harding University, AR?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Alcorn State University is in Lorman, Mississippi (MS)

      - Harding University is in Searcy, Arkansas (AR)


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Arkansas is generally north of Mississippi on a map

      - Mississippi is to the east and south of Arkansas


      Step 3: Examine the specific locations within their states.

      - Lorman, MS (home of Alcorn State) is in southwestern Mississippi

      - Searcy, AR (home of Harding) is in central Arkansas


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Alcorn State University is located in the southern portion of Mississippi

      - Harding University is in the central part of Arkansas, which places it further
      north than southwestern Mississippi


      NO. Alcorn State University is not located north of Harding University. It is

      Let me think about the locations:


      1. Alcorn State University is located in Mississippi (MS). Mississippi is in
      the southern United States.

      2. Harding University is located in Arkansas (AR). Arkansas is also in the southern

      Mount Mary College (now Mount Mary University) is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

      Michigan Technological University is located in Houghton, Michigan.


      Let me think about the geography of Wisconsin and Michigan:


      Wisconsin is below Michigan''s Upper Peninsula. Milwaukee is in the southeastern
      part of Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan.


      Michigan has two main parts: the Lower Peninsula (which looks like a mitten)
      and the Upper Peninsula (UP) which is north of Wisconsin. Houghton is located
      in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.


      The Upper Peninsula is the northernmost part of Michigan, and is generally north
      of Wisconsin. Since Houghton is in the UP, and Milwaukee is in southeastern
      Wisconsin, Michigan Technological University (in Houghton) should be north of
      Mount Mary College (in Milwaukee).

      - Milwaukee is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin.

      - Houghton is in Michigan''s Upper Peninsula, which is the northernmost part
      of Michigan.

      - The Upper Peninsula of Michigan lies north of Wisconsin.

      Milwaukee is in southeastern Wisconsin, Michigan Technological University must

      2. Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts in Maine (ME)


      Let me think about the geography of the northeastern United States:

      - Maine (ME) is the northernmost state in the contiguous United States in the
      Northeast

      - Connecticut (CT) is south of Maine

      - Maine borders New Hampshire to its west, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east

      - Connecticut is south of Massachusetts, which is south of New Hampshire, which
      is south of Maine


      So in terms of states:

      Maine is north of Connecticut.


      Now, let me consider the specific locations:

      - University of New Haven is in New Haven, CT (southern Connecticut)

      - The Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts is in Maine, but I need
      to determine where in Maine


      I believe the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts is in Portland,
      Maine, which is in the southern part of Maine. But even southern Maine is still
      north of Connecticut.


      So the University of New Haven in CT would be south of the Institute for Doctoral
      Studies in the Visual Arts in ME.


      Therefore, University of New Haven is NOT located north of Institute for Doctoral
      Studies in the Visual Arts.</think># Is University of New Haven, CT located
      north of Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts, ME?


      Let me think about the locations step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify the states: University of New Haven is in Connecticut
      (CT), while the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts is in Maine
      (ME).


      2) In terms of geography, Maine is the northernmost state in the northeastern
      United States.


      3) Connecticut is significantly south of Maine, with New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
      and Rhode Island in between.


      4) Even the southernmost point of Maine is still north of the northernmost point
      of Connecticut.


      5) Therefore, any location in Connecticut (including New Haven) would be south
      of any location in Maine (including where the Institute is located).


      NO, the University of New Haven is not located north of the Institute for Doctoral
      Studies in the Visual Arts. It is located south of it.'

      down:


      1. University of New Haven is in CT (Connecticut)

      2. Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts is in ME (Maine)


      I need to determine which one is further north.


      In terms of US geography, Maine (ME) is one of the northernmost states in the
      contiguous United States, located in the New England region. Connecticut (CT)
      is also in New England, but it''s located south of Maine.


      Maine borders Canada to the north, New Hampshire to the west, and the Atlantic
      Ocean to the east and south. It''s the northeasternmost state in the US.


      Connecticut is much further south, bordered by Massachusetts to the north, Rhode
      Island to the east, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south.


      Given this general geography, any location in Maine would typically be north
      of any location in Connecticut. Therefore, the Institute for Doctoral Studies
      in the Visual Arts in Maine would be north of the University of New Haven in
      Connecticut.


      So, is University of New Haven north of Institute for Doctoral Studies in the
      Visual Arts? No, it would be the opposite - the Institute in Maine would be
      north of the University in Connecticut.</think>To answer this question, I need

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of New Haven is in CT (Connecticut)

      - Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts is in ME (Maine)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Maine (ME) is located in the northeasternmost part of the United States. It''s
      one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.


      Connecticut (CT) is also in the Northeast/New England region, but it''s positioned
      significantly south of Maine. Connecticut borders Massachusetts to the north,
      while Maine is even further north than Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since Maine is located north of Connecticut on a map of the United States, the
      Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts (in Maine) would be north
      of the University of New Haven (in Connecticut).

      Claflin University is in Orangeburg, South Carolina.

      Winston-Salem State University is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.


      Now I need to determine if Orangeburg, SC is north of Winston-Salem, NC.


      North Carolina is generally north of South Carolina. Winston-Salem is in the
      northern half of North Carolina, while Orangeburg is in the central part of
      South Carolina.


      So Orangeburg, SC (where Claflin University is) is south of Winston-Salem, NC

      - Claflin University is in Orangeburg, South Carolina

      - Winston-Salem State University is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina


      Now I need to think about the general geography of these states. North Carolina
      is north of South Carolina. However, specific cities within these states could

      their respective states.


      Orangeburg, SC is in the central part of South Carolina.

      Winston-Salem, NC is in the north-central part of North Carolina.


      Given that North Carolina is north of South Carolina, and Winston-Salem is in
      the northern part of North Carolina while Orangeburg is in central South Carolina,
      it''s very likely that Winston-Salem is further north than Orangeburg.

      - Orangeburg is in the central part of South Carolina

      - Winston-Salem is in the north-central region of North Carolina


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      Since North Carolina is north of South Carolina, and Winston-Salem is in the
      northern portion of North Carolina while Orangeburg is in central South Carolina,
      Winston-Salem State University is clearly further north than Claflin University.

      Let me think about the general geography of the states first:

      - Claflin University is in Orangeburg, SC, which is in the central part of South

      Given that South Carolina is south of North Carolina, and these cities aren''t

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the two states.

      - North Carolina is positioned north of South Carolina on the U.S. map

      - The state line between them runs roughly east-west


      Step 3: Examine the specific cities within their states.

      - Orangeburg, SC is in the central part of South Carolina

      - Winston-Salem, NC is in the north-central part of North Carolina

      - There are no geographic anomalies (like a northern SC panhandle) that would
      place Orangeburg north of Winston-Salem


      Since Claflin University is in South Carolina (the more southern state) and

      - Arkansas State University has a campus in Paragould, Arkansas (AR)

      - Central Methodist University is in Missouri (MO)

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between the states.

      - Missouri is located directly north of Arkansas on a US map

      - Arkansas shares its northern border with Missouri


      Step 3: Look at the specific locations within their states.

      - Paragould is in northeastern Arkansas, near the Missouri border

      - Fayette (home of Central Methodist University) is in central Missouri


      Step 4: Compare their positions.

      - Even though Paragould is in the northern part of Arkansas, it still lies south
      of central Missouri where Fayette is located

      - Cities in Arkansas, even those near the northern border, are generally south

      University in Texas is located north of Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City
      in Oklahoma. Let''s think about this geographically.


      First, let me recall where these states are positioned relative to each other.
      Oklahoma is directly north of Texas. So generally speaking, locations in Oklahoma
      tend to be north of locations in Texas.


      Now let''s get more specific about these universities:


      1. McMurry University is in Texas (TX). I believe it''s located in Abilene,
      which is in west-central Texas.


      2. Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City (OSU-OKC) is in Oklahoma City, which
      is in the central part of Oklahoma.


      Since Oklahoma is north of Texas, and these universities are not at extreme
      edges of their states (like far northern Texas vs far southern Oklahoma), it''s
      most likely that the Oklahoma university is north of the Texas university.


      So, McMurry University in TX would be south of Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma
      City in OK, not north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative north-south positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - McMurry University is located in Abilene, Texas

      - Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Texas and Oklahoma.

      - Oklahoma is directly north of Texas on a map

      - The entire state of Oklahoma sits above most of Texas geographically


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Abilene is located in west-central Texas

      - Oklahoma City is in the central part of Oklahoma

      - Even considering their specific locations within their states, the Oklahoma
      institution would still be further north


      Therefore, McMurry University in Texas is NOT located north of Oklahoma State
      University-Oklahoma City. McMurry is south of OSU-OKC.

      1. University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Dentistry is in Mississippi

      1. We need to determine the relative geographic positions of two colleges: Stevens
      Institute of Technology in NJ (New Jersey) and Granite State College in NH (New
      Hampshire).


      2. First, let''s think about the states themselves: New Hampshire (NH) is in
      New England, in the northeastern United States. New Jersey (NJ) is a Mid-Atlantic
      state, south of New England.


      3. In general, New Hampshire is north of New Jersey. On a map of the US, NH
      is further north than NJ.


      4. However, the question asks specifically about the locations of these colleges,
      not just their states.


      5. Stevens Institute of Technology is in Hoboken, NJ, which is in the northern
      part of New Jersey, near New York City.


      6. Granite State College is in New Hampshire, and "Granite State" is the nickname
      for New Hampshire. Granite State College has multiple locations throughout NH,
      but all would be in New Hampshire.


      7. Since New Hampshire is north of New Jersey, and these colleges are in their
      respective states, Granite State College would be north of Stevens Institute
      of Technology.


      8. Therefore, Stevens Institute of Technology is NOT north of Granite State

      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two colleges.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - Stevens Institute of Technology is in New Jersey (NJ)

      - Granite State College is in New Hampshire (NH)


      ## Step 2: Determine the geographic relationship of these states

      - New Hampshire is located in New England, in the northeastern United States

      - New Jersey is in the Mid-Atlantic region, south of New England

      - On a north-south axis, New Hampshire is clearly north of New Jersey


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific locations within states

      - Stevens Institute of Technology is in Hoboken, NJ (northern New Jersey)

      - Granite State College has locations throughout New Hampshire

      - Even the southernmost point of New Hampshire is still north of the northernmost

      In terms of latitude:

      - New Hampshire is generally north of New Jersey

      - Therefore, Granite State College (in NH) is likely north of Stevens Institute
      of Technology (in NJ)


      Let me verify this based on my knowledge of US geography. New Hampshire borders
      Massachusetts to the north, and Massachusetts is north of Connecticut, which
      is north of New York state (excluding NYC area), which is north of northern
      New Jersey. So generally, New Hampshire is significantly north of New Jersey.

    04096c84-d62d-4d4d-bda3-50f1b446ce24: '<think>This question is asking about the
      relative positions of two universities in the United States:

      1. Averett University in Virginia (VA)

      2. Mercyhurst University in Pennsylvania (PA)


      I need to determine which one is located further north.


      Let me think about the general geography of these states:

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is a northern state, bordering New York and the Great Lakes
      region

      - Virginia (VA) is south of Pennsylvania, in the mid-Atlantic region


      Based on the general positions of these states, Virginia is south of Pennsylvania.
      This would suggest that Averett University (in VA) is likely south of Mercyhurst
      University (in PA).


      However, to be thorough, I should consider the specific locations of these universities
      within their states. It''s possible (though unlikely) that Averett is in far
      northern Virginia while Mercyhurst is in far southern Pennsylvania.


      Averett University is located in Danville, Virginia, which is in the southern
      part of Virginia near the North Carolina border.


      Mercyhurst University is located in Erie, Pennsylvania, which is in the northwestern
      corner of Pennsylvania, right on Lake Erie.


      Erie, PA is definitely much further north than Danville, VA. So Mercyhurst University
      is north of Averett University.</think>To determine whether Averett University,
      VA is located north of Mercyhurst University, PA, I need to consider the geographical
      locations of both institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the states'' relative positions.

      Pennsylvania is located north of Virginia in the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the specific locations of each university.

      Averett University is in Danville, Virginia, which is in the southern part of
      Virginia.

      Mercyhurst University is in Erie, Pennsylvania, which is in the northwestern
      corner of Pennsylvania on Lake Erie.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Erie, PA is much further north than Danville, VA. Even the southernmost point
      of Pennsylvania is generally north of most of Virginia.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these locations.

      Since Mercyhurst University is in Pennsylvania (a northern state) and specifically
      in Erie (a northern city within that state), while Averett University is in
      Virginia (a more southern state), Mercyhurst is clearly north of Averett.

      Let me work through this geographically:


      1. Averett University is located in Virginia (VA)

      2. Mercyhurst University is located in Pennsylvania (PA)


      I need to consider the relative north-south positioning of these two universities.


      Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia in the United States. Pennsylvania

      of Virginia near the North Carolina border

      - Mercyhurst University is in Erie, Pennsylvania, which is in the far northwestern

      Given these locations, Mercyhurst in Erie, PA would be significantly further
      north than Averett in southern Virginia.</think>To answer this question, I need

      - Pennsylvania is generally located north of Virginia in the United States.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Danville, VA is in the southern part of Virginia, near the North Carolina
      border

      - Erie, PA is in the far northwestern corner of Pennsylvania, along Lake Erie


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Erie, PA is significantly further north than Danville, VA

      United States.

      - Even though Cal Poly Humboldt is in northern California, any location in Washington
      state would still be further north than any location in California.

      - Pennsylvania is positioned significantly north of North Carolina on a map


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      The answer would be NO, Gardner-Webb University is not located north of Indiana
      University of Pennsylvania.</think>I''ll think about this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Gardner-Webb University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, located in the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast region

      - North Carolina is a southern state, located in the Southeast region

      - Generally, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Even though I don''t know the exact coordinates of these specific campuses,
      I know that Pennsylvania''s southern border is generally north of North Carolina''s
      northern border.


      Step 4: Therefore, a university in North Carolina (Gardner-Webb) would be south
      of a university in Pennsylvania (Indiana University of Pennsylvania).


      NO, Gardner-Webb University is not located north of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.'
    7ed7b434-dbef-4dd9-b1a4-c2e2d66df3b4: '<think>This question asks about the relative
      locations of two universities:


      1. Gardner-Webb University in North Carolina (NC)

      2. Indiana University of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania (PA)


      The question is whether Gardner-Webb University is located north of Indiana
      University of Pennsylvania.


      Let me think about the general geographic locations:

      - North Carolina is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is a state in the northeastern United States

      - Generally, Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina


      Since Gardner-Webb University is in North Carolina, and Indiana University of
      Pennsylvania is in Pennsylvania, it''s likely that Gardner-Webb University is
      south of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, not north.


      However, I should be careful about the exact locations of these universities
      within their states, especially if they''re near state borders. But generally
      speaking, most of Pennsylvania is north of most of North Carolina.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south positions

      - Gardner-Webb University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Pennsylvania (PA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these states.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Even accounting for specific locations within these states, this general
      north-south relationship holds true.

      - Pennsylvania''s southern border is still north of North Carolina''s northern
      border

      - Gardner-Webb University (in NC) would be south of any location in Pennsylvania


      NO, Gardner-Webb University is not located north of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is a northern state, located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States

      - Gardner-Webb University is in North Carolina, which is already established
      to be south of Pennsylvania

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is in Pennsylvania


      Without knowing the exact coordinates, I can reasonably conclude that Gardner-Webb
      University in NC is south of Indiana University of Pennsylvania in PA, because
      North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States

      - North Carolina is located in the southeastern United States

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of North Carolina on a map


      Step 2: Now, let''s consider the specific universities.

      - Gardner-Webb University is located in Boiling Springs, North Carolina

      - Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located in Indiana, Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Even if these universities aren''t in the geographic centers of their
      respective states, the overall north-south relationship remains consistent.
      The northernmost parts of North Carolina are still south of the southernmost

      First, let me think about where these two universities are located:

      name, I can infer it''s part of Georgia Southern University. The Armstrong Campus
      is located in Savannah, Georgia, which is on the Atlantic coast in the eastern
      part of the state.


      2. Furman University is in South Carolina (SC). Furman University is located
      in Greenville, South Carolina, which is in the northwestern part of South Carolina.

      - Savannah, GA is in the southeastern part of Georgia, close to the Georgia-South
      Carolina border.

      - Greenville, SC is in the northwestern part of South Carolina, close to the

      matter. Savannah is in the far eastern part of Georgia, while Greenville is
      in the northwestern part of South Carolina.


      Greenville, SC is further north than Savannah, GA. This means that Furman University
      (in Greenville, SC) is north of Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus

      - Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is located in Savannah, Georgia,
      which is on the Atlantic coast in the eastern part of Georgia

      - Furman University is located in Greenville, South Carolina, which is in the
      northwestern part of South Carolina

      - Greenville, SC is in the upper part of South Carolina, closer to the North
      Carolina border

      - Geographically, Greenville is further north than Savannah


      ## Step 3: Make the determination

      Since Greenville (where Furman University is located) is further north than
      Savannah (where Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus is located), the
      Armstrong Campus is NOT north of Furman University.

      part of North Carolina.


      Webb Institute is in Glen Cove, NY, which is on Long Island in New York state.


      In terms of latitude:

      - New York locations are generally at higher latitudes (more northern) than
      North Carolina locations

      - Even the southern parts of New York state are typically north of the northern
      parts of North Carolina


      So Webb Institute in NY would be north of Elizabeth City State University in
      NC, not the other way around.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Elizabeth City State University is in Elizabeth City, North Carolina

      - Webb Institute is in Glen Cove, New York


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is a northeastern state

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - New York is significantly north of North Carolina on the map

      - Even the southernmost parts of New York state are generally north of the northernmost
      parts of North Carolina

      - Elizabeth City, while in the northeastern part of North Carolina, is still
      south of New York state

      - Glen Cove (where Webb Institute is located) is on Long Island in New York


      Therefore, Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina is NOT located
      north of Webb Institute in New York. In fact, it''s the opposite - Webb Institute
      is north of Elizabeth City State University.

      locations of Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina and Webb Institute
      in New York, and then compare their latitudes to see which one is further north.


      First, let me identify where Elizabeth City State University is located:

      - Elizabeth City State University is in Elizabeth City, North Carolina

      - North Carolina is a state in the southeastern United States


      Next, let me identify where Webb Institute is located:

      - Webb Institute is in New York state

      - New York state is in the northeastern United States


      Generally speaking, New York is north of North Carolina. New York is one of
      the northernmost states on the East Coast, while North Carolina is more in the
      mid-Atlantic or southeastern region.


      To be more precise:

      - Elizabeth City, NC is likely in the northeastern part of North Carolina

      - Webb Institute is likely somewhere in New York state, probably in the NYC
      area or Long Island


      Even if Elizabeth City is in the northern part of North Carolina, it would still
      be south of most places in New York state. New York state is significantly further
      north than North Carolina.


      So the answer is likely NO - Elizabeth City State University is NOT north of
      Webb Institute, but I should be explicit about this conclusion.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the geographic locations of both institutions
      and compare their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Elizabeth City State University is located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina

      - Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, New York (on Long Island)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship of these states.

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state

      - New York is a northeastern state, generally north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Check their specific latitudes.

      - Elizabeth City, NC is in the northeastern part of North Carolina, near the
      Virginia border

      - Glen Cove, NY is on Long Island''s north shore


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      New York is significantly further north than North Carolina. Even though Elizabeth
      City is in the northern part of North Carolina, it is still well south of any
      location in New York state, including Glen Cove where Webb Institute is located.


      NO, Elizabeth City State University is not located north of Webb Institute.'

      First, let me think about the general geographic positions:

      - North Carolina (NC) is a state in the southeastern United States

      - New York (NY) is a state in the northeastern United States

      - Generally speaking, New York is north of North Carolina


      But I need to be more specific about these particular institutions:


      Elizabeth City State University is in Elizabeth City, NC. Elizabeth City is
      in the northeastern part of North Carolina.


      Webb Institute is in New York. I need to recall exactly where in New York it''s
      located. Webb Institute is in Glen Cove, NY, which is on Long Island.


      In terms of latitude:

      - States in the northern US have higher latitude numbers than states in the
      southern US

      - New York is generally at a higher latitude than North Carolina

      - Even though Elizabeth City is in the northeastern part of North Carolina,
      it would still be at a lower latitude than locations in New York, including

      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between the states.

      - New York is a northeastern state

      - North Carolina is a southeastern state

      - Generally, New York is north of North Carolina


      Step 3: Evaluate the specific locations within their states.

      - Even though Elizabeth City is in northeastern North Carolina, North Carolina
      as a whole lies south of New York

      - Glen Cove (where Webb Institute is located) is on Long Island in New York


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on latitude.

      Even though Alamosa is in southern Colorado, all of Colorado is north of New
      Mexico. Carlsbad''s location in southeastern New Mexico puts it even further
      south.


      Therefore, Adams State University in Colorado is located north of New Mexico
      State University Carlsbad.

      to determine the locations of both universities and compare their geographical
      positions, specifically whether New Mexico State University Carlsbad, NM is
      north of Adams State University, CO.


      First, let me identify where these universities are located:


      1. New Mexico State University Carlsbad is in Carlsbad, New Mexico (NM)

      2. Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)


      Now I need to determine their relative positions in terms of latitude (north-south
      positioning).


      Carlsbad, NM is in southern New Mexico, near the border with Texas. New Mexico
      is generally south of Colorado.


      Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado, which is in southern Colorado.


      Since Colorado is entirely north of New Mexico on the map, and Carlsbad is in
      southern New Mexico, this would mean that New Mexico State University Carlsbad
      is south of Adams State University in Colorado.


      Therefore, New Mexico State University Carlsbad, NM is NOT located north of
      Adams State University, CO.</think>I''ll think about this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - New Mexico State University Carlsbad is in Carlsbad, New Mexico (NM)

      - Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between New Mexico and Colorado.

      - Colorado is directly north of New Mexico on the US map

      - New Mexico shares its northern border with Colorado


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Carlsbad is in southeastern New Mexico, near the Texas border

      - Alamosa (where Adams State is located) is in southern Colorado


      Step 4: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since Colorado is entirely north of New Mexico, and Carlsbad is in southern
      New Mexico, New Mexico State University Carlsbad must be south of Adams State
      University.

      - New Mexico State University Carlsbad is in Carlsbad, New Mexico (NM)

      - Adams State University is in Colorado (CO)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of New Mexico and Colorado.

      Colorado is directly north of New Mexico in the United States. Colorado''s southern
      border is New Mexico''s northern border.


      Step 3: Now I need to think about where Carlsbad is located within New Mexico.

      Carlsbad is in southeastern New Mexico, near the border with Texas.


      Step 4: I need to determine where Adams State University is located in Colorado.

      Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado, which is in south-central Colorado,
      relatively close to the New Mexico border.


      Step 5: Compare the latitudes.

      Since Carlsbad is in southeastern New Mexico and Alamosa is in southern Colorado,
      and given that Colorado is entirely north of New Mexico, Adams State University
      must be north of New Mexico State University Carlsbad.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the relative positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Adams State University is in Alamosa, Colorado


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the two states.

      Colorado is entirely north of New Mexico. The southern border of Colorado forms
      the northern border of New Mexico.


      Step 3: Determine specific locations within their states.

      - Carlsbad is in southeastern New Mexico, near the Texas border

      - Alamosa (home of Adams State) is in south-central Colorado, though still relatively
      close to the New Mexico border


      Step 4: Compare positions.

      Since Carlsbad is in New Mexico (a state entirely south of Colorado) and Alamosa
      is in Colorado (a state entirely north of New Mexico), Adams State University
      must be north of New Mexico State University Carlsbad.


      NO - New Mexico State University Carlsbad is NOT located north of Adams State
      University. It''s the opposite: Adams State University is north of New Mexico

      locations of these two colleges.


      First, let me identify where each college is located:


      1. Lake Michigan College is in Michigan (MI). Specifically, it''s located in
      Benton Harbor, Michigan, which is on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan.


      2. Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is in Wisconsin (WI). Based on its
      name, it''s in the northeastern part of Wisconsin.


      Now I need to determine which one is further north. To do this, I need to know
      the approximate latitude of each location.


      Benton Harbor, Michigan (where Lake Michigan College is located) is in the southwestern
      part of Michigan, near the border with Indiana. It''s in the southern part of
      Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.


      Northeast Wisconsin Technical College has multiple campuses, but its main campus
      is in Green Bay, Wisconsin, which is on the western shore of Lake Michigan,
      in the northeastern part of Wisconsin.


      If I visualize the map of the Great Lakes region, Green Bay, Wisconsin is further
      north than Benton Harbor, Michigan. Wisconsin extends further north than the
      southern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula.


      So, Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (in Green Bay, WI) is located north
      of Lake Michigan College (in Benton Harbor, MI).</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the geographic locations of both colleges and compare their
      positions north to south.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Lake Michigan College.

      Lake Michigan College is located in Benton Harbor, Michigan, which is in the
      southwestern part of Michigan''s Lower Peninsula, near the southern end of Lake
      Michigan.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College.

      Northeast Wisconsin Technical College''s main campus is in Green Bay, Wisconsin,
      which is located in the northeastern part of Wisconsin along the western shore
      of Lake Michigan.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Benton Harbor, MI is positioned in the southern portion of Michigan''s Lower
      Peninsula, close to the Michigan-Indiana border.

      Green Bay, WI is positioned much further north along Lake Michigan.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      When looking at a map of the Great Lakes region, Green Bay (where Northeast
      Wisconsin Technical College is) is clearly north of Benton Harbor (where Lake
      Michigan College is).


      NO, Lake Michigan College is NOT located north of Northeast Wisconsin Technical
      College. The Wisconsin college is actually further north than the Michigan college.'

      - Arkansas State University-Newport is in Arkansas (AR)


      Now, I need to think about the geographic relationship between these states.

      - New Orleans is located in southern Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico

      - Newport, Arkansas would be somewhere in Arkansas, which is entirely north

      Step 3: Consider the specific cities.

      - New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana, very close to the Gulf Coast

      - Newport, Arkansas is in northeastern Arkansas


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - New Orleans is significantly further south than any point in Arkansas

      - Newport, being in Arkansas, is necessarily north of New Orleans


      Therefore, University of New Orleans is located SOUTH of Arkansas State University-Newport,

    067c7436-90d4-4651-a30c-22935dce35f1: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of Columbus Technical College in Georgia and Morehead
      State University in Kentucky, and then compare their geographical positions
      to determine which one is further north.


      Step 1: Find the approximate location of Columbus Technical College in Georgia.

      Columbus is a city in western Georgia. Columbus Technical College would be located
      in or near Columbus, GA.


      Step 2: Find the approximate location of Morehead State University in Kentucky.

      Morehead is a city in eastern Kentucky. Morehead State University would be located
      in or near Morehead, KY.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positions).

      Georgia is generally south of Kentucky in the United States. Kentucky borders
      the northern part of Georgia. So, in general, locations in Kentucky are north
      of locations in Georgia.


      Columbus is in the western part of Georgia, near the Alabama border, and is
      fairly far south in the state.

      Morehead is in eastern Kentucky.


      Given that Kentucky is north of Georgia, and Columbus is in southern Georgia,
      it''s very likely that Morehead State University in Kentucky is north of Columbus
      Technical College in Georgia.</think>I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - Columbus Technical College is located in Columbus, Georgia, which is in the
      western part of Georgia near the Alabama border.

      - Morehead State University is located in Morehead, Kentucky, which is in the
      eastern part of Kentucky.


      Step 2: Compare the states geographically.

      - Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia on a map of the United States.

      - Kentucky borders states like Ohio and West Virginia to its north, while Georgia
      borders Florida to its south.


      Step 3: Consider their specific locations within their states.

      - Columbus is in the southern half of Georgia.

      - Morehead is in eastern Kentucky, but even the southernmost part of Kentucky
      is still north of Georgia.


      Therefore, Columbus Technical College in Georgia is NOT located north of Morehead
      State University in Kentucky. Instead, Morehead State University is north of
      Columbus Technical College.

      them.


      1. Columbus Technical College is located in Columbus, Georgia (GA).

      2. Morehead State University is located in Morehead, Kentucky (KY).


      Now I need to determine which one is further north (i.e., has a higher latitude).


      Georgia is generally south of Kentucky. The entire state of Kentucky is north
      of Georgia on a map of the United States. Since Columbus Technical College is
      in Georgia and Morehead State University is in Kentucky, it''s very likely that
      Columbus Technical College is south of Morehead State University.


      Let me confirm this with specific locations:

      - Columbus, GA is in the western part of Georgia, close to the Alabama border

      - Morehead, KY is in eastern Kentucky


      Given the geography of the United States, with Kentucky being entirely north
      of Georgia, Columbus Technical College (in GA) must be south of Morehead State
      University (in KY).


      Therefore, Columbus Technical College is NOT north of Morehead State University.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Columbus Technical College is located in Columbus, Georgia (GA)

      - Morehead State University is located in Morehead, Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Determine their relative geographic positions.

      - Georgia is a southern state that borders Florida

      - Kentucky is further north, positioned above Tennessee and north of Georgia


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a north-south axis.

      - All of Kentucky is geographically north of Georgia

      - Since Columbus Tech is in Georgia and Morehead State is in Kentucky, Columbus
      Tech must be south of Morehead State


      NO'

      Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia (GA).

      Morehead State University is in Morehead, Kentucky (KY).


      To determine which is further north, I need to compare their latitudes:


      Georgia is a southern state, generally located south of Kentucky. Kentucky borders
      the northern part of Georgia''s neighboring state Tennessee.


      The general geographic arrangement from north to south is:

      - Kentucky (further north)

      - Tennessee (middle)

      - Georgia (further south)


      Since Columbus, Georgia would be in Georgia (south), and Morehead, Kentucky
      would be in Kentucky (north), Columbus Technical College would be south of Morehead
      State University, not north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the relative geographic positions of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia (GA)

      - Morehead State University is in Morehead, Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Georgia and Kentucky.

      - Kentucky is a state in the upper South/Midwest region of the US

      - Georgia is a state in the Deep South region of the US

      - Kentucky is positioned north of Georgia (with Tennessee in between)


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Georgia is south of Kentucky, Columbus Technical College (in GA) is south

      College, GA is located north of Morehead State University, KY, I need to figure
      out the geographical locations of both institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Columbus Technical College is in Columbus, Georgia (GA)

      - Morehead State University is in Morehead, Kentucky (KY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Georgia is a state in the southeastern United States

      - Kentucky is a state that''s north of Georgia, in the east-central part of
      the United States


      Step 3: More specifically, I need to compare the latitudes of these locations.

      - Columbus, GA is in the western part of Georgia, near the Alabama border

      - Morehead, KY is in eastern Kentucky


      In general, Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia on a map. Even the southernmost
      part of Kentucky would be north of the northernmost part of Georgia. Columbus
      is not in northern Georgia (it''s more central-west), and Morehead is not in
      the extreme southern part of Kentucky.


      So based on the general geography, Columbus Technical College in Georgia would
      be south of Morehead State University in Kentucky, not north of it.</think>#
      Is Columbus Technical College, GA located north of Morehead State University,
      KY?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two institutions by examining
      their locations.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Columbus Technical College is located in Columbus, Georgia (GA)

      2) Morehead State University is located in Morehead, Kentucky (KY)

      3) Looking at the geographical layout of US states, Kentucky is positioned entirely
      north of Georgia

      4) Columbus is in west-central Georgia, not even in the northernmost part of
      the state

      5) Morehead is in eastern Kentucky, but even the southernmost point of Kentucky
      is still north of Georgia


      Since Kentucky is entirely north of Georgia, and these institutions are in their
      respective states, Columbus Technical College must be south of Morehead State
      University.

      College in Georgia is located north of Morehead State University in Kentucky,
      I need to determine the geographic locations of both institutions.


      Columbus Technical College is located in Columbus, Georgia. Columbus is a city
      in western Georgia, near the Alabama border.


      Morehead State University is located in Morehead, Kentucky. Morehead is in eastern
      Kentucky.


      Now I need to determine which one is further north (has a higher latitude).


      Georgia is generally south of Kentucky in the United States. Kentucky borders
      the northern part of Georgia. So typically, locations in Kentucky are north
      of locations in Georgia.


      Columbus is in the western part of Georgia, near the southern part of the state.
      Morehead is in eastern Kentucky.


      Based on general U.S. geography, Morehead, Kentucky should be north of Columbus,
      Georgia. Therefore, Columbus Technical College should be SOUTH of Morehead State
      University, not north of it.</think># Is Columbus Technical College, GA located

      ## Step 3: Specific city locations

      - Columbus is in western Georgia, near the Alabama border

      - Morehead is in eastern Kentucky

      - Even though they''re in different parts of their respective states (east vs.
      west), the north-south relationship is determined by their states'' positions


      Since Kentucky is north of Georgia, and Morehead is in Kentucky while Columbus
      is in Georgia, Columbus Technical College is located SOUTH of Morehead State
      University, not north of it.

      difference even more pronounced.


      So, the University of Scranton (in PA) is north of Old Dominion University (in
      VA).


      The question asks if Old Dominion University is north of University of Scranton,
      which is the opposite of what I determined.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to locate both universities and compare their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of each university.

      - Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia (VA). (Note: I''m
      interpreting "POD" as perhaps a typo, as ODU is in Norfolk)

      - University of Scranton is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania (PA).


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions.

      - Virginia is located south of Pennsylvania in the United States.

      - Norfolk, VA (where ODU is located) is in the southeastern part of Virginia.

      - Scranton, PA is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Determine relative position.

      - Pennsylvania is substantially north of Virginia.

      - Therefore, the University of Scranton (in PA) must be north of Old Dominion
      University (in VA).


      NO - Old Dominion University is not located north of University of Scranton.
      It''s the opposite: University of Scranton is north of Old Dominion University.'
