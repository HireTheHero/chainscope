      of Huntington University in Indiana and Wisconsin Lutheran College in Wisconsin.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Huntington University is located in Huntington, Indiana.

      - Wisconsin Lutheran College is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of Indiana and Wisconsin.

      - Indiana is located in the Midwest, south of Wisconsin.

      - Wisconsin is north of Indiana.


      Step 3: To be more precise, let me consider the specific cities:

      - Huntington, Indiana is in the northeastern part of Indiana.

      - Milwaukee, Wisconsin is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin.


      Step 4: Even though Huntington is in the northern part of Indiana, Wisconsin
      as a whole is still north of Indiana. Milwaukee''s position in southern Wisconsin
      is still north of Huntington''s position in northern Indiana.


      NO, Huntington University, IN is not located north of Wisconsin Lutheran College,
      WI. It is located south of it.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of each institution.

      - Huntington University is located in Huntington, Indiana

      - Wisconsin Lutheran College is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Indiana and Wisconsin.

      - Indiana is located south of Wisconsin

      Step 3: More specifically, Huntington, IN is in the northeastern part of Indiana,
      while Milwaukee, WI is in the southeastern part of Wisconsin.


      Step 4: Even though Huntington is in the northern part of Indiana, the entire
      state of Indiana lies south of Wisconsin. Milwaukee is in southern Wisconsin,
      but it''s still farther north than any point in Indiana.


      Therefore, Huntington University in Indiana is located south of Wisconsin Lutheran
      College in Wisconsin, not north of it.

      - Shenandoah University is located in Winchester, Virginia (VA).

      - PennWest Edinboro (formerly Edinboro University of Pennsylvania) is located
      in Edinboro, Pennsylvania (PA).


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the eastern United States.

      - Pennsylvania is generally north of Virginia.

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: To be more specific, let me consider their approximate coordinates.

      - Winchester, VA (where Shenandoah University is located) is in northern Virginia,
      but still south of most of Pennsylvania.

      - Edinboro, PA is in northwestern Pennsylvania, fairly close to Lake Erie.


      Step 4: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Since Pennsylvania is north of Virginia, and Edinboro is in Pennsylvania while
      Winchester is in Virginia, PennWest Edinboro is north of Shenandoah University.

      - This means Shenandoah University is south of PennWest Edinboro, not north
      of it.

      - Tennessee is a southern state, located in the southeastern United States

      - Michigan is a northern state, located in the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region


      Step 3: More specifically, Michigan is positioned well north of Tennessee on
      a map of the United States.


      Step 4: Since Andrews University is in Michigan and Bethel University is in
      Tennessee, Andrews University must be located north of Bethel University (not

      Virginia

      - State University of New York at Cortland is located in Cortland, New York


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic relationship between Virginia and New
      York states.

      - Virginia is a southern state, located south of New York state

      - New York is a northern state, located north of Virginia


      Step 3: More specifically, let me consider the locations within their respective
      states.

      - Charlottesville, VA is in central Virginia

      - Cortland, NY is in central New York state


      Step 4: Comparing their positions on a north-south axis:

      - Any location in New York state would generally be north of any location in
      Virginia

      - Cortland, NY is definitely north of Charlottesville, VA


      Therefore, the University of Virginia Center for Politics (in Charlottesville,
      VA) is NOT north of SUNY Cortland (in Cortland, NY). In fact, it''s the opposite
      - SUNY Cortland is north of the UVA Center for Politics.

      Step 1: Let me identify the location of Elizabeth City State University.

      Elizabeth City State University is located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina,
      which is in the northeastern part of North Carolina.


      Step 2: Let me identify the location of Webb Institute.

      Webb Institute is located in Glen Cove, New York, which is on Long Island in

      New York is generally north of North Carolina. Specifically, Glen Cove, NY (where

      Elizabeth City, NC (where Elizabeth City State University is located) is further
      south.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      Since Webb Institute is in New York (a northern state) and Elizabeth City State
      University is in North Carolina (a more southern state), Webb Institute is located
      further north.


      NO, Elizabeth City State University in NC is not located north of Webb Institute

      First, I need to identify the locations of both universities:

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Ohio Valley University is in West Virginia (WV)


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      1. North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      2. West Virginia is also in the eastern United States, but is north of North
      Carolina

      3. If Ohio Valley University is in West Virginia, and St. Andrews University
      is in North Carolina, then Ohio Valley University must be north of St. Andrews
      University


      Since Ohio Valley University is north of St. Andrews University, St. Andrews
      University cannot be north of Ohio Valley University.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - St. Andrews University is in North Carolina (NC)

      - Ohio Valley University is in West Virginia (WV)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map.

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - West Virginia is north of North Carolina

      - Specifically, West Virginia is positioned in the Appalachian region, north
      of North Carolina


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positioning.

      - Since West Virginia is north of North Carolina, Ohio Valley University (in
      WV) would be north of St. Andrews University (in NC)

      - This means St. Andrews University is south of Ohio Valley University, not

      determine the relative positions of these universities.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - Old Dominion University is located in Norfolk, Virginia (not POD, VA - I believe
      this might be a typo in the question).

      - University of Scranton is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between Virginia and Pennsylvania.

      - Virginia is south of Pennsylvania on the U.S. East Coast.

      - Pennsylvania borders Virginia''s northern neighbor (Maryland/West Virginia).


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Norfolk is in southeastern Virginia.

      - Scranton is in northeastern Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Since Pennsylvania is entirely north of Virginia, and Scranton is in the northern
      part of Pennsylvania while Norfolk is in the southern part of Virginia, the
      University of Scranton must be north of Old Dominion University.


      NO, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA is not located north of University
      of Scranton, PA. It is located south of the University of Scranton.'
