      - North Carolina is generally south of West Virginia.

      - Beckley, WV, is located in the southern portion of West Virginia.

      - Pembroke, NC, is located in the southern portion of North Carolina.


      Given that West Virginia is north of North Carolina and the specific locations
      within the states, Mountain State University in Beckley, WV, is north of the
      University of North Carolina at Pembroke, NC.


      Thus, the answer is NO; the University of North Carolina at Pembroke is not
      located north of Mountain State University.'
