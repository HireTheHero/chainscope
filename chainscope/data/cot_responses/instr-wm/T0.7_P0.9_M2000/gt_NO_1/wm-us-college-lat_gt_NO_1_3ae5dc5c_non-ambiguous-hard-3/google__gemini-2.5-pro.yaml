      \nI've pinpointed the core geographic question: determining if Huntington University,\
      \ IN, sits north of Wisconsin Lutheran College, WI. My next step is to precisely\
      \ define these two locations for accurate latitude comparison.\n\n\n**Calculating\
      \ Latitude Comparisons**\n\nI've confirmed the locations: Huntington, IN, and\
      \ Milwaukee, WI. My research yielded approximate latitudes: 40.88\xB0 N and\
      \ 43.04\xB0 N, respectively. This confirms Wisconsin Lutheran College is north\
      \ of Huntington University. My task is complete.\n\n\n**Evaluating Stepwise\

      \ it's clear the latter is further north. Thus, I have the final answer.\n\n\
      \n**Finalizing the Analysis**\n\nI've completed the geographical analysis. My\
      \ approach was methodical: pinpointing the city locations, determining their\

      \ we find the approximate latitude of Marinette, WI. It is about 45.1\xB0 N.\n\
      5.  To determine if one location is north of another, we compare their latitudes.\
      \ A higher latitude means a location is further north.\n6.  Comparing the two,\
      \ 41.8\xB0 N (Lisle, IL) is a lower latitude than 45.1\xB0 N (Marinette, WI).\
      \ This means Benedictine University is south of the University of Wisconsin\u2013\

      I''ve established the core question: Determining if Cal Poly Humboldt is indeed
      north of Saint Martin''s University.  My focus is now on confirming the geographical
      locations of these two institutions within the United States. I''m moving on
      to gathering specific latitude and longitude data.



      **Locating University Cities**


      I''m now identifying the exact cities for each university: Arcata, CA for Cal
      Poly Humboldt and Lacey, WA for Saint Martin''s. Confirmed locations are key
      to proceeding with the geographical comparison. Next, I''ll determine the relative
      positions of these cities.



      **Determining Geographical Relationships**


      I''ve established that Cal Poly Humboldt is in Arcata, CA, and Saint Martin''s
      is in Lacey, WA. Now, I''m working through the logic. Since Washington is north
      of California, Saint Martin''s is north of Cal Poly Humboldt. Therefore, the
      answer to the user''s question, "Is Cal Poly Humboldt north of Saint Martin''s?",
      is no. It will be useful to clearly state this conclusion with the supporting
      steps.



      **Answering the User''s Question**


      I''ve outlined the process, from identifying the core question to finding the
      cities, Arcata and Lacey, and their states, California and Washington. Reasoning
      through it, the conclusion is clear: Since Washington is north of California,
      Saint Martin''s is north of Cal Poly Humboldt. Therefore, the answer to the
      user''s question, "Is Cal Poly Humboldt north of Saint Martin''s?", is no, and
      I can now formulate a concise response.

      I'm zeroing in on the core question: Determining the geographical relationship\
      \ between St. Andrews and Ohio Valley.  I need to clarify what data is crucial\
      \ to solving this. Is it latitude and longitude, state boundaries, or something\
      \ else entirely? The more I investigate, the more I realize a precise answer\
      \ hinges on a focused approach.\n\n\n**Clarifying Geographic Positions**\n\n\
      I've determined that pinpointing the latitudes of St. Andrews and Ohio Valley\
      \ Universities is paramount. I've successfully found St. Andrews' latitude (34.77\xB0\
      \ N) and am now focusing on Ohio Valley. I'm preparing to conduct a search for\
      \ the correct latitude of its former location in Vienna, West Virginia, to compare\
      \ with St. Andrews.\n\n\n**Analyzing Geographic Locations**\n\nI've made significant\
      \ progress by comparing the latitudes.  St. Andrews in Laurinburg, NC, is at\
      \ approximately 34.77\xB0 N, and Ohio Valley in Vienna, WV, is at roughly 39.33\xB0\
      \ N. With this direct comparison, I can now conclusively determine which location\

      that this is a straightforward geographical question. I''m focusing on the specifics
      of the geographical relationship.



      **Verifying State Relationships**


      I''m now certain that the question hinges on the relative positions of Georgia
      and Ohio. My initial assumption that Ohio is north of Georgia seems correct,
      given their positions in the US. A further check confirms this with a quick
      look at a map. Kennesaw, Georgia, will indeed be south of Bexley, Ohio.



      **Refining the Geographical Comparison**


      I''ve clarified the question further. We''re now comparing the exact locations:
      Kennesaw, Georgia, and Bexley, Ohio. My logic has progressed through state-level
      comparison to city-specific coordinates. I''m focusing on the latitudes of the
      two locations, solidifying the conclusion that Bexley is definitively north
      of Kennesaw.

      I''m focusing on the core question: Is ODU north of Scranton? I''ve started
      breaking down the question, realizing I need concrete geographical facts like
      the latitude and longitude of each university. My next step will be to define
      the coordinate retrieval approach to ensure accurate and reliable data.



      **Confirming Location Comparison**


      I''ve clarified the geographical locations. Old Dominion University is in Norfolk,
      Virginia, and the University of Scranton is in Scranton, Pennsylvania. My next
      task will be determining which city is further north. I am considering using
      latitude coordinates or even general geographical knowledge.



      **Refining the Comparative Analysis**


      I''ve established that Norfolk, Virginia, is the correct location for Old Dominion
      University and Scranton, Pennsylvania, for the University of Scranton. My focus
      now is solidifying the north-south comparison. Using geographical knowledge
      alone, I''ve concluded that Pennsylvania is north of Virginia. This implies
      Scranton is north of Norfolk. To definitively answer the core question, I''ll
      explicitly state the comparative relationship using that conclusion.



      **Analyzing Geographical Positions**


      My approach shifted to pinpointing the locations: Norfolk, Virginia, and Scranton,
      Pennsylvania. I''ve now completed the geographical fact-finding and comparative
      analysis, focusing on establishing the relative north/south positions. I''ve
      built a logical progression that provides a definitive and correct response
      to the core question, culminating in a clear "NO" answer. The reasoning is sound
      and ready for a final review.



      **Concluding Geographical Comparison**


      I''ve completed the geographical analysis, starting with identifying each university''s
      location. Then, I compared them, culminating in a clear "NO" answer to the initial
      question. My approach was methodical and resulted in a correct, easy-to-understand
      response to the user''s initial prompt. The logic is now finalized and ready
      for the next task.



      </think>Here is the step-by-step reasoning:


      1.  **Identify the location of Old Dominion University.** Old Dominion University
      is located in the city of Norfolk, Virginia (VA).

      2.  **Identify the location of the University of Scranton.** The University
      of Scranton is located in the city of Scranton, Pennsylvania (PA).

      3.  **Compare the geographical locations.** The state of Pennsylvania is located
      north of the state of Virginia. Therefore, Scranton, PA is geographically north
      of Norfolk, VA.

      4.  **Answer the question.** The question asks if Old Dominion University (in
      Virginia) is north of the University of Scranton (in Pennsylvania). Since Virginia
      is south of Pennsylvania, the statement is false.


      NO'

      I''ve zeroed in on the core question: Is ODU north of Scranton? Now, I''m breaking
      down the query to identify the specific geographic data needed, like the latitude
      and longitude of each university. My focus is on ensuring precision and avoiding
      assumptions.



      **Refining Geographic Comparison**


      I''m now zeroing in on the comparison itself. Previously, I established that
      both locations are known. I need to get the exact latitude and longitude of
      both Norfolk, VA and Scranton, PA. I''ll need to use those values to ascertain
      which city is farther north.



      **Establishing Relative Positions**


      I''ve identified the locations, and I''m confident in Norfolk, VA, and Scranton,
      PA. Now, I''ll compare the positions of Virginia and Pennsylvania. I recall
      Pennsylvania lies north of Virginia, and I''ll use this knowledge to formulate
      the final answer, concluding ODU is south of Scranton. I will present the answer
      step-by-step to increase clarity.



      **Clarifying the Conclusion**


      I''ve finalized my reasoning and confirmed the answer. I have identified the
      locations of both universities and established that Pennsylvania is north of
      Virginia.  Therefore, I''ve concluded, step-by-step, that ODU is south of Scranton.
      The answer is a clear "NO".
