      2.  **Determine the relative positions:** We need to know if Nueces County,
      TX is east or west of Galax City, VA.

      3.  **Consider the states:** Texas is generally in the southwestern/south-central
      US. Virginia is on the East Coast.

      4.  **Rough estimation:** Due to the overall geography of the US, locations
      in Virginia are generally much further east than locations in Texas.

      5.  **Confirm:** A quick mental map or lookup confirms that Texas is significantly
      west of Virginia.

      6.  **Apply to the specific locations:** Since Texas is west of Virginia, any
      location within Texas (like Nueces County) will be west of any location within
      Virginia (like Galax City).

      7.  **Formulate the answer:** The question asks if Nueces County, TX is *east*
      of Galax City, VA. Since Nueces County is west of Galax City, the answer is
      no.

      *greater* than 80.9 degrees West (Galax City).

      5.  **Understand the relationship between longitude and east/west:** On Earth,
      as West longitude numbers increase, you move further *west*. As East longitude
      numbers increase, you move further *east*. When comparing two locations in the
      Western Hemisphere (which both Texas and Virginia are), the location with the
      *smaller* West longitude number is *east* of the location with the *larger*
      West longitude number.

      \ state matters for precise comparisons (e.g., is the *center* of Sac County\
      \ east of the *center* of St. Lucie County?), the overwhelming geographical\
      \ separation of the states makes it highly likely that the general state relationship\
      \ holds true for any county within those states. Iowa is far to the northwest\
      \ of Florida.\n\n6.  **Focus on the specific question:** The question asks if\
      \ Sac County, IA is *east* of St. Lucie County, FL.\n\n7.  **Compare the longitudes\

      A glance at a map or knowledge of US geography shows that states like South
      Dakota are generally located *west* of states like Tennessee.

      5.  **Confirm the relative longitudinal positions:** South Dakota is located
      primarily in the Central Time Zone (western part) and Mountain Time Zone (western

      Time Zone (western part). Time zones are based on longitude, with Eastern being
      further east than Central and Central being further east than Mountain. This
      confirms that, in general, South Dakota is located west of Tennessee.

      6.  **Consider the specific counties:** While variations exist within states,
      the overall relationship between the states is a strong indicator. Brookings
      County is in eastern South Dakota. Knox County is in eastern Tennessee. Even

      \ the answer is NO.\n\n8.  **Final check:** Does the logic make sense? Texas\
      \ is a western state compared to New Jersey, which is on the East Coast. It\
      \ is geographically intuitive that a location in central Texas would be west\
      \ of a location in central New Jersey. The longitude comparison confirms this\
      \ intuition.\n\n9.  **Provide the final YES/NO answer:** Based on the analysis,\
      \ the answer is NO.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  Identify the\
      \ two locations: Milam County, TX and Somerset County, NJ.\n2.  Understand the\
      \ geographical relationship being asked: Is Milam County *east* of Somerset\
      \ County?\n3.  To determine if one location is east of another, compare their\
      \ longitudes. A location further east will have a longitude value closer to\
      \ 0 degrees or a larger positive value (if using East longitudes) or a smaller\
      \ negative value (if using West longitudes) compared to a location further west.\n\
      4.  Locate Milam County, TX. It is in central Texas. Texas is a state in the\
      \ southern/southwestern United States. Its approximate longitude is around -97\
      \ degrees West.\n5.  Locate Somerset County, NJ. It is in central New Jersey.\
      \ New Jersey is a state on the East Coast of the United States. Its approximate\
      \ longitude is around -74 degrees West.\n6.  Compare the longitudes: -97 degrees\
      \ West (Milam County) vs. -74 degrees West (Somerset County).\n7.  On a scale\
      \ where 0 is the Prime Meridian and negative numbers represent degrees West,\
      \ -97 is a smaller (more negative, further west) number than -74.\n8.  Therefore,\
      \ Milam County, TX is located *west* of Somerset County, NJ.\n9.  The question\

      2.  **Determine the relative positions:** We need to know which state is generally
      east or west of the other state. Texas is in the southwestern/south-central
      US, and Virginia is in the southeastern/Mid-Atlantic US. Virginia is significantly
      east of Texas.

      3.  **Consider locations within states:** While specific county locations within
      their states matter for a precise "east of" or "west of" comparison, the vast

      factor. San Augustine County is in East Texas, and Dinwiddie County is in south-central
      Virginia.

      4.  **Compare locations:** Since Virginia is far to the east of Texas, any county
      in Texas will be west of any county in Virginia. Therefore, San Augustine County,

      asks about Woodson County, KS and Screven County, GA.

      2.  **Determine the general location of each state:** Kansas (KS) is a state
      in the central United States. Georgia (GA) is a state in the southeastern United
      States.

      3.  **Consider the relative positions of the states:** The Southeast is generally
      east of the Central US. Georgia is located significantly east of Kansas.

      4.  **Consider the locations of the counties within their states:** While the
      exact position of the counties within their states matters for a precise comparison,
      the vast difference in the longitudinal positions of the states themselves is
      the primary factor. Georgia is entirely east of Kansas.

      5.  **Compare the general locations:** Since Georgia is east of Kansas, any
      location within Georgia will be east of any location within Kansas (ignoring
      minor curvature of the Earth over this distance, which is negligible for this
      comparison).

      6.  **Conclude based on state locations:** Screven County, GA is located in
      Georgia, and Woodson County, KS is located in Kansas. Since Georgia is east
      of Kansas, Screven County, GA is east of Woodson County, KS.

      7.  **Rephrase the question:** The question asks if Woodson County, KS is east
      of Screven County, GA. This is the opposite of the conclusion from step 6. Since
      Screven County, GA is east of Woodson County, KS, Woodson County, KS is *not*
      east of Screven County, GA.

      2.  **Determine longitude:** To compare "east of," we need to consider the longitude
      of each location.

      3.  **Find the approximate longitude of Uintah County, UT:** Uintah County is
      in eastern Utah. Utah is in the Mountain Time Zone (MST), which is generally
      around 105-115 degrees West longitude. Uintah County is in the eastern part
      of the state, so its longitude will be closer to the eastern edge, perhaps around
      109-110 degrees West.

      4.  **Find the approximate longitude of Walworth County, WI:** Walworth County
      is in southeastern Wisconsin. Wisconsin is in the Central Time Zone (CST), which
      is generally around 87-92 degrees West longitude. Walworth County is in the
      southern/eastern part of the state, so its longitude will be closer to the eastern
      edge, perhaps around 88-89 degrees West.

      5.  **Compare longitudes:** Uintah County, UT is around 109-110 degrees West.
      Walworth County, WI is around 88-89 degrees West.

      6.  **Interpret "east of":** A location with a *smaller* West longitude is further
      east than a location with a *larger* West longitude.

      7.  **Make the comparison:** 88-89 (Walworth County) is smaller than 109-110
      (Uintah County). Therefore, Walworth County, WI is east of Uintah County, UT.

      8.  **Answer the question asked:** The question is "Is Uintah County, UT located

    d3ffd047-1b09-4088-abe7-49e15c9c5aa7: "Here's my thought process to answer the\
      \ question:\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks if Okmulgee\
      \ County, OK is located *east* of Beaufort County, SC.\n\n2.  **Identify the\
      \ key locations:**\n    *   Okmulgee County, OK\n    *   Beaufort County, SC\n\
      \n3.  **Determine the relevant geographical concept:** The question uses the\
      \ term \"east of\". This relates to longitude. To determine if one location\
      \ is east of another, I need to compare their longitudes. The location with\
      \ the *smaller* (more negative, or closer to 0 if using degrees East) longitude\
      \ is *west* of the location with the *larger* (less negative) longitude. Conversely,\
      \ the location with the *larger* longitude is *east* of the location with the\
      \ *smaller* longitude.\n\n4.  **Find the approximate longitude of Okmulgee County,\
      \ OK:** I can look this up or use my internal knowledge base. Okmulgee County\
      \ is in eastern Oklahoma. Oklahoma is in the central US. Its longitude is significantly\
      \ west of the prime meridian (0 degrees). A quick search or recall gives an\
      \ approximate range around 95-96 degrees West longitude. Let's use ~95.8\xB0\
      \ W as a representative central longitude for the county.\n\n5.  **Find the\
      \ approximate longitude of Beaufort County, SC:** Beaufort County is on the\
      \ coast of South Carolina. South Carolina is on the Atlantic coast of the US.\
      \ Its longitude is significantly west of the prime meridian, but much further\
      \ east than Oklahoma. A quick search or recall gives an approximate range around\
      \ 80-81 degrees West longitude. Let's use ~80.7\xB0 W as a representative central\
      \ longitude for the county.\n\n6.  **Compare the longitudes:**\n    *   Okmulgee\
      \ County, OK: ~95.8\xB0 W\n    *   Beaufort County, SC: ~80.7\xB0 W\n\n7.  **Interpret\
      \ the comparison:**\n    *   95.8\xB0 W is further west (more negative in the\
      \ Western Hemisphere convention) than 80.7\xB0 W.\n    *   Therefore, Okmulgee\
      \ County, OK is located *west* of Beaufort County, SC.\n\n8.  **Formulate the\
      \ answer to the *original* question:** The original question asks if Okmulgee\
      \ County, OK is located *east* of Beaufort County, SC. Since I determined it\
      \ is *west*, the answer to the original question is NO.\n\n9.  **Final check:**\
      \ Does my reasoning make sense geographically? Oklahoma is in the central US,\
      \ while South Carolina is on the East Coast. Yes, locations on the East Coast\
      \ are generally east of locations in the central US.\n\n10. **State the final\
      \ YES/NO answer.**\n\nStep 1: Identify the two counties: Okmulgee County, OK\
      \ and Beaufort County, SC.\nStep 2: Determine the relative longitudinal position\
      \ of each county. This requires knowing or looking up their approximate longitudes.\n\
      Step 3: Okmulgee County, OK is located in eastern Oklahoma. Oklahoma is in the\
      \ central US. Its longitude is roughly between 94\xB0W and 103\xB0W. A representative\
      \ longitude for Okmulgee County is around 95.8\xB0W.\nStep 4: Beaufort County,\
      \ SC is located on the coast of South Carolina. South Carolina is on the eastern\
      \ US coast. Its longitude is roughly between 78\xB0W and 83\xB0W. A representative\
      \ longitude for Beaufort County is around 80.7\xB0W.\nStep 5: Compare the longitudes:\
      \ 95.8\xB0W (Okmulgee) vs. 80.7\xB0W (Beaufort). In the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ a smaller W value means further east. Since 80.7 < 95.8, Beaufort County is\
      \ further east than Okmulgee County.\nStep 6: The question asks if Okmulgee\
      \ County is *east* of Beaufort County. Since Okmulgee County is at a higher\
      \ W longitude (further west) than Beaufort County, it is located *west* of Beaufort\
      \ County.\n\nNO"

      are located to the west of southern states in the US. Montana is significantly
      northwest of Arkansas.

      4.  **Consider locations within the states:** While counties can be anywhere
      within a state, the overall position of Montana relative to Arkansas is the
      primary factor. Yellowstone County is in the southern part of Montana. Little
      River County is in the southwestern corner of Arkansas.

      in the eastern part of the US. Texas is west of North Carolina.

      4.  **Determine the general longitudinal positions of the counties within their
      states:** Scurry County is in West Texas. Caswell County is in northern North
      Carolina. While knowing the exact location within the state helps refine the
      position, the state''s overall position is the primary factor. West Texas is
      significantly further west than northern North Carolina.

      5.  **Compare the longitudes:** Since Texas is generally west of North Carolina,
      and Scurry County is in West Texas while Caswell County is in North Carolina,
      Scurry County is at a more westerly longitude than Caswell County.

      2.  **Identify the two entities:**\n    *   Bledsoe County, TN (Tennessee)\n\
      \    *   Belknap County, NH (New Hampshire)\n\n3.  **Determine the general location\
      \ of each state:**\n    *   Tennessee (TN) is generally located in the southeastern/south-central\
      \ part of the United States.\n    *   New Hampshire (NH) is located in the northeastern\
      \ part of the United States (part of New England).\n\n4.  **Visualize or recall\
      \ the relative positions of these states on a US map:** New Hampshire is significantly\
      \ further north and east than Tennessee. Tennessee is further south and west\
      \ than New Hampshire.\n\n5.  **Consider the counties within the states:** While\
      \ the exact location within the state matters for precise calculations, the\
      \ states themselves provide a very strong indication of the overall relative\
      \ position. Belknap County is in New Hampshire, and Bledsoe County is in Tennessee.\n\
      \n6.  **Compare the longitudinal positions:** To determine if one is east of\
      \ the other, we primarily look at longitude. A location further east has a higher\
      \ longitude (or a less negative longitude if using standard geographic coordinates\
      \ where west is negative).\n    *   New Hampshire is located further east than\
      \ Tennessee. Its longitude is generally around 71-72 degrees West.\n    *  \
      \ Tennessee is located further west than New Hampshire. Its longitude is generally\
      \ around 86-90 degrees West.\n\n7.  **Apply the \"east of\" concept:** A location\
      \ \"A\" is east of location \"B\" if A has a higher longitude than B (is less\
      \ negative in standard W longitude). Since New Hampshire is significantly east\
      \ of Tennessee, any county *within* New Hampshire will be east of any county\
      \ *within* Tennessee.\n\n8.  **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:**\
      \ Belknap County, NH is located in New Hampshire. Bledsoe County, TN is located\
      \ in Tennessee. New Hampshire is geographically located to the east of Tennessee.\
      \ Therefore, Belknap County, NH is located to the east of Bledsoe County, TN.\n\
      \n9.  **Re-read the original question carefully:** \"Is Bledsoe County, TN located\
      \ east of Belknap County, NH?\" This is the *reverse* of what I just concluded.\
      \ I concluded Belknap is east of Bledsoe. The question asks if Bledsoe is east\
      \ of Belknap.\n\n10. **Reverse the comparison:** If Belknap County, NH is east\
      \ of Bledsoe County, TN, then Bledsoe County, TN must be west of Belknap County,\
      \ NH.\n\n11. **Final check:** Bledsoe County, TN is in the central US (longitude\
      \ around 85-86\xB0 W). Belknap County, NH is in the northeastern US (longitude\
      \ around 71-72\xB0 W). Since 85-86\xB0 W is further west (more negative longitude)\
      \ than 71-72\xB0 W, Bledsoe County, TN is located west of Belknap County, NH.\
      \ The question asks if it's *east*.\n\n12. **Conclusion:** Bledsoe County, TN\
      \ is *not* located east of Belknap County, NH. It is located west.\n\n13. **Format\
      \ the final answer:** Provide the single word YES or NO.\n\nThe final answer\
      \ is $\\boxed{NO}$."
