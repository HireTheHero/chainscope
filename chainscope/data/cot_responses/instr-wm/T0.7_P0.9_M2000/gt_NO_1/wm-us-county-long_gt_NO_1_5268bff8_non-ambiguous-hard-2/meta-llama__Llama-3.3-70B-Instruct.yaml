      in the state of Nebraska. Nebraska is in the Midwestern United States, which
      is generally considered to be in the central part of the country.


      2. **Identify the location of Wythe County, VA**: Wythe County is located in
      the state of Virginia. Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States, which
      places it to the east of the central part of the country.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Nebraska (where Buffalo County is located)
      is in the central part of the United States and Virginia (where Wythe County
      is located) is on the East Coast, it means that Buffalo County, NE, is west
      of Wythe County, VA.


      Based on this comparison, Buffalo County, NE, is not east of Wythe County, VA.
      Therefore, the answer to the question is:

      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Colorado is in the western
      part of the United States, while Michigan is in the eastern part.


      3. **Determine the relative positions of Colorado and Michigan**: Since Colorado
      is west and Michigan is east, any county in Colorado will be west of any county
      in Michigan.


      4. **Apply this understanding to Baca County, CO, and Gladwin County, MI**:

      2. Next, we need to determine the location of Dubuque County, IA. Dubuque County

      central part of the country, west of the Mississippi River.


      2. **Identify the location of Schoharie County, NY**: Schoharie County is located
      in the state of New York, in the Northeastern United States. New York is situated

      east of Ellis County, TX, we need to consider their geographical locations.


      1. First, identify the state locations: Bannock County is in Idaho (ID), and
      Ellis County is in Texas (TX).

      2. Consider the general geographical positions of Idaho and Texas in the United
      States. Idaho is located in the northwestern part of the United States, while
      Texas is in the south-central part.

      3. Since Idaho is west of Texas, any county in Idaho, including Bannock County,
      would be west of any county in Texas, including Ellis County.

      4. Given this, Bannock County, ID cannot be east of Ellis County, TX because
      it is actually to the west.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      east of Kankakee County, IL, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Hayes County is in Nebraska (NE), and Kankakee
      County is in Illinois (IL).

      2. **Understand the general geography of the United States**: Nebraska is located
      west of Illinois. This is a crucial piece of information because it gives us
      a general idea of the relative positions of the two states.

      3. **Consider the specific counties**: Without specific knowledge of each county''s
      exact location within its state, we might think we need detailed maps. However,
      knowing that Nebraska is west of Illinois gives us a strong hint.

      4. **Apply the west-east rule**: Since Nebraska is west of Illinois, any county
      in Nebraska, including Hayes County, would be west of any county in Illinois,
      including Kankakee County.

      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Hayes County, NE is in a state that is west of

      Nebraska, and Kankakee County is located in the state of Illinois.


      2. **Understand Geographic Positions**: Nebraska is located west of Illinois.

      would generally be west of Kankakee County, which is in Illinois.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Nebraska is west of Illinois, it follows that
      Hayes County, NE, is located west of Kankakee County, IL, not east.

      (more towards the west) compared to something in North Carolina. This is because
      Kansas is farther west than North Carolina.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Lane County, OR is located in the state of Oregon
      on the west coast of the United States. Coke County, TX is located in the state
      of Texas.


      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Oregon is generally west of Texas. The
      United States is laid out in a way that as you move from the east coast to the
      west coast, you pass through various states, with the Rocky Mountains roughly
      dividing the eastern two-thirds from the western third of the country. Oregon
      is beyond these mountains on the Pacific coast, while Texas is more towards
      the southern part of the central United States.


      3. **Specific locations of counties**: Without needing the exact longitude and
      latitude, knowing the states'' positions relative to each other is enough. Lane
      County, being in Oregon, is on the west coast, and Coke County, being in Texas,
      is more towards the central/southern part of the U.S., which places it east

      1. First, we identify the states: Eddy County is in New Mexico (NM), and Greenup
      County is in Kentucky (KY).

      2. Next, we consider the general geography of the United States. New Mexico
      is located in the southwestern part of the country, while Kentucky is in the
      eastern part.

      3. Given this information, we can infer that New Mexico is west of Kentucky
      because the United States is generally divided into western and eastern regions,
      with the Mississippi River often serving as a rough dividing line. New Mexico
      is west of this line, and Kentucky is east of it.

      4. Since Eddy County, NM, is in the western United States and Greenup County,
      KY, is in the eastern United States, Eddy County is west of Greenup County.

      5. Therefore, considering the question of whether Eddy County, NM, is located

      is actually west of Greenup County.

      the locations of Gregory County, SD, and Terrell County, GA, relative to each

      1. **Identify the states**: Gregory County is located in South Dakota (SD),
      and Terrell County is located in Georgia (GA).


      2. **General geographic location of the states**: South Dakota is located in
      the Midwestern United States, near the Canadian border, while Georgia is in
      the Southeastern United States.


      3. **Relative east-west positioning of the states**: Generally, Georgia is east
      of South Dakota. This is because the United States can be broadly divided into
      eastern and western parts, with the Mississippi River often serving as a rough
      dividing line. Georgia is east of the Mississippi River, and South Dakota is
      west of it.


      4. **County-specific locations**: Without needing the exact positions of the
      counties within their states, the general east-west positioning of the states
      (Georgia to the east of South Dakota) gives us the information needed to answer
      the question.


      Given these steps, since Georgia (where Terrell County is located) is east of

      1. **Identify the locations**: Edmunds County is in South Dakota (SD), and Medina

      2. **General geographical knowledge**: South Dakota is located in the Midwestern
      United States, considered part of the Great Plains region, and is situated relatively
      far to the west. Ohio, on the other hand, is in the Eastern United States, part
      of the Midwestern United States as well but significantly farther east than
      South Dakota.


      3. **Compare the longitudes or general east-west positions**: Since longitude
      measures east-west position, any location with a higher longitude is farther
      east. However, without needing the exact longitudes, we can use general geographical
      knowledge: South Dakota is west of Ohio.


      Given these steps, since South Dakota (where Edmunds County is located) is west
      of Ohio (where Medina County is located), Edmunds County, SD cannot be east
      of Medina County, OH.
