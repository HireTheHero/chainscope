      Montana (MT) is located east of Becker County, Minnesota (MN), we need to analyze
      their relative geographic positions in the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Becker County, MN.

      - Becker County is located in the western part of Minnesota. Minnesota is in
      the northern-central region of the U.S., and its western border is shared with
      North Dakota and South Dakota.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Musselshell County, MT.

      - Musselshell County is in the central part of Montana. Montana is directly
      west of North Dakota and is located in the northwestern part of the contiguous
      U.S.


      Step 3: Understand relative east-west positions.

      - Since Montana is west of North Dakota and Minnesota is east of North Dakota,
      Montana in general lies west of Minnesota.

      - Becker County is in western Minnesota, while Musselshell County is in central
      Montana, which is even farther west.


      Conclusion:

      Musselshell County, MT is located west of Becker County, MN.

      Dakota (SD) is located east of Cullman County, Alabama (AL), we need to analyze
      their geographic positions relative to each other.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Haakon County, SD.

      - Haakon County is in the western part of South Dakota.

      - South Dakota is a northern Great Plains state in the central United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Cullman County, AL.

      - Cullman County is in the northern part of Alabama.

      - Alabama is located in the southeastern region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - South Dakota is generally west of Alabama.

      - Haakon County, being in western South Dakota, is even farther west.

      - Cullman County, being in Alabama, is significantly farther east than Haakon
      County.


      Conclusion:

      Since Haakon County, SD is in a western state and Cullman County, AL is in an
      eastern state, and Haakon is in the western part of its state while Cullman
      is in the eastern half of the country, Haakon County is west of Cullman County.

      Step 1: Locate Todd County, Minnesota.

      - Todd County is in the central part of the state of Minnesota.

      - Minnesota is located in the north-central region of the United States, part
      of the Midwest.

      locations of both counties.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Minnehaha County, South Dakota.

      - Minnehaha County is located in the southeastern part of South Dakota.

      - Sioux Falls, a major city in South Dakota, is located in Minnehaha County.

      - South Dakota is in the north-central region of the United States, part of

      TX is located east of Dickenson County, VA, we need to analyze their geographic
      positions within the United States.


      Step 1: Locate Collingsworth County, Texas.

      - Collingsworth County is located in the Texas Panhandle, which is in the northern
      part of Texas, near the Oklahoma border.

      - It is situated in the central United States, in the western portion of Texas.


      Step 2: Locate Dickenson County, Virginia.

      - Dickenson County is in the southwestern part of Virginia.

      - Virginia is on the eastern side of the United States, and even southwestern
      Virginia is generally farther east than most parts of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions.

      - Texas lies mostly west of Virginia.

      - Even the easternmost parts of Texas (including the Panhandle) are farther
      west than the westernmost parts of Virginia.


      Therefore, Collingsworth County, TX is west of Dickenson County, VA.

    42abb319-d0ca-49d0-8d70-bcf3cd6813af: 'To determine whether Granite County, Montana
      is located east of Deuel County, South Dakota, we need to analyze their relative
      geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Granite County, MT.

      - Granite County is in western Montana.

      - Montana is located in the northwestern part of the United States.

      - Specifically, Granite County is in the western part of the state, near counties
      like Missoula and Powell.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Deuel County, SD.

      - Deuel County is in the eastern part of South Dakota.

      - South Dakota is located to the east of Montana.

      - Deuel County borders Minnesota and is one of the easternmost counties in South
      Dakota.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since Granite County is in western Montana and Deuel County is in eastern
      South Dakota, and South Dakota itself is east of Montana, it follows that Granite
      County is significantly west of Deuel County.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO.'

      longitudinal positions, since east-west positioning is determined by longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Sharkey County, MS.

      - Sharkey County is located in the western part of the state of Mississippi.

      - Mississippi is a southern state in the central-eastern part of the United
      States, bordering the Mississippi River on the west.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Charles County, MD.

      - Charles County is located in the southern part of Maryland.

      - Maryland is on the East Coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Mississippi, and especially Sharkey County, which is in western Mississippi,
      lies to the west of Maryland.

      - Maryland, including Charles County, is significantly farther east than Mississippi.

      Dakota, is located east of St. Charles County, Missouri, we need to consider
      their relative geographic positions in terms of longitude (east-west orientation).


      Step 1: Identify the location of McKenzie County, ND.

      - McKenzie County is in the western part of North Dakota. In fact, it is one
      of the westernmost counties in the state.

      - North Dakota itself is located in the northern central region of the United
      States, and McKenzie County is close to the Montana border.


      Step 2: Identify the location of St. Charles County, MO.

      - St. Charles County is in eastern Missouri, near the city of St. Louis.

      - Missouri is located to the south of North Dakota, and St. Charles County is
      in the eastern part of Missouri.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - McKenzie County, ND is farther west than most of Missouri, especially the
      eastern part where St. Charles County is located.

      - Therefore, McKenzie County is clearly west of St. Charles County.
