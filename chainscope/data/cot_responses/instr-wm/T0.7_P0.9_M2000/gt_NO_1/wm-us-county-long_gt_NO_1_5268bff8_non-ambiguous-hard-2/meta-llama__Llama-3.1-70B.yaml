      2. **Understand general US geography**: Washington state is located in the northwestern
      part of the United States, while Texas is located in the southwestern part.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Frio County is in Texas (TX), and Dooly County
      is in Georgia (GA).

      2. **Understand general geography**: Texas is located in the southern part of
      the United States, while Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the
      country.

      3. **Consider the longitude**: The United States is wider from east to west,
      so counties in Georgia are generally east of counties in Texas.

      4. **Specific county locations**: Without needing exact longitudes, knowing
      that Frio County, TX, is in the southern part of the United States and Dooly
      County, GA, is in the southeastern part helps establish their east-west relationship.

      5. **Conclusion based on east-west positioning**: Given that Georgia is east
      of Texas, Dooly County, GA, is east of Frio County, TX. Therefore, Frio County,
      TX, is not east of Dooly County, GA.


      The final answer is: **NO**'

      4. **Conclusion**: Given the west-east positioning of Idaho and Texas, Shoshone

      2. **Understand general US geography**: Texas is in the southern part of the
      United States, while North Carolina is in the southeastern part.

      3. **Consider the east-west positions**: Texas is generally west of North Carolina
      because the United States is wider from east to west, and the Atlantic Ocean
      borders the eastern edge of the country.

      4. **Specific county locations**: Without needing exact longitudes, knowing

      2. **Understand general US geography**: South Dakota is located in the northern
      part of the United States, while Tennessee is in the southeastern part.

      3. **Consider the longitudinal positions**: South Dakota is generally west of

      Ocean borders the western edge of the country, with the Atlantic Ocean to the
      east.

      4. **Specific county locations**: Without needing exact longitudes, knowing
      that Brookings County, SD, is in the northern part of the country and Knox County,
      TN, is in the southeastern part helps establish their east-west relationship.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Fall River County is in South Dakota (SD), and
      Hickman County is in Tennessee (TN).

      2. **Understand the general geography of the United States**: South Dakota is
      located in the northern part of the country, while Tennessee is in the southeast.

      3. **Consider the specific counties**: Without specific knowledge of each county''s
      exact location within its state, we might think we need detailed maps. However,
      knowing that South Dakota is in the north and Tennessee is in the southeast
      gives us a strong hint.

      4. **Apply the east-west rule**: Since Tennessee is generally east of South
      Dakota, any county in Tennessee, including Hickman County, would be east of
      any county in South Dakota, including Fall River County.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Slope County is located in North Dakota (ND),

      2. **Understand the general geography of the United States**: North Dakota is
      located in the northern part of the United States, while Tennessee is located

      3. **Consider the specific counties**: Without specific knowledge of each county''s

      knowing that North Dakota is generally north and Tennessee is generally southeast
      gives us a strong hint.

      2. **Understand the general geography**: Washington is located in the northwestern
      part of the United States, while Kansas is in the central part.

      3. **Consider the longitudinal positions**: Since the United States is wider
      from east to west, and the Pacific Ocean borders the western edge of the country,
      Washington is generally west of Kansas.

      4. **Specific county locations**: Without needing exact longitudes, knowing
      that Kittitas County, WA, is on the west coast and Jewell County, KS, is more
      towards the central part of the country helps establish their east-west relationship.

      5. **Conclusion based on east-west positioning**: Given that Washington is west

      east of Val Verde County, TX, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Plumas County is in California (CA) and Val Verde
      County is in Texas (TX).

      2. **Understand the general geography**: California is located on the West Coast
      of the United States, while Texas is in the southern part of the country.

      3. **Consider the longitude**: The West Coast of the United States is generally
      west of the southern part of the country. This means that Plumas County, CA,
      is likely to be west of Val Verde County, TX.

      4. **Specific county locations**: Without needing exact longitudes, knowing
      that Plumas County, CA, is on the West Coast and Val Verde County, TX, is more
      towards the central part of the southern United States helps establish their
      east-west relationship.

      east of Caswell County, NC, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Scurry County is located in the state of Texas
      (TX), and Caswell County is located in the state of North Carolina (NC).

      2. **Understand the general geography of the United States**: Texas is located
      in the southwestern part of the United States, while North Carolina is located
      in the southeastern part.

      3. **Consider the specific counties**: Without specific knowledge of each county''s
      exact location within its state, we might think we need detailed maps. However,
      knowing that Texas is southwest of North Carolina gives us a strong hint.

      4. **Apply the west-east rule**: Since Texas is southwest of North Carolina,
      any county in Texas, including Scurry County, would be west of any county in
      North Carolina, including Caswell County.
