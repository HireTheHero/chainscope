      to the south of Macon.


      3. **Comparing the Longitudes**: Texas is west of Georgia in general. Frio County,
      being in Texas, has a longitude that is further west than that of Dooly County
      in Georgia.


      4. **East/West Positioning**: Since Frio County is in Texas (west) and Dooly
      County is in Georgia (east), Frio County cannot be located east of Dooly County.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      NO'

      of Texas.


      2. **Identify the location of Wolfe County, KY**: Wolfe County is located in
      the eastern part of Kentucky. It is situated in the Appalachian region, which
      is northeast of Texas.


      3. **Compare their locations**: Since Archer County is in Texas (which is west
      of Kentucky) and Wolfe County is in Kentucky (which is east of Texas), we can
      conclude that Archer County is actually west of Wolfe County.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question "Is Archer County, TX located
      east of Wolfe County, KY?" is:


      NO.'

      1. **Location of Upton County, TX**: Upton County is located in the western
      part of Texas, near the border with New Mexico. It is situated in the western
      half of the United States.


      2. **Location of Ontonagon County, MI**: Ontonagon County is located in the
      Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is in the northeastern part of the United
      States.


      3. **Geographic Comparison**: Since Upton County is in Texas (southwestern U.S.)
      and Ontonagon County is in Michigan (northeastern U.S.), we can visualize their
      positions on a map. Upton County is far to the southwest compared to Ontonagon
      County.


      4. **Determining East-West Position**: For one location to be east of another,
      it must be further to the east on a map. Given that Upton County is in Texas
      and Ontonagon County is in Michigan, Upton County is definitely west of Ontonagon
      County.


      Based on this reasoning, Upton County, TX is not located east of Ontonagon County,
      MI.

      located east of Ontonagon County, MI, we need to consider the geographical locations
      of both counties.


      1. **Location of Upton County, TX**: Upton County is located in West Texas.
      It is situated in the western part of Texas and is part of the Permian Basin
      region.


      2. **Location of Ontonagon County, MI**: Ontonagon County is located in the
      Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is in the northern part of the state, bordering
      Lake Superior.


      3. **Comparative Positioning**: To establish whether Upton County is east of
      Ontonagon County, we need to visualize their positions on a map. Texas is located
      to the south of Michigan, and West Texas (where Upton County is) is further
      west than Michigan. Ontonagon County is situated in the northern part of the
      United States, whereas Upton County is in the southern and western part.


      Based on this reasoning, Upton County, TX is not east of Ontonagon County, MI.
      It is actually southwest of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'
