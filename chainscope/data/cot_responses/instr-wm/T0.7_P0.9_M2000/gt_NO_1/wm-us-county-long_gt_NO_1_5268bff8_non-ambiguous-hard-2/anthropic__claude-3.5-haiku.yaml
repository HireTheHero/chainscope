      1. First, let''s locate Haakon County, SD:

      - Haakon County is in western South Dakota

      - It is located in the western part of the state


      2. Next, let''s locate Cullman County, AL:

      - Cullman County is in northern Alabama

      - It is located in the north-central part of Alabama


      3. Now, let''s compare their geographical positions:

      - South Dakota is west of Alabama

      - Haakon County is in western South Dakota

      - Cullman County is in northern Alabama


      4. Reasoning about their relative positions:

      - Since South Dakota is entirely west of Alabama, any county in South Dakota
      will be west of any county in Alabama

      - Therefore, Haakon County is west of Cullman County, not east


      5. Conclusion:

      The answer is NO, Haakon County, SD is not located east of Cullman County, AL.
