      6.  **Evaluate the "east of" condition:** To be "east of" Wolfe County, KY,
      Archer County, TX would need to be located further east (have a smaller West
      longitude or a positive East longitude). Since Texas is west of Kentucky, Archer

      3.  **Locate Maine:** Maine is a state in the New England region, the northeasternmost
      state in the US, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.

      4.  **Compare the states'' general positions:** Geographically, Maine is significantly
      farther east than Louisiana. Maine is on the Atlantic coast in the far northeast,
      while Louisiana is much further west, closer to the center of the country (though
      still east of the geographic center of the continental US).

      5.  **Consider the specific counties/parishes:** East Baton Rouge Parish is
      in the southeastern part of Louisiana. Sagadahoc County is in the southern coastal
      part of Maine. Even considering their specific locations within their respective
      states, the overall east-west relationship of the states holds true for these
      specific counties/parishes. Maine is much further east than Louisiana.

      6.  **Determine relative position:** Since Maine is east of Louisiana, Sagadahoc
      County, ME is east of East Baton Rouge Parish, LA. Therefore, East Baton Rouge
      Parish, LA is *west* of Sagadahoc County, ME.

      7.  **Answer the question:** The question asks if East Baton Rouge Parish is
      *east* of Sagadahoc County. Our reasoning shows it is *west*.

      2.  **Identify the location of Belknap County, NH:** Belknap County is located
      in the central part of New Hampshire. New Hampshire is a state in the northeastern
      United States (New England).

      3.  **Compare the relative east-west positions of the states:** New Hampshire
      is located significantly further east than Tennessee. The entire state of New
      Hampshire is east of the entire state of Tennessee.

      4.  **Compare the relative east-west positions of the counties:** Since New
      Hampshire is entirely east of Tennessee, any county in New Hampshire (like Belknap
      County) will be east of any county in Tennessee (like Bledsoe County).

      5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, Bledsoe County, TN is located *west* of Belknap
      County, NH.
