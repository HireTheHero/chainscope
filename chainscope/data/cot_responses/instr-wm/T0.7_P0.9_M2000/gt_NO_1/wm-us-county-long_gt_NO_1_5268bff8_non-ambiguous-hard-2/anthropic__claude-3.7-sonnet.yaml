      Galax City, VA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Nueces County is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States.

      - Galax City is in Virginia (VA), which is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their general geographic positions.

      - Texas is located in the southwestern/south-central part of the United States.

      - Virginia is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Locations further east have lower longitude values in the western hemisphere.

      - Virginia is significantly east of Texas.

      - Galax City, VA would be further east (lower longitude) than Nueces County,
      TX.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Galax City, VA is east of Nueces County, TX, then Nueces County cannot
      be east of Galax City.


      NO, Nueces County, TX is not located east of Galax City, VA. Nueces County is
      west of Galax City.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Nueces County is in Texas (TX), located along the Gulf Coast in southern Texas.

      - Galax City is in Virginia (VA), located in the western part of Virginia.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other on a map of the United
      States.

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the US.

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the US.

      - Generally, Virginia is east of Texas.


      Step 3: More specifically, I need to determine if Nueces County (TX) is east
      of Galax City (VA).

      - Since Virginia is entirely east of Texas, and Galax City is in Virginia, while
      Nueces County is in Texas, Nueces County must be west of Galax City, not east.


      NO, Nueces County, TX is not located east of Galax City, VA. It is located west
      of Galax City.'

      - Spokane County is in Washington state (WA), which is in the northwestern United
      States.

      - Runnels County is in Texas (TX), which is in the south-central United States.


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning of these states.

      - Washington state is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Texas is much further east than Washington.


      Step 3: Determine the specific locations within their states.

      - Spokane County is in eastern Washington, near the Idaho border.

      - Runnels County is in central Texas.


      Step 4: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Even though Spokane is in eastern Washington, Washington state as a whole
      is significantly west of Texas.

      - Being in eastern Washington doesn''t place Spokane County far enough east
      to be east of a county in Texas.


      NO, Spokane County, WA is not located east of Runnels County, TX. It is located

      Wythe County, VA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Buffalo County is in Nebraska (NE)

      - Wythe County is in Virginia (VA)


      Step 2: Consider the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Nebraska is in the central part of the United States

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - States on the east coast (like Virginia) are generally east of central states
      (like Nebraska)

      - This means Virginia is east of Nebraska

      - Therefore, Wythe County, VA would be east of Buffalo County, NE


      Step 4: Verify this isn''t an unusual case.

      - There are no geographic anomalies that would place a Nebraska county east
      of a Virginia county

      - The entirety of Nebraska is west of Virginia


      NO, Buffalo County, NE is not located east of Wythe County, VA. It is located
      west of it.'

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both counties.

      - Buffalo County is in Nebraska (NE), which is in the Midwest region of the
      United States.

      - Wythe County is in Virginia (VA), which is on the East Coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Nebraska is significantly west of Virginia in the United States.

      - Virginia is along the Atlantic coast, while Nebraska is in the interior of
      the country.


      Step 3: Since counties are subdivisions within states, they follow the same
      general geographic positioning as their states.

      - Buffalo County must be west of Wythe County because Nebraska is west of Virginia.

      - For Buffalo County to be east of Wythe County would contradict the basic geography
      of the United States.


      NO, Buffalo County, NE is not located east of Wythe County, VA. It is located
      west of it.'

      - Whatcom County is in Washington (WA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Charles Mix County is in South Dakota (SD), which is in the north-central
      United States.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two counties on the US map.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - Cimarron County is in Oklahoma (OK)

      - Haralson County is in Georgia (GA)


      Step 2: Recall the general geographic positions of these states.

      - Oklahoma is located in the south-central United States

      - Georgia is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      - Oklahoma is west of Georgia in the United States

      - States in the southeastern US (like Georgia) are generally east of states
      in the south-central region (like Oklahoma)


      Step 4: Since counties are subdivisions within their respective states, Cimarron
      County must be in Oklahoma, and therefore west of Georgia and any of its counties,
      including Haralson County.


      Step 5: Additionally, Cimarron County is specifically in the Oklahoma panhandle,
      at the westernmost part of Oklahoma, making it even further west relative to
      Georgia.


      NO, Cimarron County, OK is not located east of Haralson County, GA. It is located
      west of Haralson County, GA.'

      - Montana is in the western part of the country.

      - Alabama is in the eastern part of the country.


      Step 3: Since we''re comparing counties within these states, I need to consider
      their positions, but the dominant factor is the states themselves.

      - Any county in Alabama will be east of any county in Montana because Alabama
      as a whole state is east of Montana.

      - Therefore, Elmore County, AL is east of Petroleum County, MT (not the other
      way around).


      Step 4: The question asks if Petroleum County, MT is east of Elmore County,
      AL, which would be the reverse of the actual situation.

      - Michigan is in the northern part of the US, specifically in the Great Lakes
      region

      - Generally, Texas is southwest of Michigan


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations of these counties.

      - Upton County is in Texas

      is in the southwestern United States, while Kentucky is in the eastern part
      of the country.


      Step 3: More specifically, New Mexico borders Arizona to the west, Colorado
      to the north, Oklahoma and Texas to the east. Kentucky is located much further
      east, bordering West Virginia and Virginia to the east, Tennessee to the south,
      Missouri to the west, and Ohio and Indiana to the north.


      Step 4: In terms of longitude, all of New Mexico is west of all of Kentucky.
      Since longitude decreases as you move west across the United States, New Mexico
      has lower longitude values than Kentucky.


      Step 5: Since Eddy County is in New Mexico and Greenup County is in Kentucky,
      Eddy County must be west of Greenup County, not east.


      NO, Eddy County, NM is not located east of Greenup County, KY. It is located

      To determine this, I need to find the approximate longitudes of both counties.


      Step 1: Consider the general locations.

      - Eddy County is in New Mexico (NM), which is in the southwestern United States.

      - Greenup County is in Kentucky (KY), which is in the eastern part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Recall the general geography of the US.

      - New Mexico is significantly west of Kentucky.

      - States in the eastern US (like Kentucky) have much higher (less negative)
      longitude values than southwestern states like New Mexico.


      Step 3: Apply geographical reasoning.

      - Since Eddy County is in New Mexico, it must be west of Greenup County, Kentucky.

      - "East of" would mean Eddy County has a higher longitude value (less negative)
      than Greenup County, which is not the case.

      - States on the eastern seaboard generally follow a north-south alignment.

      - Massachusetts is positioned further east than Georgia on the map.

      - This is because the Atlantic coastline curves, with New England jutting out
      more to the east than the southeastern states.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Massachusetts is positioned further east than Georgia, Bristol County,
      MA would be east of Worth County, GA.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Gregory County is in South Dakota (SD), which is in the Midwest/Great Plains
      region.

      - Terrell County is in Georgia (GA), which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - States in the Midwest/Great Plains (like SD) are west of states in the Southeast
      (like GA).


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions.

      - Since South Dakota is west of Georgia, counties in South Dakota would generally
      be west of counties in Georgia.

      - Gregory County, being in South Dakota, would be west of Terrell County, which
      is in Georgia.

      - This means Gregory County is NOT east of Terrell County.

      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two counties by identifying their locations and comparing their longitudes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - SD = South Dakota (in the northern Great Plains region)

      - GA = Georgia (in the southeastern United States)


      ## Step 2: Consider general geography of the United States

      - South Dakota is in the central part of the US

      - Georgia is in the eastern part of the US

      - Generally, Georgia is east of South Dakota


      ## Step 3: More specific locations

      - Gregory County is in south-central South Dakota

      - Terrell County is in southwestern Georgia


      ## Step 4: Longitude comparison

      - Counties in Georgia, even in the western part of the state, are significantly
      further east than counties in South Dakota

      - Georgia''s western border is well east of South Dakota''s eastern border


      Based on the geographic positions of these states and counties, Gregory County,
      SD is located WEST of Terrell County, GA, not east.
