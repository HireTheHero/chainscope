    32fc52ea-6dd4-400c-8a82-31b1f0c7a393: 'Hayes County, NE is located in the western
      United States. Kankakee County, IL is located in the central United States.
      West is east of central. Therefore, Hayes County, NE is located east of Kankakee
      County, IL.

      The distance between two cities is 100 miles. You can use the distance formula
      to determine the distance. The distance formula is d = r * t where d is the
      distance, r is the rate, and t is the time. You can use the speed formula to
      determine the speed. The speed formula is s = d/t where s is the speed, d is
      the distance, and t is the time.


      Let''s say the distance between the two cities is 100 miles.


      We can use the distance formula to determine the distance:


      d = r * t


      where d is the distance, r is the rate, and t is the time.


      We know the distance is 100 miles. We also know the time it takes to travel
      that distance is 10 hours.


      So we can plug in the values:


      100 = r * 10


      10 = r


      So the rate is 10 miles per hour.


      Now we can use the speed formula to determine the speed:


      s = d/t


      where s is the speed, d is the distance, and t is the time.


      We know the distance is 100 miles. We also know the time it takes to travel
      that distance is 10 hours.


      So we can plug in the values:


      s = 100/10


      s = 10


      So the speed is 10 miles per hour.


      So the rate is 10 miles per hour and the speed is 10 miles per hour.

      I''m assuming you''re talking about a US county.


      The answer is NO.


      If you mean county in the state of Nebraska, then the answer is NO.


      If you mean county in the state of Illinois, then the answer is YES.


      Hope this helps!
