    438ab041-a095-4623-9f0e-860f0cbf06d7: 'To determine whether Bargal is located
      north of Jezzine District, we need to:


      1. Identify where Bargal is located.

      2. Identify where Jezzine District is located.

      3. Compare their relative positions geographically (north/south).


      Step 1: Bargal is a town located in the northeastern part of Somalia, specifically
      in the Bari region, which is part of the autonomous Puntland state.


      Step 2: Jezzine District is located in southern Lebanon. It is part of the South
      Governorate.


      Step 3: Comparing the two locations:

      - Somalia is in the Horn of Africa, and the Bari region (where Bargal is located)
      is in the northeastern part of Somalia, which is near the Gulf of Aden.

      - Lebanon is in the Middle East, situated north of Somalia.


      Therefore, Bargal (in Somalia) is located SOUTH of Jezzine District (in Lebanon).

      locations of both places.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Namakkal district.

      - Namakkal is a district in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

      - Tamil Nadu is located in the southern part of India.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Uri.

      - Uri is a town in the Baramulla district in the union territory of Jammu and
