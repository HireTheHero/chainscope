      of West Bengal, India. West Bengal is situated in the eastern part of India.


      3. **Relative Positioning**: To ascertain which district is further north, we
      compare their latitudinal positions. West Bengal, being in India, is generally
      further north compared to locations in Malaysia. Malaysia is closer to the equator
      than India is.


      Given this analysis, Kluang District, located in southern Malaysia, is indeed
      south of Nadia district in eastern India.

      Next, we consider the relative positions of Malaysia and India:


      - Malaysia is located to the southeast of India, and given that Kluang is in
      southern Malaysia, it is quite far south compared to most regions in India.


      - West Bengal, where Nadia District is located, is in the eastern part of India,

      - **Nadia District** (West Bengal, India) is in the eastern part of South Asia.


      Considering the geographical positions of Malaysia and India, Malaysia is located
