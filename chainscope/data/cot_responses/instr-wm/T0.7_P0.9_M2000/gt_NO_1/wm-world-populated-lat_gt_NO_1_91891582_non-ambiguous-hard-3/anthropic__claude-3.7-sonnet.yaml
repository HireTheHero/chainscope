      El Rodeo is in Escuintla, which is a department (province) in Guatemala, Central
      America. Guatemala is located south of Mexico, at approximately 14-15 degrees

      Guatemala (where El Rodeo, Escuintla is located) is at around 14-15 degrees
      north latitude.

      Brown County, Nebraska is at around 42-43 degrees north latitude.


      Since a higher value of north latitude means a location is further north, and
      42-43 degrees is greater than 14-15 degrees, Brown County, Nebraska is further

      whether San Miguel Petapa is north of Colby, Wisconsin.


      Step 1: Identify the location of San Miguel Petapa.

      San Miguel Petapa is a municipality in Guatemala, Central America. Guatemala
      is located south of Mexico, which puts it in the general latitude range of approximately
      13-17 degrees north.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Colby, Wisconsin.

      Colby is a city in Wisconsin, United States. Wisconsin is in the northern United
      States, with latitudes generally between 42-47 degrees north.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      Guatemala (where San Miguel Petapa is located) is at a much lower latitude (around
      13-17 degrees north) than Wisconsin (around 42-47 degrees north).


      Step 4: Determine relative positions.

      Since San Miguel Petapa is at a lower latitude than Colby, Wisconsin, it is
      located south of Colby, not north of it. (Remember that on a map, north corresponds
      to higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere.)

      Beit Jala is a Palestinian town located in the West Bank, near Bethlehem. It''s

      Step 3: Determine their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      Russia is located in the northern part of Eurasia, while the Palestinian territories
      are in the Middle East. In terms of latitude, Russia is significantly further
      north than the Middle East.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Odintsovsky District (in Russia) is located much further north than Beit
      Jala (in Palestine), Beit Jala cannot be north of Odintsovsky District. Instead,

      Step 1: Let me identify where Kluang District is located.

      Kluang District is a district in Johor state, Malaysia. It is located in the
      central part of Johor, which is at the southern end of Peninsular Malaysia.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Nadia District is located.

      After checking, I don''t find a "Nadia District" in standard geographic references.
      There is a Nadia District (or Nadiya) in West Bengal, India, which is the most
      likely match.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - Kluang District is in Malaysia, which is in Southeast Asia

      - Nadia District is in West Bengal, India, which is in South Asia


      Step 4: Determine north-south relationship.

      Geographically, West Bengal, India (where Nadia District is located) is significantly
      north of Johor, Malaysia (where Kluang District is located). Malaysia is closer
      to the equator than India.


      NO. Kluang District is not located north of Nadia District. It is located south

      Step 1: Let me identify where Murqub District is located.

      Murqub District (Al Murqub) is a district in Libya, in North Africa.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Uden is located.

      Uden is a municipality and city in the Netherlands, in northern Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes to determine which is further north.

      The Netherlands is located much further north (approximately 51-53 degrees North
      latitude) compared to Libya, which is in North Africa (Murqub would be approximately
      32-33 degrees North latitude).


      Step 4: Make the comparison to answer the question.

      Since Uden (in the Netherlands) is at a higher latitude than Murqub District
      (in Libya), Murqub is NOT north of Uden. Rather, Murqub is south of Uden.

      Step 1: Let me identify where Zapotlanejo is located.

      Zapotlanejo is a municipality in the state of Jalisco, Mexico.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Adams County, Colorado is located.

      Adams County is in the U.S. state of Colorado, in the north-central part of

      - Bui is a department in Cameroon, which is a country in Central Africa.

      - Franzensfeste (also known as Fortezza) is a municipality in northern Italy,
      specifically in South Tyrol.


      Step 2: Determine their approximate latitudes.

      - Cameroon is located near the equator in Africa. Bui department is in the Northwest
      Region of Cameroon, approximately between 5-7 degrees North latitude.

      - Franzensfeste is in northern Italy, which is in southern Europe, approximately
      at 46-47 degrees North latitude.

      Ko Kret is an island in the Chao Phraya River in Thailand, specifically in Nonthaburi
      Province, just north of Bangkok.


      Step 2: Let me identify where Nalaikh is located.

      Nalaikh is a district located southeast of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of
