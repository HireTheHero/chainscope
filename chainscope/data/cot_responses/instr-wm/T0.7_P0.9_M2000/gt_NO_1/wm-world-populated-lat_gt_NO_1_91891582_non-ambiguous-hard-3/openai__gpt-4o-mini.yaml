      is located north of Jezzine District, we need to identify the locations of both
      places.


      1. **Locate Jezzine District**: Jezzine District is in Lebanon, located in the
      southern part of the country.


      2. **Locate Bargal**: Bargal is a town located in Somalia, specifically in the
      northeastern part of the country.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Jezzine District is in Lebanon
      and Bargal is in Somalia, they are in completely different countries and regions
      of the world.

      the province of Cuneo.


      Now, we need to look at the relative positions of these two locations:


      - Cape Coast is situated on the west coast of Africa, while Bra is in northern
      Italy, which is significantly north of Cape Coast.

      - When comparing their latitudes, Cape Coast is located around 5 degrees north
      of the equator, while Bra is situated at approximately 44 degrees north latitude.


      Given these facts, we can conclude that Cape Coast is not north of Bra; instead,
      it is significantly south of Bra.
