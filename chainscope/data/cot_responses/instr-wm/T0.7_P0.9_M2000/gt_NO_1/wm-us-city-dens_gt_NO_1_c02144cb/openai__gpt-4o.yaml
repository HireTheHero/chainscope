      NJ. This data is typically available from sources like the U.S. Census Bureau

      mile).


      3. **Compare the population densities**: Once you have the population densities

      Without providing specific numbers, I will illustrate how you would answer based
      on hypothetical findings:


      - If Bothell East, WA has a population density of, say, 4,500 people per square
      mile, and River Edge, NJ has a population density of 6,200 people per square
      mile, then River Edge, NJ is more densely populated.


      - Conversely, if Bothell East, WA has a higher population density than River
      Edge, NJ, then Bothell East is more densely populated.


      In summary, you need specific data to make this determination. Since I don''t
      have real-time data access, I would suggest checking the latest statistics for
      accuracy.


      Based on the typical characteristics of suburban areas around Seattle (Bothell

      density of each area. Population density is typically measured in people per
      square mile or square kilometer.


      **Step 1: Identify the population and area of Terre du Lac, MO.**


      - Terre du Lac, MO is a census-designated place in Missouri. You would need
      to find the most recent population data and its land area to calculate its population
      density.


      **Step 2: Identify the population and area of Lake Wisconsin, WI.**


      - Lake Wisconsin, WI is not a city or town but rather a census-designated area
      around the lake. Similarly, you would need to find the population data and land
      area to calculate its population density.


      **Step 3: Calculate the population density for each location.**


      - Population Density = Population / Land Area


      **Step 4: Compare the population densities.**


      - Once you have the population densities for both places, you can compare them
      to determine which one is more densely populated.


      Unfortunately, without the specific numerical data for these locations, I cannot
      provide the densities directly. However, you can look up the latest census or
      demographic data for both Terre du Lac, MO, and the Lake Wisconsin area to perform
      these calculations.


      Once you have the densities:


      - If the population density of Terre du Lac, MO is greater than that of Lake
      Wisconsin, WI, the answer is YES.

      - If it is less, the answer is NO.


      Based on typical knowledge, census-designated places like Terre du Lac may have
      a higher population density if they are developed or residential compared to
      more rural or recreational areas like Lake Wisconsin. However, without specific
      data, I cannot definitively answer.


      If you can provide data or if the data is available, you could perform the calculations
      to reach a definitive YES or NO answer.'

      **Step 1: Gather data on Greenwich, OH.**

      - Greenwich is a village in Huron County, Ohio.

      - As of the latest census data, Greenwich has a population of approximately
      1,400 people.

      - The total area of Greenwich is about 1.1 square miles.


      **Population density of Greenwich, OH:**

      \[ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{1400}{1.1}
      \approx 1273 \text{ people per square mile} \]


      **Step 2: Gather data on Herculaneum, MO.**

      - Herculaneum is a city in Jefferson County, Missouri.

      - According to the latest available census data, Herculaneum has a population
      of approximately 3,900 people.

      - The total area of Herculaneum is about 4.0 square miles.


      **Population density of Herculaneum, MO:**

      \[ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{3900}{4.0}

      - Greenwich, OH has a population density of approximately 1273 people per square
      mile.

      - Herculaneum, MO has a population density of approximately 975 people per square
      mile.


      Since 1273 (Greenwich) is greater than 975 (Herculaneum), Greenwich, OH is more

      Let''s analyze step by step:


      - **Emigration Canyon, UT**: This is a census-designated place (CDP) in Salt
      Lake County, Utah. According to the most recent data, it has a relatively small
      population and encompasses a larger area, resulting in a low population density.


      - **Gilbert Creek, WV**: This is a smaller community in Mingo County, West Virginia.
      Information on its population and area is less readily available, but it is
      generally less populated and covers a smaller area compared to urban or suburban
      areas.


      Given the typical characteristics of these locations, Emigration Canyon, UT
      is likely to have a lower population density due to its larger area and smaller
      population compared to Gilbert Creek, WV, which is typical for rural areas in
      West Virginia.


      Therefore, without specific numerical data, based on general knowledge of these
      types of locations:

      1. **San Castle, FL**: San Castle is a census-designated place in Florida. It
      is relatively small in both area and population compared to many cities. It
      is primarily a residential community and does not have a high population density.


      2. **San Gabriel, CA**: San Gabriel is a city in Los Angeles County, California.

      population and a relatively small area, contributing to a higher population
      density.


      Given these general characteristics, San Gabriel, CA is likely to have a higher
      population density than San Castle, FL, due to its urban setting and larger
      population within a limited area.

    fed3a35a-3246-4c8d-9106-5a3b64719255: 'To determine whether West Wareham, MA is
      more densely populated than Phillips, WI, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the populations and land areas of both locations**: We need to
      find the population and land area for West Wareham, MA, and Phillips, WI.


      2. **Calculate the population density for each location**: Population density
      is calculated as the population divided by the land area (usually in square
      miles).


      3. **Compare the population densities**: Once we have the population densities,
      we can compare them to see which location is more densely populated.


      Let''s look at the data available:


      - **West Wareham, MA**: According to the most recent data, West Wareham is a
      census-designated place (CDP) in Massachusetts. As of the 2020 census, the population
      was approximately 2,064, with a land area of about 4.7 square miles. This gives
      a population density of approximately 439.1 people per square mile.


      - **Phillips, WI**: Phillips is a city in Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census,
      the population was approximately 1,478, with a land area of about 3.4 square
      miles. This results in a population density of approximately 434.1 people per
      square mile.


      Now, comparing the population densities:

      - West Wareham, MA: ~439.1 people/sq mi

      - Phillips, WI: ~434.1 people/sq mi


      Since 439.1 is greater than 434.1, West Wareham, MA is more densely populated
      than Phillips, WI.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
