      \]


      ### Step 1: Find Dunellen, NJ''s Population Density

      - **Population**: Approximately 7,200 (as of recent estimates)

      \ and land area.\n\n2. **Petaluma Center, CA**:  \n   - Petaluma is a city in\
      \ Sonoma County, California.\n   - The population of Petaluma is around 60,000.\n\
      \   - The city's area is approximately 14.5 square miles.\n   - This gives a\
      \ population density of about **4,100 people per square mile**.\n\n3. **Basehor,\

      ### Step 1: Find Population and Area

      - **Pittsford, MI**: Pittsford is a small unincorporated community in Hillsdale
      County, Michigan. The township of Pittsford has a low population and a large
      rural land area.

      - **South Brooksville, FL**: South Brooksville is a census-designated place
      (CDP) in Hernando County, Florida. It has a small population but covers a relatively
      small area.


      ### Step 2: Consider Population Density Formula

      Population density = Population / Land Area


      - South Brooksville, FL, being a CDP, typically has a more concentrated population
      than a rural township like Pittsford, MI.

      - Pittsford, MI, being in a rural region, is likely to have a lower population
      density.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Likely Population Densities
