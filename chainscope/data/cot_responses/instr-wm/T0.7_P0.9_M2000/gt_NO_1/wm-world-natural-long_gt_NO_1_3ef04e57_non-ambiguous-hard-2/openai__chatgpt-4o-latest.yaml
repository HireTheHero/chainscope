      - Specifically, it is in the KwaZulu-Natal province, near the northeastern coast
      of South Africa, close to the Indian Ocean.

      - This puts it in the southeastern part of the African continent.

      - They are situated in the northern part of North Korea, running roughly north-south.

      - North Korea is in East Asia, east of China and west of Japan.


      3. Comparing their positions:

      - South Africa (where Lake Sibhayi is) is in the Southern Hemisphere and lies
      much farther west than East Asia.
