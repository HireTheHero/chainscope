      the geographical locations of both Gravelly Lake and the Bay of Islands in Newfoundland
      and Labrador.


      1. **Identify the location of the Bay of Islands:** The Bay of Islands is located
      on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland, in the Canadian province of
      Newfoundland and Labrador.


      2. **Identify the location of Gravelly Lake:** Gravelly Lake is located in Washington
      State, USA.


      3. **Determine the relative position of Gravelly Lake to the Bay of Islands:**
      Since Washington State is on the west coast of the United States, and the Bay
      of Islands is on the west coast of Newfoundland, Gravelly Lake is significantly
      west of the Bay of Islands.

      However, no prominent Gravelly Lake is listed specifically in Newfoundland and
      Labrador.


      2. **Identify the location of the Bay of Islands**: The Bay of Islands is located
      on the west coast of Newfoundland, which is part of the Canadian province of
      Newfoundland and Labrador.


      3. **Determine relative positions**: The Bay of Islands, being on the west coast

      is on the west coast of the United States and Ontario is in central Canada,
      both locations of Gravelly Lake (Washington and Ontario) are west of the Bay
      of Islands.

      in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It is known for its scenic
      beauty and is situated near the city of Corner Brook.


      2. **Gravelly Lake**: There are multiple lakes named Gravelly Lake, but we need
      to focus on the one relevant to the context of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.


      3. **Geographical Orientation**: For Gravelly Lake to be east of the Bay of

      and Labrador, Canada.


      2. Identify the location of Gravelly Lake: There are multiple places named Gravelly
      Lake, but to answer this question accurately, we need to ensure we are considering
      a Gravelly Lake that is relevant to the region. If there is a specific Gravelly
      Lake in Newfoundland and Labrador, it should be identified.


      3. Compare the relative positions: Assuming we identify a Gravelly Lake in Newfoundland
