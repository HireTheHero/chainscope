      Step 1: Determine the location of Umm al Binni lake.

      Umm al Binni lake is located in southeastern Iraq, in the Middle East.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Lake Ballard.

      Lake Ballard is located in Western Australia, Australia.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a global map.

      Iraq is in the Middle East, which is west of Australia on a world map. Since
      Umm al Binni lake is in Iraq, and Lake Ballard is in Australia, Umm al Binni

      the relative locations of Little Blue Run Lake and Mount Pilatus.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Little Blue Run Lake.

      Little Blue Run Lake is a man-made reservoir located on the border between Pennsylvania
      and West Virginia in the United States, in the eastern part of North America.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Pilatus (mountain).

      Mount Pilatus is a mountain in Switzerland, located near Lucerne in central
      Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - The United States is located in the Western Hemisphere, with Pennsylvania/West
      Virginia roughly between 75-80 degrees west longitude.

      - Switzerland is in Europe, with Mount Pilatus at approximately 8 degrees east
      longitude.


      Step 4: Determine east/west relationship.

      When comparing global east-west positions, locations with eastern longitudes
      (like Switzerland) are east of locations with western longitudes (like the eastern
      United States). Therefore, Little Blue Run Lake (in North America) is west of
      Mount Pilatus (in Europe).

      Little Blue Run Lake is a man-made reservoir located on the border between Pennsylvania
      and West Virginia in the eastern United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Pilatus mountain.

      Mount Pilatus is a mountain in Switzerland, located near Lucerne in central
      Switzerland.


      Step 3: Compare their positions globally.

      Switzerland is in central Europe, while Pennsylvania/West Virginia are in the
      eastern United States. When considering global east-west positioning, locations
      in the eastern United States are west of locations in Europe.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Little Blue Run Lake is in the eastern United States, and Pilatus mountain
      is in Switzerland (Europe), the lake is located to the west of the mountain,
      not to the east.

      determine the relative locations of the Gulf of Oman and Mount Apo.


      Step 1: Identify the location of the Gulf of Oman.

      The Gulf of Oman is a gulf that connects the Arabian Sea with the Strait of
      Hormuz, which then leads to the Persian Gulf. It''s located between Iran and
      Oman in the Middle East, which is in western Asia.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Mount Apo.

      Mount Apo is the highest mountain in the Philippines. The Philippines is an
      island country in Southeast Asia, located in the western Pacific Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      The Middle East (where the Gulf of Oman is) is to the west of Southeast Asia
      (where the Philippines and Mount Apo are). On a world map, the Philippines is
      further east than the Gulf of Oman.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Mount Apo in the Philippines is located further east than the Gulf of
      Oman, the Gulf of Oman cannot be east of Mount Apo. Rather, it is west of Mount
      Apo.

      in KwaZulu-Natal province. It''s South Africa''s largest freshwater lake and
      is situated near the Indian Ocean coast.


      Step 2: Identify where the Rangrim Mountains are located.

      The Rangrim Mountains are a mountain range located in North Korea, in East Asia.


      Step 3: Compare the locations to determine their relative positions.

      South Africa is in the southern part of Africa, while North Korea is in East
      Asia. These locations are on completely different continents.


      Step 4: Determine east-west positioning.

      When looking at a world map, East Asia (where the Rangrim Mountains are) is
      significantly east of Africa (where Lake Sibhayi is). Therefore, Lake Sibhayi
      is west of the Rangrim Mountains, not east.

      Step 1: Let me identify where the Central Oregon Coast Range is located.

      The Central Oregon Coast Range is a mountain range in western Oregon, United

      Looking at a global map, Oregon is on the west coast of North America, while
      Greenland is in the northeastern part of North America. Moving from west to
      east across North America, we would go from Oregon toward Greenland, not the
      other way around.

      NO, the Central Oregon Coast Range is not located east of Sermilik. It is located

      their positions on a global scale. Romania is in Eastern Europe, while Mona
      Passage is in the Caribbean. On a world map, Eastern Europe is much further
      east than the Caribbean. The Caribbean (including Mona Passage) is in the western
      hemisphere, while Romania (including Retezat Mountains) is in the eastern hemisphere.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Mona Passage is in the western hemisphere and the Retezat Mountains are
      in the eastern hemisphere, Mona Passage cannot be east of the Retezat Mountains.
      In fact, it''s west of them.

      Step 1: I need to identify the locations of both lakes.

      - Chip Lake is in Alberta, Canada.

      - Manistique Lake is not specified, but I know it''s located in Michigan''s
      Upper Peninsula in the United States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Alberta is in western Canada.

      - Michigan is in the eastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Geographically, Michigan (where Manistique Lake is) is significantly east
      of Alberta (where Chip Lake is).

      - Therefore, Chip Lake in Alberta would be west of Manistique Lake, not east
      of it.

      in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, in northeastern Africa.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      Switzerland is in Europe, which is northwest of Africa. Ethiopia is in eastern
      Africa.

      On a world map, Switzerland (containing the Glarus Alps) is significantly west
      of Ethiopia (containing Lake Afrera).


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since the Glarus Alps are in Switzerland (Europe) and Lake Afrera is in Ethiopia
      (eastern Africa), the Glarus Alps are located to the west of Lake Afrera, not
      to the east.

      Step 1: Identify the location of Glarus Alps.

      The Glarus Alps are a mountain range located in Switzerland, in central Europe.


      Step 2: Identify the location of Lake Afrera.

      Lake Afrera (also known as Lake Afdera) is a salt lake located in the Afar Region

      Switzerland is in Europe, which is generally north and west of Africa. Ethiopia
      is in the eastern part of Africa. On a global map, Ethiopia (where Lake Afrera
      is) is actually east of Switzerland (where the Glarus Alps are).


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since Lake Afrera in Ethiopia is east of the Glarus Alps in Switzerland, the
      Glarus Alps cannot be east of Lake Afrera. The Glarus Alps are west of Lake
      Afrera.
