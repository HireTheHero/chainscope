      3. Compare these two heights.


      Step 1: Mount Kilimanjaro''s height

      Mount Kilimanjaro stands at an elevation of approximately 5,895 meters (or 19,341
      feet) above sea level.


      Step 2: Mount Denali''s height

      Mount Denali (formerly known as Mount McKinley) stands at an elevation of approximately
      6,190 meters (or 20,310 feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Compare the heights

      Mount Denali is taller than Mount Kilimanjaro because 6,190 meters > 5,895 meters.

      Step 1: Find the elevation of Mount Whitney.

      Mount Whitney is the highest peak in the contiguous United States, located in
      California. Its elevation is approximately 14,505 feet (4,421 meters) above
      sea level.


      Step 2: Find the elevation of The Matterhorn.

      The Matterhorn is a famous mountain located in the Alps, near Zermatt, Switzerland.
      Its elevation is approximately 14,692 feet (4,478 meters) above sea level.


      Step 3: Compare the two elevations.

      Mount Whitney''s elevation (14,505 feet) is less than The Matterhorn''s elevation
