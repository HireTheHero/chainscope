      Now, let''s compare the two heights:


      4,478 meters (Matterhorn) is less than 4,810 meters (Mont Blanc).

      down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Mount Denali is located in North America, specifically
      in Alaska, USA. Mount Kangchenjunga is located in the Himalayas, in Nepal and
      India.

      2. **Compare the mountains'' locations**: Since Mount Denali is in North America
      and Mount Kangchenjunga is in the Himalayas, it''s clear that Mount Kangchenjunga
      is much higher in elevation than Mount Denali, simply because the Himalayas
      are a much higher mountain range than the North American mountain ranges.

      3. **Consider the elevations**: Mount Denali, formerly known as Mount McKinley,
      is the highest peak in North America, with an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190
      meters). Mount Kangchenjunga, on the other hand, is the third-highest peak in
      the world, with an elevation of 28,169 feet (8,586 meters).

      4. **Make the comparison**: Given that Mount Kangchenjunga is significantly
      taller than Mount Denali, it''s clear that Mount Kangchenjunga is not lower
      than Mount Denali.
