      Mount Kilimanjaro''s peak, known as Uhuru Peak, reaches an elevation of approximately
      5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level.


      Step 2: Determine the elevation of Mount Denali.

      Mount Denali, formerly known as Mount McKinley, has a peak that reaches an elevation
      of approximately 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Compare the elevations.

      Mount Denali is higher at 6,190 meters compared to Mount Kilimanjaro''s 5,895

      (19,341 feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Compare the two elevations.

      - Mount Elbrus: 5,642 meters

      - Mount Kilimanjaro: 5,895 meters


      Since 5,642 meters (Elbrus) is less than 5,895 meters (Kilimanjaro), Mount Elbrus
      is indeed lower than Mount Kilimanjaro.

      Step 1: Identify the elevation of Mount Elbrus.

      Mount Elbrus is located in Russia and is known as the highest mountain in Europe.
      Its elevation is approximately 5,642 meters (18,510 feet) above sea level.

      - Mount Whitney: 14,505 feet (4,421 meters)

      - The Matterhorn: 14,692 feet (4,478 meters)


      Since 14,505 feet is less than 14,692 feet, Mount Whitney is indeed lower than
      The Matterhorn.


      Answer: NO (Mount Whitney is not lower than The Matterhorn; it is actually lower.)'
