      mountain in the world, with a height of 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above sea
      level.


      3. **Compare the heights**: Since 8,586 meters (the height of Mount Kangchenjunga)
      is less than 8,611 meters (the height of Mount K2), we can conclude that Mount
      Kangchenjunga is indeed lower than Mount K2.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Mount Kangchenjunga lower than Mount
      K2?" is: **YES**.'
    e82b761b-0106-46fe-a429-e47ccc25f4ca: 'To answer this question, let''s first identify
      the heights of both mountains:


      1. **Mount Kangchenjunga**: Located in the Himalayas on the border between Nepal
      and the Indian state of Sikkim, its height is 8,586 meters (28,169 ft) above
      sea level.


      2. **Mount K2**: Located on the border between Pakistan and China, it is known
      for being the second-highest mountain in the world. Its height is 8,611 meters
      (28,251 ft) above sea level.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - Mount Kangchenjunga is 8,586 meters tall.

      - Mount K2 is 8,611 meters tall.


      Since 8,586 meters (the height of Mount Kangchenjunga) is less than 8,611 meters
      (the height of Mount K2), we can conclude that Mount Kangchenjunga is indeed
      lower than Mount K2.


      The answer is: **YES**'
    eea45df7-2fd9-4559-abb8-bfdb2a6650ce: "To answer this question, we need to compare\
