      than Mount Denali, we need to compare their elevations.


      Step 1: Find the elevation of Mount Kilimanjaro.

      Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania and has an elevation of 5,895 meters
      (19,341 feet) above sea level.


      Step 2: Find the elevation of Mount Denali.

      Mount Denali, formerly known as Mount McKinley, is located in Alaska, United
      States. It has an elevation of 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Compare the elevations.

      Mount Kilimanjaro: 5,895 meters (19,341 feet)

      Mount Denali: 6,190 meters (20,310 feet)


      Since Mount Denali has a higher elevation than Mount Kilimanjaro, we can conclude
      that Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed lower than Mount Denali.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Mount Kilimanjaro lower than Mount
      Denali?" is:


      YES.'

      contiguous United States. Its elevation is 14,505 feet (4,421 meters) above
      sea level.


      Step 2: Find the elevation of The Matterhorn.

      The Matterhorn is a famous mountain located in the Alps on the border between
      Switzerland and Italy. Its elevation is 14,692 feet (4,478 meters) above sea
      level.


      Step 3: Compare the elevations of Mount Whitney and The Matterhorn.

      Mount Whitney: 14,505 feet (4,421 meters)

      The Matterhorn: 14,692 feet (4,478 meters)


      The Matterhorn is 187 feet (57 meters) higher than Mount Whitney.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Mount Whitney lower than The Matterhorn?"
      is:


      YES'
