      follow these steps:


      1. Identify the heights of both mountains.

      2. Compare their elevations.


      Step 1: Identifying the Heights

      - Mount Kilimanjaro has an elevation of 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea
      level.

      - Mount Denali (previously known as Mount McKinley), the highest peak in North
      America, stands at 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level.


      Step 2: Comparing Their Elevations

      - Since 5,895 meters (Mount Kilimanjaro) is less than 6,190 meters (Mount Denali),
      it follows that Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed lower than Mount Denali.
