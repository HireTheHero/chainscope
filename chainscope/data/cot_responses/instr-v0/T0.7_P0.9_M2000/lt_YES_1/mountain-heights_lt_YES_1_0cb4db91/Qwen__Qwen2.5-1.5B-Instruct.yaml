      1. **Mount Kangchenjunga**: This mountain is located in the Mahabharat Range
      of the Himalayas, situated between Nepal and India. Its elevation is approximately
      8,586 meters (28,169 feet) above sea level.


      2. **Mount K2**: Known as the "God''s Peak," this mountain is also part of the
      Himalayan range but is slightly further west, near Pakistan. The summit elevation
      of Mount K2 is about 8,611 meters (28,251 feet).


      By comparing these two values:

      - Mount Kangchenjunga: 8,586 meters

      - Mount K2: 8,611 meters
