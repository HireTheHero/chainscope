      Both the Lincoln Tunnel and the Holland Tunnel are vehicular tunnels connecting
      New Jersey to New York City under the Hudson River.


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

      The Lincoln Tunnel consists of three tubes, with a total length of approximately
      1.5 miles (2.4 km).


      Step 3: Determine the length of the Holland Tunnel.

      The Holland Tunnel is a single-tube tunnel with a total length of approximately
      1.6 miles (2.6 km).


      Step 4: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      The Holland Tunnel (1.6 miles) is slightly longer than the Lincoln Tunnel (1.5

      Tunnel is shorter than the Seikan Tunnel, let''s follow these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the Chunnel Service Tunnel and its length.

      The Chunnel Service Tunnel is a part of the Channel Tunnel, also known as the
      Chunnel, which connects Folkestone, England, to Coquelles, France, beneath the
      English Channel. The total length of the Channel Tunnel is approximately 50.45

      Step 2: Identify the Seikan Tunnel and its length.

      The Seikan Tunnel is a railway tunnel in Japan that connects the islands of
      Honshu and Hokkaido beneath the Tsugaru Strait. It is approximately 53.85 km
      (33.46 miles) long, making it the longest underwater tunnel in the world.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the Chunnel Service Tunnel and the Seikan Tunnel.

      The Chunnel Service Tunnel is part of the Channel Tunnel system, which has a
      total length of 50.45 km (31.35 miles). The Seikan Tunnel, on the other hand,
      is 53.85 km (33.46 miles) long. Therefore, the Seikan Tunnel is longer than

      reason step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the Chunnel Service Tunnel

      - The Chunnel, also known as the Channel Tunnel, is a 50.45 km (31.35 miles)
      rail tunnel linking Folkestone, Kent, in England, with Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais,

      Step 3: Compare the lengths

      - The Chunnel''s total length is 50.45 km (31.35 miles), which includes the
      two rail tunnels and the service tunnel.

      - The Seikan Tunnel''s total length is 53.85 km (33.46 miles).

      - The Chunnel Service Tunnel is a part of the total Chunnel length and is therefore
      shorter than the total Chunnel length.


      Step 4: Conclude

      - Since the total length of the Chunnel is shorter than the Seikan Tunnel, and
      the Chunnel Service Tunnel is a part of the Chunnel, it can be concluded that
      the Chunnel Service Tunnel is indeed shorter than the Seikan Tunnel.

      Tunnel is shorter than the Lincoln Tunnel, let''s break it down step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the location of each tunnel.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is located in Sydney, Australia, connecting the
      northern and southern shores of Sydney Harbour.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is located in New York City, USA, connecting Midtown Manhattan
      and Weehawken, New Jersey.


      Step 2: Find the length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is approximately 2.3 kilometers (1.4 miles) long.


      Step 3: Find the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel consists of three tubes, each approximately 2.4 kilometers
      (1.5 miles) long.


      Step 4: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is approximately 2.3 kilometers (1.4 miles) long.

      - Each tube of the Lincoln Tunnel is approximately 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles)
