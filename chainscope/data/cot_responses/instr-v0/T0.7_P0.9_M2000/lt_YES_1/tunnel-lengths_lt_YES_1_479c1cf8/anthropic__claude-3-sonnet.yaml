      that runs under the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains. According to
      various sources, the length of each bore of the Eisenhower Tunnel is approximately
      1.7 miles (2.7 km).


      Step 2: Find the length of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line.

      The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a bridge-tunnel crossing Tokyo Bay in Japan. It consists
      of a 9.6-mile (15.4 km) long bridge portion and a 3.8-mile (6.1 km) long tunnel
      portion, making the total length of the Aqua-Line approximately 13.4 miles (21.5
      km).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      The Eisenhower Tunnel is 1.7 miles (2.7 km) long for each bore, while the Tokyo
      Bay Aqua-Line is 13.4 miles (21.5 km) long in total.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO, the Eisenhower Tunnel is not shorter than the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line.'
