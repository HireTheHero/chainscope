      2. The Lincoln Tunnel is a tunnel in New York City, USA, and its length is approximately
      1.9 km (1.2 miles).

      3. To determine which tunnel is shorter, I need to compare the lengths of the
      two tunnels.

      4. Since 1.8 km is less than 1.9 km, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is shorter than
      the Lincoln Tunnel.
