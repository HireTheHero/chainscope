      \ for northbound traffic and one for southbound traffic. Each tube is approximately\
      \ 57,129 meters long.\n\n3. **Comparison**: Comparing the two lengths:\n   -\
      \ Mont Blanc Tunnel: 10,795 meters\n   - St. Gotthard Road Tunnel: 57,129 meters\n\
      \nThe St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is significantly longer than the Mont Blanc Tunnel.\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is: **YES**."

      \ shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, let's break it down step by step:\n\
      \n1. **Identify the lengths of each tunnel:**\n   - The Mont Blanc Tunnel is\
      \ approximately 10.75 kilometers (6.68 miles) long.\n   - The St. Gotthard Road\
      \ Tunnel is approximately 15.49 kilometers (9.62 miles) long.\n\n2. **Compare\
      \ the lengths:**\n   - Mont Blanc Tunnel: 10.75 km\n   - St. Gotthard Road Tunnel:\
      \ 15.49 km\n\n3. **Determine which is longer:**\n   - Since 10.75 km is less\
      \ than 15.49 km, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is shorter than the St. Gotthard Road\
      \ Tunnel.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: YES"

      \   - Both tunnels have the same length of 10.75 kilometers (6.68 miles).\n\n\
      3. **Determine the answer:**\n   - Since both tunnels are of equal length, the\
