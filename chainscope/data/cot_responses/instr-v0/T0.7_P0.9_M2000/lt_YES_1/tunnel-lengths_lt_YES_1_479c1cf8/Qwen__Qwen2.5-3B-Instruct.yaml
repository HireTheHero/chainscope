      ### Step 2: Compare the Lengths


      Now, let''s compare the lengths:

      - The Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is 4,250 feet long.

      - The Queens-Midtown Tunnel is 1,760 feet long.


      ### Step 3: Determine Which is Shorter


      Since 4,250 feet is greater than 1,760 feet, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel is shorter
      than the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel.


      ### Conclusion


      The answer to the question "Is the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel shorter than the
      Queens-Midtown Tunnel?" is **NO**.'

      Tunnel is shorter than the Seikan Tunnel, we need to compare their lengths.
      Let''s break this down into steps:


      ### Step 1: Identify the length of the Chunnel Service Tunnel

      - The Chunnel (Channel Tunnel) is the tunnel under the English Channel connecting
      England and France. It primarily consists of two railway tunnels, each about
      50.4 km long.

      - There is also a service tunnel that runs alongside these main tunnels. The
      service tunnel is used for maintenance purposes and is approximately 2.7 km
      long.


      ### Step 2: Identify the length of the Seikan Tunnel

      - The Seikan Tunnel is located in Japan and connects Aomori Prefecture to Hokkaido.
      This is the longest rail tunnel in the world.

      - The Seikan Tunnel is 234 km long, including both the main tunnel and its associated
      maintenance passages.


      ### Step 3: Compare the lengths

      - Length of the Chunnel Service Tunnel: Approximately 2.7 km

      - Length of the Seikan Tunnel: 234 km


      ### Step 4: Determine if one is shorter than the other

      - Comparing 2.7 km (Chunnel Service Tunnel) to 234 km (Seikan Tunnel), it is
      clear that the 2.7 km is significantly shorter than the 234 km.


      ### Conclusion:

      The Chunnel Service Tunnel is indeed shorter than the Seikan Tunnel. Therefore,

      Step 1: Identify the Chunnel Service Tunnel (Channel Tunnel)

      - The Channel Tunnel, also known as the Chunnel, connects England and France
      under the English Channel.

      - It consists of two railway tunnels and one service tunnel.

      - The total length of the Chunnel is approximately 50.4 km (31.3 miles), including

      Chunnel (the Channel Tunnel), but rather a service tunnel used for maintenance
      and ventilation purposes.

      - According to sources, the Chunnel Service Tunnel has a length of approximately

      bridge that connects Shimonoseki on Honshu to Mikuma on Kyushu in Japan. The
      total length of the bridge is approximately 19 km (11.8 miles).


      Step 2: Find the length of the Mont Blanc Tunnel.

      The Mont Blanc Tunnel is a mountain tunnel in the Alps connecting Italy and

      Step 1: Find the length of the Channel Tunnel.

      The Channel Tunnel (also known as the Chunnel) runs from Coquelles, France,
      to Sangatte, Calais, in England, passing under the English Channel. The main
      tunnel has two tracks and is approximately 50.4 km (31.3 miles) long.

      The Seikan Tunnel connects Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan to Hokkaido.
      It is the longest rail tunnel in the world, stretching for about 53.87 km (33.5
      miles).


      Step 3: Compare the two lengths.

      - Length of the Channel Tunnel: ~50.4 km

      - Length of the Seikan Tunnel: ~53.87 km


      Since 50.4 km is less than 53.87 km, the Channel Tunnel is shorter than the
      Seikan Tunnel.

      Step 4: Determine which tunnel is shorter.

      Since 11 kilometers is less than 13.34 kilometers, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is
      shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.


      Final Answer: NO'

      is shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, I need to compare their lengths.


      Step 1: Determine the length of the Mont Blanc Tunnel.

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel (Monte Bianco Tunnel) is a mountain tunnel located in
      the Alps between Italy and France.

      - It has two sections: the main tunnel and a service tunnel.

      - The main section is approximately 11,420 meters long.

      - The total length including the service tunnel is around 16,350 meters.


      Step 2: Determine the length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.

      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel (St. Gotthardtunnel) is also a mountain tunnel
      located in Switzerland.

      - It is one of the longest tunnels in Europe, connecting northern and southern
      Switzerland.

      - The total length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is approximately 13,888 meters.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of both tunnels.

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel''s total length is about 16,350 meters.

      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel''s total length is about 13,888 meters.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the comparison.

      - Since 16,350 meters is greater than 13,888 meters, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is
      longer than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'
    edfaffec-4371-4e9f-8d87-de27d20be8bb: 'To determine whether the Mont Blanc Tunnel
      is shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, we need to compare their lengths.


      Step 1: Recall the length of the Mont Blanc Tunnel.

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel is an underground tunnel under Mount Blanc in the Alps
      between France and Italy.

      - It is approximately 11,427 meters (about 37,486 feet) long.


      Step 2: Recall the length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.

      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is a road tunnel through the St. Gotthard massif
      in the Alps, connecting Switzerland and Italy.

      - It is approximately 57,000 meters (about 35,423 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the two lengths.

      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is significantly longer than the Mont Blanc Tunnel.

      - The difference is around 55,552 meters (about 34,567 miles).


      Conclusion:

      No, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is not shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.
      In fact, it is much shorter.

      shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, I need to compare the lengths of
      both tunnels.


      Step 1: Find the length of the Mont Blanc Tunnel.

      The Mont Blanc Tunnel is a road tunnel that connects Italy and France beneath
      Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco). The tunnel''s length is approximately 11 km (6.8
      miles).


      Step 2: Find the length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.

      The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is located in Switzerland, connecting the cantons
      of Ticino and Uri. It is the longest tunnel in the world by length. The tunnel''s
      length is approximately 57 km (35.4 miles).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is significantly longer than the Mont Blanc Tunnel.
      Specifically, it is 57 km long while the Mont Blanc Tunnel is 11 km long.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is the Mont Blanc Tunnel shorter than
      the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel?" is:

      NO'
