      Step 2: Determine the approximate lengths of both tunnels.


      The Mont Blanc Tunnel is approximately 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles) long. The
      St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is approximately 15.9 kilometers (9.9 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of both tunnels.


      The Mont Blanc Tunnel is 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles) long, while the St. Gotthard
      Road Tunnel is 15.9 kilometers (9.9 miles) long.


      Conclusion: Based on the comparison of the lengths, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is
      shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.


      Answer: NO, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is not shorter than the St. Gotthard Road
      Tunnel.'

    a00b900c-cf8e-4686-97a3-06ea08eff826: 'Step 1: Identify the locations of both
      tunnels

      The Mont Blanc Tunnel is located in the Alps, connecting France and Italy. The
      St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is also located in the Alps, but it connects Switzerland
      and Italy.


      Step 2: Determine the lengths of both tunnels

      The Mont Blanc Tunnel is approximately 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles) long. The
      St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is around 15.4 kilometers (9.6 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths

      Now that we know the lengths of both tunnels, we can compare them. The Mont
      Blanc Tunnel is 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles), while the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel
      is 15.4 kilometers (9.6 miles) long.


      Conclusion: The Mont Blanc Tunnel is shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.
