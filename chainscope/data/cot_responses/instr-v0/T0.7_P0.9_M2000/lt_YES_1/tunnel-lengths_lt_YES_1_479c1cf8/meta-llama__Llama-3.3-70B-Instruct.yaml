      Utah, USA. It was constructed in the 1930s as part of the Zion-Mount Carmel
      Highway. The tunnel is approximately 1.1 miles (1.77 kilometers) long.


      2. **Queens-Midtown Tunnel**: This tunnel is in New York City, connecting the
      borough of Queens to Midtown Manhattan. It was opened in 1940. The Queens-Midtown
      Tunnel is approximately 6,414 feet (1.95 kilometers or 1.22 miles) long.

      the necessary information about the lengths of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel
      and the Simplon Tunnel.


      1. **Identify the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel''s length**: The St. Gotthard Road
      Tunnel is approximately 17 kilometers (10.6 miles) long.


      2. **Identify the Simplon Tunnel''s length**: The Simplon Tunnel, which is a
      railway tunnel, has a length of about 19.8 kilometers (12.3 miles) for the older
      tube and 19.9 kilometers (12.4 miles) for the newer tube. However, it''s essential
      to note that the Simplon Tunnel is primarily a railway tunnel, not a road tunnel.
      For the purpose of comparison with the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, we should consider
      the Simplon Road Tunnel if it exists, or understand that the question might
      be comparing road and rail tunnels indirectly.


      3. **Consideration of the Simplon Road Tunnel**: There isn''t a well-known Simplon
      Road Tunnel that matches the significance of the Simplon Railway Tunnel. The
      Simplon Pass, however, does have a road that crosses it, but it''s not a tunnel
      of the same length as the railway tunnel.


      Given the above considerations, if we are strictly comparing the St. Gotthard
      Road Tunnel to the Simplon Tunnel (which is a railway tunnel), the St. Gotthard
      Road Tunnel is indeed shorter than the Simplon Tunnel.


      **Answer: YES**'
    f0ebc07f-65bb-4883-bb19-006af661df28: 'To answer this question, let''s first identify
      the lengths of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel and the Simplon Tunnel.


      1. **St. Gotthard Road Tunnel**: This tunnel is part of the A2 motorway in Switzerland,
      connecting the cantons of Uri and Ticino. It is approximately 17 kilometers
      (10.6 miles) long.


      2. **Simplon Tunnel**: This is a railway tunnel that connects Switzerland and
      Italy, also in the Swiss Alps. There are actually two Simplon Tunnels: the old
      Simplon Tunnel, which was opened in 1906 and is about 19.8 kilometers (12.3
      miles) long, and the new Simplon Tunnel, which was opened in 1922 and is slightly
      longer.


      Given these lengths:


      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is approximately 17 kilometers long.

      - The Simplon Tunnel (considering both the old and the new) is longer, with
      the old one being about 19.8 kilometers long.


      Therefore, since 17 kilometers (the length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel)
      is less than 19.8 kilometers (the length of the Simplon Tunnel), the answer
      is:


      YES'

      Tunnel, which connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Queens in New York City,
      has a total length. We need to find out what this length is.


      2. **Identify the Length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel**: Similarly, we need
      to find the length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, which spans under the Sydney
      Harbour in Australia.


      3. **Compare the Lengths**: Once we have the lengths of both tunnels, we can
      compare them to determine which one is shorter.


      Now, let''s find the necessary information:

      - The Queens-Midtown Tunnel is approximately 6,414 feet (1,955 meters) long.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is about 2.3 kilometers (1.4 miles or 7,546 feet)
      long.


      Given these lengths, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel is approximately 6,414 feet,
      and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is about 7,546 feet.


      Since 6,414 feet is less than 7,546 feet, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel is indeed
      shorter than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

      the lengths of the Chunnel Service Tunnel and the Seikan Tunnel.


      1. **Identify the Chunnel Service Tunnel**: The Chunnel, also known as the Channel
      Tunnel, connects England and France. It has three tunnels: two for rail traffic
      and a smaller service tunnel in between them for maintenance and emergency access.
      The total length of the Chunnel is approximately 50.45 kilometers (31.35 miles),

      approximately 53.85 kilometers (33.49 miles), making it one of the longest undersea

      \ the lengths of the Mont Blanc Tunnel and the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.\n\n\
      1. **Identify the lengths of the tunnels**: \n   - The Mont Blanc Tunnel connects\
      \ France and Italy, and its length is approximately 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles).\n\
      \   - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, located in Switzerland, has a length of\

      the lengths of the Mont Blanc Tunnel and the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.


      1. **Identify the lengths of the tunnels**: The Mont Blanc Tunnel connects France
      and Italy, and its length is approximately 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles). The
      St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, located in Switzerland, has a length of about 17 kilometers
      (10.6 miles).


      2. **Compare the lengths**: Now, we compare the lengths of the two tunnels to
      determine which one is shorter. The Mont Blanc Tunnel is 11.6 kilometers long,
      and the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is 17 kilometers long.


      3. **Conclusion**: Since 11.6 kilometers is less than 17 kilometers, the Mont
      Blanc Tunnel is indeed shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.

      1. **Identify the Mont Blanc Tunnel''s length**: The Mont Blanc Tunnel connects
      France and Italy under the Mont Blanc mountain. It is approximately 11.6 kilometers
      (7.2 miles) long.


      2. **Identify the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel''s length**: The St. Gotthard Road
      Tunnel is located in Switzerland and is part of the A2 motorway. It is approximately
      17 kilometers (10.6 miles) long.


      3. **Compare the lengths**: Now, we compare the lengths of the two tunnels.
      The Mont Blanc Tunnel is about 11.6 kilometers long, while the St. Gotthard
      Road Tunnel is about 17 kilometers long.


      Given that 11.6 kilometers (the length of the Mont Blanc Tunnel) is less than
      17 kilometers (the length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel), we can conclude
      that the Mont Blanc Tunnel is indeed shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.
