      To do this, we need to know their heights. Unfortunately, I couldn''t find the
      exact heights of Kevin Hart and Bruno Mars online. However, I can suggest some
      possible ways to find their heights:


      * Check their official websites or social media profiles for height information.

      * Look up their height on Wikipedia or other online encyclopedias.

      * Use a reliable online source, such as a celebrity height chart or a news article.


      Assuming I don''t have the exact heights, let''s move on to the next step.


      2. If we can find the heights of Kevin Hart and Bruno Mars, we can compare them
      to determine if Kevin Hart is taller or shorter.


      3. If Kevin Hart is taller than Bruno Mars, we can conclude that Kevin Hart
      is shorter than Bruno Mars. If Kevin Hart is shorter than Bruno Mars, we can
      conclude that Kevin Hart is taller than Bruno Mars.


      4. If Kevin Hart is the same height as Bruno Mars, we can conclude that Kevin
      Hart and Bruno Mars are the same height.


      Now, let''s move on to the final step.


      5. Since we are asked to give a YES or NO answer, we can simply compare the
      heights of Kevin Hart and Bruno Mars and provide a conclusion.


      If we assume that Kevin Hart is shorter than Bruno Mars, the answer is: YES.


      If we assume that Kevin Hart is the same height as Bruno Mars, the answer is:
      NO.


      If we assume that Kevin Hart is taller than Bruno Mars, the answer is: NO.

      2. We know that Scarlett Johansson is a female, and Kevin Hart is a male. This

      5. We can now set up an inequality to represent the situation: h < 6''1" (185.4

      6. Since we don''t know Kevin Hart''s height, we can''t directly compare his

      Kit Harington is taller than Jennifer Lawrence.

      * Kit Harington is a member of the British royal family, and as such, he is
      likely to be of a certain height, which is typically around 6 feet (183 cm).

      * Jennifer Lawrence, on the other hand, is a relatively petite American actress,
      and her height is likely to be around 5 feet (152 cm) or less.

      * In the movie "Game of Thrones", Kit Harington plays the role of Jon Snow,
      a character who is often depicted as being tall and strong, while Jennifer Lawrence
      plays the role of Katniss Everdeen, a character who is often depicted as being
      slender and agile.
