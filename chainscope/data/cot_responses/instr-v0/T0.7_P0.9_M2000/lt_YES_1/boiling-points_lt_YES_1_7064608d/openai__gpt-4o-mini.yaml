      2. **Boiling Point of Nitrogen:** Nitrogen has a boiling point of approximately
      -195.8 degrees Celsius (or about 77.4 Kelvin).


      Now, comparing the two:


      - Since -268.9 degrees Celsius (helium) is lower than -195.8 degrees Celsius
      (nitrogen), it indicates that helium transitions from a liquid to a gas at a
      much lower temperature than nitrogen does.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      YES, helium has a lower boiling point than nitrogen.'
