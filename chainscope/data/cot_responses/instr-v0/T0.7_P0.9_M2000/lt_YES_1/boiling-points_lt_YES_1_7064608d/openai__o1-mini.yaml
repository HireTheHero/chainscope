      \n1. **Understanding Boiling Points**: The boiling point of a substance is the\
      \ temperature at which its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, causing\

      \ approximately **4.2 Kelvin**.\n\n2. **Identify the Boiling Point of Nitrogen:**\n\
      \   - Nitrogen has a significantly higher boiling point compared to helium.\
      \ Its boiling point is around **77.36 Kelvin**.\n\n3. **Compare the Boiling\
      \ Points:**\n   - **4.2 K (Helium)** vs. **77.36 K (Nitrogen)**\n   - Clearly,\
      \ **4.2 K** is lower than **77.36 K**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nYes, helium has a\
      \ lower boiling point than nitrogen."

    cbe476a7-81fd-4fee-b658-19d4bf61ef76: "Sure, let's break it down step by step:\n\
      \n1. **Understand Boiling Points:** The boiling point of a substance is the\
      \ temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a gas. It is influenced by\
      \ factors like intermolecular forces and molecular weight.\n\n2. **Identify\
      \ the Elements:**\n   - **Helium (He):** A noble gas with very weak intermolecular\
      \ forces (primarily London dispersion forces) due to its monoatomic nature.\n\
      \   - **Nitrogen (N\u2082):** A diatomic molecule with slightly stronger intermolecular\
      \ forces (also primarily London dispersion forces) compared to helium because\
      \ of its larger molecular size.\n\n3. **Look Up Standard Boiling Points:**\n\
      \   - **Helium:** Approximately **4.2 Kelvin (K)**\n   - **Nitrogen:** Approximately\
      \ **77 Kelvin (K)**\n\n4. **Compare the Boiling Points:**\n   - **4.2 K (Helium)**\
      \ is lower than **77 K (Nitrogen)**.\n\n**Answer:** YES."
