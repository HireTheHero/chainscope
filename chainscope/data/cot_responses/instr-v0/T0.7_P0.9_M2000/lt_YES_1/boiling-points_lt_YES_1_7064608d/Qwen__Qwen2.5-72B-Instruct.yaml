      \ However, hydrogen bonding in methanol is a much stronger force compared to\
      \ dipole-dipole interactions in acetone.\n\n3. **Boiling Points**:\n   - The\

      F) or 4.22 K.\n   - Nitrogen: The boiling point of nitrogen is approximately\
      \ -195.79\xB0C (-320.42\xB0F) or 77.36 K.\n\nGiven these values, we can see\
      \ that helium has a much lower boiling point than nitrogen.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ answer is **YES**, helium does have a lower boiling point than nitrogen."
