      1. **Understanding Boiling Point:** Boiling point is the temperature at which\
      \ a liquid changes into a gas. \n2. **Intermolecular Forces:**  The strength\
      \ of the forces between atoms or molecules in a substance influences its boiling\
      \ point. Stronger forces require more energy (heat) to break.\n3. **Helium vs.\
      \ Nitrogen:** Helium and nitrogen are both gases at room temperature. Helium\
      \ is much lighter than nitrogen.\n4. **Predicting Boiling Point:** Lighter molecules\
      \ tend to have lower boiling points than heavier molecules. \n\n**Conclusion:**\
      \ Since helium is lighter than nitrogen, it has a lower boiling point. \n\n\n\
      **Answer: YES** \n"
