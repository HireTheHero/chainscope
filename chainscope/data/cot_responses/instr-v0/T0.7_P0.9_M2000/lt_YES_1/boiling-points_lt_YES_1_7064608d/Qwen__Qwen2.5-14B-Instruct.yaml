      \ boiling point than methanol, let's consider the chemical structures and properties\

      COCH\u2083) is an organic compound with a carbonyl group (C=O) in the center,\
      \ flanked by two methyl groups.\n   - Methanol (CH\u2083OH) is also an organic\

      \ can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of the hydroxyl group, which is\
      \ more effective at increasing the boiling point compared to dipole-dipole interactions.\n\
      \n3. **Boiling Points**:\n   - The boiling point of acetone is approximately\

      \ 64.7\xB0C (148.5\xB0F).\n\nGiven these points, methanol has stronger intermolecular\

      \ (when referring to the transition from liquid to gas at standard pressure)\
