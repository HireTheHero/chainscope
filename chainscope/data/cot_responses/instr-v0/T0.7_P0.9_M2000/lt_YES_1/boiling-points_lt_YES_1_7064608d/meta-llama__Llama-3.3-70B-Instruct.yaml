      OH) and ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH) are alcohols, meaning they contain a hydroxyl\
      \ (-OH) group, which is polar. This polarity leads to hydrogen bonding between\

      \ or -109.3\xB0F. However, under pressure, it can be liquefied, and its boiling\
      \ point would be relevant at pressures above its triple point (5.1 atm), but\
      \ at standard atmospheric pressure, it sublimes rather than boils in the traditional\
      \ sense.\n\n4. **Comparison**: Oxygen has a boiling point of -183\xB0C, while\
      \ carbon dioxide sublimes at -78.5\xB0C at standard atmospheric pressure. Since\
      \ carbon dioxide sublimes rather than boils at standard pressure, we're comparing\
      \ the boiling point of oxygen to the sublimation point of carbon dioxide. However,\
      \ for the sake of comparison in terms of changing from a liquid to a gas (or\
      \ in CO\u2082's case, solid to gas at standard pressure), oxygen requires a\
      \ lower temperature to make this phase transition.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given\
      \ that oxygen's boiling point is lower than the temperature at which carbon\
      \ dioxide changes from a solid to a gas at standard atmospheric pressure, we\
      \ can conclude that oxygen indeed has a lower boiling point than the sublimation\
      \ point of carbon dioxide. Since the question seems to be asking about the boiling\
      \ point in a general sense and given the context that carbon dioxide's relevant\
      \ phase transition at standard pressure is sublimation, the comparison leans\
      \ towards the temperatures at which these phase transitions occur.\n\nThe final\
      \ answer is: $\\boxed{YES}$"
