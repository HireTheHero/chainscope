      1. **Atari 2600**: The Atari 2600, originally called the Atari VCS (Video Computer
      System), was released in October 1977.

      2. **Sony Walkman**: The Sony Walkman, the first portable audio cassette player,
      was introduced on July 1, 1979.


      Given these release dates:

      - The Atari 2600 came out in 1977.

      - The Sony Walkman was released in 1979.


      Therefore, the Atari 2600 was indeed released before the Sony Walkman.
