      the release dates of the Commodore 64 and the Nintendo Entertainment System
      (NES).


      Step 1: Determine the release date of the Commodore 64.

      The Commodore 64 was released in August 1982.


      Step 2: Determine the release date of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

      The NES was first released in Japan in 1983 under the name "Family Computer"
      or "Famicom." It was later released in North America and Europe in 1985 and
      1986, respectively.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      Since the Commodore 64 was released in August 1982, and the NES was released
      in Japan in 1983 and in other regions later, it is evident that the Commodore
      64 was released before the Nintendo Entertainment System.

      - The VHS (Video Home System) format was introduced in 1976, and the first VHS
      players were released in 1977.

      - The Apple II personal computer was introduced in 1977.
