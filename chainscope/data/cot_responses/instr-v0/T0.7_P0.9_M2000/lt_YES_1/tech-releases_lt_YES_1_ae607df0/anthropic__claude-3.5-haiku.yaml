      - The Polaroid SX-70 was introduced in 1972

      - It was first sold to the public in November 1972


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date of the Xerox Alto:

      - The Xerox Alto was developed at Xerox PARC

      - It was first completed in 1973

      - The first working prototype was built in late 1973

    a06fc7eb-a9f6-40da-80fe-d41aae607b19: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find out when the Motorola DynaTAC was released:

      - The Motorola DynaTAC 8000X was the first commercially available handheld cellular
      mobile phone

      - It was released to the public in 1983


      2. Next, let''s determine when the Apple Macintosh was released:

      - The first Macintosh computer (Macintosh 128K) was introduced on January 24,
      1984


      3. Comparing the two dates:

      - Motorola DynaTAC: 1983

      - Apple Macintosh: 1984

      - 1983 comes before 1984


      4. Therefore, the Motorola DynaTAC was released before the Apple Macintosh.
