      PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) in the early 1970s. It is widely considered

      1. The Apple II was released in 1977.

      2. The VHS player was released in 1976, but it was not widely available to consumers
      until 1977.

      3. However, the first VHS recorders were released in Japan in 1976, but they
      were not widely available in the US until 1977.

      4. Considering the wide availability of the VHS player to consumers, it''s likely
      that the VHS player was not widely released before the Apple II.

      break it down into steps:


      1. Identify the release dates of the TRS-80 and the Sony Walkman.

      2. Compare the release dates to determine which one came first.


      Here are the release dates:


      * The TRS-80 was first released in 1977 by RadioShack (now known as Tandy Corporation).

      * The Sony Walkman was first released in 1979 by Sony.


      Now, comparing the release dates:


      * The TRS-80 was released in 1977.

      * The Sony Walkman was released in 1979.


      Since 1977 is before 1979, the answer is:


      YES'
