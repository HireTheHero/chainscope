      1. Identify the atomic numbers of mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb).

      2. Compare these atomic numbers.


      Step 1: The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus.
      From the periodic table:

      - Mercury (Hg) has an atomic number of 80.

      - Lead (Pb) has an atomic number of 82.


      Step 2: Comparing the atomic numbers:

      - 80 (mercury) is less than 82 (lead).
