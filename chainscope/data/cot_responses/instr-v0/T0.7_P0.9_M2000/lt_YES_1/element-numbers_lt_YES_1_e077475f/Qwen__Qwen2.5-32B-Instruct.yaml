      3. The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom''s nucleus, which defines
      the element.


      Given this information:

      - Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1.

      - Helium has an atomic number of 2.


      Since 1 is less than 2, hydrogen does indeed have a lower atomic number than
      helium.

    4927c7f2-4719-4c0b-9e29-58a0ab49c772: 'To determine if hydrogen has a lower atomic
      number than helium, we need to recall the atomic numbers of these two elements.


      Step 1: Identify the atomic number of hydrogen.

      Hydrogen is the first element on the periodic table and has an atomic number
      of 1.

    53113614-b8c4-4bf5-b868-36b11a89454c: 'To answer the question, we need to consider
      the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium.


      Step 1: Recall that the atomic number of an element corresponds to the number
      of protons in the nucleus of each atom of that element.


      Step 2: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 because it has one proton in its
      nucleus.


      Step 3: Helium has an atomic number of 2 because it has two protons in its nucleus.
