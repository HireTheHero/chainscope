      in the periodic table.


      2. Zinc''s atomic number: Zinc (Zn) has an atomic number of 30. This means that

      that a silver atom has 47 protons in its nucleus.


      4. Comparison: When comparing the atomic numbers of zinc (30) and silver (47),
      we can see that zinc''s atomic number is lower than silver''s.
