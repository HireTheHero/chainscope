      Since the atomic number of silicon (14) is lower than the atomic number of phosphorus
      (15), this means that silicon has fewer protons in its nucleus compared to phosphorus.


      After following these steps, the answer is:


      YES, silicon has a lower atomic number than phosphorus.'
