      atomic number than chlorine, we need to follow these steps:


      1. Identify the atomic numbers of sulfur (S) and chlorine (Cl).

      2. Compare these two values.


      Step 1: Identifying Atomic Numbers

      - Sulfur (S): The atomic number of sulfur is 16.

      - Chlorine (Cl): The atomic number of chlorine is 17.


      Step 2: Comparing the Values

      - Atomic number of sulfur: 16

      1. **Atomic Number**: The atomic number of an element represents the number
      of protons in its nucleus. This determines the element''s identity.


      2. **Sulfur (S)**: Sulfur has an atomic number of 16. It is located on the periodic
      table under Group 16 (or VIA).


      3. **Chlorine (Cl)**: Chlorine has an atomic number of 17. It is also found
      on the periodic table, but it is located on the same row as oxygen (Group 16),
      which makes it different from sulfur.


      4. **Comparison**: Since both elements belong to Group 16, they have identical
      numbers of electrons in their outermost shell. Therefore, sulfur and chlorine
      have the same number of protons.


      5. **Conclusion**: Because sulfur and chlorine have the same atomic number,
      one cannot be "lower" than the other. They occupy the same position in the periodic
      table and share similar properties.

      To determine if potassium has a lower atomic number than calcium, let''s consider

      1. Potassium (K) is in Group 1 (alkali metals).

      In the periodic table:

      - Atomic numbers increase from left to right across each period.

      - The elements in the same group tend to have similar properties.


      Since both potassium and calcium belong to the alkali metal group, they share
      similar chemical properties. However, this doesn''t necessarily mean that their
      atomic numbers must be equal.
