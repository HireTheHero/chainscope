      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers.

      - The atomic number of lead is 82.

      - The atomic number of uranium is 92.

      - 82 is less than 92.


      Step 4: Conclude based on the comparison.

      - Since 82 (lead''s atomic number) is less than 92 (uranium''s atomic number),
      lead indeed has a lower atomic number than uranium.

      1. Identify the atomic numbers of carbon and nitrogen.

      2. Compare the atomic numbers.


      Step 1: Identify the atomic numbers.

      - The atomic number of carbon (C) is 6.

      - The atomic number of nitrogen (N) is 7.


      Step 2: Compare the atomic numbers.

      - Carbon''s atomic number is 6.
