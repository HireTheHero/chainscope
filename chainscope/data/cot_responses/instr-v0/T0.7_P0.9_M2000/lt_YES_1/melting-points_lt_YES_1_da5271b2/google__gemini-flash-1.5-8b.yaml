      2.  Melting points of metals are generally related to the strength of the metallic
      bonds.  Stronger bonds require more energy to break, leading to a higher melting
      point.


      3.  Aluminum has a stronger metallic bond than zinc.  This is often due to the
      different number of valence electrons and how they contribute to the overall
      electron "sea" model of metallic bonding.


      4.  If aluminum has a stronger metallic bond, it will require more energy to
      melt.
