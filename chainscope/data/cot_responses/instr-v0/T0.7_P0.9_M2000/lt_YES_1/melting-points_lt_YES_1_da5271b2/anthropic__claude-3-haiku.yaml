      1. Zinc (Zn) is a metallic element with an atomic number of 30.

      2. Aluminum (Al) is a metallic element with an atomic number of 13.

      3. The melting point of a metal is primarily determined by the strength of the
      metallic bonds between the atoms.

      4. Generally, the stronger the metallic bonds, the higher the melting point
      of the metal.

      5. Aluminum has a higher atomic number than zinc, which means it has more protons
