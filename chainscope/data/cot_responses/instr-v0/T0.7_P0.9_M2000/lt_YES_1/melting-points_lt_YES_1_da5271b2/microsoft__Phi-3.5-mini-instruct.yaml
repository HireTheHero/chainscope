      Step 2: Compare the melting points.

      Now that we have both melting points, we can compare them. Aluminum''s melting
      point is 660.3 degrees Celsius, while silver''s melting point is 961.8 degrees
      Celsius.


      Step 3: Determine if aluminum has a lower melting point than silver.

      Comparing the two melting points, we can see that 660.3 degrees Celsius (aluminum)
      is less than 961.8 degrees Celsius (silver).


      Conclusion:

      Based on the comparison, we can conclude that aluminum has a lower melting point
      than silver.
