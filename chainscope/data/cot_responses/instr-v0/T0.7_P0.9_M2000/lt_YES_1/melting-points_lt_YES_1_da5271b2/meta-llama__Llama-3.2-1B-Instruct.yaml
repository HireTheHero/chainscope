      point than iron, we need to consider the properties of both metals.


      1. The melting point of a metal is the temperature at which it changes state
      from solid to liquid. This is a fundamental property of metals that can vary
      depending on the specific metal and its chemical composition.

      2. Copper and iron are both metals, but they have different chemical properties
      and structures.

      3. Copper is a transition metal, which means it has a relatively low melting
      point compared to the main group metals like iron, which is a post-transition
      metal.

      4. The melting point of a metal is influenced by the strength of the metallic
      bonds between its atoms, as well as the presence of impurities or other factors
      that can affect the metal''s physical properties.

      5. Copper has a higher atomic number (29) than iron (26), which means it has
      more electrons in its outermost energy level. This can lead to stronger metallic
      bonds and a lower melting point.

      6. The atomic structure of copper and iron also differs, with copper having
      a more stable electron configuration and a lower ionization energy compared
      to iron.

      To answer this question, we need to consider the properties of aluminum and
      silver. Here''s my step-by-step reasoning:


      1. Both aluminum and silver are metals.

      2. They are both relatively soft metals, meaning they can be easily melted and
      shaped.

      3. However, they have different crystal structures.

      4. Aluminum has a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal structure, while silver
      has a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure.

      5. The hcp structure is typically associated with lower melting points, while
      the fcc structure is associated with higher melting points.

      6. Silver has a higher melting point than aluminum due to its more stable crystal
      structure.


      Therefore, based on these considerations, I conclude that aluminum has a **lower**
      melting point than silver.
