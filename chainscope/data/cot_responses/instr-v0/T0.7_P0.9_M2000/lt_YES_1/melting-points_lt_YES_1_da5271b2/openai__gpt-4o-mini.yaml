    0cabc355-4b24-4c05-8849-ca34f4f12861: 'To determine whether copper has a lower
      melting point than iron, let''s look at the melting points of both metals:


      1. **Melting Point of Copper**: The melting point of copper is approximately
      1,984 degrees Fahrenheit (1,085 degrees Celsius).


      2. **Melting Point of Iron**: The melting point of iron is around 2,800 degrees
      Fahrenheit (1,538 degrees Celsius).


      Now, comparing the two values:


      - Copper: 1,085 degrees Celsius

      - Iron: 1,538 degrees Celsius


      Since 1,085 degrees Celsius (copper) is lower than 1,538 degrees Celsius (iron),
      we can conclude that copper does indeed have a lower melting point than iron.


      Thus, the answer is **YES**.'
