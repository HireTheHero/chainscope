      step:


      1. Gold and copper are both metals.

      2. The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from
      a solid to a liquid state.

      3. I know that different metals have different melting points, but I don''t
      have the exact values memorized.

      4. I recall that copper has a relatively high melting point compared to many
      other common metals.

      5. I also recall that gold is often used in jewelry and decorative items partly
      because it has a relatively low melting point for a metal, making it easier
      to work with.

      6. Based on this, I believe that gold likely has a lower melting point than
      copper.


      So, my answer is: YES, gold does have a lower melting point than copper.'
