      \ **What is sound?** Sound is a vibration that travels through a medium, like\

      \n* **Sound and Materials:** Sound is a vibration that travels through a medium\
      \ (like air, water, or solid objects). The speed of sound depends on the properties\
      \ of the medium.\n* **Density and Molecular Structure:** Denser materials tend\
      \ to have faster sound propagation because the molecules are closer together\
      \ and can vibrate more readily.  \n* **Comparing Wood and Glass:** Wood is generally\
      \ less dense than glass. \n\n**Therefore:**  Sound travels slower in wood than\
      \ in glass. \n\n**Answer: YES** \n"
