      1. **Sound travels as vibrations:** Sound is a mechanical wave that needs a
      medium to travel. It propagates through the vibration of particles within that
      medium.


      2. **Density affects sound speed:** Generally, sound travels faster in denser
      materials. This is because the particles are closer together, allowing vibrations
      to transfer more quickly.
