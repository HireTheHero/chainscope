      The Tower Bridge in London stands at a total height of 65 meters (213 feet)
      including the roadway. On the other hand, the Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia
      is significantly taller, with a main span height of 134 meters (440 feet) and
      a total height of 336 meters (1,102 feet) including the roadway.


      Step 2: Compare the heights of both bridges.


      The Sydney Harbour Bridge''s total height of 336 meters (1,102 feet) is much
      greater than the Tower Bridge''s height of 65 meters (213 feet).
