      1. The Tower Bridge is located in London, UK.

      2. The Sydney Harbour Bridge is located in Sydney, Australia.

      steel arch bridges in the world, with a height of 134 meters (440 feet) above
      the water level.

      4. The Tower Bridge, on the other hand, is a combined bascule and suspension
      bridge in London, with a height of 65 meters (215 feet) above the water level.


      Now, let''s compare the heights:


      Since 65 meters (Tower Bridge) is less than 134 meters (Sydney Harbour Bridge),
      the Tower Bridge is shorter than the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
