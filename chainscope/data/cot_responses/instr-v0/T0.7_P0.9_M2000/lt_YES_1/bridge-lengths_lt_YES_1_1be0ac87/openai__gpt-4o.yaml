      a bridge-tunnel complex known as the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel. It has a
      total length of about 17.6 miles (28.3 kilometers).


      Comparing these lengths, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is significantly shorter
      than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
    a3619ccb-e817-43fd-acbd-7f2471cdea3c: 'To determine whether the Sunshine Skyway
      Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, we need to consider the lengths
      of both bridges.


      1. **Sunshine Skyway Bridge:** This bridge spans Tampa Bay in Florida and is
      approximately 21,877 feet (about 4.1 miles) long.


      2. **Chesapeake Bay Bridge:** This bridge-tunnel system spans the Chesapeake
      Bay in Virginia and is approximately 92,848 feet (about 17.6 miles) long.


      By comparing the lengths, it''s clear that the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is significantly
      shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

    bcf9108e-ead0-4769-b9c9-cf6407f7a059: 'To determine whether the Sunshine Skyway
      Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the Length of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: The Sunshine Skyway
      Bridge, located in Florida, is approximately 4.14 miles (6.7 kilometers) long.


      2. **Identify the Length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge**: The Chesapeake Bay
      Bridge, located in Maryland, is a complex that includes two separate spans.
      The total length of the bridge-tunnel system is approximately 17.6 miles (28.3
      kilometers).


      3. **Compare the Lengths**: By comparing the lengths identified in the previous
      steps, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is significantly longer than the Sunshine Skyway
      Bridge.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:


      NO.'

      span.


      Now, let''s compare the lengths:

      - The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is approximately 4.14 miles long.

      - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is at least 4.3 miles long, with the newer span
      being 4.5 miles.


      Therefore, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.
