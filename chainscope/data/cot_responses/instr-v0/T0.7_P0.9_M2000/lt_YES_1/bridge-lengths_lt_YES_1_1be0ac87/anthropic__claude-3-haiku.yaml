      5. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge has a main span length of 4,000 feet (1,219 meters).

      6. Comparing the main span lengths, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge (1,200 feet)
      is shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (4,000 feet).


      Therefore, the answer is:


      YES, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.'
    95116f15-655c-4ca8-94be-32b8982d8174: 'Okay, let''s break this down step-by-step:


      1. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the mouth of
      Tampa Bay in Florida.

      2. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is also a suspension bridge, connecting the Delmarva
      Peninsula with the Maryland mainland across the Chesapeake Bay.

      3. To determine which bridge is shorter, we need to compare the total length
      of each bridge.

      4. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge has a main span of 1,200 feet (366 meters) and
      a total length of 21,877 feet (6,667 meters).

      5. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge has a main span of 1,092 feet (333 meters) and
      a total length of 4.3 miles (6,920 meters).

      6. Comparing the total lengths, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (6,920 meters) is
      longer than the Sunshine Skyway Bridge (6,667 meters).


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is not shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.'
    ca1a8fbe-afaf-46be-a86f-d2cb500a4243: 'Okay, let''s think through this step-by-step:


      1. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the mouth of
      Tampa Bay in Florida.

      2. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Chesapeake
      Bay in Maryland.

      3. To determine which bridge is shorter, we need to compare the main span lengths
      of the two bridges.

      4. The main span of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is 1,200 feet (366 meters).

      5. The main span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is 4,000 feet (1,219 meters).

      6. Since the main span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (4,000 feet) is longer than
      the main span of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge (1,200 feet), the Sunshine Skyway
      Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      YES, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.'
