    24d267c1-2260-480e-8978-dbe8bbb3b451: 'To answer this question, we need to compare
      the lengths of both bridges.


      Step 1: Determine the length of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

      - The Sydney Harbour Bridge has a total length of approximately 1,149 meters
      (3,770 feet).


      Step 2: Determine the length of the George Washington Bridge.

      - The George Washington Bridge, spanning the Hudson River between New York City
      and New Jersey, has a total length of approximately 4,760 meters (15,617 feet)
      including its approaches.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - The Sydney Harbour Bridge at about 1,149 meters is shorter than the George
      Washington Bridge at about 4,760 meters.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is the Sydney Harbour Bridge shorter
      than the George Washington Bridge?" is:


      YES.'

      Comparing these two measurements:

      - Sydney Harbour Bridge: 503 meters

      - George Washington Bridge: 1,067 meters


      Since 503 meters is less than 1,067 meters, the Sydney Harbour Bridge is indeed

      - The Sydney Harbour Bridge has a total length of about 1,149 meters (3,770
      feet).


      Step 2: Find the length of the George Washington Bridge.

      - The George Washington Bridge has a total length of about 1,067 meters (3,500

      - Comparing the lengths directly shows that the Sydney Harbour Bridge (1,149
      meters) is indeed shorter than the main span of the George Washington Bridge
      (1,067 meters per level). However, when comparing the overall lengths including
      approaches, the difference becomes even more pronounced.
