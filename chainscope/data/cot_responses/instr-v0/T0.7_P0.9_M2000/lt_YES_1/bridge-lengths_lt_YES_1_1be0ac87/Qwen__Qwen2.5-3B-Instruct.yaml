      ### Step 1: Identify the Lengths of Both Bridges

      - **Golden Gate Bridge**: The main span length of the Golden Gate Bridge is
      2,737 meters (8,982 feet).

      - **Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: The Sunshine Skyway Bridge has multiple spans,

      is shorter than the Brooklyn Bridge, we need to compare their lengths. Let''s
      break this down into steps.


      ### Step 1: Determine the Length of the Brooklyn Bridge

      - The Brooklyn Bridge is approximately 1,595 meters (about 5,234 feet) long.


      ### Step 2: Determine the Length of the George Washington Bridge

      - The George Washington Bridge spans between New York City and Jersey City and
      has a main span of about 3,500 feet (1,067 meters).


      ### Step 3: Compare the Two Bridges

      - The Brooklyn Bridge: 1,595 meters

      - The George Washington Bridge: 3,500 feet


      ### Step 4: Convert Units for Comparison

      - To make the comparison easier, let''s convert both lengths into the same unit.
      We''ll use meters for consistency.

      - 1 foot = 0.3048 meters

      - Therefore, 3,500 feet = 3,500 * 0.3048 = 1,066.8 meters


      ### Step 5: Final Comparison

      - Brooklyn Bridge: 1,595 meters

      - George Washington Bridge: 1,066.8 meters


      ### Conclusion

      The George Washington Bridge is longer than the Brooklyn Bridge.

      1. Identify the lengths of both bridges.


      The Manhattan Bridge:

      - It is a combined cable-stayed and suspension bridge connecting Manhattan to
      Brooklyn in New York City.

      - The total length of the bridge from Manhattan to Brooklyn (including the anchorages)
      is approximately 6,380 feet (1,944 meters).


      The Forth Bridge:

      - It is a cantilever railway bridge spanning the Firth of Forth in Scotland.

      - The main span of the Forth Bridge is about 1,700 feet (520 meters), while
      the entire bridge''s length is about 8,955 feet (2,730 meters).


      2. Compare the lengths.


      From the information gathered:

      - Manhattan Bridge: Approximately 6,380 feet

      - Forth Bridge: Approximately 8,955 feet


      3. Determine which bridge is shorter.


      Clearly, 6,380 feet is less than 8,955 feet.

      (or in this case, lengths) of these two iconic structures.


      Step 1: Recall the approximate length of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

      The Sydney Harbour Bridge is approximately 1,149 meters (3,770 feet) long.


      Step 2: Recall the approximate length of the George Washington Bridge.

      The George Washington Bridge spans about 3,572 feet (1,089 meters).


      Step 3: Compare the two measurements.

      The Sydney Harbour Bridge is 3,770 feet, while the George Washington Bridge
      is 1,089 meters. To make a direct comparison, we can convert both lengths to
      the same unit. Let''s use meters for this purpose.


      - Sydney Harbour Bridge: 1,149 meters

      - George Washington Bridge: 1,089 meters


      Step 4: Determine which bridge is longer.

      The George Washington Bridge is 1,089 meters, which is shorter than the Sydney
      Harbour Bridge at 1,149 meters.


      Step 5: Answer the question.

      Since the George Washington Bridge is shorter than the Sydney Harbour Bridge,
      the answer is:


      NO'

      1. **Sydney Harbour Bridge**: The main span of the Sydney Harbour Bridge is
      492 meters (1,614 feet) long. However, the question asks about height, not length.
      The height of the bridge at its highest point above the water level is approximately
      50.3 meters (165 feet).


      2. **George Washington Bridge**: The main span of the George Washington Bridge

      Comparing these two heights:

      - Sydney Harbour Bridge: 165 feet

      - George Washington Bridge: 41 feet


      Since 165 feet is greater than 41 feet, the Sydney Harbour Bridge is taller
      than the George Washington Bridge.
