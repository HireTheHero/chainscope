      \n1. **Length of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge:**\n   - The main span of the Sunshine\
      \ Skyway Bridge, located in Florida, USA, is 360 meters (1,181 feet). However,\
      \ the total length of the bridge is approximately 4.1 miles (6.6 kilometers).\n\
      \n2. **Length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge:**\n   - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge,\
      \ also known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, is located in\
      \ Maryland, USA. It consists of two parallel bridges. The total length of the\
      \ main span and approaches is approximately 4.3 miles (7 kilometers).\n\nNow,\
      \ let's compare the total lengths:\n- Sunshine Skyway Bridge: 4.1 miles (6.6\
      \ kilometers)\n- Chesapeake Bay Bridge: 4.3 miles (7 kilometers)\n\nSince 4.1\
      \ miles is less than 4.3 miles, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is indeed shorter\
      \ than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.\n\n**Answer: YES**"
