      The Confederation Bridge, which connects Prince Edward Island to mainland New
      Brunswick in Canada, is about 8 miles (12.9 km) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      The Confederation Bridge (8 miles or 12.9 km) is longer than the Seven Mile
      Bridge (6.79 miles or 10.93 km).

      is shorter than the Forth Bridge, let''s follow these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the Manhattan Bridge and its length.

      The Manhattan Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the East River in New
      York City, connecting the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. The main span
      of the Manhattan Bridge is 1,470 feet (448 meters) long.


      Step 2: Identify the Forth Bridge and its length.

      The Forth Bridge is a cantilever railway bridge across the Firth of Forth in
      the east of Scotland, connecting Edinburgh to Fife. The total length of the
      Forth Bridge is 8,094 feet (2,467 meters), with the longest single cantilever
      span being 1,709 feet (521 meters).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      The main span of the Manhattan Bridge (1,470 feet) is shorter than the longest
      single cantilever span of the Forth Bridge (1,709 feet). Additionally, the total

      Step 1: Chesapeake Bay Bridge length

      - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is officially known as the William Preston Lane
      Jr. Memorial Bridge.

      - It consists of two separate bridges: the original span and a parallel span.

      - The original span, opened in 1952, is 4.3 miles (6.9 km) long.

      - The parallel span, opened in 1973, is 4.3 miles (6.9 km) long as well.

      - The total length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is approximately 4.3 miles (6.9
      km).


      Step 2: San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge length

      - The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is a complex of bridges spanning San
      Francisco Bay.

      - It consists of two major segments: the western suspension bridge and the eastern
      cantilever bridge.

      - The western suspension bridge, connecting San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island,
      is 1.8 miles (2.9 km) long.

      - The eastern cantilever bridge, connecting Yerba Buena Island to Oakland, is
      2.2 miles (3.5 km) long.

      - The total length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is approximately
      4.0 miles (6.4 km).


      Step 3: Comparison

      - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge has a total length of approximately 4.3 miles (6.9
      km).

      - The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge has a total length of approximately 4.0
      miles (6.4 km).

      - 4.3 miles is greater than 4.0 miles.
