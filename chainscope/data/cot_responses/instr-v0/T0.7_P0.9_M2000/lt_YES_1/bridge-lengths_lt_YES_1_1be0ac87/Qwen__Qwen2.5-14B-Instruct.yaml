      The Tower Bridge in London spans approximately 244 meters (800 feet) across
      the River Thames.


      Step 2: Identify the length of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

      2. **Sydney Harbour Bridge (Sydney, Australia):** The Sydney Harbour Bridge
      spans about 1,342 meters (4,403 feet) in total length, but the main span itself

      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is the Tower Bridge shorter than the

      - Forth Bridge: About 1.55 miles

      - Golden Gate Bridge (total length): About 1.7 miles


      Step 4: Conclude based on the comparison.

      Since 1.55 miles (Forth Bridge) is less than 1.7 miles (Golden Gate Bridge),
      the Forth Bridge is indeed shorter than the Golden Gate Bridge.


      Answer: YES'
    d39f0b21-0e0a-4bb8-82f8-e89aa908a46a: 'To answer the question "Is the Forth Bridge
      shorter than the Golden Gate Bridge?" we need to compare the lengths of these
      two bridges.


      Step 1: Determine the length of the Forth Bridge.

      The Forth Bridge, located in Scotland, has a total length of approximately 2.5
      kilometers (km).


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Golden Gate Bridge.

      The Golden Gate Bridge, located in California, USA, has a main span length of
      about 1.28 kilometers (km). However, when comparing overall lengths, it''s more
      appropriate to consider the full length of the bridge including its approaches.
      The total length of the Golden Gate Bridge, including its approaches, is approximately
      2.7 kilometers (km).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      Forth Bridge: ~2.5 km

      Golden Gate Bridge: ~2.7 km


      Step 4: Answer the question based on the comparison.

      Since the Forth Bridge at approximately 2.5 km is shorter than the Golden Gate
      Bridge at approximately 2.7 km, the answer is:


      NO'

      1. **Sydney Harbour Bridge**: The main span of the Sydney Harbour Bridge is
      approximately 503 meters (1,650 feet) long. However, when considering its overall
      length, it extends further due to its approach spans, making the total length
      about 1,149 meters (3,770 feet).


      2. **George Washington Bridge**: This bridge has a main span of 1,067 meters
      (3,500 feet) and an overall length including approach spans that exceeds 2,500
      meters (8,200 feet).

      - The overall length of the Sydney Harbour Bridge is around 1,149 meters.

      - The overall length of the George Washington Bridge is significantly longer

      1. **Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, located in Florida,
      USA, has two main spans. The current bridge, which replaced an older one that
      was damaged by a ship collision in 1980, opened in 1987. Its total length is
      approximately 25,062 feet (about 4.7 miles or 7.6 kilometers).


      2. **Chesapeake Bay Bridge**: This bridge actually refers to two parallel bridges
      over the Chesapeake Bay, connecting Maryland''s Eastern Shore and the mainland.
      The original bridge, completed in 1952, is known as the original span, and the
      newer bridge, opened in 1973, is known as the parallel span. Together, these
      bridges form what is often referred to collectively as the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.
      The combined length of both spans is significantly longer than either span alone.
      The newer span, for example, is about 4.3 miles (or around 22,400 feet) long.


      Comparing the lengths:

      - Sunshine Skyway Bridge: ~4.7 miles

      - Chesapeake Bay Bridge (newer span): ~4.3 miles


      The newer span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is shorter than the total length
      of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, but if comparing just the newer span, the original
      question might be implying a comparison with the overall structure. However,
      based on the information provided, the original span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge
      is much shorter than the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.


      Since the question seems to imply a direct comparison without specifying which
      part of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (considering it has multiple spans), and given
      the information provided, we can infer it''s asking about the newer span directly.


      **Answer: No**, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is not shorter than the newer span

      break down the information needed:


      1. Identify the lengths of both bridges in question.

      2. Compare the lengths to determine which bridge is longer.


      Firstly, let''s look at the Sunshine Skyway Bridge:

      - The Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida has a main span length of about 435
      meters (1,427 feet) for the current bridge that was completed in 1987. However,
      when we talk about total length including approaches, it is significantly longer,
      but the specific number can vary based on how you measure approach roads and
      structures.


      Secondly, let''s consider the Chesapeake Bay Bridge:

      - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland actually consists of two spans: the
      original 1952 bridge and the parallel bridge built in 1973. The newer bridge
      (known as the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge) is approximately 10.2 miles (16.4
      kilometers) long.
