      step by step:


      **Step 1: Identify Both Bridges**

      - **Chesapeake Bay Bridge**: Also known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial
      Bridge, it spans the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland.

      - **San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge**: Connects the cities of San Francisco
      and Oakland in California, spanning the San Francisco Bay.


      **Step 2: Determine the Length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge**

      - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is approximately **4.3 miles (6.9 kilometers)**
      long for the original span. With additional extensions, the total length can
      vary slightly, but it remains around this measurement.


      **Step 3: Determine the Length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge**

      - The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is significantly longer, with a total
      length of about **8.4 miles (13.6 kilometers)**.


      **Step 4: Compare the Lengths**

      - **Chesapeake Bay Bridge**: ~4.3 miles

      - **San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge**: ~8.4 miles
