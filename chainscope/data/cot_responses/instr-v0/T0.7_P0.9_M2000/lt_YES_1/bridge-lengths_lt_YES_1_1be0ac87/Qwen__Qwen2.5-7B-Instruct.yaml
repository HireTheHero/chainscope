      Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, we need to compare their respective
      lengths.


      Step 1: Find the length of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.

      The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is located in Florida and is part of U.S. Route 1.
      According to available data, its total length is approximately 8.2 miles (13.2
      kilometers).


      Step 2: Find the length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

      There are actually two major bridges that span the Chesapeake Bay, but the most
      notable one is the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, which is a combination of bridge
      and tunnel. The total length of the bridge portion alone is about 17.6 miles
      (28.3 kilometers).


      Step 3: Compare the two lengths.

      - Sunshine Skyway Bridge: 8.2 miles (13.2 kilometers)

      - Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel (bridge portion): 17.6 miles (28.3 kilometers)


      Since 8.2 miles is less than 17.6 miles, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is indeed
      shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      1. **Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: This bridge spans Tampa Bay in Florida, USA.
      According to reliable sources, the total length of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge
      is approximately 8.7 miles (14 kilometers).
