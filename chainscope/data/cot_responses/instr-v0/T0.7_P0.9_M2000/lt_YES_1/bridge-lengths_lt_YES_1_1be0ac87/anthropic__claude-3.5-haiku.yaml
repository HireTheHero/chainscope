      1. Tower Bridge is located in London, United Kingdom

      2. Sydney Harbour Bridge is located in Sydney, Australia

      3. I''ll need to compare their lengths


      Tower Bridge length:

      - Total length is approximately 244 meters (800 feet)


      Sydney Harbour Bridge length:

      - Total length is approximately 1,149 meters (3,770 feet)


      Comparing the two:

      - Sydney Harbour Bridge is significantly longer than Tower Bridge

      - Sydney Harbour Bridge is almost 5 times longer than Tower Bridge
