      The B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight on April 24, 1952.

      The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on December 22, 1964.

      steps of reasoning:


      1. Identify the aircraft: The Spitfire and the P-51 Mustang are both fighter
      planes.

      2. Identify their countries of origin: The Spitfire is a British aircraft, while
      the P-51 Mustang is an American aircraft.

      3. Identify the time period of their development: The Spitfire was developed
      during World War II, while the P-51 Mustang was also developed during World
      War II.
