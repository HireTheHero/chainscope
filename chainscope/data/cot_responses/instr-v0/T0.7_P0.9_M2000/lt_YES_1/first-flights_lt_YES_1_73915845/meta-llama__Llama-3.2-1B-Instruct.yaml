      To answer this, I''ll follow the steps:


      1. I''ll look up the first flight dates for both aircraft.

      2. I''ll compare the dates to determine which one came before the other.

      3. Based on the comparison, I''ll give a yes or no answer.


      Here are the dates I found:


      * The B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight on March 16, 1952.

      * The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on May 21, 1958.


      Now, let me compare the dates:


      The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight 6 years before the B-52 Stratofortress.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**. The B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight
      before the SR-71 Blackbird.'

      To answer this, let''s consider the historical context and the characteristics
      of both aircraft.


      The B-52 Stratofortress was a strategic bomber aircraft developed in the 1950s,
      designed to carry nuclear bombs and deliver them over long distances.


      The SR-71 Blackbird, on the other hand, was a supersonic reconnaissance aircraft
      developed in the 1950s and 1960s, designed to gather intelligence over enemy
      territories.


      Considering the characteristics of both aircraft:


      * The B-52 Stratofortress was a large, long-range bomber, while the SR-71 Blackbird
      was a short-range, high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft.

      * The B-52 Stratofortress was designed for nuclear deterrence, while the SR-71
      Blackbird was designed for reconnaissance and surveillance.


      It''s highly unlikely that the B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight before
      the SR-71 Blackbird, given the significant differences in design, purpose, and

      Works.


      2. The DC-3 was first introduced in 1935, making it the first production airliner.
