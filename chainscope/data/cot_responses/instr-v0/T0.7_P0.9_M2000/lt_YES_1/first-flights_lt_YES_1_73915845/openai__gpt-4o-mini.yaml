      made its first flight before the SR-71 Blackbird, we need to look at the first
      flight dates of each aircraft.


      1. The B-52 Stratofortress, specifically the B-52A variant, had its first flight
      on April 15, 1952.

      2. The SR-71 Blackbird had its first flight on December 22, 1964.


      Now, comparing the two dates:

      - The B-52''s first flight (April 15, 1952) occurred significantly earlier than
      the SR-71''s first flight (December 22, 1964).
