    219b9f7d-d81d-402e-ac34-90f5af8df0e0: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the first flight date of the Spitfire:

      - The Spitfire prototype first flew on March 5, 1936


      2. Next, let''s find the first flight date of the P-51 Mustang:

      - The P-51 prototype first flew on October 26, 1940


      3. Comparing the two dates:

      - The Spitfire flew first in 1936

      - The P-51 Mustang flew first in 1940

      - 1936 is earlier than 1940


      4. Therefore, the Spitfire made its first flight before the P-51 Mustang.


      YES'
