      2. I need to know the first flight date of the SR-71 Blackbird.

      steps of reasoning:


      1. The B-52 Stratofortress is a subsonic bomber, which means it doesn''t break
      the sound barrier.

      2. The SR-71 Blackbird is a supersonic reconnaissance plane, which means it
      can break the sound barrier.

      3. The SR-71 was developed and designed to be a high-speed, high-altitude aircraft,
      which required significant advancements in materials and aerodynamics.

      4. The B-52, on the other hand, was designed as a strategic bomber for the Cold
      War era, and its primary goal was to deliver nuclear weapons, not to be a high-speed
      aircraft.

      5. Given the technological requirements and design goals, the SR-71 was likely
      developed after the B-52.

      that the B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight before the SR-71 Blackbird.

      Boeing and Douglas (the manufacturer of the DC-3) in response to market demand.

      3. Military fighter planes, like the Spitfire, are often developed in response
      to emerging military needs and threats.

      4. The Spitfire was a British fighter plane developed during World War II, which
      started in 1939.

      5. The DC-3 was a commercial airliner developed in the 1930s, with the first

      to be a reliable and efficient aircraft for passenger transportation.

      3. The Spitfire, on the other hand, was first introduced in 1938 as a military
