      down into the necessary steps of reasoning:


      1. **Identify the first flight date of the B-52 Stratofortress**: The B-52 Stratofortress,
      a strategic bomber used by the United States Air Force, made its first flight
      on April 15, 1952.


      2. **Identify the first flight date of the SR-71 Blackbird**: The SR-71 Blackbird,
      a supersonic reconnaissance plane also used by the United States Air Force,
      made its first flight on December 22, 1964.


      3. **Compare the first flight dates**: By comparing the dates, we can determine
      if the B-52 Stratofortress flew before the SR-71 Blackbird. The B-52''s first
      flight was in 1952, and the SR-71''s first flight was in 1964.

      the key information needed:


      1. **First Flight of the B-52 Stratofortress**: The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress

      strategic bomber used by the United States Air Force since the 1950s. It was
      designed and built by Boeing. The first B-52 prototype, the XB-52, made its
      first flight on October 2, 1952.


      2. **SR-71 Blackbird**: The SR-71 is a supersonic reconnaissance plane developed
      in the 1950s and 1960s by Lockheed Skunk Works. It is known for its extraordinary
      speed and operational altitude. The first SR-71 flight took place on December
      22, 1964.

      was an American fighter aircraft used during World War II and the Korean War.
      The development of the Mustang began in response to a British Purchasing Commission''s
      requirement for a fighter that could escort bombers deep into enemy territory.
      The P-51 Mustang made its first flight on October 26, 1940.


      Given these dates:


      - The Spitfire''s first flight was on March 5, 1936.

      - The P-51 Mustang''s first flight was on October 26, 1940.


      Therefore, considering the timeline, the Spitfire made its first flight before
      the P-51 Mustang.
