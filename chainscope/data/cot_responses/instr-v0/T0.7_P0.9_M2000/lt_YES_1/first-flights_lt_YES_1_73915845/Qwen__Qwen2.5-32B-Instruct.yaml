      1. Identify the first flight date of the B-52 Stratofortress.

      2. Identify the first flight date of the SR-71 Blackbird.

      3. Compare the dates to determine which aircraft made its first flight earlier.


      Step 1: The B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight on April 15, 1952.


      Step 2: The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on December 22, 1964.

      1. The Wright Flyer: The Wright brothers made four brief flights on December
      17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The longest of these flights lasted
      59 seconds and covered a distance of 852 feet (260 meters).
