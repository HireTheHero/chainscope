    f44b0c58-2308-4196-afb1-5a725908cc82: 'Let''s break down the question step by
      step to determine the correct answer.


      **Step 1: Determine the first flight date of the P-51 Mustang.**

      - The North American P-51 Mustang is a famous American long-range, single-seat
      fighter and fighter-bomber used during World War II.

      - Its first flight took place on October 26, 1940.


      **Step 2: Determine the first flight date of the B-52 Stratofortress.**

      - The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic
      bomber.

      - Its first flight occurred much later, on April 15, 1952.


      **Step 3: Compare the dates to see which aircraft flew first.**

      - P-51 Mustang: October 26, 1940

      - B-52 Stratofortress: April 15, 1952


      **Step 4: Conclusion**

      - Since the P-51 Mustang''s first flight in 1940 predates the B-52 Stratofortress''s
      first flight in 1952, the P-51 Mustang did indeed make its first flight before
      the B-52 Stratofortress.
