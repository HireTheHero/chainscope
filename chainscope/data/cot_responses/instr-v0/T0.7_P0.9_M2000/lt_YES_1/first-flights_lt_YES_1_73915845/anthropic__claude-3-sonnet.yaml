    b811558f-282f-41f3-b613-de1abfa34b2f: 'Sure, let''s break this down step-by-step:


      1. The SR-71 Blackbird was a long-range, advanced strategic reconnaissance aircraft
      developed by Lockheed''s Skunk Works division.


      2. The first flight of the SR-71 Blackbird took place on December 22, 1964.


      3. The Boeing 737 is a narrow-body aircraft used for short to medium-range flights.
      It is one of the most popular commercial aircraft in service.


      4. The Boeing 737 made its first flight on April 9, 1967.


      By comparing the first flight dates of the SR-71 Blackbird (December 22, 1964)
      and the Boeing 737 (April 9, 1967), we can determine that the SR-71 Blackbird
      made its first flight before the Boeing 737.

      Step 1: Identify the first flight date of the Spitfire.

      The Supermarine Spitfire, a British single-seat fighter aircraft, made its first
      flight on March 5, 1936.


      Step 2: Identify the first flight date of the P-51 Mustang.

      The North American P-51 Mustang, an American long-range single-seat fighter
      and fighter-bomber, made its first flight on October 26, 1940.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      March 5, 1936 (Spitfire''s first flight) is earlier than October 26, 1940 (P-51
      Mustang''s first flight).


      Therefore, the answer is:
