      - Taipei 101 was the tallest building in the world from 2004 until 2010.

      - The total height of Taipei 101 is approximately 508 meters (including its
      spire).


      Step 2: Identify the height of the One World Trade Center.

      - The One World Trade Center is located in New York City and completed in 2013.

      - Its total height is approximately 541 meters (including its spire).

      The Shanghai World Financial Center stands at approximately 632 meters tall
      (including its spire).


      Step 2: Identify the height of the Taipei 101.

      Taipei 101 reaches a height of approximately 509 meters (including its spire).


      Step 3: Compare the two heights.

      When comparing the two heights, we can see that 632 meters (Shanghai World Financial
      Center) is greater than 509 meters (Taipei 101).


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is the Shanghai World Financial Center
      shorter than the Taipei 101?" is NO.'

      break it down into steps.


      Step 1: Identify the heights of both buildings.

      - The Shanghai World Financial Center (SWFC) is one of the tallest buildings
      in China. Its height is 632 meters (including antennas).

      - Taipei 101 is located in Taiwan and has a height of 509 meters (including

      Since 632 meters (SWFC) is greater than 509 meters (Taipei 101), the Shanghai
      World Financial Center is not shorter than Taipei 101; in fact, it is taller.
