      is shorter than the 30 Hudson Yards, we need to compare their heights.


      Step 1: Find the height of the Empire State Building.

      The Empire State Building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (381 meters) and a
      total height including antennas of 1,454 feet (443.2 meters).


      Step 2: Find the height of 30 Hudson Yards.

      30 Hudson Yards has a height of approximately 1,296 feet (395 meters) to its
      roof, and 1,426 feet (435 meters) to its highest point including the spire.


      Step 3: Compare the heights.

      Comparing the roof heights, the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet (381 meters)
      is shorter than 30 Hudson Yards at 1,296 feet (395 meters). Even if we compare
      the total heights including antennas/spires, the Empire State Building at 1,454

      2. Height of the Chrysler Building: The Chrysler Building in New York City has
      a total height of 319 meters (1,047 feet) including its spire.
