      Since 1,250 feet (the roof height of the Empire State Building) is less than

      Dubai, United Arab Emirates, is known for being the tallest building in the
      world. Its height is approximately 828 meters (2,722 feet).


      2. **Identify the height of the Shanghai Tower**: The Shanghai Tower, located
      in Shanghai, China, is one of the tallest buildings in the world. Its height
      is approximately 632 meters (2,073 feet).


      3. **Compare the heights**: Now, we compare the heights of the two buildings.
      The Burj Khalifa is 828 meters tall, and the Shanghai Tower is 632 meters tall.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 632 meters (the height of the Shanghai Tower) is less
      than 828 meters (the height of the Burj Khalifa), the Shanghai Tower is indeed
      shorter than the Burj Khalifa.

    f0be4e27-e0d0-411e-9b94-baa17ae9fd5f: 'To answer this question, let''s break down
      the steps needed to compare the heights of the 30 Hudson Yards and the Willis
      Tower.


      1. **Identify the Height of 30 Hudson Yards**: The first step is to find out
      how tall the 30 Hudson Yards is. According to available data, 30 Hudson Yards
      stands at a height of 1,296 feet (394.7 meters) to its architectural top.


      2. **Identify the Height of the Willis Tower**: Next, we need to determine the
      height of the Willis Tower. The Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears Tower,
      has a height of 1,451 feet (442 meters) to its architectural top, and with antennas,
      it reaches 1,730 feet (527 meters). However, for architectural height comparisons,
      we usually consider the height to the architectural top.


      3. **Compare the Heights**: Now, we compare the two heights. The 30 Hudson Yards
      is 1,296 feet tall, and the Willis Tower is 1,451 feet tall to their respective
      architectural tops.


      Given these steps, it is clear that 1,296 feet (the height of 30 Hudson Yards)
      is less than 1,451 feet (the height of the Willis Tower).


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'
