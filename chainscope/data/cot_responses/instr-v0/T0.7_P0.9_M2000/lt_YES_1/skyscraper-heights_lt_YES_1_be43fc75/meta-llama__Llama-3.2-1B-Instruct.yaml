      1. **Height comparison**: The Petronas Towers and the Shanghai World Financial
      Center are both famous skyscrapers. To determine which one is taller, we need

      provides the exact heights of these two buildings. However, I can suggest that
      you check their official websites or reputable sources such as Wikipedia, Skyscraper
      Center, or Emporis for the most accurate information.

      meters (1,483 feet) tall, and the Shanghai World Financial Center is approximately
      632 meters (2,073 feet) tall.


      3. **Comparison**: Now, let''s compare the heights of the two buildings. If
      the Petronas Towers are taller than the Shanghai World Financial Center, then
      the Petronas Towers are shorter than the Shanghai World Financial Center. If
      the Petronas Towers are shorter than the Shanghai World Financial Center, then

      meters).


      The 30 Hudson Yards stands at 1,368 feet (417 meters).
