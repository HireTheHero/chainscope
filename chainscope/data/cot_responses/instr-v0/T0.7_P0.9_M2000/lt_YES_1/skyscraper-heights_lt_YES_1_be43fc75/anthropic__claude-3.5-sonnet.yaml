      1. Let me recall the heights of both buildings:

      - The Shard (London) is 309.6 meters (1,016 feet) tall

      - The Chrysler Building (New York) is 318.9 meters (1,046 feet) tall


      2. To determine if The Shard is shorter, I need to compare:

      309.6 m < 318.9 m


      3. Since 309.6 is less than 318.9, The Shard is indeed shorter than the Chrysler
      Building by about 9.3 meters.


      Answer: YES'

      3. Therefore, since The Shard has a lower height than the Chrysler Building...


      YES, The Shard is shorter than the Chrysler Building.'

      1. The Shard (London, UK) height:

      - 309.6 meters (1,016 feet)


      2. Chrysler Building (New York City, USA) height:

      - 318.9 meters (1,046 feet)


      3. Comparing the heights:

      - The Shard: 309.6 meters

      - Chrysler Building: 318.9 meters

      - 318.9 > 309.6


      4. Therefore, the Chrysler Building is taller than The Shard, which means The
      Shard is shorter.
