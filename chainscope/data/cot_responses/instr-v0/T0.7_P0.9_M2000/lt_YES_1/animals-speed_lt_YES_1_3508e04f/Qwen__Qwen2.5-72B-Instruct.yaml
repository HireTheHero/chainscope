      2. **Cheetah''s Speed**: Cheetahs are renowned for being the fastest land animals.
      They can reach speeds of up to about 70 miles per hour (113 kilometers per hour)
      over short distances.


      3. **Comparison**: Since a cheetah can run faster than a lion, it means that
      a lion can indeed run slower than a cheetah.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.'

      1. **Kangaroo''s Speed**: Kangaroos are known for their powerful hind legs that

      Now, comparing the two:

      - The maximum speed of a kangaroo is 56 kilometers per hour.

    b955eae2-3ff5-4e07-a1fe-bbfff0f64385: 'To determine if a zebra can run slower
      than a tiger, we need to compare their maximum running speeds:


      1. **Zebra''s Speed**: Zebras are known for their speed and agility, which helps
      them evade predators. The average top speed of a zebra is about 35-40 miles
      per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour).


      2. **Tiger''s Speed**: Tigers are also fast runners, especially when chasing
      prey. The average top speed of a tiger is about 35-40 miles per hour (56-64
      kilometers per hour), but they can reach short bursts of up to 50 miles per
      hour (80 kilometers per hour) over short distances.

      - Zebras typically run at 35-40 mph.

      - Tigers typically run at 35-40 mph, with short bursts up to 50 mph.


      Since tigers can achieve higher speeds in short bursts, it is possible for a
