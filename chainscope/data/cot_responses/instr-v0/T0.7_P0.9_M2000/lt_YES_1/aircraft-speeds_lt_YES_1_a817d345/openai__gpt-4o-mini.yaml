      1. **Boeing 787 Dreamliner**: The Boeing 787 has a cruise speed of approximately
      Mach 0.80, which translates to about 560-580 miles per hour (mph) depending
      on altitude and specific variant.


      2. **Boeing 747-400**: The Boeing 747-400 has a cruise speed of approximately

      2. **Maximum Speed of F-22 Raptor**: The F-22 Raptor has a maximum speed of
      approximately Mach 2.25 as well, but it is also capable of sustained supersonic
      flight without afterburners (supercruise). Its maximum speed is around 2,414
      km/h (1,500 mph).


      3. **Comparison**: While both aircraft have similar maximum speeds (around Mach
      2.25), the F-22 Raptor is generally considered more advanced in terms of performance
      capabilities, including acceleration and maneuverability. However, in terms
      of raw maximum speed, they are quite comparable.


      Therefore, the MiG-29 is not definitively slower than the F-22 Raptor, as they
      have similar maximum speeds.


      So, the answer is **NO**.'
    e89ebc61-c8c0-4fb5-9b56-18faac2cf0fa: 'To determine whether the MiG-29 is slower
      than the F-22 Raptor, we need to consider their maximum speeds.


      1. **MiG-29 Speed**: The MiG-29 has a maximum speed of approximately Mach 2.25,
      which translates to around 2,400 km/h (1,500 mph) at altitude.


      2. **F-22 Raptor Speed**: The F-22 Raptor has a maximum speed of about Mach
      2.25 as well, but it is often cited that it can achieve this speed with supercruise
      capabilities (sustained supersonic flight without afterburners), making it operationally
      effective at high speeds.


      3. **Comparison**: Both aircraft have a similar maximum speed in terms of Mach
      number, but the F-22 Raptor has superior technology, maneuverability, and overall
      performance characteristics that might affect their operational speed capabilities.


      However, focusing strictly on maximum speed:


      - The MiG-29 and F-22 are roughly equivalent in terms of their maximum speed
      (both around Mach 2.25).


      Based on this analysis, the MiG-29 is not slower than the F-22 Raptor; they
      are comparable in maximum speed.


      Final answer: NO.'
