      jet-powered aircraft.

      - Jet engines, used in the Airbus A320, provide more thrust and enable higher
      speeds.

      1. The F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation stealth fighter aircraft, while the

      2. Generally, newer generation fighter aircraft are designed with improved technology,
      including more advanced engines and aerodynamics.


      3. The F-22 Raptor is powered by two Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 turbofan engines,

      the F-22 to reach speeds of up to Mach 2.25 (about 1,500 mph).


      4. The F-14 Tomcat is powered by two General Electric F110-GE-400 turbofan engines,

      the F-14 to reach speeds of up to Mach 2.34 (about 1,544 mph).

      slower than the Boeing 737-800, let''s consider the following steps:


      1. The Airbus A380 is a large, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner designed
      for long-haul flights. It is the world''s largest passenger airliner.


      2. The Boeing 737-800 is a narrow-body, twin-engine jet airliner designed for
      short to medium-haul flights. It is part of the Boeing 737 Next Generation family.


      3. Typically, larger aircraft like the A380 have a higher maximum speed compared
      to smaller aircraft like the 737-800. This is because larger aircraft are designed
      to fly at higher altitudes where the air is thinner, allowing them to achieve
      higher speeds more efficiently.
