      Step 2: Research and compare the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Boeing 747-400
      in terms of these factors.


      Step 3: Analyze the findings:


      - Engine power: Both aircraft are equipped with powerful engines. The Boeing
      747-400 uses engines like the Pratt & Whitney PW4000 or Rolls-Royce RB211-524G,
      while the Boeing 787 Dreamliner uses engines like the General Electric GEnx

      Step 2: Research and compare the performance characteristics of both aircraft
      models.


      The F-4 Phantom II and MiG-29 are both fighter jets that were in service during
      the Cold War era. They were designed for different purposes and have distinct
      performance characteristics.


      The F-4 Phantom II:

      - First flew in 1960.

      - It was primarily designed as an all-weather day fighter with the capability
      of operating in night conditions.

      - It has a maximum speed of around Mach 2.25 (approximately 1,550 mph or 2,495
      km/h).

      - The Phantom II has a relatively low maneuverability due to its design and
      weight.


      The MiG-29:

      - First flew in 1975.

      - It was designed as a multi-role fighter capable of air-to-air combat and ground
      attack.

      - The MiG-29 has a maximum speed of around Mach 2.35 (approximately 1,650 mph
      or 2,655 km/h).

      - It has better maneuverability than the F-4 Phantom II due to its more advanced
      design and lighter weight.


      Step 3: Compare the maximum speeds of both aircraft models.


      The MiG-29 has a higher maximum speed (Mach 2.35) compared to the F-4 Phantom
      II (Mach 2.25).
