    69846029-7534-4bf3-8e7b-85c410219d2f: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s consider the typical cruise speeds of these aircraft:

      - Airbus A320 (narrow-body, short to medium-range aircraft): Typical cruise
      speed around 828-871 km/h (511-541 mph)

      - Airbus A380 (wide-body, long-haul aircraft): Typical cruise speed around 907
      km/h (563 mph)


      2. Comparing the cruise speeds:

      - A380 is slightly faster than A320


      3. Key factors affecting speed:

      - Aircraft design

      - Purpose (short-haul vs long-haul)

      - Engine type and configuration


      4. Conclusion:

      The A380 is actually faster than the A320, not slower.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO (Airbus A320 is NOT slower than Airbus A380)'
