      Since the A380 cruises at Mach 0.85 while the 737-800 cruises at Mach 0.78,
      the A380 is actually faster, not slower.

      1. First, let''s find the maximum cruise speed of Airbus A380:

      - A380''s typical cruise speed is Mach 0.85

      - This equals approximately 560 mph (902 km/h)


      2. Now, let''s find the maximum cruise speed of Boeing 737-800:

      - 737-800''s typical cruise speed is Mach 0.82

      - This equals approximately 544 mph (876 km/h)


      3. Comparing the speeds:

      - A380: 560 mph

      - 737-800: 544 mph

      - The A380 is actually faster by about 16 mph


      4. Therefore, since the A380 is faster than the 737-800, it cannot be slower.
