      first spacecraft to escape Earth''s gravity.


      TIROS-1:

      - TIROS-1 (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was the first successful
      weather satellite launched by the United States.

      - It was launched on April 1, 1960.

      - Its mission was to test experimental television techniques that could be used
