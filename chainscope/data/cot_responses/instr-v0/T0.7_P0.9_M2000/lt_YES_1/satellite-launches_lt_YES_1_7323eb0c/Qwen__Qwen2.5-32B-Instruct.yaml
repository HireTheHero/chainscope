    1f476c33-8307-48a2-8777-75d34aa549dd: 'To determine if Voyager 1 was launched
      before GPS 1, we need to look at the launch dates of both.


      Step 1: Find the launch date of Voyager 1.

      - Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977.


      Step 2: Identify what is meant by "GPS 1."

      - The first GPS satellite, Block I GPS-IIR, was not part of the initial operational
      system but rather a prototype. The first of these experimental satellites was
      launched on February 22, 1978.

      - However, the first GPS satellite of the operational system, which could be
      considered as GPS 1 in a more practical sense, was launched later in the GPS
      development timeline. But for comparison purposes, we will use the date of the
      first GPS satellite''s launch.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      - Voyager 1 launch date: September 5, 1977

      - First GPS satellite launch date: February 22, 1978


      Based on this information, Voyager 1 was indeed launched before the first GPS
      satellite.
