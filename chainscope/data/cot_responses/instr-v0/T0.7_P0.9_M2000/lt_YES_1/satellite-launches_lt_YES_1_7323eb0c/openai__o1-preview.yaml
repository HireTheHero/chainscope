      1.


      **Step 1: Determine the launch date of Early Bird (Intelsat I).**


      Early Bird, officially known as Intelsat I, was the world''s first commercial
      communications satellite. It was launched on **April 6, 1965**. Early Bird provided
      the first scheduled transoceanic television service and communications between
      North America and Europe.


      **Step 2: Determine the launch date of Landsat 1.**


      Landsat 1, originally named Earth Resources Technology Satellite 1 (ERTS-1),
      was the first satellite in the Landsat program dedicated to Earth observation.
      It was launched on **July 23, 1972**.


      **Step 3: Compare the launch dates.**


      - Early Bird (Intelsat I): April 6, 1965

      - Landsat 1: July 23, 1972


      **Conclusion:**


      Early Bird was launched approximately **seven years before** Landsat 1. Therefore,
      the answer is **Yes**, Early Bird was launched before Landsat 1.'
