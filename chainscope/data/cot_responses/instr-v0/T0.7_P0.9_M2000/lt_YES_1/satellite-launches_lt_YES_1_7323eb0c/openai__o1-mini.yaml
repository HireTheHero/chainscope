      step:


      **Step 1: Determine the Launch Date of Voyager 1**

      - **Voyager 1** was launched by NASA on **September 5, 1977**.


      **Step 2: Determine the Launch Date of GPS I**

      - The **GPS (Global Positioning System)** began with the launch of its first
      satellites in the **late 1970s**.

      - Specifically, the **first GPS satellites** (Block I/Navstar satellites) were
      launched starting in **1978**.


      **Step 3: Compare the Launch Dates**

      - **Voyager 1**: September 5, 1977

      - **First GPS Satellites**: Starting in 1978


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Voyager 1 was launched in September 1977 and the first GPS satellites
      were launched starting in 1978, **Voyager 1 was indeed launched before GPS I**.
