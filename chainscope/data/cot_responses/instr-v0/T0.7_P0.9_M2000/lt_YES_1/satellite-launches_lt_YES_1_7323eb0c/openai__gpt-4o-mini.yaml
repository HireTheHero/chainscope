      1. **Voyager 1**: This spacecraft was launched by NASA on September 5, 1977.
      It was designed for long-term missions to study the outer planets and is now
      in interstellar space.


      2. **GPS 1**: The first satellite in the Global Positioning System (GPS) was
      launched on February 22, 1978. This satellite marked the beginning of the GPS
      satellite constellation.
