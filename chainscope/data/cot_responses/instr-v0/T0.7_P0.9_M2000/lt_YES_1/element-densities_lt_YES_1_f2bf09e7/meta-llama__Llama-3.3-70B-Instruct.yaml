    9d8195a6-3700-4038-b3c8-9766a45a0a7c: 'To determine if sodium is less dense than
      magnesium, let''s consider the following steps:


      1. **Identify the Atomic Mass and Atomic Radius**: The density of an element
      is inversely related to its atomic volume (which can be approximated by the
      atomic radius for simplicity) and directly related to its atomic mass. Sodium
      (Na) has an atomic number of 11, and magnesium (Mg) has an atomic number of
      12.


      2. **Compare Atomic Mass**: The atomic mass of sodium is approximately 22.99
      u (unified atomic mass units), and the atomic mass of magnesium is approximately
      24.305 u. This means magnesium has a slightly higher atomic mass than sodium.


      3. **Consider Atomic Radius**: Generally, as you move down a group in the periodic
      table, the atomic radius increases due to the addition of new energy levels
      (shells). Sodium and magnesium are in the same group (Group 2, the alkaline
      earth metals for magnesium and Group 1 for sodium, but they are adjacent groups),
      so we should also consider their positions. Sodium is above magnesium in the
      periodic table if we were to align groups, but since they''re in different groups,
      we directly compare: Sodium''s atomic radius is about 186 pm, and magnesium''s
      is about 160 pm. This indicates sodium has a larger atomic radius than magnesium.


      4. **Calculate Density**: Density = Mass / Volume. Since we''re comparing and
      not calculating exact densities, we can infer based on the mass and volume (related
      to atomic radius). Sodium has a lower atomic mass but a larger atomic radius
      compared to magnesium.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that sodium has a lower atomic mass and a larger atomic
      radius (indicating a larger volume) than magnesium, sodium would indeed be less
      dense than magnesium, as density is directly proportional to mass and inversely
      proportional to volume.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$'

      2. **Recall the trend in alkali metals**: In the alkali metal group, as you
