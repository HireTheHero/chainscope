      The question asks if potassium is less dense than sodium. Density is the mass
      per unit volume of a substance.


      Step 2: Recall the properties of potassium and sodium

      Both potassium (K) and sodium (Na) are alkali metals in the periodic table.
      They are in the same group, which means they share similar chemical properties.


      Step 3: Consider the atomic structure

      Potassium has an atomic number of 19 and an atomic mass of 39.1 g/mol. Sodium
      has an atomic number of 11 and an atomic mass of 22.99 g/mol. Both elements
      have similar electronic structures, but potassium has more protons, neutrons,
      and electrons, making it heavier.


      Step 4: Analyze the relationship between atomic mass and density

      Density depends on both mass and volume. As potassium has a greater atomic mass
      than sodium, it also has a greater mass for the same volume.


      Step 5: Compare the densities

      Since potassium has a greater atomic mass than sodium, and both elements have
      similar atomic volumes, potassium will have a greater density than sodium.


      Conclusion: NO, potassium is not less dense than sodium. It is denser than sodium.'

      Step 1: Identify the elements in question.

      We are comparing potassium (K) and sodium (Na).


      Step 2: Find the atomic masses of both elements.

      The atomic mass of potassium is approximately 39.0983 g/mol.

      The atomic mass of sodium is approximately 22.9897 g/mol.


      Step 3: Find the atomic radii of both elements.

      The atomic radius of sodium is approximately 186 pm (picometers).

      1. Identify the atomic weights of lithium and potassium.

      2. Compare the atomic weights of lithium and potassium.

      3. Understand how atomic weight relates to density.

      4. Evaluate the relationship between the atomic weights and density of lithium
      and potassium.


      Step 1: Atomic weights

      - Lithium (Li): Approximately 6.94 g/mol

      - Potassium (K): Approximately 39.10 g/mol


      Step 2: Comparison of atomic weights

      - The atomic weight of lithium (6.94 g/mol) is significantly lower than the
      atomic weight of potassium (39.10 g/mol).


      Step 3: Atomic weight and density relationship

      - Generally, elements with lower atomic weights tend to have lower densities,
      but this is not a strict rule. Density also depends on the atomic radius and
      how closely atoms are packed in the solid state.


      Step 4: Evaluation of lithium and potassium

      - Both lithium and potassium are alkali metals, which have similar structures
      in their solid states. Lithium has a smaller atomic radius than potassium, which
      means its atoms can be packed more closely together.
