      1. **Identify the Elements**: Potassium (K) and Sodium (Na) are both alkali
      metals found in Group 1 of the periodic table.


      2. **Understand Periodic Trends**: In the periodic table, density generally
      increases as you move down within the same group due to increasing atomic mass
      and decreasing atomic radius (which affects packing efficiency in the solid
      state).


      3. **Compare Positions**: Sodium is in period 3 of the periodic table, while
      potassium is in period 4. Since potassium is lower in the periodic table, it
      has a higher atomic number and larger atomic radius compared to sodium.


      4. **Density Comparison**: Given that potassium is below sodium in the same
      group, it will have a larger atomic size and thus, typically, a lower density
      than sodium due to less efficient packing of atoms in its crystal structure.

      potassium, we need to consider their atomic structures and periodic trends.


      Step 1: Locate lithium (Li) and potassium (K) on the periodic table.

      - Lithium is in Group 1 (alkali metals) and Period 2.

      - Potassium is also in Group 1 but in Period 4.


      Step 2: Understand periodic trend for density.

      - Within the same group (vertical column), as you go down the group, the number
      of electron shells increases, which generally increases atomic radius and decreases
      density due to the increased spacing between atoms.


      Step 3: Compare lithium and potassium specifically.

      - Since both are alkali metals, and lithium is above potassium in the same group,
      lithium should be more compact and have a smaller atomic radius.

      - Therefore, lithium would typically be more dense than potassium.
