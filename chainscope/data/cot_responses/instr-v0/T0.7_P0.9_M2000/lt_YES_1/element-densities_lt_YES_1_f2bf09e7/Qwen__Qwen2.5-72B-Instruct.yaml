      \   - Both sodium and potassium have a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure,\
      \ which means they pack in a similar way at the atomic level.\n\n3. **Determine\
      \ the volume occupied by atoms**:\n   - Since both elements have the same crystal\
      \ structure, the volume occupied by each atom in the crystal lattice will be\
      \ influenced by the size of the atoms.\n   - Potassium atoms are larger than\
      \ sodium atoms due to the additional electron shell.\n\n4. **Calculate the density**:\n\
      \   - Density is given by the formula: \\( \\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\\
      text{Volume}} \\)\n   - For elements with the same crystal structure, the density\
      \ depends on the ratio of the atomic mass to the volume occupied by the atoms.\n\
      \   - Since potassium has a higher atomic mass and larger atomic size, it will\
      \ occupy more volume per atom, but the increase in mass is more significant\
      \ than the increase in volume.\n\n5. **Compare the densities**:\n   - The density\
