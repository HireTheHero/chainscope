      \ An alkali metal with an atomic number of 3.\n   - **Potassium (K):** Also\
      \ an alkali metal with an atomic number of 19.\n\n2. **Determine the Densities:**\n\
      \   - **Density of Lithium:** Approximately 0.534 grams per cubic centimeter\
      \ (g/cm\xB3).\n   - **Density of Potassium:** Approximately 0.862 grams per\
      \ cubic centimeter (g/cm\xB3).\n\n3. **Compare the Densities:**\n   - **Lithium's\
      \ density (0.534 g/cm\xB3)** is less than **Potassium's density (0.862 g/cm\xB3\
      )**.\n\n**Answer:** YES"
