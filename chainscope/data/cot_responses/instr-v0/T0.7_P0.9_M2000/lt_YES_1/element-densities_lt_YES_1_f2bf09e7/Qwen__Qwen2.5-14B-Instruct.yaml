      than magnesium (Mg), we need to consider the physical properties of both elements.


      Step 1: Understand Density

      Density is defined as mass per unit volume. It is calculated using the formula:

      \[ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} \]


      Step 2: Compare Atomic Structure and Size

      Sodium and magnesium are both in the same period (3rd period) but in different
      groups (sodium is in group 1, while magnesium is in group 2). Magnesium has
      a larger atomic number (12) compared to sodium (11). This means that magnesium
      atoms have more protons and electrons than sodium atoms. Additionally, magnesium
      atoms are slightly larger than sodium atoms due to the increased electron shell
      interactions.


      Step 3: Consider Crystal Structure

      Both elements form metallic structures, but their crystal structures can affect
      density. Sodium forms a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, while magnesium
      forms a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure. The HCP structure is generally
      more compact, which might contribute to higher density.


      Step 4: Look at Known Densities

      From standard chemistry tables, we know:

      - The density of sodium (Na) is approximately \(0.97 \, \text{g/cm}^3\).

      - The density of magnesium (Mg) is approximately \(1.74 \, \text{g/cm}^3\).


      Step 5: Draw Conclusion

      Given the densities, it''s clear that sodium is indeed less dense than magnesium.

      \ than sodium; in fact, potassium is more dense than sodium. This might seem\
      \ counterintuitive based on the initial reasoning about atomic radius, but empirical\
      \ data shows that sodium has a density of approximately 0.97 g/cm\xB3 while\
      \ potassium has a density of approximately 0.86 g/cm\xB3 at room temperature.\
      \ Thus, potassium is actually less dense than sodium. \n\nSo, the correct answer\
      \ is **YES**, potassium is less dense than sodium."
