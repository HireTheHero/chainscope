      \ Density**: Density is defined as mass per unit volume (\u03C1 = m/V). To compare\
      \ the densities of two elements, we need to consider their atomic masses and\
      \ volumes.\n\n2. **Atomic Mass Comparison**: \n   - Lithium (Li) has an atomic\
      \ mass of approximately 6.941 g/mol.\n   - Potassium (K) has an atomic mass\
      \ of approximately 39.10 g/mol.\n   \n   Since potassium has a higher atomic\
      \ mass than lithium, it suggests that potassium might be more dense.\n\n3. **Density\
      \ in Elemental Form**: \n   - The density of elemental lithium is approximately\
      \ 0.534 g/cm\xB3 at room temperature.\n   - The density of elemental potassium\
