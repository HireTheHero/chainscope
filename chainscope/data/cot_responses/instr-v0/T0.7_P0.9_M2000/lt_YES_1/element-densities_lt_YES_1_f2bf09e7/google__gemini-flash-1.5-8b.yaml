      2.  Atomic radii increase down a group in the periodic table.  Potassium is
      below Lithium.


      3.  Density is mass per unit volume.  Larger atoms generally have a lower density,
      all other things being equal, because the same mass is spread out over a larger
      volume.


      4.  Therefore, Potassium, with its larger atomic radius, is less dense than
      Lithium.

      alkali metals.

      2. Alkali metals are generally soft and have low densities.

      3.  Potassium is in the same column as Lithium on the periodic table, but is
      further down.

      4.  Going down a column, atomic radii increase.

      5.  Larger atomic radii usually correlate with greater atomic mass and volume.

      6.  Greater volume for the same mass means lower density.

      7.  Therefore, Potassium is less dense than Lithium.

      3.  Density is mass per unit volume.  A larger atomic radius generally means
      a larger atomic volume.


      4.  Since Potassium has a larger atomic radius and thus a larger atomic volume,
      and the mass of a Potassium atom is greater than that of a Lithium atom, the
      density of Lithium will likely be higher.


      5.  Therefore, Lithium is likely denser than Potassium.

      alkali metals.

      2.  Atomic mass of Lithium is 6.94 g/mol, and Potassium is 39.10 g/mol.

      3.  Potassium has a significantly higher atomic mass than Lithium.

      4.  Density is mass per unit volume.

      5.  If two elements have the same volume, the one with the higher mass will
      have a higher density.

      6.  Since Potassium has a much higher mass than Lithium, and assuming similar
      volumes, Potassium will be denser than Lithium.
