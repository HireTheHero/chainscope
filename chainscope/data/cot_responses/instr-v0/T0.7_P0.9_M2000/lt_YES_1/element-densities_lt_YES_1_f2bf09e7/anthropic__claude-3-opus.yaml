      1. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. To compare the densities of sodium
      and magnesium, we need to know their respective masses and volumes.


      2. Sodium and magnesium are both elements on the periodic table. Their densities
      can be found by looking up their standard atomic weights and considering their
      crystal structures.


      3. The standard atomic weight of sodium (Na) is 22.98976928 g/mol, and its crystal

      dense than HCP structures.


      6. Given that sodium has a slightly lower atomic weight and a BCC crystal structure,

      2. Sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg) are both elements in the periodic table. Sodium
      is in period 3 and group 1, while magnesium is in period 3 and group 2.


      3. In general, atomic mass increases from left to right across a period and

      has an atomic number of 12. Therefore, magnesium has a higher atomic mass than
      sodium.


      4. In general, atomic radius decreases from left to right across a period and
      increases from top to bottom in a group. Since sodium and magnesium are in the
      same period, and sodium is to the left of magnesium, sodium has a larger atomic
      radius than magnesium.


      5. With a larger atomic radius and smaller atomic mass, sodium atoms will occupy

      than lead, let''s think through this step by step:


      1. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. A material with higher density
      will have more mass in the same volume compared to a material with lower density.


      2. Silver and lead are both metals, but they have different properties.


      3. Silver is used in jewelry, cutlery, and electronics due to its luster, conductivity,
      and malleability. These properties suggest that silver atoms are relatively
      loosely packed, allowing for easy shaping and movement of electrons.


      4. Lead, on the other hand, is known for its heavy weight and is used in applications
      such as car batteries, radiation shielding, and ammunition. The heaviness of
      lead suggests that its atoms are tightly packed, resulting in a high mass per
      unit volume.


      5. The atomic number of silver is 47, while the atomic number of lead is 82.
      A higher atomic number indicates a larger number of protons and neutrons in
      the nucleus, contributing to a higher atomic mass.


      6. Given the heavy nature of lead and its high atomic number, it is likely that
      lead has a higher density compared to silver.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is silver less dense than lead?" is:


      YES.'

      1. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. So, to compare the densities
      of chromium and tin, we need to know their respective densities or their atomic
      masses and atomic radii.


      2. Chromium (Cr) has an atomic number of 24, while tin (Sn) has an atomic number
      of 50.


      3. In the periodic table, chromium is located in period 4 and group 6, whereas
      tin is located in period 5 and group 14.


      4. Generally, elements in higher periods have larger atomic radii due to the
      presence of additional electron shells.


      5. With more protons in its nucleus, tin also has a greater atomic mass than
      chromium.


      6. Considering the larger atomic radius and higher atomic mass of tin compared
      to chromium, we can infer that tin has a lower density than chromium.


      Therefore, the answer is NO; chromium is not less dense than tin. In fact, chromium
      is denser than tin.'

      than platinum, let''s consider the following steps:


      1. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. A substance with higher density
      will have more mass in the same volume compared to a substance with lower density.


      2. Gold has an atomic number of 79, while platinum has an atomic number of 78.
      This means that a gold atom has one more proton and electron than a platinum
      atom.


      3. However, platinum has a larger atomic mass (195.08 u) compared to gold (196.97
      u). This indicates that platinum has more neutrons than gold.


      4. In the periodic table, platinum is positioned below gold. Elements in the
      same group (column) typically have similar properties, but as we move down the
      group, the atomic size increases due to the addition of electron shells.


      5. The larger atomic size of platinum suggests that it has a greater volume
      per atom compared to gold.


      6. Considering that platinum has a larger atomic mass and volume than gold,
      we can infer that platinum atoms are more loosely packed than gold atoms.


      7. As a result, for the same volume, gold would have more mass than platinum.

      Step 1: Understand the concept of density.

      Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. It is calculated by dividing
      the mass of an object by its volume.


      Step 2: Consider the periodic table.

      Lithium (Li) and potassium (K) are both alkali metals and are located in the
      first column of the periodic table. Lithium is in period 2, while potassium
      is in period 4.


      Step 3: Understand the trend in density for elements in the same group.

      In general, as you move down a group in the periodic table, the density of the
      elements increases. This is because the atomic mass increases more rapidly than
      the atomic size.


      Step 4: Compare lithium and potassium.

      Since potassium is located below lithium in the same group, it is expected to
      have a higher density than lithium.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is lithium less dense than potassium?"
      is:

      than potassium, let''s think through this step by step:


      1. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. So, to compare the densities
      of lithium and potassium, we need to consider their atomic masses and atomic
      radii.


      2. Lithium (Li) and potassium (K) are both alkali metals, located in the first
      column of the periodic table.


      3. As we move down the periodic table, the atomic number increases, and so does
      the atomic mass. This means that potassium, being below lithium, has a greater
      atomic mass than lithium.


      4. However, as we move down the periodic table, the atomic radius also increases
      due to the addition of electron shells. This means that potassium has a larger
      atomic radius than lithium.


      5. Since density is directly proportional to mass and inversely proportional
      to volume, the larger atomic radius of potassium (which translates to a larger
      volume) will have a more significant impact on its density than its greater
      atomic mass.


      6. Therefore, despite having a greater atomic mass, potassium will have a lower
      density compared to lithium because of its significantly larger atomic radius.


      So, to answer the question: Is lithium less dense than potassium?


      NO, lithium is not less dense than potassium. In fact, lithium is more dense
      than potassium.'
