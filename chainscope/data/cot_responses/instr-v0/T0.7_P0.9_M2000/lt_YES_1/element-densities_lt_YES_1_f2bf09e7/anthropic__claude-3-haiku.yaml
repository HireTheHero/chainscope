      5. Lead (Pb) has a higher atomic number (82) compared to silver (Ag) which has
      an atomic number of 47.

      6. Therefore, the atomic volume of lead is smaller than the atomic volume of
      silver.

      7. Since lead has a higher atomic weight and a smaller atomic volume compared
      to silver, lead has a higher density than silver.
