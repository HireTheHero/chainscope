      1. Mercury is a liquid metal at room temperature.

      2. Gold is a solid metal at room temperature.

      3. Density is defined as mass per unit volume.

      4. Since gold is a solid, its volume is larger than its mass. This means that
      gold''s density is lower than its mass.

      5. Mercury, being a liquid, has a smaller volume than its mass, which means
      its density is higher than its mass.

      Step 1: Recall the atomic weights of silver and lead. Silver''s atomic weight
      is approximately 107.868 g/mol, while lead''s atomic weight is approximately
      207.2 g/mol.


      Step 2: Consider the molar masses of silver and lead. Since the molar mass is
      the atomic weight multiplied by the number of atoms in a mole (which is Avogadro''s
      number, 6.022 x 10^23), both silver and lead have the same number of atoms in
      a mole. Therefore, their molar masses are the same.


      Step 3: Since the molar masses of silver and lead are the same, and they have
      the same number of atoms in a mole, their densities should be the same. Density
      is defined as mass per unit volume (density = mass/volume). If the mass of silver
      and lead are the same, and they have the same number of atoms, they should have
      the same volume (and therefore the same density).

      To determine if potassium is less dense than sodium, we need to consider the
      atomic masses of both elements and their atomic structures.


      1. **Atomic Mass:** Potassium (K) has an atomic mass of approximately 39.1 g/mol,
      while Sodium (Na) has an atomic mass of approximately 22.9 g/mol.

      2. **Atomic Structure:** Both potassium and sodium are alkali metals in Group
      1 of the periodic table. They have similar atomic structures, with one electron
      in their outermost shell, which makes them highly reactive.

      3. **Density Calculation:** Density is calculated by dividing the mass of an
      element by its volume. Since both elements are atoms, we can use their atomic
      masses as a proxy for their masses in any given volume. The key here is to compare
      their volumes relative to their atomic masses.

      4. **Volume Comparison:** Potassium has a larger atomic mass than sodium. Given
      that the atomic mass is a measure of the total mass of an atom, including protons,
      neutrons, and electrons, a larger atomic mass typically corresponds to a larger
      atomic volume. However, the actual volume of an atom is determined by the electrons
      and protons, not just the mass. For alkali metals, the difference in atomic
      volume is relatively small compared to their atomic masses.

      5. **Conclusion:** Considering the atomic masses and the fact that the atomic
      volume is relatively small for both elements, we can infer that potassium, having
      a larger atomic mass than sodium, would actually be more dense than sodium.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**, potassium is not less dense than sodium.'

      than sodium, I''ll follow these steps:


      1. Look up the atomic masses of potassium (K) and sodium (Na) on the periodic
      table. The atomic mass of potassium is 39.1 g/mol, and the atomic mass of sodium
      is 22.99 g/mol.

      2. Since density is defined as mass per unit volume, we need to consider the
      molar masses of both elements. A molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance.
      Since both potassium and sodium are elements, their molar masses are equal to
      their atomic masses.

      3. Now, let''s consider the atomic masses of potassium and sodium. Potassium
      has an atomic mass of 39.1 g/mol, while sodium has an atomic mass of 22.99 g/mol.
      This means that a mole of potassium has a mass that is approximately 1.7 times
      greater than a mole of sodium.

      4. Since a mole of any substance has the same volume (1 mole = 6.022 x 10^23
      particles), the density of a substance is directly proportional to its atomic
      mass. This means that the substance with the higher atomic mass will have a
      higher density.

      5. Based on the above reasoning, since potassium has a higher atomic mass than
      sodium, potassium will have a higher density than sodium.

      2. Potassium (K) has an atomic mass of 39.1 g/mol, while sodium (Na) has an

      1. We know that density is defined as mass per unit volume (density = mass/volume).

      2. We need to compare the densities of tin and iron.

      3. To do this, we need to know the atomic masses of tin and iron.

      4. According to the periodic table, the atomic mass of tin (Sn) is approximately
      118.71 g/mol, and the atomic mass of iron (Fe) is approximately 55.85 g/mol.

      5. Since the atomic mass of iron is less than that of tin, iron has a lower
      mass for the same volume.

      6. Therefore, iron has a higher density than tin, since density is inversely
      proportional to volume (i.e., less mass for the same volume means higher density).

      3. The density of an element is typically determined by the mass and volume

      0.534 g/cm\xB3 (lithium) < 0.853 g/cm\xB3 (potassium)\n\nSo, lithium is indeed\
      \ less dense than potassium.\n\nAnswer: YES"
    8af8bcc4-f76f-4467-8875-c0ddbb816be3: 'Let''s break it down step by step:


      1. We know that lithium and potassium are both alkali metals, which are in the
      same group (Group 1) of the periodic table.

      2. Since they are in the same group, their atomic radii are likely to be similar.

      3. However, atomic radius is not the same as density. Density is a measure of
      mass per unit volume.

      4. To compare the densities of lithium and potassium, we need to consider their
      atomic masses and molar volumes.

      5. The atomic mass of lithium is approximately 6.94 g/mol, while the atomic
      mass of potassium is approximately 39.09 g/mol.

      6. Since potassium has a much larger atomic mass, it has a much larger molar
      mass (the mass of a mole of atoms).

      7. The molar volume of a substance is the volume occupied by one mole of atoms.
      Since potassium has a larger atomic mass, its molar volume is also larger.

      8. However, the molar volume of lithium is likely to be smaller than that of
      potassium due to its smaller atomic radius.

      9. As a result, the density of lithium is likely to be higher than that of potassium.


      Therefore, my answer is: **NO**, lithium is not less dense than potassium.'
    a7b34b3e-1cfa-4e29-9b38-11f6e80e9615: "To answer this question, I'll consider\
      \ the atomic masses and atomic radii of lithium (Li) and potassium (K).\n\n\
      1. The atomic mass of lithium is 6.94 u (unified atomic mass units), and the\
      \ atomic mass of potassium is 39.09 u.\n2. The atomic radius of lithium is approximately\
      \ 152 pm, and the atomic radius of potassium is approximately 227 pm.\n3. Density\
      \ is calculated as mass per unit volume (\u03C1 = m/V), where m is the mass\
      \ and V is the volume. Since we're comparing densities, we can simplify the\
      \ calculation by comparing the mass-to-volume ratios.\n4. The mass-to-volume\
      \ ratio is related to the atomic mass and atomic radius: m/V = \u03C1 = \u03C1\
      \u2080 \\* (A / r\u2080\xB2), where \u03C1\u2080 is the density of the element,\
      \ A is the atomic mass, and r\u2080 is the atomic radius.\n5. Since the atomic\
      \ radii of lithium and potassium are different, and the atomic masses are different,\
      \ we need to consider how these differences affect the density.\n6. Potassium\
      \ has a larger atomic radius than lithium, which means its atoms are farther\
      \ apart. This would result in a lower density, since the same amount of mass\
      \ occupies a larger volume.\n7. Potassium also has a much larger atomic mass\
      \ than lithium, but this is not enough to overcome the effect of the larger\
      \ atomic radius.\n8. Therefore, considering both the atomic mass and atomic\
      \ radius, potassium is expected to be less dense than lithium.\n\nAnswer: **YES**"

      The atomic mass of lithium is approximately 6.94 u (unified atomic mass units).

      The atomic mass of potassium is approximately 39.09 u.


      Now, I need to think about what "density" means. Density is defined as mass
      per unit volume. Since both elements are elements with the same atomic structure
      (monatomic), their atomic volumes are likely similar.


      To determine which element is less dense, I can compare their atomic masses.
      A lower atomic mass corresponds to a lower density, assuming the same atomic
      volume.


      Comparing the atomic masses, lithium has a lower atomic mass than potassium.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'
