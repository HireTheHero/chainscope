      1. The River Rhine originates from the Swiss Alps and flows through several
      countries in Europe before emptying into the North Sea.

      2. The Colorado River originates from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and flows
      through the southwestern United States and northern Mexico before emptying into
      the Gulf of California.

      3. The length of the River Rhine is approximately 1,232 kilometers (766 miles).

      4. The length of the Colorado River is approximately 2,330 kilometers (1,450
