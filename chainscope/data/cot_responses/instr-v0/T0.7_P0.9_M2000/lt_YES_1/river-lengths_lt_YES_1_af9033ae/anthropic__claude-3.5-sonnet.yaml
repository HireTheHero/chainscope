      1. First, I need to recall the lengths of both rivers:

      - The Mississippi River is approximately 3,766 kilometers (2,340 miles) long

      - The Yangtze River is approximately 6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles) long


      2. Now I can compare the lengths:

      - 3,766 km < 6,300 km

      - 2,340 miles < 3,915 miles


      3. Since the Mississippi River''s length is less than the Yangtze River''s length,
      the Mississippi is indeed shorter.


      YES, the Mississippi River is shorter than the Yangtze River.'
