      The Amazon River is the largest river by volume and the second-longest river
      in the world. It runs for approximately 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) from
      its source in the Andes Mountains to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two rivers.

      The Amazon River is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) longer than the Yangtze
      River.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is the Yangtze River shorter than the
      Amazon River?" is:


      YES'

      is shorter than the Amazon River, let''s follow these steps:


      Step 1: Find the length of the Yangtze River.

      The Yangtze River is the longest river in Asia and the third-longest in the
      world. It flows for about 6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles) from the glaciers on
      the Tibetan Plateau in Qinghai eastward across southwest, central, and eastern
      China before emptying into the East China Sea at Shanghai.


      Step 2: Find the length of the Amazon River.

      The Amazon River is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world,
      and the disputed longest river in the world. It flows for approximately 6,400
      kilometers (4,000 miles) from its source in the Andes Mountains in Peru to its
      mouth in the Atlantic Ocean in Brazil.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two rivers.

      The Amazon River is approximately 6,400 kilometers long, while the Yangtze River
      is about 6,300 kilometers long. Therefore, the Yangtze River is slightly shorter
      than the Amazon River.


      Final answer: YES, the Yangtze River is shorter than the Amazon River.'
