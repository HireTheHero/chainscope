      step by step to determine if the River Rhine is shorter than the Colorado River.


      **Step 1: Determine the Length of the River Rhine**

      - The Rhine River is one of the major rivers in Europe.

      - It flows through several countries, including Switzerland, Germany, and the
      Netherlands.

      - The total length of the Rhine River is approximately **1,230 kilometers**
      (about **760 miles**).


      **Step 2: Determine the Length of the Colorado River**

      - The Colorado River is a significant river in the United States, primarily
      flowing through states like Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and California.

      - It also extends into Mexico.

      - The total length of the Colorado River is approximately **2,330 kilometers**
      (about **1,450 miles**).


      **Step 3: Compare the Lengths**

      - River Rhine: ~760 miles

      - Colorado River: ~1,450 miles


      Since **760 miles** (Rhine) is less than **1,450 miles** (Colorado), the River
      Rhine is indeed shorter than the Colorado River.
