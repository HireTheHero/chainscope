      To determine if the Mississippi River is shorter than the Yangtze River, I need
      to know the lengths of both rivers.


      According to my knowledge, the length of the Mississippi River is approximately
      2,320 miles (3,734 kilometers).


      The length of the Yangtze River is approximately 3,385 miles (5,443 kilometers).


      Now, let''s compare the lengths:


      3,385 miles (Yangtze River) > 2,320 miles (Mississippi River)


      So, the Yangtze River is longer than the Mississippi River.

      1. **Identify the lengths of both rivers**: According to various sources, the
      River Rhine is approximately 1,232 kilometers (766 miles) long, while the Colorado
      River is about 2,330 kilometers (1,450 miles) long.

      2. **Compare the lengths**: Now, I''ll compare the lengths of the two rivers.
      If the River Rhine is shorter, the answer is NO. If it''s longer, the answer
      is YES.

      3. **Make the comparison**: Based on the lengths I found, the Colorado River
      is significantly longer than the River Rhine.


      **Answer:** NO'
