      shorter than the Colorado River?", we need to compare their lengths.


      Step 1: Determine the length of the River Rhine.

      - The River Rhine originates in Switzerland and flows through Germany and the
      Netherlands before emptying into the North Sea.

      - Its total length is approximately 1,230 kilometers (764 miles).


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Colorado River.

      - The Colorado River starts in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and flows through
      several U.S. states and Mexico.

      - Its total length is approximately 2,330 kilometers (1,450 miles).


      Step 3: Compare the two lengths.

      - River Rhine: ~1,230 km (~764 mi)

      - Colorado River: ~2,330 km (~1,450 mi)


      Since 1,230 km is less than 2,330 km, the River Rhine is indeed shorter than
      the Colorado River.
