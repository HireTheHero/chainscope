      2. Determine the length of the River Seine.

      3. Determine the length of the River Rhine.

      4. Compare the lengths of the two rivers.


      The River Seine is a river that flows through Paris, France, and into the English
      Channel. The River Rhine originates in the Swiss Alps and flows through several
      European countries before emptying into the North Sea.


      The length of the River Seine is approximately 776 kilometers (482 miles).


      The length of the River Rhine is approximately 1,233 kilometers (766 miles).


      By comparing the lengths, it is clear that the River Rhine is longer than the
      River Seine.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO, the River Seine is not shorter than the River Rhine.'
