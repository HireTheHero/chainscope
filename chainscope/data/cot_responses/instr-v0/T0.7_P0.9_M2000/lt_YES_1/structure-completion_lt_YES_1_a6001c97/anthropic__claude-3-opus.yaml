      China''s Ming Dynasty section was completed before the Taj Mahal, let''s consider
      the following steps:


      Step 1: Determine the construction period of the Ming Dynasty Great Wall.

      The Ming Dynasty ruled China from 1368 to 1644. During this period, the Great
      Wall was extensively rebuilt, fortified, and expanded. The construction of the
      Ming Dynasty Great Wall lasted for about 200 years, with the most well-known
      sections being built during the 15th and 16th centuries.


      Step 2: Determine the construction period of the Taj Mahal.

      The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife,
      Mumtaz Mahal. The construction began in 1632 and was completed in approximately
      1653, taking around 21 years to build.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates of the Ming Dynasty Great Wall and the
      Taj Mahal.

      The Ming Dynasty Great Wall was primarily built during the 15th and 16th centuries,
      with construction lasting until the end of the Ming Dynasty in 1644. The Taj
      Mahal, on the other hand, was completed in 1653.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Was the Great Wall of China Ming Dynasty

      completed before the Suez Canal, we need to compare the completion dates of
      both structures.


      Step 1: Determine the completion date of the Taj Mahal.

      The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum located in Agra, India. It was commissioned by
      Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The construction
      began in 1632 and was completed in approximately 1653.


      Step 2: Determine the completion date of the Suez Canal.

      The Suez Canal is an artificial waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean
      Sea to the Red Sea. The construction of the modern Suez Canal began in 1859
      under the supervision of French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps. The canal was
      officially opened on November 17, 1869.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates.

      The Taj Mahal was completed in approximately 1653, while the Suez Canal was
      completed in 1869. Therefore, the Taj Mahal was completed more than 200 years
      before the Suez Canal.


      Final answer: YES, the Taj Mahal was completed before the Suez Canal.'
