      \ completed before the Empire State Building, let's examine the timelines of\
      \ both projects step by step.\n\n1. **Panama Canal Completion**:\n   - The Panama\
      \ Canal was officially completed and opened to traffic on **August 15, 1914**.\n\
      \   - Construction began in 1904 under U.S. administration after the failed\
      \ French attempt that started in 1881.\n   - The canal connected the Atlantic\
      \ and Pacific Oceans, significantly reducing maritime travel time.\n\n2. **Empire\
      \ State Building Completion**:\n   - The Empire State Building was completed\
      \ and officially opened on **May 1, 1931**.\n   - Construction began on March\
      \ 17, 1930, and remarkably took just over a year to complete.\n   - It held\
      \ the title of the world's tallest building for nearly 40 years.\n\n3. **Comparing\
      \ the Dates**:\n   - **1914** (Panama Canal completion) is **17 years earlier**\

      \ the Panama Canal was completed before the Empire State Building."

      1. **Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty):**\n   - The Ming Dynasty ruled China\
      \ from **1368 to 1644**.\n   - During this period, the Ming emperors undertook\
      \ extensive rebuilding and expansion of the Great Wall to defend against northern\
      \ invasions.\n   - The majority of the existing Great Wall structures that we\
      \ see today were built during the Ming Dynasty.\n   - The construction and reinforcement\
      \ efforts continued throughout the Ming era but effectively concluded by the\
      \ end of their reign in **1644**.\n\n2. **Taj Mahal:**\n   - The Taj Mahal,\
      \ located in Agra, India, was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan\
      \ as a mausoleum for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.\n   - Construction began\
      \ around **1632** and was completed around **1653**.\n   - It took approximately\
      \ 21 years to complete this architectural masterpiece.\n\n3. **Comparing Completion\
      \ Dates:**\n   - The Ming Dynasty's work on the Great Wall was completed by\
      \ **1644** at the latest.\n   - The Taj Mahal was completed later, in **1653**.\n\
      \   - Therefore, the Ming Dynasty's completion of the Great Wall occurred **before**\
      \ the Taj Mahal was finished.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Great Wall of China\
      \ (Ming Dynasty) was completed before the Taj Mahal."
