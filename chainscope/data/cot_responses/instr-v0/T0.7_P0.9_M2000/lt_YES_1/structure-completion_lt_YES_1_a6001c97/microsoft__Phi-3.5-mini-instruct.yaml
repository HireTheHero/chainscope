      of the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty.

      The construction of the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)
      was the most extensive and well-known phase of its history. The Ming rulers
      focused on building, rebuilding, and strengthening the wall to protect their
      empire from northern invasions.


      Step 2: Determine the construction period of the Taj Mahal.

      The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor
      Shah Jahan in 1632 and completed in 1653.


      Step 3: Compare the construction periods.

      The Ming Dynasty, which was responsible for the most extensive phase of the
      Great Wall of China, ended in 1644. The Taj Mahal was commissioned in 1632 and
      completed in 1653.


      Based on the comparison of construction periods, the Ming Dynasty (Great Wall
      of China) was completed before the Taj Mahal was commissioned.


      Answer: NO. The Great Wall of China was not completed before the Taj Mahal was
      commissioned. However, the Ming Dynasty''s construction efforts on the Great
      Wall were ongoing during the time the Taj Mahal was being built.'

      Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal.


      The Great Wall of China was built and expanded over several dynasties, with
      significant construction occurring during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).


      The Taj Mahal, a monumental mausoleum, was built in the city of Agra, India,
      during the Mughal Empire. It was commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632
      and completed in 1653.


      Step 2: Compare the time periods.


      The Ming Dynasty (Great Wall of China) spanned from 1368 to 1644. The construction
      of the Taj Mahal took place from 1632 to 1653.


      Step 3: Determine if the Ming Dynasty''s completion came before the Taj Mahal''s
      completion.


      Since the Ming Dynasty''s significant construction (Great Wall of China) ended
      in 1644, and the Taj Mahal''s construction began in 1632 and finished in 1653,
      the Ming Dynasty''s completion (Great Wall of China) did indeed occur before

      1632 and 1653, under the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan.


      Step 2: Compare the time periods.

      - The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) was well before the construction of the Taj Mahal
      (1632-1653).


      Step 3: Determine if the Ming Dynasty''s completion of the Great Wall of China
      came before the Taj Mahal.

      - Since the Ming Dynasty''s construction period ended in 1644 and the Taj Mahal
      was built between 1632 and 1653, the Great Wall of China was indeed completed
      before the Taj Mahal.

      project that involved the construction of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama
      to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, greatly reducing the time and distance
      needed for maritime travel.


      Step 2: Compare the completion dates.


      Since the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 and the Panama Canal was completed
      in 1914, we can conclude that the Eiffel Tower was completed before the Panama
      Canal.


      Answer: YES, the Eiffel Tower was completed before the Panama Canal.'
