      1. **Great Wall of China**: The construction of the Great Wall began in 221
      BC under Emperor Qin Shi Huang of the Qin dynasty (Qin Dynasty). It continued
      to be expanded and repaired throughout subsequent dynasties until the late Ming
      dynasty.


      2. **Taj Mahal**: This iconic mausoleum complex was built between 1632 and 1653
      during the Mughal Empire period, specifically during the reign of Shah Jahan.


      Given these timelines:

      - The Great Wall of China started construction around 221 BC and continued through
      various periods up to the Ming dynasty.

      - The Taj Mahal was constructed much later, starting in 1632 and finishing in
      1653.


      Since the Great Wall of China began its construction over 1,000 years earlier

      Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. The Eiffel Tower was designed and constructed in Paris, France between 1887
      and 1889.

      2. Construction of the Panama Canal began in 1904 after the completion of the
      French attempt to build it from 1881-1885.

      3. Therefore, the Eiffel Tower was completed long after the Panama Canal project
