      2. **Taj Mahal**: The Taj Mahal was commissioned in 1632 and completed in 1648,
      although some parts of the complex continued to be worked on until around 1653.


      3. **Comparison**: The Great Wall sections built during the Ming Dynasty were
      largely completed prior to the commissioning of the Taj Mahal in 1632.


      Now, summarizing the timelines:

      - The significant construction of the Ming Great Wall occurred mainly in the
      late 15th century to early 17th century.

      - The Taj Mahal was built starting in 1632.


      Based on this reasoning, the Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty) was indeed completed
      before the Taj Mahal.

      China from the Ming Dynasty was completed before the Taj Mahal, we need to look
      at the construction dates of both structures.


      1. The Ming Dynasty Great Wall of China was primarily built and reinforced during
      the Ming Dynasty, which lasted from 1368 to 1644. The most significant construction
      and repairs took place in the 15th and 16th centuries.


      2. The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, was commissioned by Mughal Emperor
      Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Its construction began in 1632
      and was completed in 1653.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - The Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty) was primarily constructed and enhanced
      before the completion of the Taj Mahal, as much of the construction occurred
      in the 15th and 16th centuries, while the Taj Mahal was completed in 1653.


      Therefore, the Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty) was completed before the Taj
      Mahal.

      during this period, particularly from the 15th to the 17th centuries. The wall
      construction was ongoing, but significant portions were completed in the late
      1500s and early 1600s.

      1. The Eiffel Tower was completed on March 31, 1889.

      2. The construction of the Panama Canal began in the early 20th century, and
      it was completed on August 15, 1914.


      Now we compare the two dates:


      - The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.

      - The Panama Canal was completed in 1914.


      Since 1889 is before 1914, we can conclude that the Eiffel Tower was completed
      before the Panama Canal.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      1. **Eiffel Tower**: The Eiffel Tower was completed on March 31, 1889. It was
      officially opened to the public on May 6, 1889.


      2. **Panama Canal**: The Panama Canal was completed on August 15, 1914.
