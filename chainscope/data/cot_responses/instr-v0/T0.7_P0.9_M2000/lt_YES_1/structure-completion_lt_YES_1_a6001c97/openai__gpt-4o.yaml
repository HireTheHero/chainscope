      \ the completion periods for both the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty\
      \ and the Taj Mahal.\n\n1. **Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty):**\n   - The\
      \ construction of the Great Wall of China as we largely know it today took place\
      \ during the Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty lasted from 1368 to 1644. The most\
      \ significant construction and fortification efforts were undertaken during\
      \ this period, particularly in the late 15th century to the early 17th century.\n\
      \n2. **Taj Mahal:**\n   - The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum in Agra, India, commissioned\
      \ by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Its construction began in 1632 and was completed\
      \ in 1643, with some finishing touches continuing until 1653.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\
      - The Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty) was completed before the significant\
      \ construction efforts on the Taj Mahal began (1632). Even though parts of the\
      \ Great Wall might have seen continued work through 1644, its major sections\
      \ were functionally completed before the start of the Taj Mahal's construction.\n\
      \nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n**YES.**"

      \   - The Ming Dynasty ruled from 1368 to 1644.\n   - Most of the Great Wall\
