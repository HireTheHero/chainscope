      the time periods during which the Great Wall of China (specifically the parts
      constructed during the Ming Dynasty) and the Taj Mahal were completed.


      1. **Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty)**: The construction of the Great Wall
      under the Ming Dynasty began in the early 14th century and continued until the
      late 16th century. However, significant rebuilding and extension of the wall
      took place throughout the Ming period, which lasted from 1368 to 1644.


      2. **Taj Mahal**: Construction on the Taj Mahal started around 1632 and was
      completed around 1653 during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.


      Given these dates:

      - The Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty section) saw major construction activities
      from the 14th century to the 17th century.

      - The Taj Mahal''s construction spanned from approximately 1632 to 1653.

      dynasty in 1644. However, the most significant construction efforts were concentrated

    1525c33c-49a5-4c42-b2da-e8b261e62988: 'To determine if the Eiffel Tower was completed
      before the Panama Canal, we need to look at the completion dates for both projects.


      1. **Eiffel Tower**: Construction began in January 1887 and was completed in
      March 1889.

      2. **Panama Canal**: The initial attempt by the French started in 1881 but faced
      significant challenges and was abandoned in 1894. A new effort by the United
      States began in 1904 and the canal was officially opened on August 15, 1914.


      Comparing these dates:

      - The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.

      - The Panama Canal was completed in 1914.


      Since 1889 comes before 1914, the Eiffel Tower was indeed completed before the
      Panama Canal.
