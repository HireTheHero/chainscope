      \n1. **Length of the \xD8resund Bridge:**\n   - The \xD8resund Bridge connects\
      \ Sweden and Denmark.\n   - Its total length is approximately 7.845 kilometers\
      \ (4.875 miles).\n\n2. **Length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge:**\n\
      \   - The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge connects San Francisco and Oakland\
      \ in California.\n   - Its total length is approximately 10.3 kilometers (6.4\
      \ miles).\n\nNow, let's compare the two lengths:\n- \xD8resund Bridge: 7.845\
      \ kilometers\n- San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge: 10.3 kilometers\n\nSince 7.845\
      \ kilometers is less than 10.3 kilometers, the \xD8resund Bridge is indeed shorter\
      \ than the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.\n\n**Answer: YES**"
