      ### Step 1: Identify the Bridges

      - **Seven Mile Bridge**: Located in the Florida Keys, it connects Knight''s
      Key in the Middle Keys to Little Duck Key in the Lower Keys.

      - **Mackinac Bridge**: Located in Michigan, it connects the Upper and Lower
      Peninsulas across the Straits of Mackinac.


      ### Step 2: Determine the Lengths

      - **Seven Mile Bridge**: Despite its name, it is approximately **6.79 miles**
      (10.9 kilometers) long.

      - **Mackinac Bridge**: It has a total length of about **5 miles** (8.04 kilometers).


      ### Step 3: Compare the Lengths

      - **Seven Mile Bridge**: ~6.79 miles

      - **Mackinac Bridge**: ~5 miles


      Since 6.79 miles is longer than 5 miles:
