      Bridge is shorter than the Seven Mile Bridge, let''s consider the following
      steps:


      1. Identify the location and purpose of both bridges.

      2. Research the lengths of both bridges.

      3. Compare the lengths to determine which bridge is shorter.


      Step 1: The Confederation Bridge connects Prince Edward Island with the mainland
      in Canada. It serves as an important transportation link for vehicles, pedestrians,
      and cyclists. The Seven Mile Bridge, on the other hand, is part of the Overseas
      Highway in Florida, United States. It connects the Florida mainland to the Florida
      Keys.


      Step 2: Research the lengths of both bridges:

      - The Confederation Bridge is approximately 12.9 kilometers (7.9 miles) long.

      - The Seven Mile Bridge is part of a series of bridges, with a total length
      of around 11.3 kilometers (7.0 miles).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths:

      - Confederation Bridge: 7.9 miles

      - Seven Mile Bridge: 7.0 miles


      The Confederation Bridge (7.9 miles) is longer than the Seven Mile Bridge (7.0
      miles).


      Answer: NO, the Confederation Bridge is not shorter than the Seven Mile Bridge.'

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is located in Maryland, connecting Havre de Grace
      to the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay.


      Step 2: Research the approximate lengths of both bridges.

      The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge (often called the Bay Bridge) is approximately
      1.2 miles (1.9 kilometers) long.

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is approximately 4.3 miles (6.9 kilometers) long.

      Step 4: Determine if the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is shorter than the
      Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

      Since 1.9 kilometers (the length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge) is
      less than 6.9 kilometers (the length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge), the answer
      is YES, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake
