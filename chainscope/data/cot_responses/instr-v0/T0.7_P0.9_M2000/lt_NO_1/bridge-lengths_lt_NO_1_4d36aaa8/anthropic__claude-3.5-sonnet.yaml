      - Manhattan Bridge length: 6,855 feet

      - Brooklyn Bridge length: 5,989 feet


      2. To determine if the Manhattan Bridge is shorter, I need to compare these
      numbers:

      6,855 feet > 5,989 feet


      3. Since the Manhattan Bridge is longer than the Brooklyn Bridge (by about 866
      feet), it cannot be shorter.
