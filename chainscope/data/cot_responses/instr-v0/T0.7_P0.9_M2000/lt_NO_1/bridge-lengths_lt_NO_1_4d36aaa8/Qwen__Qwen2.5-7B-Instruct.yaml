      bridges.


      1. **Forth Bridge**: The Forth Bridge is a cantilever bridge across the Firth
      of Forth in Scotland. Its total length is approximately 2,500 meters (8,202
      feet).


      2. **Manhattan Bridge**: The Manhattan Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning
      the East River between Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City. Its total length
      is approximately 2,905 meters (9,530 feet).


      Comparing these lengths:

      - Forth Bridge: 2,500 meters

      - Manhattan Bridge: 2,905 meters


      Since 2,500 meters is less than 2,905 meters, the Forth Bridge is indeed shorter
      than the Manhattan Bridge.

      Step 1: Determine the length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

      - The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge consists of two main spans: the eastern
