      Bridge by about 0.2 miles (0.3 kilometers), the answer is:


      NO, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is not shorter than the Chesapeake
      Bay Bridge.'

      \ is shorter than the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, let's break it down\
      \ step by step:\n\nStep 1: Find the length of the \xD8resund Bridge.\nThe \xD8\
      resund Bridge, connecting Sweden and Denmark, has a total length of 7,845 meters\
      \ (25,738 feet), which includes a 4,050-meter (13,287-foot) bridge and a 3,510-meter\
      \ (11,519-foot) tunnel.\n\nStep 2: Find the length of the San Francisco-Oakland\
      \ Bay Bridge.\nThe San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge has a total length of 7,180\
      \ meters (23,556 feet), consisting of two sections: the western span, which\
      \ is 3,141 meters (10,304 feet) long, and the eastern span, which is 4,039 meters\
      \ (13,252 feet) long.\n\nStep 3: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.\nThe\
