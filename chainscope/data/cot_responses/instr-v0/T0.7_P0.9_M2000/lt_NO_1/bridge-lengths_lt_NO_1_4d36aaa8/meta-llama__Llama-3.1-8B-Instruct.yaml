      2. I also know that the Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel arch bridge, while
      the Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge.

      3. To compare their heights, I''ll look up the information: the Sydney Harbour
      Bridge has a height of 134 meters (440 ft), while the Tower Bridge has a height
      of 65 meters (213 ft) to its road level, but the high level is 152 meters (499
      ft).

      4. However, I need to consider the height from the water level, not the ground
      level. The Sydney Harbour Bridge''s height above water level is approximately
      134 meters, while the Tower Bridge''s height above water level is approximately
      65 meters.

      4. According to various sources, the Brooklyn Bridge has a main span of 1,595.5
      feet (486.3 meters) and a total length of 6,016 feet (1,834 meters).

      5. The Manhattan Bridge has a main span of 1,470 feet (447.4 meters) and a total
      length of 6,016 feet (1,834 meters) as well.


      Interestingly, both bridges have the same total length, which is 6,016 feet
      (1,834 meters). However, the Manhattan Bridge''s main span is slightly shorter
      than the Brooklyn Bridge''s main span.


      Based on this comparison, I would conclude that the Manhattan Bridge is indeed
      shorter than the Brooklyn Bridge in terms of main span, but they have the same
      total length. So, the answer is:


      YES'

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is approximately 4.3 miles (6.9 km) long.

      2. Look up the length of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge:

      The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is approximately 4.1 miles (6.6 km) long.

      3. Compare the lengths of the two bridges:

      Since 4.1 miles is less than 4.3 miles, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is shorter
      than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.
