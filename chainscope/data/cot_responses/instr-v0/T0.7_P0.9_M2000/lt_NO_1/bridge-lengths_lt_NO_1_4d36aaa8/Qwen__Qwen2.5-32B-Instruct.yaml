      Step 1: Determine the length of the Seven Mile Bridge.

      - The Seven Mile Bridge stretches approximately 7 miles (about 11.27 kilometers).


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Mackinac Bridge.

      - The Mackinac Bridge has a total length of about 5 miles (8 kilometers) for
      its main span, but when including approaches, it extends over 8 miles (approximately
      13 kilometers).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - The Seven Mile Bridge is around 11.27 kilometers long.

      - The Mackinac Bridge, considering its full length including approaches, is

      - The Seven Mile Bridge is approximately 6.8 miles (36,024 feet) long.


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Mackinac Bridge.

      - The Mackinac Bridge is approximately 5 miles (26,372 feet) long in terms of

      - The Seven Mile Bridge is actually approximately 7 miles long, which is about
      36,000 feet or around 11 kilometers.


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Mackinac Bridge.

      - The Mackinac Bridge has a total length of about 5 miles for its main span
      plus additional approaches, making it roughly 26,400 feet (or 8 kilometers)
      for the main span alone. However, including the approaches, the entire structure
      extends to about 8 miles (or 13 kilometers).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - Even though the main span of the Mackinac Bridge is shorter than the Seven
      Mile Bridge, when considering the entire structure of the Mackinac Bridge (including
      approaches), it becomes longer than the Seven Mile Bridge.


      Given this analysis, the answer is:


      NO

      - The Seven Mile Bridge, located in Florida, USA, as its name suggests, is approximately
      seven miles long. In feet, this translates to roughly 36,960 feet (7 miles *
      5,280 feet/mile).

      length of approximately 6,855 feet (about 2,089 meters).


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Brooklyn Bridge.

      - The Brooklyn Bridge, also spanning the East River in New York City, has a
      total length of approximately 6,016 feet (about 1,834 meters) for its main span
      alone. However, when considering the entire structure including approaches,

    776752f5-a212-4153-9a3f-2c1a12fbe457: 'To determine if the San Francisco-Oakland
      Bay Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, we need to compare their
      lengths.


      Step 1: Find the length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

      The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is approximately 8.25 miles (13.27 kilometers)
      long.


      Step 2: Find the length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, also known as the "Bay Bridge," has a total length
      of about 4.3 miles (6.92 kilometers) for each of its two spans, making it roughly
      8.6 miles (13.84 kilometers) in total length when considering both spans.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is about 8.25 miles long, while the Chesapeake
      Bay Bridge is about 8.6 miles long.


      Step 4: Answer the question based on the comparison.

      Given that the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake
      Bay Bridge, the answer is:


      NO'
    8448b7ce-f380-4a57-a699-e1570ef4be04: 'To determine if the San Francisco-Oakland
      Bay Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, we need to look at the
      lengths of both bridges.


      Step 1: Determine the length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

      - The total length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is approximately
      8.4 miles (or about 13.5 kilometers).


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

      - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge has two main spans, and when considering the full
      length of the bridge including approach roads, it measures about 4.3 miles (or
      about 6.9 kilometers) for the main span, but if including all the approaches,
      it extends to about 17.6 miles (about 28.3 kilometers).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - Comparing the lengths directly, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge at around
      8.4 miles is indeed shorter than the full extent of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge,
      which can be up to 17.6 miles when including approach roads.


      Answer: YES, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is shorter than the Chesapeake
      Bay Bridge when considering the full extent of the latter including its approach
      roads.'

      The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge has a total length of approximately 8.25
      miles (or about 13.28 kilometers).


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, also known as the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial
      Bridge, spans about 4.34 miles (or about 7 kilometers) for its longest span.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      Comparing the two lengths, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is longer at
      about 8.25 miles compared to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge at about 4.34 miles.
