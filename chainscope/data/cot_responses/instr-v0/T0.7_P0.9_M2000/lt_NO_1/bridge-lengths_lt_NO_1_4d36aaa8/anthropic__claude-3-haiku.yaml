    d2de9d1a-4a15-4473-a7e1-dd0709ef7026: 'To determine whether the George Washington
      Bridge is shorter than the Sydney Harbour Bridge, we need to follow these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the lengths of the two bridges.

      - The George Washington Bridge has a main span length of 3,500 feet (1,067 meters).

      - The Sydney Harbour Bridge has a main span length of 1,650 feet (502 meters).


      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      - The George Washington Bridge, with a main span length of 3,500 feet, is longer
      than the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which has a main span length of 1,650 feet.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is the George Washington Bridge shorter
      than the Sydney Harbour Bridge?" is:


      NO, the George Washington Bridge is not shorter than the Sydney Harbour Bridge.'
