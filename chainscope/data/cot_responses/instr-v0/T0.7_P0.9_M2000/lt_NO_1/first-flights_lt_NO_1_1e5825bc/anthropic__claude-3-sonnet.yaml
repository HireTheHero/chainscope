      down into steps:


      Step 1: Identify the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis was the aircraft flown by Charles Lindbergh in 1927
      on the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight from New York to Paris.

      - The Wright Flyer was the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft,
      designed and built by the Wright brothers and flown in 1903.


      Step 2: Compare the first flight dates of the two aircraft.

      - The Wright Flyer made its first flight on December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk,
      North Carolina.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight on May 20, 1927, from Roosevelt
      Field, New York.


      Step 3: Determine which aircraft flew first based on the dates.

      - The Wright Flyer flew in 1903, while the Spirit of St. Louis flew in 1927,
      nearly 24 years later.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO, the Spirit of St. Louis did not make its first flight before the Wright

      NO, the Boeing 737 did not make its first flight before the SR-71 Blackbird.'
    d2e2f145-8a6f-4e47-b921-99226bca8c01: 'Okay, let''s think through this step-by-step:


      1. The Boeing 737 is a commercial passenger jet airliner.

      2. The SR-71 Blackbird was a long-range, advanced strategic reconnaissance aircraft
      operated by the United States Air Force.

      3. The first flight of the Boeing 737 was on April 9, 1967.

      4. The first flight of the SR-71 Blackbird was on December 22, 1964.


      Since the SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight in 1964, which is earlier than
      the Boeing 737''s first flight in 1967, the answer is:


      NO, the Boeing 737 did not make its first flight before the SR-71 Blackbird.'

    c5ddb5a4-be70-49f4-8f41-582a9709c108: 'Sure, let''s break this down step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the first flight dates of the Spitfire and the DC-3.

      - The Spitfire, a British fighter aircraft, made its first flight on March 5,
      1936.

      - The Douglas DC-3, an American airliner, made its first flight on December
      17, 1935.


      Step 2: Compare the two dates to determine which aircraft flew first.

      - December 17, 1935 (DC-3 first flight) is earlier than March 5, 1936 (Spitfire
      first flight).


      Step 3: Provide the YES/NO answer based on the comparison.


      NO, the Spitfire did not make its first flight before the DC-3. The DC-3 made
