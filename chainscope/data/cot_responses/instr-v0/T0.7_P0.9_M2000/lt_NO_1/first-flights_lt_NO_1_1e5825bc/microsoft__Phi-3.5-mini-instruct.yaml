      Step 2: Research the first flight dates for both aircraft.


      - The Boeing 737 (specifically the original variant, the 737-100) made its first
      flight on February 9, 1967.

      - The SR-71 Blackbird, a reconnaissance aircraft, made its first flight on December
      22, 1964.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates.


      - The Boeing 737 (737-100) first flew in February 1967.

      - The SR-71 Blackbird first flew in December 1964.


      Step 4: Determine which aircraft had its first flight earlier.


      - The SR-71 Blackbird had its first flight before the Boeing 737 (737-100).


      Step 5: Provide the answer.


      NO, the Boeing 737 did not make its first flight before the SR-71 Blackbird.
      The SR-71 Blackbird''s first flight occurred before the Boeing 737''s first

      of both aircrafts.


      The Boeing 737 is a commercial airliner that was first introduced by Boeing.
      Its first flight was on February 9, 1967.


      The SR-71 Blackbird, on the other hand, is a reconnaissance aircraft developed
      by Lockheed for the United States Air Force. Its first flight was on December
      22, 1964.


      Step 2: Compare the flight dates.


      The SR-71 Blackbird''s first flight date (December 22, 1964) is earlier than
      the Boeing 737''s first flight date (February 9, 1967).


      Step 3: Answer the question based on the comparison.


      Since the SR-71 Blackbird had its first flight before the Boeing 737, the answer
      is NO. The Boeing 737 did not make its first flight before the SR-71 Blackbird.'

      The Boeing 737 is a family of narrow-body aircraft that was first produced by
      Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The first Boeing 737, the 737-100, made its maiden
      flight on February 9, 1967.


      The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, on the other hand, was an advanced long-range,
      Mach 3+ strategic reconnaissance aircraft developed by Lockheed''s Skunk Works
      division. The SR-71 made its first flight on December 22, 1964.
