      1. The Spirit of St. Louis was a plane designed by Charles Lindbergh and built
      by Ryan Airlines.

      2. It made its first flight in 1927.

      3. The Wright Flyer, on the other hand, was the first powered, heavier-than-air
      aircraft designed and built by the Wright brothers.

      4. The Wright Flyer made its first flight on December 17, 1903.

      5. Since the Wright Flyer flew before the Spirit of St. Louis was even designed,
      let alone built, the answer is clear.


      The answer is: NO'
