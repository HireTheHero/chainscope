      - Spitfire: First flight on March 5, 1936.


      Step 2: Compare the dates to determine which aircraft made its first flight
      earlier.

      Since 1936 (Spitfire''s first flight) is before 1940 (P-51 Mustang''s first
      flight), the Spitfire made its first flight before the P-51 Mustang.

      Lindbergh''s Spirit of St. Louis by many years.

      5. Given that the Wright Flyer was built and flown before Lindbergh''s aircraft,
      it is likely that Lindbergh''s Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight after
      the Wright Flyer.

    559d63eb-0656-4f63-bccb-0b8fae97c0c9: 'Let''s break it down step by step:


      1. The Spirit of St. Louis was a plane designed by Charles Lindbergh and built
      in 1927.

      2. The Wright Flyer was the first powered, heavier-than-air aircraft, designed
      and built by the Wright brothers in 1903.

      3. Charles Lindbergh was a student of the Wright brothers and was influenced
      by their work.

      4. The Spirit of St. Louis was designed to fly non-stop across the Atlantic
      Ocean, which was a goal set by the Wright brothers.

      5. Given that the Wright Flyer was the first powered aircraft, it is likely
      that Lindbergh was familiar with it and may have even flown in it.


      However, I need to look up the exact date of the Spirit of St. Louis'' first
      flight.

      its first flight before the Wright Flyer.


      Step 3: I know that the Spirit of St. Louis was a solo non-stop flight made
      by Charles Lindbergh in 1927. The Wright Flyer, on the other hand, was the first
      powered, heavier-than-air aircraft, invented by the Wright brothers in 1903.


      Step 4: I need to determine the timeline of these events. The Wright Flyer made
      its first flight on December 17, 1903. The Spirit of St. Louis made its first
      flight on May 20-21, 1927.

      - The Spitfire''s first flight

      - The DC-3''s introduction


      Step 2: Determine the dates of these events.

      - The DC-3 made its first flight on March 28, 1935.

      - The Spitfire''s first flight took place on March 5, 1936.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Since the DC-3''s first flight occurred in 1935 and the Spitfire''s first flight
      occurred in 1936, the Spitfire made its first flight after the DC-3.


      Answer: NO'

      1. The DC-3 (De Havilland Comet 3) is a British-built airliner that made its
      first flight in 1935.

      2. The Spitfire is a British fighter aircraft that was designed and built by
      Supermarine Aviation Works (Vickers-Armstrongs).

      3. The Spitfire made its first flight on March 5, 1936.

      The DC-3 made its first flight in 1935, while the Spitfire made its first flight
      in 1936.
