      - The Spirit of St. Louis was the airplane Charles Lindbergh flew across the
      Atlantic in 1927


      2. The Spirit of St. Louis was built in 1927, which is much later than 1903


      3. Therefore, the Wright Flyer existed and made its first flight well before
      the Spirit of St. Louis was even constructed


      4. So the answer is: NO, the Spirit of St. Louis did NOT make its first flight
      before the Wright Flyer.


      The answer is NO.'
