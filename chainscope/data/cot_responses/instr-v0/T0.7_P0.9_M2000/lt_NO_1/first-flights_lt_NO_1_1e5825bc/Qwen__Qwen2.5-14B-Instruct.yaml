      1. **DC-3**: The Douglas DC-3 made its first flight on December 17, 1935.

      2. **Spirit of St. Louis**: The Spirit of St. Louis was actually a modified
      version of the Lockheed Vega 5B. Its famous transatlantic solo flight was flown
      by Charles Lindbergh, but the airplane itself was not newly manufactured for
      that purpose. The original Lockheed Vega 5B model, which the Spirit of St. Louis
      was based on, had been in production since 1928. However, the specific aircraft
      "Spirit of St. Louis" was completed and delivered to Charles Lindbergh on April
      28, 1927, and its design flight date would relate to the prototype of the Vega
      series, which first flew in July 1927.


      Based on these dates:

      - The DC-3 first flew in 1935.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis (based on the Lockheed Vega series) was designed earlier,

      the information needed about each aircraft.


      Firstly, let''s consider the **B-52 Stratofortress**:

      - The B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range, subsonic strategic bomber used by
      the United States Air Force (USAF).

      - It was designed and built during the Cold War era.

      - The B-52 made its maiden flight on April 15, 1952.


      Now, let''s look at the **P-51 Mustang**:

      - The P-51 Mustang was a long-range single-seat fighter aircraft developed for
      the US Army Air Forces.

      - It was introduced earlier than the B-52, being developed in the early years
      of World War II.

      - The first flight of the P-51 Mustang prototype took place on October 26, 1940.


      Comparing these dates:

      - The P-51 Mustang''s first flight occurred on October 26, 1940.

      - The B-52 Stratofortress''s first flight occurred on April 15, 1952.


      Since 1940 is earlier than 1952, the P-51 Mustang indeed made its first flight
