      3. **P-51 Mustang first flight**: The P-51 Mustang made its first flight on
      October 26, 1940.


      4. **Comparison**: Now, compare the two dates. The P-51 Mustang''s first flight
      was in 1940, while the B-52 Stratofortress''s first flight was in 1952.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since 1940 is before 1952, the P-51 Mustang made its first

    dca5c168-96a2-46a7-948e-77019fe90c0c: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the first flight date of the Boeing 737**: The Boeing 737 made
      its first flight on April 9, 1967.


      2. **Identify the first flight date of the SR-71 Blackbird**: The SR-71 Blackbird
      made its first flight on December 22, 1964.


      3. **Compare the first flight dates**: Since 1964 (the year the SR-71 Blackbird
      first flew) comes before 1967 (the year the Boeing 737 first flew), we can conclude
      that the SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight before the Boeing 737.

      the first flight dates of both the Boeing 737 and the SR-71 Blackbird.


      1. **First Flight of the Boeing 737**: The Boeing 737 is a narrow-body aircraft
      produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. According to historical records, the
      first Boeing 737, which was the 737-100, made its maiden flight on April 9,
      1967.


      2. **First Flight of the SR-71 Blackbird**: The SR-71 Blackbird is a supersonic
      reconnaissance plane developed by Lockheed Skunk Works. The first flight of
      the SR-71 occurred on December 22, 1964.


      Now, comparing these dates:


      - The SR-71 Blackbird first flew on December 22, 1964.

      - The Boeing 737 first flew on April 9, 1967.


      Since December 22, 1964, is before April 9, 1967, the SR-71 Blackbird made its
      first flight before the Boeing 737.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Did the Boeing 737 make its first flight
      before the SR-71 Blackbird?" is: **NO**.'

      flight before the DC-3, we need to consider the first flight dates of both aircraft.


      1. **Identify the first flight date of the Supermarine Spitfire:** The Supermarine
