      Step 1: Identify the first flight date of the B-52 Stratofortress.

      The B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight on April 15, 1952.


      Step 2: Identify the first flight date of the P-51 Mustang.

      Step 1: Identify the first flight date of the SR-71 Blackbird.

      The SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on December 22, 1964.


      Step 2: Identify the first flight date of the B-52 Stratofortress.

      The B-52 Stratofortress made its first flight on April 15, 1952.
