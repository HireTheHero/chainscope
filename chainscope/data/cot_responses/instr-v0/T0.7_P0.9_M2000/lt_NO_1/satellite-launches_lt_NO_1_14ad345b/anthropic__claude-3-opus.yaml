      2. Landsat 1 was part of the Landsat program, which was the first civilian Earth
      observation program. It was designed to study and monitor Earth''s landmasses.

      Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. This alignment only occurs once every 175 years.

      Early Bird (Intelsat I):

      - It was the first commercial communications satellite to be placed in geosynchronous
      orbit.

      - Early Bird was launched on April 6, 1965, from Cape Canaveral, Florida.


      Landsat 1 (originally named Earth Resources Technology Satellite 1, ERTS-1):

      Earth''s landmasses.

      - Landsat 1 was launched on July 23, 1972, from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.


      Comparing the launch dates:

      - Early Bird: April 6, 1965
