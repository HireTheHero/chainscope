      **Step 1: Identify the Launch Date of Landsat 1**

      - **Landsat 1** was the first satellite in the Landsat program, which is a series
      of Earth-observing satellite missions jointly managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological
      Survey (USGS).

      - **Launch Date:** July 23, 1972.


      **Step 2: Identify the Launch Date of Early Bird**

      - **Early Bird**, officially known as **Intelsat I**, was the first commercial
      communications satellite.

      - **Launch Date:** April 6, 1965.


      **Step 3: Compare the Launch Dates**

      - **Early Bird** was launched in April 1965.

      - **Landsat 1** was launched in July 1972.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Early Bird was launched in 1965 and Landsat 1 was launched in 1972, **Landsat
      1 was not launched before Early Bird**.
