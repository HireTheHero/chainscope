      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      - Luna 1 was launched in 1959.

      - Vanguard 1 was launched in 1958.


      Since 1958 comes before 1959, Vanguard 1 was launched before Luna 1.


      Answer: NO'
    a1dfb5a5-2c65-4d03-b641-ecb72374f4e4: 'To answer the question "Was Luna 1 launched
      before Vanguard 1?", we need to look at the launch dates for both spacecraft.


      Step 1: Identify the launch date of Luna 1.

      Luna 1 was launched on January 2, 1959.


      Step 2: Identify the launch date of Vanguard 1.

      Vanguard 1 was launched on February 17, 1958.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      January 2, 1959 comes after February 17, 1958. Therefore, Luna 1 was launched
      after Vanguard 1.


      Given this information, the answer is:


      NO'
