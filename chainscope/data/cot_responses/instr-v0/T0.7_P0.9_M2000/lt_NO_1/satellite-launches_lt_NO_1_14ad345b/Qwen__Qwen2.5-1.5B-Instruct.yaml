      1. **GPS 1**: This is the name of the first Global Positioning System (GPS)
      satellite. The first operational satellite was launched in October 1978.

      2. **Voyager 2**: This mission includes multiple spacecraft that were launched
      between 1977 and 1980. The Voyager 2 probe was launched on August 20, 1977,
      and began its journey to Jupiter in December 1977.


      Based on these facts:

      - GPS 1 was launched in October 1978.

      - Voyager 2 was launched in August 1977.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**, GPS 1 was not launched before Voyager 2; Voyager
      2 was launched earlier than GPS 1.'

      2. **Voyager 2**: A NASA space probe launched in 1977 as part of the Voyager
      program. It has traveled through interstellar space and is currently exploring
      deep space beyond our solar system.


      Now let''s compare these two entities:

      - **GPS 1** operates within Earth''s atmosphere and provides location data for
      users on the ground.

      - **Voyager 2**, despite being a spacecraft, does not operate in GPS''s frequency
      band. Its primary purpose is to explore outer space and gather scientific data.

      GPS 1 (Global Positioning System) was designed as part of Project Starlink,
      which aimed to create a global satellite navigation system using microwave signals.
      The first operational GPS satellite, known as GPS-1B, was launched on March
      30, 1985, from Vandenberg AFB in California. This makes GPS 1 one of the oldest
      satellites ever put into orbit.


      Voyager 2 was another groundbreaking space mission that explored Jupiter, Saturn,
      Uranus, and Neptune. It was launched on September 5, 1977, aboard the massive
      Titan IV rocket. While it''s not exactly accurate to say "before" Voyager 2
      because it didn''t launch until after its predecessor, GPS 1 was indeed launched
      earlier than Voyager 2, although Voyager 2 was launched nearly two years later.

      particularly in the United States.


      2. **Syncom 3**: Syncom 3 is an American geosynchronous communications satellite.


      Now, let''s break it down further:

      - The term "Early Bird" typically refers to the launch date of a new TV network
      or service. It usually indicates that this service started its operations relatively
      soon after its development phase.

      - Syncom 3 was indeed launched on March 26, 1965.


      Given these facts, we can conclude that Early Bird likely refers to a specific
      launch date for a TV network or similar service, which would have been much
      earlier than the successful launch of Syncom 3 (which occurred in 1965).


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**. Syncom 3 was not launched before Early Bird;
      rather, Syncom 3 was one of the significant milestones in the history of satellite
      communication technology, while Early Bird likely refers to a different event
