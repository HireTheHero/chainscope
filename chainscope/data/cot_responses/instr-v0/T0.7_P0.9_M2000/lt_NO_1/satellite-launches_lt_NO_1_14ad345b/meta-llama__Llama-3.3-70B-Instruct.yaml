      module) is after 1990 (the launch year of the Hubble Space Telescope), we can
      conclude that the Hubble Space Telescope was launched before the International
      Space Station.


      Therefore, the answer to whether the International Space Station was launched
      before the Hubble Space Telescope is: **NO**'
    e1de3a01-ac8d-41de-bd07-835eb5ac8f4a: 'To answer this question, let''s first identify

      Space Telescope (HST).


      1. **Hubble Space Telescope Launch Date**: The Hubble Space Telescope was launched
      on April 24, 1990.

      2. **International Space Station Launch Date**: The first module of the International
      Space Station, Zarya, was launched on November 20, 1998. This marked the beginning
      of the ISS''s construction in space.


      Given these dates:


      - The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990.

      - The first module of the International Space Station was launched in 1998.


      Since 1998 is after 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched before the
      International Space Station.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Was International Space Station launched

      1. **Luna 1**: This was a Soviet spacecraft. According to historical records,
      Luna 1 was launched on January 2, 1959. It was designed to impact the Moon but
      instead became the first spacecraft to fly by the Moon.


      2. **Vanguard 1**: This was an American spacecraft and the first solar-powered
      satellite. Vanguard 1 was launched on March 17, 1958.


      Now, comparing the launch dates:

      - Vanguard 1 was launched on March 17, 1958.

      - Luna 1 was launched on January 2, 1959.
