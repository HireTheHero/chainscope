      \ let's break down the key information about both space missions.\n\n### Step\
      \ 1: Determine the Launch Date of the Hubble Space Telescope\n\n- **Launch Date:**\
      \ The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 24, 1990, aboard Space Shuttle\
      \ Discovery as STS-31 mission.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Launch Date of the\
