      **1. Launch Date of Mir:**


      - **Mir Space Station:** The core module of the Mir space station was launched
      by the Soviet Union.

      - **Launch Date:** February 20, 1986.


      **2. Launch Date of GPS 1:**


      - **GPS 1 Satellite (Navstar 1):** This refers to the first satellite in the
      NAVSTAR Global Positioning System, which is the United States'' GPS program.

      - **Launch Date:** February 22, 1978.


      **3. Comparison:**


      - **GPS 1 Launch Date:** February 22, 1978.

      - **Mir Launch Date:** February 20, 1986.
