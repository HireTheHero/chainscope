      \ southern coast to over 2,500 meters in some areas of Indonesia. However, for\

      \ meters.\n\n2. **South China Sea Depth**: This sea has a much broader area\
      \ and can have different depths depending on location:\n   - In the western\
      \ part (e.g., off the Philippines), it might be shallow due to underwater mountains\
      \ like the Spratly Islands.\n   - In the central part (e.g., the Gulf of Thailand\

      \   - In the eastern part (e.g., the Taiwan Strait), it typically has deeper\
      \ waters.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - If we consider the overall depth, the\
      \ South China Sea tends to have greater variations in depth compared to the\

      \ while there could be specific instances where the South China Sea might appear\
      \ shallower due to local conditions, the overall average and typical comparison\

      1. **Geographical Location**: Both seas are located in different parts of the
      world but share some similarities due to their location between continents.


      2. **Depth Measurement**: The depth measurements for these two bodies of water
      can vary slightly depending on which source you consult (e.g., Google Earth,
      bathymetric maps). However, for the purpose of this comparison, I''ll use generally
      accepted depths.


      3. **Historical Depth Records**: Historically, the South China Sea has been

      - The Arabian Sea is an enclosed body of water between Africa and India.\n-\
