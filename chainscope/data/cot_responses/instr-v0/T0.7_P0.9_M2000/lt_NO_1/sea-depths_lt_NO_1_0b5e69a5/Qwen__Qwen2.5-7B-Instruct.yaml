      1. **Tasman Sea**: The Tasman Sea lies between Australia and New Zealand. Its
      maximum depth is approximately 4,760 meters (15,617 feet).

      \ of the seas:**\n   - The Arabian Sea is part of the Indian Ocean and is bounded\
      \ by India, Pakistan, Iran, and Yemen.\n   - The Bering Sea is part of the Pacific\
      \ Ocean and is located between Alaska and Siberia.\n\n2. **Understand the characteristics\
      \ of each sea:**\n   - The Arabian Sea is generally a shallow, warm, and relatively\
      \ enclosed body of water.\n   - The Bering Sea is known for its deep waters\
      \ and significant seasonal ice cover.\n\n3. **Research average depths:**\n \
      \  - The average depth of the Arabian Sea is approximately 3,890 meters (12,760\
      \ feet).\n   - The average depth of the Bering Sea is approximately 945 meters\
