      1. **Location**: Both seas are located in the western Pacific Ocean. However,
      their locations relative to each other and to other bodies of water might be
      relevant.

      2. **Depth**: The Tasman Sea is situated between Australia and New Zealand,
      while the South China Sea is between the southern coast of China and the northern
      coast of Vietnam, with the Philippines to the east. The South China Sea is a
      marginal sea connected to the Pacific Ocean via the Luzon Strait.

      know the depths of both the Caribbean Sea and the Sargasso Sea. Based on my
      knowledge, here are the steps:


      1. I know that the Sargasso Sea is a region in the North Atlantic Ocean, characterized
      by calm and clear waters. It''s located in the North Atlantic, but its exact
      boundaries are not well-defined.

      2. I also know that the Caribbean Sea is a part of the Atlantic Ocean, located

      3. Given the locations of these two bodies of water, I can infer that the Sargasso
      Sea is likely to be shallower than the Caribbean Sea. The Caribbean Sea is a
      relatively large body of water, and its depth varies, but it''s generally considered
      to be a deep sea. The Sargasso Sea, on the other hand, is a relatively small
      and shallow area.
