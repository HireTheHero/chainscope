      number than nonmetals.

      3. The atomic number of aluminum is 13, and the atomic number of zinc is 30.

      4. Since aluminum has a higher atomic number than zinc, it means that aluminum
      has more protons in its nucleus than zinc.

      5. As a result, aluminum has a higher effective nuclear charge than zinc.

      6. The effective nuclear charge is a measure of the attractive force between
      protons in the nucleus, and it decreases as the number of protons increases.

      7. Therefore, aluminum has a lower effective nuclear charge than zinc, which
      means that the electrostatic attraction between aluminum and other atoms is
      weaker.

      8. A lower electrostatic attraction means that aluminum has a lower melting
      point than zinc.


      Based on these steps, I conclude that aluminum has a lower melting point than

      Metals are typically good conductors of heat and electricity, and they tend

      Silver has a higher atomic number (47) than aluminum (13), which means it has
