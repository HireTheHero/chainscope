      Celsius.

      2. **Melting point of aluminum:** Aluminum melts at approximately 660.3 degrees
      Celsius.


      By comparing these values, we can see that aluminum has a lower melting point
      than silver.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is **NO**, silver does not have a lower
      melting point than aluminum.'
