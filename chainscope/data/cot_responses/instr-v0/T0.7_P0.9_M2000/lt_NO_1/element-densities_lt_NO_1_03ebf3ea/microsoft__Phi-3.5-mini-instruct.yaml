      - Potassium (K) and Lithium (Li).


      Step 2: Recall the atomic structure and properties of both elements. Both potassium
      and lithium are alkali metals, found in Group 1 of the periodic table.


      Step 3: Understand that density is a property related to an element''s atomic
      mass and atomic volume. In general, density is calculated by dividing the atomic
      mass by the atomic volume.


      Step 4: Look up the atomic masses of potassium and lithium. The atomic mass
      of potassium is approximately 39.10 g/mol, while the atomic mass of lithium
      is approximately 6.94 g/mol.


      Step 5: Compare the atomic masses. Potassium has a higher atomic mass than lithium.


      Step 6: Now, we need to consider the atomic volumes. Although the atomic volumes
      of these elements are not typically listed, we know that the atomic volume of
      an element generally increases with increasing atomic size. Since potassium
      has a larger atomic size than lithium (as it has more electron shells), it will
      have a larger atomic volume.


      Step 7: Calculate the relative densities by dividing the atomic mass by the
      atomic volume. Since potassium has a higher atomic mass but also a larger atomic
      volume than lithium, we need to determine which factor has a greater influence
      on the density.


      Step 8: Consider the trend in atomic volumes across the periodic table. The
      atomic volume generally increases down a group, meaning that potassium will
      have a larger atomic volume than lithium.


      Step 9: Given that the increase in atomic volume of potassium is likely to have
      a greater influence on density than the increase in atomic mass, we can conclude
      that potassium is less dense than lithium.

      dense than lithium, we need to consider the atomic structure, atomic mass, and
      atomic radius of both elements.


      Step 1: Atomic structure

      Both potassium (K) and lithium (Li) are alkali metals found in Group 1 of the
      periodic table. They have one electron in their outermost shell, which they
      readily lose to form a +1 ion.


      Step 2: Atomic mass

      Lithium has an atomic mass of approximately 6.94 g/mol, while potassium has
      an atomic mass of approximately 39.10 g/mol. Since atomic mass is directly related
      to density, we can infer that lithium is lighter than potassium.


      Step 3: Atomic radius

      Atomic radius generally increases as we move down a group in the periodic table.
      Lithium, being in the second period, has a smaller atomic radius compared to
      potassium, which is in the fourth period. A larger atomic radius implies a larger
      volume for the same mass, which results in lower density.


      Considering the atomic mass, atomic radius, and the general trend of increasing
      atomic radius as we move down a group, we can deduce that potassium is indeed
      less dense than lithium.

      \ packing efficiency, which in turn affects density.\n\n5. Calculate the density:\
      \ To calculate the density, we need the atomic weight and the volume occupied\
      \ by the atoms. The volume occupied by an atom can be approximated using the\
      \ atomic radius and the crystal structure. For both magnesium and sodium, the\
      \ volume occupied by one atom can be calculated using the formula for the volume\
      \ of a sphere (V = 4/3 * \u03C0 * r\xB3).\n\n6. Compare the densities: Now that\
      \ we have the approximate volumes occupied by magnesium and sodium atoms, we\
      \ can calculate their densities using the formula \u03C1 = m/V.\n\nBased on\
      \ these steps, let's perform the calculations:\n\nVolume occupied by one Mg\
      \ atom = 4/3 * \u03C0 * (160 pm)\xB3 \u2248 1.71 x 10^6 pm\xB3\nVolume occupied\
      \ by one Na atom = 4/3 * \u03C0 * (190 pm)\xB3 \u2248 2.87 x 10^6 pm\xB3\n\n\

      \nDensity of Na = (22.990 g/mol) / (2.87 x 10^6 pm\xB3/atom) \u2248 0.80 g/cm\xB3\

      The question is asking whether sodium (Na) is less dense than potassium (K).


      Step 2: Research atomic properties

      To answer this question, we need to look at the atomic properties of both elements,
      specifically their atomic mass and atomic volume.


      Step 3: Compare atomic mass

      The atomic mass of sodium is approximately 22.99 g/mol, while the atomic mass
      of potassium is approximately 39.10 g/mol.


      Step 4: Compare atomic volume

      The atomic volume (or atomic radius) of sodium is approximately 186 pm (picometers),
      while the atomic volume of potassium is approximately 248 pm.


      Step 5: Determine density

      Density is calculated by dividing the atomic mass by the atomic volume. The
      formula for density is:


      Density = Atomic Mass / Atomic Volume


      Step 6: Calculate density for both elements

      Density of sodium = 22.99 g/mol / 186 pm = 0.1236 g/mol/pm

      Density of potassium = 39.10 g/mol / 248 pm = 0.1576 g/mol/pm


      Step 7: Compare densities

      Sodium has a density of 0.1236 g/mol/pm, while potassium has a density of 0.1576
      g/mol/pm. Since sodium has a lower density than potassium, the answer to the
      question is:


      YES, sodium is less dense than potassium.'
    4cd260a6-4314-42cf-af65-d327e344653f: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the atomic structure and properties of sodium and potassium.


      Step 1: Understand the atomic structure

      Both sodium (Na) and potassium (K) are elements in the same group (Group 1:
      Alkali Metals) in the periodic table. This means they have similar electron
      configurations, with one electron in their outermost shell.


      Step 2: Compare atomic radii

      As we move down the group in the periodic table, the atomic radius increases
      due to the addition of electron shells. Sodium is located in the third period,
      while potassium is in the fourth period. Therefore, potassium has a larger atomic
      radius than sodium.


      Step 3: Analyze density

      Density is determined by the mass of an element and how closely packed its atoms
      are. Since potassium has a larger atomic radius, its atoms are more spread out,
      and thus its atoms are less tightly packed compared to sodium.


      Conclusion:

      Given that potassium has a larger atomic radius and less tightly packed atoms,
      it is less dense than sodium.

      Step 2: Recall the position of these elements in the periodic table. Both sodium
      and potassium are located in Group 1, which is the alkali metal group.


      Step 3: Understand the general trend in density for alkali metals. As you move
      down the group in the periodic table, the atomic radius increases due to the
      addition of electron shells. This generally leads to an increase in density.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic radii of sodium and potassium. Sodium (Na) has an
      atomic radius of approximately 186 pm, while potassium (K) has an atomic radius
      of approximately 231 pm.

      has a larger atomic radius than sodium, it can be expected to have a lower density,
