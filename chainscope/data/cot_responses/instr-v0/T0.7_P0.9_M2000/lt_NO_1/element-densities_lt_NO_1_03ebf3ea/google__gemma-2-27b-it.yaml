      1. **Density is related to mass and volume:**  Density = Mass / Volume.

      2. **Elements in the same group (column) of the periodic table have similar
      chemical properties:** Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K) are both in Group 1 (alkali
      metals).

      3. **Atomic size increases as you move down a group:** Potassium is below sodium
      in the periodic table.

      4. **Larger atoms have more electrons and occupy more space:** This means potassium
      has a larger atomic volume than sodium.

      5. **Atoms in the same group have similar atomic masses:** The difference in
      atomic mass between sodium and potassium is relatively small.


      **Conclusion:** Since potassium has a larger volume but a similar mass to sodium,
      potassium will have a lower density.
