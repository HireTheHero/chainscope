      1. Platinum is a metal.

      2. Gold is also a metal.

      3. Density is a measure of the mass per unit volume of a substance.

      4. The density of a substance depends on its atomic structure and the arrangement
      of its atoms.

      5. Platinum has an atomic number of 78 and a molar mass of 195.08 g/mol.
