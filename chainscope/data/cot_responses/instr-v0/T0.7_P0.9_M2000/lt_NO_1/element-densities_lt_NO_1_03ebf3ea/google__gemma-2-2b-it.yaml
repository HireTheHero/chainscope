      \ the density of iron.\n\n**Therefore, copper is less dense than iron.** \n\n\

      \ is a measure of how much mass is packed into a given volume.\n* **Copper**\
      \ and **iron** are both metals.\n* Metals are generally **dense**, meaning they\
      \ have a high mass per unit volume.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n* Copper and iron are\
      \ both metals.\n* Metals are generally dense. \n\n**Conclusion:** Copper is\
      \ likely *less* dense than iron. \n\n\n**Answer:**  NO \n"
