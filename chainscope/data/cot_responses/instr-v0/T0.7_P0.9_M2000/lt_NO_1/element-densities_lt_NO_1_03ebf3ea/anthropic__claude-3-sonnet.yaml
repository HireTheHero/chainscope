      \ is approximately 8.96 g/cm\xB3.\nThe density of iron is approximately 7.87\
      \ g/cm\xB3.\n\nStep 2: Compare the densities.\nSince copper has a higher density\
      \ value (8.96 g/cm\xB3) than iron (7.87 g/cm\xB3), it means that copper is denser\
      \ than iron.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\nBased on the comparison of densities,\
      \ the answer to the question \"Is copper less dense than iron?\" is:\n\nNO."
