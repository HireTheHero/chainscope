      \ the elements**: Potassium (K) and Lithium (Li) are both alkali metals, located\
      \ in Group 1 of the periodic table.\n\n2. **Understand density**: Density is\

      \ u.\n\n4. **Consider atomic radius and volume**:\n   - As we move down a group\
      \ in the periodic table, the atomic radius increases due to the addition of\
      \ new energy levels. This means that potassium, being below lithium in Group\
      \ 1, has a larger atomic radius than lithium.\n   - A larger atomic radius generally\

      \ a higher atomic mass and a larger volume than lithium, but its density is\
      \ actually higher than that of lithium, not lower.\n\nSo, based on the densities\
      \ of potassium (approximately 0.892 g/cm\xB3) and lithium (approximately 0.534\
