      \ the density of copper. The density of copper is approximately 8.96 g/cm\xB3\
      .\n\n2. Next, we determine the density of iron. The density of iron is around\
      \ 7.87 g/cm\xB3.\n\n3. Comparing these two values, it's clear that copper (8.96\
      \ g/cm\xB3) has a higher density compared to iron (7.87 g/cm\xB3).\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer to the question \"Is copper less dense than iron?\" is NO. Copper\
      \ is not less dense than iron; in fact, it is more dense."
