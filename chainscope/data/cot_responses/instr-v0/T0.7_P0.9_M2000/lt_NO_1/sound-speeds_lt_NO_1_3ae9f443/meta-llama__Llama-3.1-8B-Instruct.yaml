      1. **Identify the properties involved**: We''re comparing the speed of sound
      in two different materials: steel and copper. The speed of sound in a material
      is determined by its elastic properties, specifically its Young''s modulus and
      density.

      2. **Look up the speed of sound in each material**: The speed of sound in steel
      is approximately 5,960 meters per second (m/s), while in copper, it''s around
      3,958 m/s.

      3. **Compare the speeds**: Since 5,960 m/s is greater than 3,958 m/s, sound
      travels faster in steel than in copper.

      1. The speed of sound in a material is influenced by its density and elasticity.
      Generally, the denser and more elastic a material is, the faster sound travels
      through it.

      2. Steel is generally denser than copper. This means that steel has a higher
      mass per unit volume than copper.

      3. Copper is a relatively soft and malleable metal, which indicates that it
      is less elastic than steel. Steel, on the other hand, is harder and more rigid,
      which suggests that it is more elastic.

      4. Given that sound travels faster in denser and more elastic materials, we
      can infer that steel, being denser and more elastic than copper, should support
      the transmission of sound waves at a faster speed than copper.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO. Sound does not travel slower in steel than in
      copper.'

      Step 1: Recall the general rule about the speed of sound in different materials.
      The speed of sound is generally faster in solids than in liquids and gases.


      Step 2: Both copper and glass are solids, so we can''t conclude that sound travels
      slower in one of them just because it''s a solid. We need to consider other
      factors.


      Step 3: Consider the properties of copper and glass. Copper is a good conductor
      of electricity and heat, while glass is a poor conductor. The speed of sound
      in a material can be affected by its density and elasticity.


      Step 4: Compare the densities of copper and glass. Copper has a higher density
      than glass, which means it''s more compact and has a tighter atomic structure.


      Step 5: Recall that the speed of sound is influenced by the material''s elasticity,
      which is related to its stiffness. Materials with higher elasticity (i.e., stiffness)
      tend to have faster sound speeds.


      Step 6: Considering the higher density and elasticity of copper compared to

      sound travels through it.

      3. Rubber is a solid object with a relatively low density compared to water,
      which is a liquid.

      4. The stiffness of rubber molecules is different from that of water molecules,
      but generally, solids are stiffer than liquids.

      5. However, the speed of sound in water is significantly slower than in air,
      primarily due to water''s higher density and lower stiffness compared to air.

      6. Considering the properties of rubber and water, rubber is likely to have
      a higher stiffness than water due to its solid nature, but its lower density
      compared to water might make its sound speed comparable or even slower than
      in water.


      Given these considerations, my conclusion is that sound likely travels slower
      in rubber than in water.

      Step 4: Since sound travels slower in solids than in liquids, and rubber is
      a solid, we can infer that sound travels slower in rubber than in a typical

      in water. Since water is a liquid, and sound travels slower in solids than in
