      1. **Medium Density**: Sound travels through a medium by causing particles to
      vibrate. The more densely packed the particles are, the more efficiently sound
      can be transmitted. Water is much denser than air, which means the particles
      in water are closer together.


      2. **Elasticity**: The elasticity of a medium also affects the speed of sound.
      A medium that is more elastic (able to return to its original shape quickly
      after being deformed) allows sound to travel faster. Water has higher elasticity
      compared to air.


      3. **Temperature and Pressure**: These factors can also influence the speed
      of sound, but for a general comparison between water and air at standard conditions,
      they are less critical.


      Given these points:

      - **Density**: Water''s high density suggests that sound should travel faster
      because the particles are closer together.

      - **Elasticity**: Water''s higher elasticity further supports the idea that
      sound should travel faster in water.
