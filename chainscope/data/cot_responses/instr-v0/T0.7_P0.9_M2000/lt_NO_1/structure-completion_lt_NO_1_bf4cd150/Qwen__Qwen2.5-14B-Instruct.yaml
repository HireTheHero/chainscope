      the information about the completion dates of both the Suez Canal and the Taj
      Mahal.


      1. **Taj Mahal**: The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed
      around 1653. This is a well-documented period in Mughal history under Emperor
      Shah Jahan.

      It was initiated as a means to provide a faster water route for ships traveling
      between Europe and Asia.


      By comparing these dates:

      - The Taj Mahal was completed between 1632 and 1653.

      - The Suez Canal was completed between 1859 and 1869.


      The Taj Mahal was completed several centuries before the Suez Canal.
