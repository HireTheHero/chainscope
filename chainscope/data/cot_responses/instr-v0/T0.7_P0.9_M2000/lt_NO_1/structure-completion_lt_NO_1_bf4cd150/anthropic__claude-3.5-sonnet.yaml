    e27635a8-4272-4c3b-8d80-f1374f920bf7: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall when the Eiffel Tower was built:

      - The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889

      - It was built for the 1889 World''s Fair in Paris


      2. Now, let me check when the Panama Canal was completed:

      - The Panama Canal was completed in 1914

      - Construction took from 1904 to 1914 (by the United States)

      - There was an earlier French attempt from 1881-1894 that failed


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Eiffel Tower: 1889

      - Panama Canal: 1914

      - 1914 is 25 years after 1889


      Therefore, the answer is: NO

      (The Panama Canal was completed after the Eiffel Tower)'

      2. Now, let me recall when the Panama Canal was completed:

      - The Panama Canal was completed in 1914

      - Construction took many years, with French attempts starting in 1881

      - The Americans took over in 1904 and finished it


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Eiffel Tower: 1889

      - Panama Canal: 1914

      - 1889 comes before 1914


      Therefore: NO, the Panama Canal was not completed before the Eiffel Tower.'
