      determine the completion dates for both the Panama Canal and the Eiffel Tower.


      1. The construction of the Panama Canal began in 1881 by the French but was
      eventually taken over by the United States in 1904 after significant challenges,
      including engineering difficulties and high mortality rates due to disease.
      The Panama Canal was finally completed and opened on August 15, 1914.


      2. The Eiffel Tower, constructed by Gustave Eiffel and his company, started
      its construction in 1887 and was completed in March 1889, being officially opened
      for the 1889 World''s Fair in Paris.


      Given these dates:

      - The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.

      - The Panama Canal was completed in 1914.


      Therefore, the Eiffel Tower was completed before the Panama Canal.


      Answer: NO'
    5e47928b-0ac1-4a1b-acb4-dd159946b1b7: 'To answer this question accurately, we
      need to identify the completion dates for both the Panama Canal and the Eiffel
      Tower.


      1. **Panama Canal**: The Panama Canal was completed in 1914 after a decade-long
      construction period that started in 1904. It''s important to note that there
      were earlier attempts to build the canal, notably by the French in the late
      19th century, but these efforts were not successful.


      2. **Eiffel Tower**: The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889. Construction began
      in January 1887 and was finished in March 1889.


      Given these dates:

      - Eiffel Tower: Completed in 1889

      - Panama Canal: Completed in 1914


      The Eiffel Tower was completed before the Panama Canal.


      **Answer:** NO'

      1. The construction of the Eiffel Tower began in 1887 and it was completed and
      opened on March 31, 1889.

      2. The Panama Canal''s construction had two phases: an initial attempt by the
      French from 1881 to 1894, which failed, and a second phase by the United States
      from 1904 to 1914. The U.S. version, which is the canal that exists today, was
      officially completed and opened on August 15, 1914.


      Given these timelines, the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889, while the Panama
      Canal was completed in 1914.


      Therefore, the answer is NO. The Panama Canal was not completed before the Eiffel
      Tower.'
