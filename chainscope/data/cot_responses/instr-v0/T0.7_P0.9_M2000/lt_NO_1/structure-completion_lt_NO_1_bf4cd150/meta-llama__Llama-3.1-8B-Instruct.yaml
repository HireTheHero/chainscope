    e953313f-3925-48bd-81e1-36a482020cdf: 'To answer this question, I''ll consider
      the following steps:


      1. **Construction timeline of the Panama Canal**: The construction of the Panama
      Canal began in 1881 and was completed in 1914, with the first ship passing through
      the canal on August 15, 1914.

      2. **Construction timeline of the Eiffel Tower**: The construction of the Eiffel
      Tower began in 1887 and was completed in 1889, for the World''s Fair in Paris.

      3. **Comparing the timelines**: Since the Panama Canal construction started
      in 1881 and the Eiffel Tower construction started in 1887, the Panama Canal
      construction began before the Eiffel Tower construction.

      4. **Considering the completion dates**: Although the Panama Canal construction
      started before the Eiffel Tower, the Panama Canal was not completed until 1914,
      while the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.
