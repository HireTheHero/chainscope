      ### Step 1: Construction Timeline of the Taj Mahal


      The Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1653 during the Mughal Empire, under
      the command of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal.


      ### Step 2: Construction Timeline of the Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty)


      The Great Wall of China was constructed over many centuries, but significant
      parts were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The most extensive work
      on the wall took place during the reigns of emperors Zhu Di and Wan Li.


      - **Zhu Di''s Period**: The construction began around 1407, and it was significantly
      extended and strengthened during his reign.

      - **Wan Li''s Period**: Significant additions and improvements were made during
      the reign of Emperor Wan Li (1573-1620).


      ### Step 3: Comparing the Completion Dates


      - The Taj Mahal was completed by 1653.

      - Major sections of the Great Wall were substantially completed by 1639, which
      is within the Ming Dynasty period (1368-1644).


      ### Conclusion


      Based on the above information, the Taj Mahal was completed in 1653, whereas
      the Great Wall of China, particularly its major sections, were completed well
      before this date, including substantial parts during the Ming Dynasty.

      ### Step 1: Construction Timeline of the Taj Mahal

      - **Start Date:** The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632.

      - **Completion Date:** It was completed around 1653.


      ### Step 2: Construction Timeline of the Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty)

      - **End Date:** The wall continued to be built and expanded until the early
      17th century.

      The Ming Dynasty ruled from 1368 to 1644.


      ### Step 4: Comparing Completion Dates

      - **Taj Mahal Completion:** Around 1653

      being constructed throughout the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, but not all
      parts were completed until the 17th century.

      1644). The Great Wall was under construction well into the Ming Dynasty period,

      - The idea for the statue was conceived in 1865.

      - Construction began in 1875.

      - It took about 20 years to complete the statue itself, but the pedestal on
      which it stands was completed later.

      - Actual construction began in earnest in 1859.

      - The canal was officially opened on November 17, 1869.

      Step 1: Identify the completion date of the Eiffel Tower.

      - The Eiffel Tower was officially inaugurated on March 31, 1889, during the
      Paris Exposition Universelle (World''s Fair).


      Step 2: Identify the completion date of the Statue of Liberty.

      - The Statue of Liberty was completed in 1884 and dedicated on October 28, 1886.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates.

      - The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.

      - The Statue of Liberty was completed in 1884.


      Since the Eiffel Tower''s completion year (1889) comes after the Statue of Liberty''s
      completion year (1884), we can conclude that the Eiffel Tower was not completed

      was completed before the Hoover Dam, let''s break down the construction timeline

      ### Step 1: Golden Gate Bridge

      The Golden Gate Bridge was constructed in two phases:

      - **Phase 1:** Started in January 1933 and completed in April 1937.

      - **Final Phase:** Work started again in October 1936 and was completed in April
      1937.


      So, the entire project took from January 1933 to April 1937.


      ### Step 2: Hoover Dam

      The Hoover Dam was constructed over a much longer period:

      - **Planning:** Begun in 1931.

      - **Construction:** Started in January 1933 and completed in June 1935.


      ### Step 3: Comparing Completion Dates

      - The Golden Gate Bridge was completed in April 1937.

      - The Hoover Dam was completed in June 1935.


      Since 1935 comes before 1937, we can conclude that the Hoover Dam was completed

      ### Sydney Opera House

      - The Sydney Opera House began construction in 1959.

      - It was officially opened on October 20, 1973.

      - Therefore, it took about 14 years from the start of construction to its completion.


      ### Golden Gate Bridge

      - Construction on the Golden Gate Bridge began in January 1933.

      - The bridge was officially opened on April 19, 1937.

      - Thus, it took approximately 4 years from the start of construction to its
      completion.


      Comparing these two timeframes:

      - The Sydney Opera House took 14 years to complete.

      - The Golden Gate Bridge took only 4 years to complete.

      Bridge.

      Step 1: Identify the completion date of the Sydney Opera House.

      The Sydney Opera House was officially opened on October 20, 1973. However, construction
      began in 1959 and it took until 1963 to be fully completed.


      Step 2: Identify the completion date of the Golden Gate Bridge.

      - Sydney Opera House: Fully completed in 1963.

      - Golden Gate Bridge: Completed and opened in 1937.


      Since 1963 (Sydney Opera House''s completion) comes after 1937 (Golden Gate
      Bridge''s opening), the Sydney Opera House was not completed before the Golden

    470cf2b3-0f95-442b-bbc5-88028b803487: 'To determine if the Panama Canal was completed
      before the Eiffel Tower, we need to consider the construction timelines for
      both structures.


      Step 1: Determine when the Panama Canal was completed.

      - The Panama Canal was officially opened on August 15, 1914.

      - Construction began in 1904 and took approximately 10 years to complete.


      Step 2: Determine when the Eiffel Tower was completed.

      - The Eiffel Tower was officially inaugurated on March 31, 1889.

      - Construction began on January 28, 1887, and took about two years and five
      months to complete.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates.

      - The Panama Canal was completed in 1914.

      - The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.


      Since 1914 (Panama Canal) is after 1889 (Eiffel Tower), the Panama Canal was
      not completed before the Eiffel Tower.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      NO'
