      - The Taj Mahal was constructed between 1632 and 1653

      - It was completed in 1653 during the Mughal Empire in India


      2. Next, let''s identify when the Suez Canal was completed:

      - The Suez Canal was completed in 1869

      - It was constructed under the supervision of Ferdinand de Lesseps

      - This was during the Ottoman Empire''s control of Egypt


      3. Compare the dates:

      - Taj Mahal: Completed in 1653

      - Suez Canal: Completed in 1869
