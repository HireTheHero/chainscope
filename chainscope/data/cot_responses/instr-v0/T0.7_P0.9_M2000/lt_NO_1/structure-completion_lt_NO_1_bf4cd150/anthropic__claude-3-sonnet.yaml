      the completion dates of the Empire State Building and the Panama Canal. Let''s
      break it down step by step:


      Step 1: Determine when the Empire State Building was completed.

      The Empire State Building is a famous skyscraper located in New York City. Construction
      began in 1930, and it was officially completed and opened on May 1, 1931.


      Step 2: Determine when the Panama Canal was completed.

      The Panama Canal is an artificial waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific
      Oceans through the Isthmus of Panama. Construction on the canal began in 1904
      and was completed in 1914.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates.

      The Empire State Building was completed in 1931, while the Panama Canal was
      completed earlier, in 1914.
