      and Mount K2.

      - Mount Everest is the highest peak in the world, located in the Mahalangur
      Himal sub-range of the Himalayas, on the border between China (Tibet) and Nepal.
      Its height is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level.

      - Mount K2 is the second-highest mountain in the world, located on the border
      between Pakistan and China. Its height is 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above sea
      level.


      Step 2: Compare the heights.

      - Comparing the two altitudes, we see that Mount Everest at 8,848 meters is
      higher than Mount K2, which stands at 8,611 meters.
