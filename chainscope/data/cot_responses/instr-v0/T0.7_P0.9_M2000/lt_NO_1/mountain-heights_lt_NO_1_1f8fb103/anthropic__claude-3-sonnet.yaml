      Mount K2 is the second-highest mountain in the world, located in the Karakoram
      range on the border between Pakistan and China.


      Step 2: Compare the heights of Mount Everest and Mount K2.

      The height of Mount Everest is 8,849 meters (29,032 feet) above sea level.

      The height of Mount K2 is 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Determine which mountain is higher.

      Since Mount Everest has a greater height of 8,849 meters compared to Mount K2''s
      height of 8,611 meters, Mount Everest is the higher mountain.


      Step 4: Answer the question based on the reasoning.

      The question asks, "Is Mount Everest lower than Mount K2?"

      Based on the reasoning that Mount Everest is higher than Mount K2, the answer
      is:
