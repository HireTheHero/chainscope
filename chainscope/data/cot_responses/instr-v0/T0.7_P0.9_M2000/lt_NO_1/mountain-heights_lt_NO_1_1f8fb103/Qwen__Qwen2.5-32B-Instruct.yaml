      The Matterhorn has an elevation of approximately 4,478 meters (or about 14,692
      feet) above sea level.


      Step 2: Find the elevation of Mount Whitney.

      Mount Whitney, the highest mountain peak in the contiguous United States, has
      an elevation of 4,421 meters (or about 14,505 feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Compare the two elevations.

      Since The Matterhorn''s elevation is approximately 4,478 meters and Mount Whitney''s
      is approximately 4,421 meters, it is clear that The Matterhorn is actually higher
      than Mount Whitney.
