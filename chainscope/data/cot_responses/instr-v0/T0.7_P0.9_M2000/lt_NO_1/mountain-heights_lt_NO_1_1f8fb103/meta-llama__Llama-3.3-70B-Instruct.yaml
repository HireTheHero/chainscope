      1. **Identify the height of Mount Kilimanjaro**: Mount Kilimanjaro, located
      in Tanzania, is the highest mountain in Africa. Its summit, Uhuru Peak, stands
      at a height of 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level.


      2. **Identify the height of Mount Elbrus**: Mount Elbrus, located in Russia,
      is the highest mountain in Europe. It has two summits, with the higher one reaching
      a height of 5,642 meters (18,510 feet) above sea level.


      3. **Compare the heights**: Now, compare the height of Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895
      meters) with the height of Mount Elbrus (5,642 meters).


      Given that 5,895 meters (the height of Mount Kilimanjaro) is greater than 5,642
      meters (the height of Mount Elbrus), we can conclude that Mount Kilimanjaro
