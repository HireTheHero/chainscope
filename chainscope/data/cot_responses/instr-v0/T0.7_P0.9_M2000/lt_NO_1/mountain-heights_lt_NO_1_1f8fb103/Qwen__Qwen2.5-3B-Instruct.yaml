    058d7907-f795-4ddf-94e3-3427738e38d6: 'To determine if Mount Kilimanjaro is lower
      than Mount Elbrus, I will follow these steps:


      1. Identify the heights of both mountains.

      2. Compare the heights to determine which one is higher.

      3. Determine if Mount Kilimanjaro is lower than Mount Elbrus based on the comparison.


      Step 1: Identifying the heights.

      - Mount Kilimanjaro''s height is approximately 5,895 meters (19,341 feet).

      - Mount Elbrus''s height is approximately 5,642 meters (18,510 feet).


      Step 2: Comparing the heights.

      Since 5,895 meters is greater than 5,642 meters, Mount Kilimanjaro is taller
      than Mount Elbrus.


      Step 3: Determining if Mount Kilimanjaro is lower than Mount Elbrus.

      As we have established that Mount Kilimanjaro is taller than Mount Elbrus, it
      cannot be lower than Mount Elbrus.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      NO'

      Step 1: Recall the elevation of Mount Everest.

      Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world, has an elevation of approximately
      8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level.


      Step 2: Recall the elevation of Mount K2.
