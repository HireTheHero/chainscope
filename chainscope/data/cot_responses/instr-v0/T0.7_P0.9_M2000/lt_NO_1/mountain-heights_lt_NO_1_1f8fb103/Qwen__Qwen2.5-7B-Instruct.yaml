    1c4cb28d-9fc7-4b1b-b4af-ccabebac057d: 'To determine if Mount Kilimanjaro is lower
      than Mount Elbrus, let''s follow these steps:


      1. Find the elevation of Mount Kilimanjaro.

      2. Find the elevation of Mount Elbrus.

      3. Compare the two elevations.


      Step 1: The elevation of Mount Kilimanjaro is approximately 5,895 meters (19,341
      feet).


      Step 2: The elevation of Mount Elbrus is approximately 5,642 meters (18,510
      feet).


      Step 3: Comparing the two:

      - Mount Kilimanjaro: 5,895 meters

      - Mount Elbrus: 5,642 meters


      Since 5,895 meters is greater than 5,642 meters, Mount Kilimanjaro is higher
      than Mount Elbrus.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'
