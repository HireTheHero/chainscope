    05055854-f777-45ea-a1d1-ee7ce17210c5: 'To determine if Zendaya is shorter than
      Jennifer Lawrence, I need to follow these steps:


      1. Find the current height of both Zendaya and Jennifer Lawrence.

      2. Compare their heights.


      Step 1: Finding their current heights:

      - According to recent sources, Jennifer Lawrence''s height is approximately
      5 feet 4 inches (163 cm).

      - According to various sources, Zendaya''s height is approximately 5 feet 3
      inches (160 cm).


      Step 2: Comparing their heights:

      - Jennifer Lawrence is 5 feet 4 inches tall.

      - Zendaya is 5 feet 3 inches tall.


      Since 5 feet 4 inches (which is 163 cm) is greater than 5 feet 3 inches (which
      is 160 cm), we can conclude that Jennifer Lawrence is taller than Zendaya.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Zendaya shorter than Jennifer Lawrence?"
      is:
