      1. Kevin Hart is an American actor and comedian.

      2. Scarlett Johansson is a Canadian actress.

      3. Both Kevin Hart and Scarlett Johansson are known to be relatively tall, but
      I couldn''t find a specific height measurement for either of them.

      4. Since I couldn''t find a specific height measurement, I''ll make an educated
      guess. Based on general knowledge, I''ll assume that both actors are likely
      above average height.

      5. Considering the height of both actors, I''ll make a rough estimate. Assuming
      an average height of around 5''9" (175 cm) for both actors, Kevin Hart is likely
      around 5''10" (178 cm) or 5''11" (180 cm).

      6. Scarlett Johansson is around 5''4" (163 cm) or 5''5" (165 cm) based on my
      knowledge.

      7. Since Kevin Hart is taller than Scarlett Johansson, my answer is: NO'

      1. I don''t have any information about Kevin Hart''s height.

      2. I don''t have any information about Scarlett Johansson''s height either.

      3. Since I don''t have any information about either person''s height, I need

      4. In general, it''s common knowledge that Scarlett Johansson is a petite actress,
      often playing roles that require a slender build.

      5. Therefore, it''s reasonable to assume that Scarlett Johansson is likely shorter
      than Kevin Hart, as she tends to have a more slender build.

      To determine if Kevin Hart is shorter than Scarlett Johansson, let''s consider
      the following steps:


      1. We don''t have any specific information about their heights, so let''s assume
      we''re looking at their heights in a general sense.

      2. According to my knowledge, Scarlett Johansson''s height is approximately
      5 feet 7 inches (170 cm).

      3. Kevin Hart''s height is approximately 5 feet 2 inches (157 cm).


      Now, let''s compare their heights:


      * Scarlett Johansson is taller than Kevin Hart by 5 inches (12 cm).


      Based on this comparison, we can conclude that Kevin Hart is shorter than Scarlett
      Johansson.


      So, my answer is: YES.'

      and Mark Wahlberg. Unfortunately, their heights are not publicly known, and
      it''s not possible to find reliable sources that provide their heights.


      However, I can suggest a few options to help us find the answer:


      1. Check online sources: You can try searching for Jennifer Lawrence''s and
      Mark Wahlberg''s heights on websites like Wikipedia, IMDB, or other online encyclopedias.

      2. Look up celebrity height databases: Websites like Celebrity Height Finder
      or Height Frenzy provide information on the heights of various celebrities.

      3. Use a height estimation tool: Some websites, like What''s My Height, allow
      you to input the height of a celebrity and estimate their height.


      Assuming we find the heights of both celebrities, we can proceed with the reasoning
      steps.
