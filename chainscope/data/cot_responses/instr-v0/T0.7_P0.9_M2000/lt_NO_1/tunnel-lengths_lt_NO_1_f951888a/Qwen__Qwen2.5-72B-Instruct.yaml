      Johnson Memorial Tunnel, is located in Colorado, USA.\n   - It consists of two\
      \ bores, each about 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers) long.\n\n2. **Holland Tunnel:**\n\
      \   - The Holland Tunnel connects New York City and Jersey City, New Jersey,\
      \ USA.\n   - It also consists of two tubes, each about 0.83 miles (1.34 kilometers)\
      \ long.\n\nNow, let's compare the lengths:\n- Eisenhower Tunnel: 1.7 miles (2.7\
      \ kilometers)\n- Holland Tunnel: 0.83 miles (1.34 kilometers)\n\nSince 1.7 miles\
      \ is greater than 0.83 miles, the Eisenhower Tunnel is longer than the Holland\
      \ Tunnel.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**."
