      1. First, let me recall the lengths of both tunnels:

      - The Gotthard Base Tunnel is 57.1 km (35.5 miles) long

      - The Seikan Tunnel is 53.85 km (33.46 miles) long


      2. To determine if one is shorter than the other, I need to compare these numbers:

      57.1 km > 53.85 km


      3. Since the Gotthard Base Tunnel (57.1 km) is longer than the Seikan Tunnel
      (53.85 km), it cannot be shorter.
