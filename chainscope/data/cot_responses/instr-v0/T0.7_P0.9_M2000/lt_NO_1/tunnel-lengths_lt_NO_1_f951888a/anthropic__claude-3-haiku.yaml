      2. The Holland Tunnel is a road tunnel located between New York City and Jersey
      City, New Jersey, USA.

      3. To determine which tunnel is shorter, we need to compare the lengths of the
      two tunnels.

      4. The Eisenhower Tunnel is approximately 1.7 miles (2.7 km) long.

      5. The Holland Tunnel is approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km) long.

      6. Since the Holland Tunnel (1.6 miles) is shorter than the Eisenhower Tunnel
