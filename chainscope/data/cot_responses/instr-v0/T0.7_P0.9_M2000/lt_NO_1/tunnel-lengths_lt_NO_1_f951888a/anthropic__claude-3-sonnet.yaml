      - The Eisenhower Tunnel is approximately 1.7 miles (2.7 km) long.

      - The Holland Tunnel is approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km) long.


      Step 4: Determine which tunnel is shorter

      Based on the lengths provided in Step 3, the Holland Tunnel (1.6 miles) is shorter
      than the Eisenhower Tunnel (1.7 miles).


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO, the Eisenhower Tunnel is NOT shorter than the Holland Tunnel.'

      \n1) The Eisenhower Tunnel is located in Colorado, United States. It is a pair\
      \ of vehicular tunnels that run under the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains.\
      \ The tunnel's total length is approximately 1.7 miles (2.7 km).\n\n2) The Holland\
      \ Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel that connects the island of Manhattan in New\
      \ York City with Jersey City, New Jersey. It runs underneath the Hudson River.\
      \ The tunnel's total length is approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km).\n\n3) Comparing\
      \ the lengths:\n   Eisenhower Tunnel: 1.7 miles (2.7 km)\n   Holland Tunnel:\
      \ 1.6 miles (2.6 km)\n\n4) Since the Eisenhower Tunnel is longer than the Holland\
      \ Tunnel, the answer is:\n\nNO, the Eisenhower Tunnel is not shorter than the\
      \ Holland Tunnel."
