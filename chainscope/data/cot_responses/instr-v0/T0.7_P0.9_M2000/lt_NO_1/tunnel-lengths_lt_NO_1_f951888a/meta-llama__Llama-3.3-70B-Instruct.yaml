      the lengths of both tunnels:


      1. **Simplon Tunnel**: This is a railway tunnel through the Lepontine Alps in
      Switzerland. It has two single-track tubes. The Simplon Tunnel is approximately
      19.8 kilometers (12.3 miles) long.


      2. **St. Gotthard Road Tunnel**: This tunnel is also in Switzerland and is used
      for road traffic. It goes through the St. Gotthard massif. The St. Gotthard
      Road Tunnel is approximately 17 kilometers (10.6 miles) long.


      Now, comparing the lengths:


      - The Simplon Tunnel is approximately 19.8 kilometers long.

      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is approximately 17 kilometers long.


      Since 19.8 kilometers is greater than 17 kilometers, the Simplon Tunnel is longer

      - The Holland Tunnel is approximately 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) long.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) long for each
      of its three tubes, but since we are comparing overall tunnel length, we consider
      the total length of the tunnel system. However, for the purpose of this comparison,
      the key figure is the length of the tunnel itself, not the total project length
      including approaches.


      Given this information:

      - The Holland Tunnel is about 2.5 miles long.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel, focusing on the tunnel portion, is about 1.5 miles long
      for each tube.


      Since 1.5 miles (the length of the Lincoln Tunnel) is less than 2.5 miles (the
      length of the Holland Tunnel), we can conclude:


      YES'
    def4245a-6b7a-437d-b17f-2747ea2d9200: 'To determine if the Holland Tunnel is shorter
      than the Lincoln Tunnel, let''s examine the lengths of both tunnels.


      1. **Identify the lengths of the tunnels**: The Holland Tunnel, connecting Manhattan,
      New York, to Jersey City, New Jersey, under the Hudson River, has a total length.
      The Lincoln Tunnel, also under the Hudson River, connecting Manhattan to Weehawken,
      New Jersey, has its own specific length.


      2. **Compare the lengths**: Once we have the lengths, we can compare them directly
      to determine which tunnel is shorter.


      According to available data:

      - The Holland Tunnel is approximately 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) long.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) long for each
      of its three tubes, but when considering the entire length from one end to the
      other, including all tubes, it''s still roughly around that 1.5 miles for the
      center tube, with variations for the other tubes due to their slightly different
      entry and exit points.


      Given this information:

      - The Holland Tunnel is approximately 2.5 miles long.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel''s length can be considered roughly 1.5 miles for the purpose
      of this comparison, focusing on the central tube.


      3. **Conclusion**: Based on these lengths, the Holland Tunnel (2.5 miles) is
      longer than the Lincoln Tunnel (approximately 1.5 miles).


      Therefore, the answer to whether the Holland Tunnel is shorter than the Lincoln
      Tunnel is: **NO**.'

      we''ll consider the overall length. According to various sources, the Lincoln
      Tunnel is approximately 2.5 miles (about 4 kilometers) long.


      2. **Identify the Length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel**: The Sydney Harbour
      Tunnel is located in Sydney, Australia, and it runs under Sydney Harbour. The
      tunnel itself is approximately 2.3 kilometers long.


      3. **Compare the Lengths**: Now, we compare the lengths of the two tunnels.
      The Lincoln Tunnel is about 4 kilometers long, while the Sydney Harbour Tunnel
      is about 2.3 kilometers long.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that 4 kilometers (the length of the Lincoln Tunnel)
      is greater than 2.3 kilometers (the length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel), we
      can conclude that the Lincoln Tunnel is indeed longer than the Sydney Harbour
      Tunnel.

      Tunnel, the answer based on our comparison is:


      NO'

      The Gotthard Base Tunnel is approximately 57 kilometers long, while the Seikan
      Tunnel is approximately 53.85 kilometers long.


      Based on the comparison, since 57 kilometers (the length of the Gotthard Base
      Tunnel) is greater than 53.85 kilometers (the length of the Seikan Tunnel),
      the Gotthard Base Tunnel is not shorter than the Seikan Tunnel.


      The answer is: **NO**'
    dd5ffa47-4ff0-40b3-980c-aa651f5d77f6: 'To answer this question, we first need
