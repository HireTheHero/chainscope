      1. The Simplon Tunnel is located in Switzerland, connecting Bern (Switzerland)
      to Zermatt (Switzerland).

      2. The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is also located in Switzerland, running from
      Tirano (Italy) to Chur (Switzerland).


      The Simplon Tunnel has been in use since 1859, while the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel
      was opened in 1960.


      Given these facts:

      - Both tunnels connect two different countries but serve similar purposes (crossing
      mountains for vehicular traffic).

      - The age difference between the two tunnels suggests that the Simplon Tunnel
      may be older and thus potentially longer due to wear and tear over time.


      However, without precise measurements of both tunnels'' lengths, it''s not possible
      to definitively state whether the Simplon Tunnel is shorter than the St. Gotthard
      Road Tunnel.

      due to varied geological conditions like mountains, valleys, and rivers.


      2. **Elevation Changes**: Tunnels often pass through regions with significant
