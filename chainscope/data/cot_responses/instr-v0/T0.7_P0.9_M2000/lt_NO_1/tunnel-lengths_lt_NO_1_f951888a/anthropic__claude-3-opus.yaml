      1. The Mont Blanc Tunnel is a road tunnel that connects France and Italy. It
      goes through the Mont Blanc mountain under the Alps.


      2. The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a bridge-tunnel combination across Tokyo Bay in
      Japan. It consists of a 4.4 km bridge and a 9.6 km tunnel.


      3. To compare the lengths, we need to know the length of the Mont Blanc Tunnel.


      4. The Mont Blanc Tunnel is approximately 11.6 km (7.2 miles) long.


      5. The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line''s tunnel portion is 9.6 km long, which is shorter
      than the Mont Blanc Tunnel.


      6. However, the total length of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, including the bridge
