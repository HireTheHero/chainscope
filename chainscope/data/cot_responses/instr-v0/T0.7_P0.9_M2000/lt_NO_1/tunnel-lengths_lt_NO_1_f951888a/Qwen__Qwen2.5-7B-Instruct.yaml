    31e31671-0920-4192-b00c-75ee31a62f70: 'To determine if the Eisenhower Tunnel is
      shorter than the Holland Tunnel, let''s gather the necessary information about
      their lengths.


      1. **Eisenhower Tunnel**: This tunnel is part of Interstate 70 in the United
      States, specifically in Colorado. The Eisenhower Tunnel has two tubes, each
      1.69 miles (2.72 kilometers) long. Since it consists of two tubes, we can consider
      the total length of the Eisenhower Tunnel to be 3.38 miles (5.44 kilometers).


      2. **Holland Tunnel**: This tunnel connects New Jersey and New York City across
      the Hudson River. It has two tubes, each 8,010 feet (2,441 meters) long. Therefore,
      the total length of the Holland Tunnel is 16,020 feet (4,882 meters), which
      is approximately 3.02 miles (4.86 kilometers).


      Now, comparing the lengths:

      - Eisenhower Tunnel: 3.38 miles (5.44 kilometers)

      - Holland Tunnel: 3.02 miles (4.86 kilometers)


      Since 3.38 miles is greater than 3.02 miles, the Eisenhower Tunnel is indeed
      longer than the Holland Tunnel.


      **Answer: NO**'
