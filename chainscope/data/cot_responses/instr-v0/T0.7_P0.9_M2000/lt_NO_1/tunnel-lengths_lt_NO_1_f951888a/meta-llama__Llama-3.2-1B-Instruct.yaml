      To determine whether the Simplon Tunnel is shorter than the St. Gotthard Road

      2. The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, on the other hand, is a road tunnel that connects
      Switzerland to Italy, also spanning the Mont Blanc mountain.

      3. Since both tunnels are located in the same mountain range, I can assume that
      the terrain and geography are similar.


      Now, let''s consider the route and dimensions of each tunnel:


      * The Simplon Tunnel has a length of approximately 11.8 km (7.3 miles) and a
      maximum height of 1,250 meters (4,100 feet) above sea level.

      * The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel has a length of approximately 14.5 km (9 miles)
