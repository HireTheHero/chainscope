    356debc9-41cd-41a0-be44-90158d58c97c: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the length of the Simplon Tunnel:

      - The Simplon Tunnel is a railway tunnel through the Alps between Switzerland
      and Italy

      - Its length is approximately 19.8 kilometers (19.8 km)


      2. Next, let''s find the length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel:

      - This is a road tunnel also located in the Swiss Alps

      - Its length is approximately 16.9 kilometers (16.9 km)


      3. Comparing the two tunnel lengths:

      - Simplon Tunnel: 19.8 km

      - St. Gotthard Road Tunnel: 16.9 km

      - 19.8 km is longer than 16.9 km


      4. Therefore, the Simplon Tunnel is NOT shorter than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.
