      Step 1: Find the approximate length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

      The Lincoln Tunnel connects New York City''s Port Authority Bus Terminal in
      New Jersey with the World Trade Center in Manhattan. Its main tubes are approximately
      4,768 feet (1,454 meters) long. The combined length of both tubes, including

      Step 2: Find the approximate length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

      The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is a tube tunnel under Sydney Harbour that runs from
      Circular Quay to Milsons Point. It has a total length of approximately 1,840
      meters (about 1.14 miles), which is equivalent to 1,840,000 millimeters or 1,840

      Step 1: Determine the length of the Seikan Tunnel.

      - The Seikan Tunnel is a rail tunnel in northern Japan that connects the Japanese
      islands of Honshu and Hokkaido.

      - It is approximately 23.35 kilometers (14.51 miles) long.


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Chunnel Service Tunnel.

      - The Chunnel refers to the Channel Tunnel, which runs beneath the English Channel
      connecting England, France, and Belgium.

      - The service tunnel, used for trains, is approximately 50.5 kilometers (31.4
      miles) long.

      - Note that the Chunnel itself has two service tunnels, each about 50.5 kilometers
      long, totaling 101 kilometers (62.7 miles) when combined, but we''re specifically
      considering the length of one of these tunnels for comparison.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - Length of Seikan Tunnel: 23.35 km

      - Length of Chunnel Service Tunnel: 50.5 km

      - **Eisenhower Tunnel**: Located in Boulder County, Colorado, connecting Boulder
      and Longmont.

      - **Holland Tunnel**: Located in New York City, connecting Manhattan to Jersey
      City, New Jersey.


      ### Step 2: Find Length Data

      - **Eisenhower Tunnel**: The Eisenhower Tunnel is approximately 3.5 miles (5.6
      kilometers) long.

      - **Holland Tunnel**: The Holland Tunnel is approximately 1.75 miles (2.8 kilometers)

      - Holland Tunnel: 1.75 miles


      ### Step 4: Determine Which Is Shorter

      shorter than the Holland Tunnel, I''ll need to gather some information about
      their lengths.


      Step 1: Research the length of the Eisenhower Tunnel.

      The Eisenhower Tunnel is a ventilation tunnel in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado,
      not a vehicular tunnel. It''s used for air flow and does not have vehicles passing
      through it. Therefore, we can disregard this tunnel for our comparison.


      Step 2: Research the length of the Holland Tunnel.

      The Holland Tunnel connects Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey. Its total
      length, including approach tunnels, is approximately 4,335 feet (1,321 meters).


      Step 3: Research the length of another tunnel that could be considered for comparison.

      For a direct comparison, let''s consider the Lincoln Tunnel. The total length
      of the Lincoln Tunnel, which connects Midtown Manhattan to the Upper West Side,
      is approximately 4,760 feet (1,450 meters). This is closer in length to the
      Holland Tunnel but still longer.


      Step 4: Make a final comparison between the Holland Tunnel and any comparable
      tunnel.

      Since the Eisenhower Tunnel is not a vehicular tunnel and we don''t have information
      on its exact length, and given that we''re looking for a direct comparison,
      we should consider the Holland Tunnel as the relevant point of comparison. Comparing
      the Holland Tunnel to the Lincoln Tunnel shows that the Lincoln Tunnel is slightly
      longer than the Holland Tunnel.


      Conclusion:

      No, the Eisenhower Tunnel is not shorter than the Holland Tunnel. In fact, it''s
      likely longer than the Holland Tunnel, especially considering the Lincoln Tunnel
      is around 4,760 feet long, making it the longest vehicular tunnel under a city
