      and Italy. Its length is approximately 19,874 meters (or about 19.874 kilometers).


      Step 2: Find the length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.

      The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is also located in Switzerland and has a length
      of approximately 16,563 meters (or about 16.563 kilometers). However, it''s
      important to note that this figure refers to the original road tunnel. The newer
      Gotthard Base Tunnel, which includes both rail and road segments, has a different
      length, but since the question specifically mentions the "St. Gotthard Road
      Tunnel," we''ll use the older figure.

      Aqua-Line and the length of the Eisenhower Tunnel.


      Step 1: Determine the length of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line.

      - The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is approximately 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) long, including
      both the bridge and tunnel sections.


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Eisenhower Tunnel.

      - The Eisenhower Tunnel, located in Colorado, USA, has a total length of about
      3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line at about 14 kilometers is longer than the Eisenhower
      Tunnel which is around 3.5 kilometers.

      Step 1: Find the length of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line.

      - The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, which includes the Tokyo Bay Aqualine Bridge and
      the Kawasaki Channel Submarine Tunnel, has a total length of approximately 14
      kilometers (8.7 miles).


      Step 2: Find the length of the Eisenhower Tunnel.

      - The Eisenhower Tunnel, located in Colorado, USA, is actually a pair of tunnels.
      The length of each tunnel is about 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - The total length of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is significantly longer at 14
      kilometers compared to the 3.5 kilometers length of one tunnel in the Eisenhower
      Tunnel complex.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is NO, the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is not shorter

      the lengths of two different structures: the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line and the Eisenhower

      Step 1: Determine the length of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line.

      The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a route that connects Kisarazu in Chiba Prefecture
      with Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture across Tokyo Bay. It includes both bridge
      and tunnel sections. The total length of the Aqua-Line is approximately 14 kilometers
      (8.7 miles).


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Eisenhower Tunnel.

      The Eisenhower Tunnel is located on Interstate 70 in Colorado, United States.
      It is one of the longest highway tunnels in North America and consists of two
      bores (tubes). Each bore is about 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is approximately 14 kilometers long, while the Eisenhower
      Tunnel, when considering each tube, is about 3.5 kilometers long. If we consider
      the entire structure, it would still be less than half the length of the Tokyo
      Bay Aqua-Line.
