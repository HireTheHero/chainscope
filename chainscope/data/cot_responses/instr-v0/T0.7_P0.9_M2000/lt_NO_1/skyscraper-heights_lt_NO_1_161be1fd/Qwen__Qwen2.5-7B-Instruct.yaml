      1. The height of the Empire State Building: The Empire State Building stands
      at approximately 443 meters (including its antenna).

      2. The height of the Bank of America Tower: The Bank of America Tower, also
      known as 100 Federation Plaza, stands at approximately 359 meters.


      Now, comparing these two heights:

      - Empire State Building: 443 meters

      - Bank of America Tower: 359 meters


      Since 359 meters is less than 443 meters, the Bank of America Tower is shorter
      than the Empire State Building.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
