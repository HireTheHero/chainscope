      1. The Burj Khalifa is located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

      2. The Shanghai Tower is located in Shanghai, China.

      3. Both structures were completed around the same time: the Burj Khalifa in
      2010 and the Shanghai Tower in 2015.

      4. However, the Shanghai Tower was built on higher ground (Shanghai) compared
      to where the Burj Khalifa stands (Dubai).

      5. Generally, taller buildings can be found in cities that have more land available
      for construction.


      Given these points, we can conclude that the Shanghai Tower is likely to be
      taller than the Burj Khalifa due to its location advantage. Therefore, the answer

      Now, let''s compare these two heights:

      - Height of the Chrysler Building: 709 feet

      - Height of the Bank of America Tower: 538 feet


      Since 538 feet is less than 709 feet, it follows that the Bank of America Tower
      is indeed shorter than the Chrysler Building.


      Therefore, my answer is **YES**.'
