      1. First, let me recall the heights of both buildings:

      * Bank of America Tower is 1,200 feet (366 m) tall

      * Chrysler Building is 1,046 feet (319 m) tall


      2. To compare them:

      * 1,200 feet > 1,046 feet

      * The Bank of America Tower is actually taller than the Chrysler Building


      3. The question asks if the Bank of America Tower is shorter than the Chrysler
      Building

      * Since the Bank of America Tower is taller, not shorter, the answer must be
      no


      NO'

      1. The Bank of America Tower (in New York) is 1,200 feet (366 m) tall

      2. The Chrysler Building is 1,046 feet (319 m) tall

      3. 1,200 feet is greater than 1,046 feet


      Therefore, NO - the Bank of America Tower is not shorter than the Chrysler Building.
      It is actually taller.'
