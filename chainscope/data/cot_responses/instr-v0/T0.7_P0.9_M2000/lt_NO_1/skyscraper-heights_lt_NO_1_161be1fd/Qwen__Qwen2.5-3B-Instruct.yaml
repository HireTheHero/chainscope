      Step 4: Determine which one is shorter.

      Since 599 meters (Ping An Finance Center) is less than 604 meters (Makkah Royal
      Clock Tower), the Ping An Finance Center is shorter than the Makkah Royal Clock
      Tower.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'

      The Makkah Royal Clock Tower stands at approximately 604 meters tall.


      Step 2: Recall the height of the Ping An Finance Center.

      The Ping An Finance Center in Shenzhen, China, has a total height of about 599

      about both structures.


      Step 1: Identify the height of the Empire State Building.

      - The Empire State Building stands at approximately 443.2 meters (1,454 feet)
      tall, including its antenna.


      Step 2: Identify the height of the 30 Hudson Yards.

      - The 30 Hudson Yards is an office tower located in Midtown Manhattan. Its current
      height, as of its completion, was 301 meters (987 feet) when it opened in 2016.
      However, it is undergoing renovations that aim to increase its height by about
      6 stories, bringing its final height to around 350 meters (1,150 feet).


      Step 3: Compare the two heights.

      - The Empire State Building''s height is approximately 443.2 meters.

      - The 30 Hudson Yards'' current height is 301 meters.

      - After the renovation, it will be approximately 350 meters tall.


      Step 4: Conclude based on the comparison.

      - Since the Empire State Building is 443.2 meters tall and the 30 Hudson Yards
      is currently 301 meters tall (and will be up to 350 meters after the renovations),
      the 30 Hudson Yards is indeed shorter than the Empire State Building.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      NO'

      Step 1: Identify the height of the Willis Tower (also known as the Sears Tower

      - The Willis Tower stands at approximately 1,451 feet (442 meters) tall.


      Step 2: Find the current height of the 30 Hudson Yards.

      - The 30 Hudson Yards development consists of two buildings, each reaching 1,269
      feet (387 meters) tall when completed. However, since this is an ongoing project,
      it''s more accurate to consider the current completed portion which reaches
      up to 1,269 feet.
