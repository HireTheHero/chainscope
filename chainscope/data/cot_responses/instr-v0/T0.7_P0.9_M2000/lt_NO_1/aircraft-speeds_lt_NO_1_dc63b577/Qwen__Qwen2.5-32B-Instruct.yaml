      Step 1: Identify the maximum speed of the F-22 Raptor.

      The F-22 Raptor is known for its high-speed capabilities. Its maximum speed
      in supercruise (without afterburners) is approximately Mach 1.82. With afterburners
      engaged, it can reach speeds exceeding Mach 2.25.


      Step 2: Identify the maximum speed of the MiG-29.

      The MiG-29 has a maximum speed of around Mach 2.25 to Mach 2.35, depending on

      Step 3: Compare the maximum speeds.

      Given that both aircraft have similar top speeds when their afterburners are
      used, but the F-22 Raptor has an edge in supercruise capability, which means
      it can fly at supersonic speeds without using afterburners.


      Conclusion:

      Based on the comparison, the F-22 Raptor is not generally considered slower

      than the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, we need to compare their cruising speeds.


      Step 1: Identify the cruising speed of the Boeing 747-400.

      The Boeing 747-400 typically has a cruising speed of around 0.85 Mach (approximately
      567 mph or 912 km/h at typical cruise altitudes).


      Step 2: Identify the cruising speed of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

      The Boeing 787 Dreamliner cruises at approximately 0.85 Mach as well (around
      567 mph or 912 km/h), but newer models can reach slightly higher speeds under
      certain conditions, up to about 0.86 Mach (approximately 575 mph or 925 km/h).


      Step 3: Compare the two speeds.

      Given that both aircraft have similar cruising speeds, with the 787 potentially
      reaching slightly higher speeds, it is accurate to say that under general operating
      conditions, the cruising speeds are comparable. However, when considering maximum
      potential speeds, the Boeing 787 could be slightly faster.


      Answer: NO, the Boeing 747-400 is not necessarily slower than the Boeing 787

      Step 1: Identify the top speed of the F-14 Tomcat.

      The F-14 Tomcat has a maximum speed of approximately Mach 2.34 (around 1,544
      mph or 2,485 km/h) at altitude.


      Step 2: Identify the top speed of the F-22 Raptor.

      The F-22 Raptor has a maximum speed of "greater than Mach 2.0" (more than 1,320
      mph or 2,124 km/h) at altitude, but it can potentially reach higher speeds in
      certain conditions.


      Step 3: Compare the speeds.

      While both aircraft can exceed Mach 2, the F-14 Tomcat''s known top speed is
      higher than the stated minimum for the F-22 Raptor. However, the F-22 Raptor
      is a more modern design with advanced aerodynamics and engines, which suggests
      that under optimal conditions, it could potentially match or surpass the F-14''s
      speed.


      Conclusion:

      Based on the publicly available information, the F-14 Tomcat is not necessarily
      slower than the F-22 Raptor. The F-22 might be capable of reaching similar or
      slightly higher speeds, but the data does not clearly indicate that the F-22
      Raptor is definitively faster than the F-14 Tomcat under all circumstances.

      1. **F-14 Tomcat Speed**: The F-14 Tomcat has a maximum speed of about Mach
      2.34 (approximately 2,600 km/h or 1,615 mph) at altitude.


      2. **F-22 Raptor Speed**: The F-22 Raptor has a higher maximum speed capability.
      It can reach speeds in excess of Mach 2.25 (approximately 2,500 km/h or 1,550
      mph), but it is capable of sustaining higher speeds for shorter durations.


      Comparing these speeds:

      - The F-14 Tomcat reaches up to approximately 2,600 km/h.

      - The F-22 Raptor can reach slightly less than this but is generally known for
      its superior performance characteristics including agility and stealth, which
      are not directly related to top speed.


      However, given that the F-22 Raptor is considered one of the most advanced fighter
      jets, even though its sustained speed might be slightly lower, it likely has
      superior acceleration and can potentially achieve higher speeds in certain conditions.


      Based on the information available, we can conclude that the F-14 Tomcat is

      While both aircraft can exceed Mach 2, the F-14 Tomcat''s top speed is slightly
      higher than that of the F-22 Raptor when using afterburners. However, the F-22
