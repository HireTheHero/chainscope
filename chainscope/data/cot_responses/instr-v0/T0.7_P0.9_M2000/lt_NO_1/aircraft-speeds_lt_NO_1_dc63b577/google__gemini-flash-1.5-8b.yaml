      jet.

      2. The P-51 Mustang is a World War II fighter aircraft.

      3. Passenger jets are designed for carrying many passengers, and thus are much
      larger and heavier than fighter aircraft.

      4.  Heavier aircraft generally need more power to achieve the same speed, and
      thus are typically slower than lighter aircraft.

      5.  Therefore, an Airbus A320 is likely slower than a P-51 Mustang.
