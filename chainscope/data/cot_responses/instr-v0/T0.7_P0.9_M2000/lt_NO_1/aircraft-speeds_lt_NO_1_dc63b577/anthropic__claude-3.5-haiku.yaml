      1. First, let''s look at the cruise speeds of these aircraft:

      - Boeing 787 Dreamliner typically cruises at around 907 km/h (564 mph)

      - Boeing 737-800 typically cruises at around 871 km/h (541 mph)


      2. Comparing these speeds, we can see that the 787 Dreamliner is actually faster
      than the 737-800.


      3. The 787 is a larger, more advanced wide-body aircraft designed for longer
      international routes, while the 737-800 is a narrow-body aircraft primarily
      used for shorter and medium-range flights.


      4. The higher cruise speed of the 787 is due to its more advanced aerodynamic
      design and more powerful engines.


      5. Therefore, the 787 Dreamliner is NOT slower than the 737-800.
