      2. **Boeing 787 Dreamliner Specifications**: The Boeing 787-9, one of the variants
      of the Dreamliner, has a maximum cruise speed of about Mach 0.85 as well, which
      is similar to the 747-400. However, the 787-8 has a slightly higher cruise speed,
      around Mach 0.85 to 0.90, translating to about 560-590 mph (900-950 km/h) depending

      3. **Comparison**: Since both aircraft have similar maximum cruise speeds and
      the 787 can sometimes operate at slightly higher speeds depending on the variant,
      the comparison shows that the 747-400 is not necessarily slower than the 787
      Dreamliner.

    e4fcd882-6e36-4be6-9558-6be0eeef61c1: 'To determine if the Airbus A320 is slower
      than the P-51 Mustang, we need to look at the maximum speeds of both aircraft.


      1. **Airbus A320**: The typical cruising speed of an Airbus A320 is about 450-500
      knots (approximately 518-575 mph or 833-925 km/h).


      2. **P-51 Mustang**: The maximum speed of a P-51 Mustang is around 440 knots
      (approximately 507 mph or 815 km/h).


      Now, comparing the two:


      - The A320 has a cruising speed that generally exceeds the maximum speed of
      the P-51 Mustang.


      Thus, the conclusion is that the Airbus A320 is not slower than the P-51 Mustang.


      Final answer: **NO**.'
    e505a88d-ef7a-4cd7-ae24-ec84c8617f35: 'To determine if the Airbus A320 is slower
      than the P-51 Mustang, we need to consider the maximum speeds of both aircraft.


      1. **P-51 Mustang**: The P-51 Mustang, a World War II fighter aircraft, has
      a maximum speed of approximately 440 miles per hour (mph) or about 710 kilometers
      per hour (km/h).


      2. **Airbus A320**: The Airbus A320, a modern commercial jet airliner, has a
      cruising speed of around 500 to 550 mph (approximately 800 to 885 km/h), depending
      on the specific model and conditions.


      Now, comparing the two speeds:


      - The P-51 Mustang has a maximum speed of about 440 mph.

      - The Airbus A320 has a cruising speed ranging from about 500 to 550 mph.


      Given this comparison, the Airbus A320 is indeed faster than the P-51 Mustang.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Airbus A320 slower than P-51 Mustang?"
      is **NO**.'
    e6c03ec8-e45c-42f7-8bdf-47e29a0b9c38: 'To determine whether the Airbus A320 is
      slower than the P-51 Mustang, we need to compare their maximum speeds.


      1. **Speed of the Airbus A320**: The Airbus A320 has a maximum cruising speed
      of approximately 828 kilometers per hour (515 miles per hour).


      2. **Speed of the P-51 Mustang**: The P-51 Mustang, a World War II fighter aircraft,
      has a maximum speed of about 703 kilometers per hour (436 miles per hour).


      Now, comparing the two speeds:

      - The A320: ~828 km/h

      - The P-51: ~703 km/h


      Since 828 km/h (A320) is greater than 703 km/h (P-51), the A320 is not slower
      than the P-51 Mustang.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.'
