      mph) in short bursts.


      2. **Speed of a Hippopotamus**: Hippos are also large animals, but they are
      much faster runners compared to elephants. While they move slowly in water,
      on land, hippos can run at speeds of up to 30 km/h (19 mph).

      elephants can run at speeds up to 24 km/h, it is clear that a hippo can run

      speeds, we need to consider their typical movements and the context in which
      they might run. In general, hippos are more aquatic animals and spend much of
      their time in water, whereas elephants are primarily land-based.

      need to be in a situation where it is running and the hippo is standing still,
      or if the hippo were to start running and the elephant was already at its top

      1. **Speed of Ostriches**: Ostriches are known to be one of the fastest land
      animals, capable of running at speeds up to about 43 miles per hour (70 kilometers
      per hour).


      2. **Speed of Kangaroos**: Kangaroos are also quite fast runners, especially
      when using their powerful hind legs. The top speed of a kangaroo can reach around
      31 miles per hour (50 kilometers per hour).


      3. **Comparison of Speeds**: Comparing the maximum speeds, we see that an ostrich
      can run faster than a kangaroo.


      Given these facts, the answer to the question "Can an ostrich run slower than
      a kangaroo?" is:


      **NO**'

      1. **Speed of Ostriches**: Ostriches can run at speeds up to about 43 miles
      per hour (70 kilometers per hour). They are known for their incredible speed
      and endurance over long distances.


      2. **Speed of Kangaroos**: Kangaroos can also run very fast, but their top speed
      is generally around 15 to 18 miles per hour (24 to 29 kilometers per hour).
      While kangaroos are incredibly agile and can jump high, their running speed
      is much lower compared to ostriches.


      3. **Comparing the Speeds**: Given that ostriches can run at speeds up to 43
      mph, while kangaroos max out at around 18 mph, it is clear that an ostrich can
      indeed run faster than a kangaroo.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Can an ostrich run slower than a kangaroo?"
      is:


      **NO**'

      1. **Speed of Ostrich**: Ostriches are known to be very fast runners. They can
      reach speeds of up to 43 miles per hour (70 kilometers per hour) over short
      distances.


      2. **Speed of Kangaroo**: Kangaroos are also known for their impressive running
      capabilities. They can run at speeds of up to 31 miles per hour (50 kilometers
      per hour) over long distances.


      3. **Comparing Speeds**: When comparing the top speeds of these two animals,
      we see that an ostrich can run faster than a kangaroo.


      Given these points, the answer to the question "Can an ostrich run slower than
      a kangaroo?" is:

      2. **Kangaroo Speed**: Kangaroos are also quite fast runners, especially when
      they are bounding. They can reach speeds of around 35-40 miles per hour (56-64
      kilometers per hour).


      3. **Comparison**: Given the speeds mentioned above, an ostrich is capable of
      running faster than a kangaroo.


      Therefore, based on the known maximum speeds of these two animals, a typical
      ostrich cannot run slower than a typical kangaroo.
