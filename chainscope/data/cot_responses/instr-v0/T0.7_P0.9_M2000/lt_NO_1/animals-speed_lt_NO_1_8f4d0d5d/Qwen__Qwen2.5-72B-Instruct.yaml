      Given these facts:

      - The maximum speed of a cheetah is higher than that of a lion.

      - However, the question asks if a cheetah can run **slower** than a lion.


      Since both animals can vary their speeds, it is entirely possible for a cheetah
      to run at a speed slower than a lion, especially if the cheetah is not running
      at its top speed.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      \ the top running speed of a gorilla:**\n   - Gorillas are not known for their\
      \ speed. They typically walk on all fours (knuckle-walking) and can run short\
      \ distances on two legs. The average running speed of a gorilla is around 20-25\
      \ miles per hour (32-40 kilometers per hour).\n\n2. **Determine the top running\
      \ speed of a hippopotamus:**\n   - Hippos are surprisingly fast for their size.\
      \ Despite their bulky appearance, they can run at speeds up to 19-30 miles per\
      \ hour (30-48 kilometers per hour) on land.\n\n3. **Compare the speeds:**\n\

    a831daed-feed-45f7-a0c6-b740f3684de3: 'To determine if a lion can run slower than
      a tiger, we need to compare their maximum running speeds.


      1. **Lion''s Running Speed**: Lions are known for their speed and agility in
      short bursts. The average maximum running speed of a lion is about 50-60 miles
      per hour (80-97 kilometers per hour).


      2. **Tiger''s Running Speed**: Tigers are also fast runners, but they have slightly
      different physical characteristics and hunting styles. The average maximum running
      speed of a tiger is about 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour).


      3. **Comparison**: Comparing the two, lions generally have a higher maximum
      running speed than tigers.


      Given this information, a lion can indeed run faster than a tiger on average.
      Therefore, it is not possible for a lion to run slower than a tiger under normal
      conditions.

      \ the running speed of an elephant:**\n   - Elephants are generally known for\
      \ their slow movement. However, when they do run, they can reach speeds of about\
      \ 25 to 30 kilometers per hour (15 to 18 miles per hour).\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ the running speed of a hippopotamus:**\n   - Hippos are surprisingly fast\

      \   - The maximum running speed of a hippopotamus is approximately 30 kilometers\

      slower than a kangaroo, let''s break down the information we need:


      1. **Ostrich Running Speed**: Ostriches are known for their speed. They can
      run at speeds of up to 43 miles per hour (70 kilometers per hour).


      2. **Kangaroo Running Speed**: Kangaroos are not as fast as ostriches in terms
      of running speed. They can hop at speeds of up to about 35 miles per hour (56
      kilometers per hour).


      Given these speeds:

      - Ostrich: Up to 43 mph (70 km/h)

      - Kangaroo: Up to 35 mph (56 km/h)


      Since the maximum speed of an ostrich is higher than that of a kangaroo, an
      ostrich cannot run slower than a kangaroo when both are at their maximum speeds.


      However, the question asks if an ostrich can run slower than a kangaroo, which
      implies considering any possible speed, not just the maximum. An ostrich can
      certainly choose to run at a speed slower than its maximum, and it is entirely
      possible for an ostrich to run at a speed slower than the maximum speed of a
      kangaroo.

    b89f064c-4876-497c-961e-c8234e25b37f: 'To determine if an ostrich can run slower
      than a kangaroo, let''s consider the running speeds of both animals:


      1. **Ostrich Speed**: Ostriches are known for their speed and agility on land.
      They can run at speeds up to 43 miles per hour (70 kilometers per hour) and
      can maintain a steady speed of about 30 miles per hour (48 kilometers per hour).


      2. **Kangaroo Speed**: Kangaroos are not as fast runners as ostriches. They
      primarily use hopping as their mode of locomotion. The top speed for a kangaroo
      is around 35 miles per hour (56 kilometers per hour), but they typically hop
      at a much slower pace, around 15-20 miles per hour (24-32 kilometers per hour).


      Given these speeds:

      - Ostrich: 30-43 miles per hour (48-70 kilometers per hour)

      - Kangaroo: 15-35 miles per hour (24-56 kilometers per hour)


      An ostrich can indeed run faster than a kangaroo, but the question asks if an
      ostrich can run **slower** than a kangaroo. Since the minimum speed of an ostrich
      (30 miles per hour) is still higher than the typical hopping speed of a kangaroo
      (15-20 miles per hour), it is possible for an ostrich to run at a speed that
      is slower than the maximum speed of a kangaroo.


      However, in typical scenarios, ostriches generally run faster than kangaroos.
      But if we consider the lower end of their speed ranges, an ostrich could theoretically
      run at a speed that is slower than a kangaroo''s top speed.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      **YES**'
