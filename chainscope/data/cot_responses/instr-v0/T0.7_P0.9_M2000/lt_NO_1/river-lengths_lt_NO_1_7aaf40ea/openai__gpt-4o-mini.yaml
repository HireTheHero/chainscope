      1. The Yangtze River is the longest river in Asia, and its length is approximately
      6,300 kilometers (3,917 miles).

      2. The Mississippi River, which is one of the longest rivers in North America,
      has a length of about 3,734 kilometers (2,320 miles) when measured from its
      source to the Gulf of Mexico.


      Now, comparing these lengths:

      - Yangtze River: ~6,300 km

      - Mississippi River: ~3,734 km


      Since 6,300 km is greater than 3,734 km, the Yangtze River is longer than the
