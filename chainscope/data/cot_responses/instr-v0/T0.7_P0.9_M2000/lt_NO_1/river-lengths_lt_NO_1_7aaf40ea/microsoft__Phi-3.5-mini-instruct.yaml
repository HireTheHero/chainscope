      2. Determine the length of the River Rhine.

      3. Compare the lengths of both rivers.


      Step 1: The Colorado River is approximately 1,450 miles (2,330 kilometers) long.


      Step 2: The River Rhine is approximately 768 miles (1,238 kilometers) long.


      Step 3: Comparing the lengths, the Colorado River is approximately 682 miles
      (1,098 kilometers) longer than the River Rhine.


      Based on this information, the answer is NO, the Colorado River is not shorter
      than the River Rhine.'
