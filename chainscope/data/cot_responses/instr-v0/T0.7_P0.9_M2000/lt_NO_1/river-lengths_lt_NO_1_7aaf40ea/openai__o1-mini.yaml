      **Step 1: Determine the length of the River Ganges.**

      - The River Ganges, also known as the Ganga, is approximately **2,525 kilometers
      (1,569 miles)** long. It flows through India and Bangladesh.


      **Step 2: Determine the length of the Colorado River.**

      - The Colorado River is about **3,700 kilometers (2,330 miles)** long. It flows
      through the United States, primarily through Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada,
      and California.


      **Step 3: Compare the two lengths.**

      - **2,525 km (Ganges)** vs. **3,700 km (Colorado)**


      **Conclusion:**

      - The River Ganges is **shorter** than the Colorado River.
