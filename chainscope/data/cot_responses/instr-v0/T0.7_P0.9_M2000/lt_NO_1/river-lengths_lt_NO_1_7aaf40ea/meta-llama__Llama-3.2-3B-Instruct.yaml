      Step 2: Recall the length of the Amazon River. The Amazon River is approximately
      6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two rivers. Since 6,695 kilometers is greater
      than 6,400 kilometers, the River Nile is longer than the Amazon River.


      Step 4: Answer the question. Since the River Nile is longer, it is not shorter
      than the Amazon River.


      Answer: NO'

      1. I''ll need to know the lengths of both rivers to compare them. The length
      of a river can be measured in kilometers or miles. I''ll look up the lengths
      of the River Nile and the Amazon River.

      2. After finding the lengths, I''ll compare them. The River Nile is approximately
      6,695 kilometers (4,160 miles) long. The Amazon River is approximately 6,400
      kilometers (3,977 miles) long.

      3. Since the River Nile is approximately 6,695 kilometers long, and the Amazon

      1. I need to know the lengths of both the River Nile and the Amazon River.

      2. According to various sources, the length of the River Nile is approximately
      6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles).

      3. The length of the Amazon River is approximately 6,800 kilometers (4,230 miles).

      4. Now, I compare the lengths: 6,650 km (Nile) vs 6,800 km (Amazon).

      5. Since 6,800 km is greater than 6,650 km, I can conclude that the Amazon River
      is longer than the Nile River.
