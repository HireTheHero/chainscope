      the necessary information about the lengths of the Yangtze River and the Mississippi
      River.


      1. **Identify the length of the Yangtze River**: The Yangtze River is approximately
      6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles) long, making it the longest river in Asia and
      one of the longest in the world.


      2. **Identify the length of the Mississippi River**: The Mississippi River is
      approximately 3,730 kilometers (2,320 miles) long. It is one of the longest
      rivers in North America.


      3. **Compare the lengths**: To determine if the Yangtze River is shorter than
      the Mississippi River, we compare their lengths. The Yangtze River, at 6,300
      kilometers, is longer than the Mississippi River, which is 3,730 kilometers
      long.


      Based on the comparison, the Yangtze River is not shorter than the Mississippi
      River; it is actually longer.

      Given these lengths, we can compare them directly:


      - The River Nile is approximately 6,695 kilometers long.

      - The Amazon River is approximately 6,400 kilometers long.


      Since 6,695 kilometers (the length of the Nile) is greater than 6,400 kilometers
