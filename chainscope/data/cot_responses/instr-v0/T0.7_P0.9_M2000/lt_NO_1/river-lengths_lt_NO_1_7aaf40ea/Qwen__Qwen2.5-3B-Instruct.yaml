      ### Step 1: Determine the Length of the River Seine

      - The River Seine flows through Paris, France.

      - Its total length from its source in the Vexin Forest to its estuary at Le
      Grau-du-Roi on the Normandy coast is approximately 776 kilometers (482 miles).


      ### Step 2: Determine the Length of the River Thames

      - The River Thames is located in England, United Kingdom.

      - It starts near the village of Kemble in Gloucestershire and ends in the North
      Sea near the town of Teddington.

      - Its total length is about 346 kilometers (215 miles).


      ### Step 3: Compare the Lengths

      - The River Seine is approximately 776 kilometers long.

      - The River Thames is approximately 346 kilometers long.


      ### Conclusion:

      Since 346 kilometers is less than 776 kilometers, the River Thames is shorter
      than the River Seine.

      Step 3: Determine if the Rhine being longer means it''s also shorter than the
      Seine.

      - If the Rhine is longer than the Seine, it cannot be shorter than the Seine
      at the same time.


      Conclusion:

      No, the River Rhine is not shorter than the River Seine; in fact, it is much
      longer than the River Seine.

      than the Amazon River, we need to consider two key pieces of information: the
      length of each river.


      1. **Length of the River Nile**: The longest river in Africa, the River Nile
      has a total length of approximately 6,650 kilometers (4,132 miles).


      2. **Length of the Amazon River**: The longest river in South America, the Amazon
      River has a total length of approximately 6,400 kilometers (3,980 miles).


      Now that we have these lengths, we can compare them:

      - The River Nile is 6,650 km long.

      - The Amazon River is 6,400 km long.


      Since 6,400 km is less than 6,650 km, the Amazon River is shorter than the River
