    89b8de53-71b4-4e9d-bab9-fa0114664f7f: 'To determine if the River Nile is shorter
      than the Amazon River, we need to compare their lengths:


      1. **Length of the Nile River**: The Nile is generally considered to be about
      6,650 km (4,132 miles) long.

      2. **Length of the Amazon River**: The length of the Amazon has been a subject
      of some debate, but recent measurements suggest it is approximately 6,400 km
      (3,977 miles) long.


      Given these lengths:

      - Nile: 6,650 km

      - Amazon: 6,400 km


      The Nile River is longer than the Amazon River.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**.'
