      than the River Ganges, we need to compare their lengths.


      1. **Length of the River Danube**: The length of the River Danube varies depending
      on which section you''re measuring. However, it generally ranges from 2,860
      km (1,779 miles) in Germany to about 2,853 km (1,774 miles) at its mouth in
      the Black Sea. For simplicity, let''s use an average length of approximately
      2,850 km.


      2. **Length of the River Ganges**: The Ganges has an estimated total length
      of around 2,525 kilometers (1,570 miles).


      Now, comparing these two lengths:

      - Length of the River Danube: 2,850 km

      - Length of the River Ganges: 2,525 km


      Since 2,850 km is greater than 2,525 km, the River Danube is longer than the
      River Ganges.

      than the Amazon River, we need to compare their lengths.


      1. **River Nile Length**: The River Nile is one of the longest rivers in the
      world, approximately 6,650 kilometers (4,132 miles) long.

      2. **Amazon River Length**: The Amazon River is even longer, spanning about
      6,400 kilometers (3,979 miles) from its source in Peru to the Atlantic Ocean.


      By comparing these two lengths:

      - The River Nile measures 6,650 km.

      - The Amazon River measures 6,400 km.


      Since 6,650 km is greater than 6,400 km, the River Nile is not shorter than
      the Amazon River; instead, it is longer.
