      To determine if the River Seine is shorter than the River Thames, let''s consider

      Swiss border, and flows through Paris, France. The River Thames, on the other
      hand, originates in the Cotswolds, in the south of England, and flows through
      London, England.

      3. **Flowing through cities**: The River Seine flows through several major cities
      in France, including Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. The River Thames, while also
      flowing through cities in England, is largely confined to the urban areas of
      London and the surrounding Thames Valley.


      4. **Elevation**: The River Seine has a relatively gentle slope, with an average
      elevation of about 10 meters (33 feet) above sea level. The River Thames, while
      also relatively low-lying, has a steeper slope, with an average elevation of
