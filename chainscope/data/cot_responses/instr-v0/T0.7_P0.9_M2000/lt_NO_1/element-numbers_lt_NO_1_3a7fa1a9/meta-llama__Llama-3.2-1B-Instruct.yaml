      Let''s break it down step by step:


      1. Chlorine (Cl) is an element with atomic number 17.

      2. Sulfur (S) is an element with atomic number 16.

      3. Chlorine is a halogen, while sulfur is a nonmetal.

      4. Halogens have an atomic number lower than nonmetals.


      Now, to answer the question: YES, chlorine has a lower atomic number than sulfur.'

      number than sulfur, I will follow the steps:


      1. Identify the atomic numbers of chlorine (17) and sulfur (16).

      2. Compare the atomic numbers. Since chlorine has a lower atomic number than
      sulfur, this is the first step of reasoning.

      3. Since the atomic number is the most basic property of an element, this is
      the final step of reasoning.

      YES'

      atom. Chlorine has an atomic number of 17, while sulfur has an atomic number
      of 16.


      Now, we can compare the atomic numbers:


      Chlorine (17) > Sulfur (16)

      of protons in the nucleus of an atom.

      4. Chlorine has 17 protons in its nucleus, while sulfur has 16 protons.
