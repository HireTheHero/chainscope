      of an atom of that element.

      Chlorine (Cl) has an atomic number of 17.


      Step 2: Determine the atomic number of sulfur.

      Sulfur (S) has an atomic number of 16.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers of chlorine and sulfur.

      Since chlorine has an atomic number of 17, and sulfur has an atomic number of
      16, chlorine has a higher atomic number than sulfur.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO, chlorine does not have a lower atomic number than sulfur.'

      these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the atomic numbers of chlorine and sulfur.

      The atomic number represents the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom.


      Chlorine (Cl) has an atomic number of 17.

      Sulfur (S) has an atomic number of 16.


      Step 2: Compare the atomic numbers of chlorine and sulfur.

      A higher atomic number means more protons in the nucleus, and a lower atomic
      number means fewer protons.


      Since chlorine has an atomic number of 17 and sulfur has an atomic number of
      16, chlorine has a higher atomic number than sulfur.


      Step 3: Provide the YES or NO answer based on the comparison.

      The question is: "Does chlorine have a lower atomic number than sulfur?"


      Since chlorine has a higher atomic number than sulfur, the answer is NO.'
