      3. Understand the relationship between atomic numbers and groups: Elements in

      nuclei together.

      4. Compare the atomic numbers: The atomic number of Carbon is 6, while that

      To arrive at this conclusion, let''s consider the periodic table, which organizes
      elements in order of increasing atomic number (from 1 to approximately 118).
      Oxygen has an atomic number of 8, while nitrogen has an atomic number of 7.

      To explain the reasoning:

      1. Oxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8.

      2. Nitrogen (N) has an atomic number of 7.

      3. Atomic numbers represent the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom,
      which determines its chemical identity.

      4. Since oxygen has more protons (8 vs. 7) than nitrogen does, it occupies a
      higher position in the periodic table.

      5. In the periodic table, elements with higher atomic numbers tend to be further
      left from hydrogen on the horizontal row (period), as they form longer bonds
      and typically exhibit stronger chemical properties compared to those with lower
