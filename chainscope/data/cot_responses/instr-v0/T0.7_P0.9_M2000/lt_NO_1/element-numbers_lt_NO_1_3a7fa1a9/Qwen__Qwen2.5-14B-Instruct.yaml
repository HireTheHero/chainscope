      - The atomic number of silicon (Si) is 14.


      Step 2: Recall the atomic number of aluminum.

      - The atomic number of aluminum (Al) is 13.


      Step 3: Compare the two atomic numbers.

      - Silicon has an atomic number of 14, while aluminum has an atomic number of
      13.


      Therefore, silicon does not have a lower atomic number than aluminum; it actually
      has a higher atomic number.
