      Step 2: Recall atomic numbers of elements

      To answer this question, we need to recall the atomic numbers of both magnesium
      and sodium. The atomic number of an element represents the number of protons
      in the nucleus of an atom of that element.


      Step 3: Look up atomic numbers

      - Magnesium (Mg) has an atomic number of 12.

      - Sodium (Na) has an atomic number of 11.
