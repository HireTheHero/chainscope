      3. Chlorine (Cl) and sulfur (S) are both in period 3 of the periodic table.


      4. In period 3, the elements from left to right are: sodium (Na), magnesium
      (Mg), aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and chlorine
      (Cl).


      5. Since sulfur (S) comes before chlorine (Cl) in the periodic table, sulfur
      has a lower atomic number than chlorine.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Does chlorine have a lower atomic number
      than sulfur?" is:


      NO'

      \ atomic number than sulfur, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Recall the definition\
      \ of atomic number:\n   The atomic number of an element is the number of protons\
      \ in its nucleus.\n\n2. Locate chlorine and sulfur on the periodic table:\n\
      \   Chlorine (Cl) is located in group 17 (halogens), period 3.\n   Sulfur (S)\
      \ is located in group 16 (chalcogens), period 3.\n\n3. Compare their positions\
      \ on the periodic table:\n   Chlorine and sulfur are in the same period (row),\

      \ atomic number on the periodic table:\n   In a period, the atomic number increases\
