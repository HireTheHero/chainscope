    f45bb583-cd0b-4a06-aed2-6ad3d7d6bfba: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Atomic number definition:** The atomic number of an element represents
      the number of protons in its nucleus.

      2. **Hydrogen''s atomic number:** Hydrogen is the simplest element with an atomic
      number of 1 (one proton).

      3. **Helium''s atomic number:** Helium has two protons in its nucleus, giving
      it an atomic number of 2.


      4. **Comparison:** 1 (hydrogen) is less than 2 (helium).



      **Answer:** NO
