      atomic number than carbon, we need to follow these steps:


      1. Identify the atomic number of nitrogen.

      2. Identify the atomic number of carbon.

      3. Compare the two atomic numbers.


      **Step 1: Identify the atomic number of nitrogen.**

      - Nitrogen (N) has an atomic number of 7.


      **Step 2: Identify the atomic number of carbon.**

      - Carbon (C) has an atomic number of 6.


      **Step 3: Compare the two atomic numbers.**

      - Nitrogen''s atomic number (7) is greater than carbon''s atomic number (6).


      Therefore, nitrogen does not have a lower atomic number than carbon.

      \ **Identify the atomic number of chlorine:**\n   - Chlorine (Cl) has an atomic\
      \ number of 17.\n\n2. **Identify the atomic number of sulfur:**\n   - Sulfur\
      \ (S) has an atomic number of 16.\n\n3. **Compare the atomic numbers:**\n  \
      \ - Chlorine's atomic number (17) is greater than sulfur's atomic number (16).\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is **NO**. Chlorine does not have a lower atomic number\
