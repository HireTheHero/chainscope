      slower than the AVE Class 103, we need to compare their maximum speeds and consider
      the context in which they typically operate.


      ### Step 1: Maximum Speeds

      - **Eurostar e320**: The Eurostar e320 has a maximum operating speed of 320
      km/h (200 mph).

      - **AVE Class 103**: The AVE Class 103 has a maximum operating speed of 310
      km/h (193 mph).


      ### Step 2: Operating Conditions

      - **Eurostar e320**: Operates on high-speed lines between London, Paris, and
      Brussels. It is designed to run at its maximum speed on these routes.

      - **AVE Class 103**: Operates on Spain''s high-speed rail network, which includes
      various routes with different speed limits.


      ### Step 3: Comparing Speeds

      - The Eurostar e320 has a higher maximum speed (320 km/h) compared to the AVE
      Class 103 (310 km/h).


      ### Step 4: Can the Eurostar e320 Travel Slower?

      - While the Eurostar e320 is capable of traveling faster, it can also travel

      1. **TGV Duplex:**\n   - The TGV Duplex is a high-speed train operated by SNCF\
      \ in France.\n   - Its maximum operating speed is typically 320 km/h (200 mph).\n\
      \n2. **AVE Class 103:**\n   - The AVE Class 103 is a high-speed train operated\
      \ by Renfe in Spain.\n   - Its maximum operating speed is 310 km/h (193 mph).\n\
      \nNow, let's compare these speeds:\n- TGV Duplex: 320 km/h\n- AVE Class 103:\
      \ 310 km/h\n\nSince the TGV Duplex has a higher maximum operating speed (320\
      \ km/h) compared to the AVE Class 103 (310 km/h), the TGV Duplex can indeed\
      \ travel faster.\n\nHowever, the question asks if the TGV Duplex can travel\
      \ **slower** than the AVE Class 103. Since the TGV Duplex can operate at any\
      \ speed below its maximum, it can certainly travel at speeds slower than 310\
      \ km/h.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**"
