      \ **What is a TGV Duplex?** It's a high-speed train in France.\n2. **What is\
      \ an AVE Class 103?** It's another high-speed train, also in Europe, but in\
      \ Spain.\n3. **What do we need to compare?** We need to compare their speeds.\n\
      4. **Can we assume both trains are designed for high-speed travel?** Yes, high-speed\
      \ trains are built to be fast. \n5. **Does speed vary between trains?** Yes,\
      \ train speeds can vary depending on the route and other factors. \n\n**Therefore,\
