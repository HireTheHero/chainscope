    c28243a3-43be-47a8-ac54-85ecf2753b3c: 'To determine whether the TRS-80 was released
      before the VHS Player, we need to look at the release dates of both products.


      1. **TRS-80 Release Date**: The TRS-80, also known as the Tandy/Radio Shack
      Z-80, was introduced in 1977. It was one of the earliest personal computers
      available to consumers.


      2. **VHS Player Release Date**: The VHS (Video Home System) format was introduced
      by JVC (Victor Company of Japan) in September 1976. However, it''s important
      to note that the first VHS players were not widely available to the general
      public until 1977.


      Given these dates:

      - The TRS-80 was released in 1977.

      - The VHS format was introduced in 1976, but the first VHS players became widely
      available in 1977.


      Since the VHS format was introduced in 1976, even though the first VHS players
      became widely available in 1977, the VHS format itself predates the TRS-80.
