      Step 1: Find the release date for the TRS-80.

      The TRS-80 (short for "Tandon Radio Shack") was introduced in 1977. It was one
      of the first mass-produced microcomputers.

      the VHS format became widely available.


      Given these facts:

      - The TRS-80 was released in September 1977.

      - VCRs (which use VHS tapes) were not widely available until 1977.


      While the TRS-80 was indeed released in 1977, VCRs using VHS technology did
      not become popular until later in the same year. Therefore, the VHS format and

      before the VHS Player, I need to follow these steps:


      1. Identify the release date of the Apple II.

      2. Identify the release date of the VHS Player.

      3. Compare the release dates to see which came first.


      Step 1: The Apple II was introduced in 1977. It was an early personal computer
      that helped popularize the home computing market.


      Step 2: The VHS (Video Home System) was introduced in Japan in 1976, and it
      became widely available in the United States in 1977. It was developed by Victor
      Company of Japan (JVC).


      Step 3: Comparing the two dates:

      - Apple II: 1977

      - VHS Player: 1976


      Since 1976 comes before 1977, the VHS Player was released before the Apple II.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Was the Apple II released before the
      VHS Player?" is:


      NO'
