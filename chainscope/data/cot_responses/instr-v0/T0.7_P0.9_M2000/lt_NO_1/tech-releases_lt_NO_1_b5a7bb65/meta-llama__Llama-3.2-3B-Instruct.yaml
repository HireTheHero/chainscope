      between 1969 and 1973.

      2. The Polaroid SX-70 was a instant camera released in 1972.

      3. Since the Xerox Alto was developed before 1972, and the Polaroid SX-70 was
      released in 1972, it is likely that the Xerox Alto was released before the Polaroid
      SX-70.


      Answer: YES'
