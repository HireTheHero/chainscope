      1. **VHS Player**: The VHS (Video Home System) player was first commercially
      available in 1976. This was developed by Japanese companies including Sony,
      Matsushita (Panasonic), and others.


      2. **Xerox Alto**: The Xerox Alto was a prototype personal computer developed
      at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) in 1973. It was not released to the
      public but rather served as a research prototype.


      Given these facts:


      - The VHS Player was first available for commercial use in 1976.

      - The Xerox Alto was developed and used as a prototype in 1973 but was never
      released to the general public.


      Since the VHS Player was released in 1976 and the Xerox Alto was developed in
      1973, the VHS Player was indeed released after the Xerox Alto.
