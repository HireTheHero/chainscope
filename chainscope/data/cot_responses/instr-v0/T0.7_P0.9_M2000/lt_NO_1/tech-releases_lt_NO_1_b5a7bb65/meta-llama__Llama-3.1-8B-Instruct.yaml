      24, 1995.

      2. **Sony PlayStation Release Date**: Sony released the PlayStation on December
      3, 1994, in Japan, and in North America on September 9, 1995.

      3. **Comparing Release Dates**: Windows 95 was released in September 1995, while
      the PlayStation was released in December 1994 in Japan and September 1995 in

      release of the PlayStation (September 1995).


      However, considering the initial question might be asking about the global availability
      of both products, and considering that the PlayStation was already available
      in Japan before Windows 95, I''ll give a cautious interpretation:


      **YES** (acknowledging the global availability of the PlayStation in Japan before
      Windows 95, but noting that Windows 95 was released before the PlayStation in
      North America, where it was also widely available).'
