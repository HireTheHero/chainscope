      \ methanol, it requires less energy to vaporize, resulting in a lower boiling\
      \ point.\n\n\n**Therefore, the answer is NO.** \n"

      \ Boiling Point:** Boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid changes\
      \ to a gas. \n2. **Intermolecular Forces:** The boiling point of a substance\
      \ is influenced by the strength of its intermolecular forces (the attractions\
      \ between molecules).\n3. **Ethanol vs. Methanol:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and methanol\
      \ (CH3OH) both have hydrogen bonding, but ethanol has a larger molecular size\
      \ and has a weaker hydrogen bond.\n4. **Size and Strength:** Larger molecules\
      \ with weaker intermolecular forces tend to have lower boiling points.\n\n**Conclusion:**\
      \  Based on the above, ethanol has a lower boiling point than methanol. \n\n\

      \n1. **What are boiling points?** Boiling points are the temperatures at which\
      \ a liquid changes into a gas. \n2. **What factors affect boiling points?**\
      \  Boiling points are influenced by the strength of intermolecular forces between\
