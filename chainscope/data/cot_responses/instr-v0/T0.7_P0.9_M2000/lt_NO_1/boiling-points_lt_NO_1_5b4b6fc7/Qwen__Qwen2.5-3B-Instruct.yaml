      1. **Identify the Elements**: Oxygen (O) and Nitrogen (N) are both in Group
      16 (also known as Group VIA) of the periodic table.


      2. **Understand Periodic Trends**: Generally, as you move down a group from
      top to bottom, the boiling points of elements increase due to the increased
      atomic radius. This is because larger atoms have more space for electrons to
      occupy, making it easier for them to form van der Waals forces, which stabilize
      the molecule.


      3. **Compare Positions**: Both oxygen and nitrogen are in the second period

      \ boiling point than methanol, we need to consider the intermolecular forces\
      \ between their molecules.\n\n1. **Understanding Intermolecular Forces:**\n\
      \   - Ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH) and Methanol (CH\u2083OH) both belong to the\
      \ same family of compounds called alcohols.\n   - Alcohols have a hydroxyl group\

      \ can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of the hydroxyl group.\n   - However,\
      \ the strength of hydrogen bonding depends on the electronegativity difference\
      \ between the hydrogen atom in the hydroxyl group and the oxygen atom attached\
      \ to it.\n   - Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, but not as much\
      \ as in other molecules like water (H\u2082O), where it forms strong hydrogen\

      \   - This closer packing can lead to stronger attractive forces between the\
      \ molecules, resulting in a higher boiling point.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on\
      \ Molecular Size and Packing:**\n   - Because methanol molecules are larger\
      \ and less densely packed compared to ethanol molecules, the intermolecular\
