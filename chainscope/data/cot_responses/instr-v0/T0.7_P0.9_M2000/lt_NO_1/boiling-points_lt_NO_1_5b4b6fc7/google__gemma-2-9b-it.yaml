      \ the strength of intermolecular forces between molecules. Stronger forces require\

      \ Both are alcohols, meaning they have -OH groups capable of hydrogen bonding.\
      \  \n\n4. **Ethanol vs. Methanol:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) has a larger molecular\
      \ size and more electrons than methanol (CH3OH). This means ethanol experiences\
      \ slightly stronger London dispersion forces in addition to hydrogen bonding.\n\
      \n5. **Conclusion:** While both have hydrogen bonding, the stronger London dispersion\
      \ forces in ethanol result in a slightly higher boiling point compared to methanol.\n\
