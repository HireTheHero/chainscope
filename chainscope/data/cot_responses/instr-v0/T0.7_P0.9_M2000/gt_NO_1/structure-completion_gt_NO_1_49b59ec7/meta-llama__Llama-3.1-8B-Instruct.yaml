      1. The Great Wall of China was built in multiple stages, with the most famous
      and well-preserved sections being constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

      2. The Taj Mahal, on the other hand, was built during the Mughal Empire, which
      was a Muslim dynasty that ruled India from 1526 to 1756. The Taj Mahal was constructed
      between 1632 and 1653.

      3. Since the Ming Dynasty ended in 1644 and the Taj Mahal was built between
      1632 and 1653, the Great Wall of China was completed before the Taj Mahal.

      step:


      1. The Great Wall of China was primarily built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

      2. The Taj Mahal was built during the Mughal Empire, specifically between 1632
      and 1653.

      The Taj Mahal was completed after the Ming Dynasty ended, and the Great Wall
