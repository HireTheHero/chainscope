      by step:


      **Step 1: Determine the Completion Date of the Taj Mahal**

      - The Taj Mahal, an iconic mausoleum located in Agra, India, was commissioned
      by Emperor Shah Jahan.

      - Construction began in 1632 and was largely completed by 1653.


      **Step 2: Examine the Ming Dynasty''s Construction of the Great Wall of China**

      - The Great Wall of China has been built and rebuilt by various dynasties over
      centuries.

      - The Ming Dynasty ruled China from 1368 to 1644.

      - Significant construction, reinforcement, and expansion of the Great Wall occurred
      during the Ming Dynasty, with the majority of the current structure dating from
      this period.

      - While construction began during the Ming Dynasty, some sections were completed
      towards the end of the dynasty, around the early to mid-17th century.


      **Step 3: Compare the Completion Dates**

      - The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653.

      - The Ming Dynasty ended in 1644, and thus, the primary construction of the
      Great Wall under the Ming Dynasty was completed before the Taj Mahal.


      **Conclusion**

      No, the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty was not completed after
      the Taj Mahal.'
