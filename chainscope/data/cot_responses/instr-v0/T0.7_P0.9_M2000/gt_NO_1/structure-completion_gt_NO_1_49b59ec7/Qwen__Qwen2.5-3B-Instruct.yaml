      after the Golden Gate Bridge, I need to find the construction completion dates
      for both structures.


      Step 1: Research the completion date of the Hoover Dam.

      The Hoover Dam, also known as Boulder Dam before it was renamed in 1947, was
      completed in 1936.


      Step 2: Research the completion date of the Golden Gate Bridge.

      The Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates.

      The Hoover Dam was completed in 1936.

      The Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937.


      Since 1936 came before 1937, the Hoover Dam was indeed completed before the
      Golden Gate Bridge.

      1. **Hoover Dam**: The Hoover Dam, located on the Colorado River in Arizona
      and Nevada, began construction in 1931 and was officially completed on June
      1, 1936. This took about 4 years and 8 months from the start date.


      2. **Golden Gate Bridge**: The Golden Gate Bridge, connecting San Francisco
      and Marin County in California, started construction in January 1933 and was
      completed on April 19, 1937. This project took approximately 4 years and 3 months
      from the start date.


      By comparing these timelines:

      - Hoover Dam: 1931 - 1936

      - Golden Gate Bridge: 1933 - 1937


      Since the Hoover Dam''s completion date (June 1, 1936) is earlier than the Golden

      ### Step 1: Timeline for the Empire State Building


      The Empire State Building was constructed from January 1930 to May 1931. It
      was officially opened on April 14, 1931.


      ### Step 2: Timeline for the Panama Canal


      Construction of the Panama Canal began in 1881 but faced significant challenges
      and halted in 1890. After a five-year hiatus, construction resumed in 1904 and
      was completed in 1914.


      ### Step 3: Comparing Completion Dates


      - The Empire State Building was completed and open for business in 1931.

      - The Panama Canal was completed and officially opened in 1914.


      ### Conclusion


      Based on the above timeline analysis, we can see that the Panama Canal was completed
      and operational well before the Empire State Building was finished. Therefore,

      1. **Empire State Building**: Construction began in January 1930 and was completed

      2. **Panama Canal**: The construction of the Panama Canal began in 1904. It

      Given these facts:

      - The Empire State Building was completed 15 months after its construction began.

      - The Panama Canal was completed 10 years after its construction began.

      ### Eiffel Tower:

      1. The construction of the Eiffel Tower began in January 1887.

      2. It was officially inaugurated on March 31, 1889, marking the opening of the
      1889 World''s Fair (Exposition Universelle).

      3. The tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel and built primarily to serve as
      the entrance arch for the fair.


      ### Panama Canal:

      1. Construction of the Panama Canal began in 1881 under French management.

      2. The project faced significant challenges, including engineering difficulties
      and health issues, leading to delays.

      3. The canal was officially opened on August 15, 1914, after a long period of
      work.


      Now, comparing the dates:

      - The Eiffel Tower was completed and inaugurated in 1889.

      - The Panama Canal was opened in 1914.


      Given these facts, the Eiffel Tower was indeed completed before the Panama Canal
      was fully operational.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**.'

      after the Panama Canal, we need to find out when each structure was finished.


      Step 1: Determine when the Eiffel Tower was completed.

      - The Eiffel Tower was constructed between 1887 and 1889.

      - It was officially inaugurated on March 31, 1889.

      - Therefore, it was completed in 1889.


      Step 2: Determine when the Panama Canal was completed.

      - Construction began in 1904.

      - The canal officially opened on August 15, 1914.

      - Thus, the Panama Canal was completed in 1914.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates.

      - The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.

      - The Panama Canal was completed in 1914.


      Since 1889 is before 1914, the Eiffel Tower was indeed completed before the

      Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.


      Step 2: Determine the construction period of the Great Wall of China.

      - The Great Wall of China has a history spanning several centuries and various
      dynasties, but its primary construction phases were during the Qin Dynasty (221-206
      BCE) and the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE).

      - However, the most significant and extensive part of the wall that is often

      - The Taj Mahal was completed around 1653 CE.

      - The primary construction of the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty
      began around 1368 CE and continued through the 16th century, reaching its peak
      during the reigns of Emperors Yongle and Xuande (1403-1424).

      - The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653 CE.

      - The Ming Dynasty''s major construction of the Great Wall began around 1368
