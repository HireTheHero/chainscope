      Now, comparing the two dates:

      - The Suez Canal was completed in 1867.

      - The Statue of Liberty was completed in 1884.


      Since 1867 (completion of the Suez Canal) is before 1884 (completion of the
      Statue of Liberty), we can conclude that the Suez Canal was completed before
      the Statue of Liberty.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Was the Suez Canal completed after the
      Statue of Liberty?" is NO.'

      1. The Statue of Liberty was officially dedicated on October 28, 1886.

      2. The Suez Canal was officially opened on February 17, 1867.


      Now, comparing the two dates:

      - The Suez Canal was completed in 1867, which is before the Statue of Liberty
      was dedicated in 1886.
