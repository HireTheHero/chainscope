      Bridge.

      2. Compare these dates to determine which was completed later.


      **Step 1: Completion Dates**


      - **Hoover Dam**: Construction began in 1931, and the dam was dedicated on September
      30, 1935.

      - **Golden Gate Bridge**: Construction began in 1933, and the bridge opened

      Step 1: The Statue of Liberty was completed in France in 1884 and shipped to

      of Liberty was initially completed in France (although the dedication ceremony

      \ Wall during the Ming Dynasty began in 1368 AD and continued through the end\
      \ of the dynasty in 1644 AD. However, significant portions were completed by\
      \ around 1500 AD.\n\n2. **Determine the completion date of the Taj Mahal:**\n\
      \   - Construction of the Taj Mahal started around 1632 AD and was completed\
      \ in 1653 AD.\n\nGiven these dates:\n- The main sections of the Great Wall of\
      \ China during the Ming Dynasty were largely completed by around 1500 AD.\n\
      - The Taj Mahal was completed much later, in 1653 AD.\n\nBased on these dates,\
