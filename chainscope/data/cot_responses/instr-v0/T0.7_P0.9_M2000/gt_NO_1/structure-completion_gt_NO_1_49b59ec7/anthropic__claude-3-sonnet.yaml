      the completion dates of the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge.


      Step 1: Determine the completion date of the Hoover Dam.

      The Hoover Dam was completed in 1935.


      Step 2: Determine the completion date of the Golden Gate Bridge.

      The Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates.

      Since the Hoover Dam was completed in 1935, and the Golden Gate Bridge was completed
      in 1937, this means that the Hoover Dam was completed before the Golden Gate
      Bridge.


      Final answer: NO, the Hoover Dam was not completed after the Golden Gate Bridge.'

      renovations and extensions were made to the Great Wall of China, particularly
      under the reign of the Yongle Emperor (1403-1424).

      Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. It was opened in 1869.


      2) The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island
