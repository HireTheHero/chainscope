      completed after the Statue of Liberty, let''s break down the timeline of these
      two significant projects.


      1. **Statue of Liberty Completion**: The Statue of Liberty was dedicated on
      October 28, 1886.


      2. **Suez Canal Completion**: The Suez Canal was officially opened on November
      17, 1869.


      Given these dates:

      - The Statue of Liberty was completed in 1886.

      - The Suez Canal was completed in 1869.


      Since 1869 (the year the Suez Canal was completed) comes before 1886 (the year
      the Statue of Liberty was completed), the Suez Canal was indeed completed before
      the Statue of Liberty.


      **Answer: NO**'
