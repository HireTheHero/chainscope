    52ae9f97-ca54-465c-8407-827d54ad0346: NO. The Suez Canal was completed in 1869,
      while the Statue of Liberty was dedicated on October 28, 1886. These two events
      occurred at different times in history, making it impossible for one to have
      been completed after the other.
    63689ccc-8ada-437d-8640-8bc267bafe49: No, the Suez Canal was not completed after
      the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886, while the
      Suez Canal was opened in 1869.
    6423209d-b510-414b-9e9b-aa224b4dc1ca: 'To determine if the Statue of Liberty was
      completed before the Suez Canal, we need to consider several factors:


      1. **Construction Timeline**: The construction of the Statue of Liberty began
      in 1865 and was completed in 1886. This timeline shows that it was built well
      before any canal work.


      2. **Canal Construction Timeline**: The construction of the Suez Canal started
      in 1859 but took over 10 years to complete, with completion estimated around
      1869-1875.


      3. **Historical Context**: Given that both projects were significant engineering
      achievements at their respective times, it''s reasonable to assume they would
      have been constructed independently rather than concurrent.


      Considering these points, we can conclude that the Statue of Liberty was not
      completed after the Suez Canal.


      Therefore, my answer is: **NO**.'
    6a0c0d45-e0f8-4ec5-9a86-b69a54d5d9b3: No, the Suez Canal was not completed after
      the Statue of Liberty. The Suez Canal was constructed in 1869 and opened to
      traffic on October 1, 1869, while the Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening
      the World) was dedicated on September 4, 1886. These two historical landmarks
      were built at different times in history.
    85e40da9-7719-43bf-8e40-368abb2d9abd: No. The Suez Canal was completed in 1869
      before the construction of the Statue of Liberty began in 1875. The canal connects
      the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, while
      the statue stands at Bedloe's Island (formerly known as Liberty Island) in New
      York Harbor.

    da5960ba-1135-4460-b433-1506b8be5418: 'To determine whether the Statue of Liberty
      was completed before or after the completion of the Suez Canal, we need to consider
      when each landmark was constructed.


      1. **Statue of Liberty**: The statue was originally dedicated on October 28,
      1886. This date marks its official opening day in New York City.


      2. **Suez Canal**: The canal was officially opened on November 17, 1869.


      Comparing these dates:

      - The Statue of Liberty was completed in 1886.

      - The Suez Canal was completed in 1869.


      Since 1869 comes before 1886, it follows that the Statue of Liberty was completed
      before the Suez Canal. Therefore, the correct answer is:


      **NO**
