      completed after the Golden Gate Bridge, let''s follow these steps:


      Step 1: Find out when the Golden Gate Bridge was completed.

      The Golden Gate Bridge was completed and opened to pedestrian traffic on May
      27, 1937, and to vehicular traffic on May 28, 1937.


      Step 2: Find out when the Hoover Dam was completed.

      The Hoover Dam was completed on March 1, 1936, and was dedicated by President
      Franklin D. Roosevelt on September 30, 1935.

      The Hoover Dam was completed on March 1, 1936, while the Golden Gate Bridge
      was completed on May 27, 1937. This means that the Hoover Dam was completed
      more than a year before the Golden Gate Bridge.

      1. The Empire State Building is located in New York City, USA. It is a 102-story
      skyscraper that was once the tallest building in the world.


      2. The Hoover Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam located on the Colorado River
      between Nevada and Arizona, USA. It was built to provide irrigation water, control
      floods, and generate hydroelectric power.


      3. Construction of the Empire State Building began on March 17, 1930, and was

      China.

      The Ming Dynasty ruled China from 1368 to 1644. During this period, the Great
      Wall was extensively rebuilt, fortified, and expanded.


      Step 2: Identify the construction period of the Taj Mahal.

      The Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1653 under the orders of the Mughal
      Emperor Shah Jahan.


      Step 3: Compare the two construction timelines.

      The Ming Dynasty''s Great Wall construction (1368-1644) began before the Taj
      Mahal (1632-1653). However, the Taj Mahal''s construction was completed in 1653,
      which falls within the Ming Dynasty''s timeline.

      to compare the construction timelines of both structures.


      Step 1: Determine the construction period of the Ming Dynasty''s Great Wall
      of China.

      - The Ming Dynasty ruled China from 1368 to 1644 CE.

      - During this period, the Ming Dynasty made significant repairs, renovations,
      and extensions to the existing Great Wall.

      - The majority of the Great Wall as we know it today was built during the Ming
      Dynasty.


      Step 2: Determine the construction period of the Taj Mahal.

      - The Taj Mahal was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory
      of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

      - The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 CE.

      - The main mausoleum was completed in 1648 CE, while the surrounding buildings
      and gardens were finished in 1653 CE.


      Step 3: Compare the timelines.

      - The Ming Dynasty''s Great Wall construction and renovations took place between
      1368 and 1644 CE.

      - The Taj Mahal''s construction took place between 1632 and 1653 CE.

      - The Taj Mahal''s construction began and was completed within the period of
      the Ming Dynasty''s Great Wall construction.


      Therefore, the answer is NO. The Great Wall of China built during the Ming Dynasty
      was not completed after the Taj Mahal. In fact, the Taj Mahal was built and
      completed during the same period as the Ming Dynasty''s construction of the

      The Ming Dynasty ruled China from 1368 to 1644.

      The Ming Dynasty Great Wall was still being constructed in the 16th and 17th
