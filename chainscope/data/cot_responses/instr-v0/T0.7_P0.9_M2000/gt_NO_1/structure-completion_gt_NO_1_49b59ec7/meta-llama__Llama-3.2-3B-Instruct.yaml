      1. First, I''ll find the completion year of the Hoover Dam. The Hoover Dam was
      completed in 1936.

      2. Next, I''ll find the completion year of the Golden Gate Bridge. The Golden
      Gate Bridge was completed in 1937.

      1. The Great Wall of China was built in multiple stages, but the most famous
      and impressive version was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

      2. The construction of the Great Wall of China was a long process that spanned
      many centuries, with different dynasties contributing to its construction.

      3. The first versions of the Great Wall were built during the 7th and 6th centuries
      BC, by several small states in the region.

      4. The wall was continuously expanded and fortified by successive Chinese dynasties,
      including the Qin, Han, Sui, and Ming.

      5. The Ming Dynasty renovated and extended the wall, building many of the most
      famous and well-preserved sections.

      6. The Taj Mahal, on the other hand, was built during the Mughal Empire (1526-1756),
      which was a later dynasty than the Ming Dynasty.

      7. The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1653.

      1. The Great Wall of China was built in multiple stages, with the earliest versions
      of the wall being constructed during the 7th and 6th centuries BC. However,
      the most famous and well-preserved versions of the wall were built during the

      2. The Taj Mahal, on the other hand, was built during the Mughal Empire (1526-1756),

      3. The Taj Mahal is believed to have been completed in 1653, during the reign

      4. The Great Wall of China was largely completed during the Ming Dynasty, with
      the final version being built in the early 16th century.


      Now, let''s combine these facts to answer the question:


      The Great Wall of China was largely completed during the Ming Dynasty, while
      the Taj Mahal was built during the Mughal Empire. Since the Mughal Empire came
      after the Ming Dynasty, it''s likely that the Great Wall of China was completed
      before the Taj Mahal.

      Taj Mahal.


      * The Great Wall of China was initially constructed during the 7th and 6th centuries
      BC, with successive dynasties extending and renovating it over time. The most
      famous and well-preserved sections were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

      * The Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1653 during the Mughal Empire, which
      was a later dynasty than the Ming Dynasty.


      Step 2: Determine the completion date of the Great Wall of China during the
      Ming Dynasty.


      * The Ming Dynasty renovated and extended the Great Wall of China, but it''s
      difficult to pinpoint an exact completion date. However, most of the existing
      sections were built by the 16th century.


      Step 3: Determine the completion date of the Taj Mahal.


      * The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653, during the Mughal Empire.


      Step 4: Compare the completion dates of the Great Wall of China during the Ming
      Dynasty and the Taj Mahal.


      * Based on the steps above, the Great Wall of China was largely built and renovated
      during the Ming Dynasty, but its completion date is not fixed. However, the
