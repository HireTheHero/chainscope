    4a0e6f44-1859-480b-8fd0-78d5e3c119e9: 'To answer this question, we need to compare
      the completion dates of both the Suez Canal and the Statue of Liberty.


      1. The Suez Canal was completed in 1869. It opened for navigation on November
      17, 1869.

      2. The Statue of Liberty was dedicated on October 28, 1886. However, it was
      designed and constructed in France before being shipped to the United States
      and assembled there.


      Given these dates, the Suez Canal was completed in 1869, while the Statue of
      Liberty was completed and dedicated in 1886.


      Therefore, the Suez Canal was completed before the Statue of Liberty.


      Answer: NO'
    6057132c-db59-4e5a-9341-abf17f639875: 'To determine whether the Suez Canal was
      completed after the Statue of Liberty, let''s look at the completion dates of
      both structures.


      1. The Suez Canal: Construction began in 1859 and was completed in 1869. It
      officially opened for navigation on November 17, 1869.


      2. The Statue of Liberty: The statue itself was completed in France in 1884.
      However, it wasn''t fully assembled and dedicated in New York until October
      28, 1886.


      Based on these facts, the Suez Canal (completed in 1869) predates the Statue
      of Liberty (completed in 1886).


      Therefore, the answer is NO. The Suez Canal was not completed after the Statue
      of Liberty; it was completed before.'
    70f2c721-bc9b-428c-977f-b06028ec63d2: 'To answer this question accurately, let''s
      break down the timeline of both events:


      1. **Completion of the Suez Canal**: The Suez Canal was completed in 1869. It
      opened officially on November 17, 1869.


      2. **Statue of Liberty**: The Statue of Liberty was gifted to the United States
      by France. It was dedicated on October 28, 1886.


      Given these dates:

      - The Suez Canal was completed in 1869.

      - The Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886.


      Since 1869 comes before 1886, the Suez Canal was indeed completed before the
      Statue of Liberty was dedicated.


      **Answer: NO**'
    80705195-871d-4f84-8a92-c9016daf7db4: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the completion dates for both the Suez Canal and the Statue of Liberty.


      1. The Suez Canal was completed in 1869. It was officially opened on November
      17, 1869, allowing ships to travel directly between the Mediterranean Sea and
      the Red Sea.


      2. The Statue of Liberty was dedicated on October 28, 1886. It was a gift from
      France to the United States and took several years to complete, including its
      construction in France and its reassembly in New York Harbor.


      Given these dates, the Suez Canal was indeed completed before the Statue of
