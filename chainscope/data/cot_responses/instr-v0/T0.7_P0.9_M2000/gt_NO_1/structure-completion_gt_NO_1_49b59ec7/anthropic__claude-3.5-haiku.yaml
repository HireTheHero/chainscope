      the Ming Dynasty

      - The majority of Ming Dynasty Great Wall construction occurred between the
      14th and 17th centuries


      3. Compare the timelines:

      - Taj Mahal: Completed around 1653

      - Ming Dynasty Great Wall: Construction ongoing during this period, with most
      sections already built before 1653


      4. Conclusion:

      - The Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty version) was largely completed BEFORE
      the Taj Mahal was finished

      - So the answer is NO, the Great Wall was not completed after the Taj Mahal

    f704af97-2f6a-4692-941a-3d0f138cce42: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, when was the Taj Mahal built?

      - The Taj Mahal was constructed between 1632 and 1653 during the Mughal Empire,
      under Shah Jahan''s rule.


      2. When was the Ming Dynasty Great Wall completed?

      - The Ming Dynasty Great Wall was primarily built and completed between the
      14th and 17th centuries (roughly 1368-1644).

      - Most of the wall''s current form was constructed between the late 15th and
      early 17th centuries.


      3. Comparing the timelines:

      - Taj Mahal: 1632-1653

      - Ming Dynasty Great Wall: Completed by around 1644


      4. Comparing the dates:

      - The Ming Dynasty Great Wall was essentially complete by 1644

      - The Taj Mahal was being built between 1632-1653


      5. Conclusion:

      The Great Wall of China was completed around the same time or slightly before
      the Taj Mahal was being constructed.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO (the Ming Dynasty Great Wall was not completed
      after the Taj Mahal).'
