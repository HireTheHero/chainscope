      atomic nucleus.

      2. I also know that the atomic number of an element is unique to that element
      and determines its position in the periodic table.

      3. I recall that hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, and helium has an atomic
      number of 2.

      4. Now, I compare the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium: hydrogen has 1,
      and helium has 2.

      atomic number than helium.
