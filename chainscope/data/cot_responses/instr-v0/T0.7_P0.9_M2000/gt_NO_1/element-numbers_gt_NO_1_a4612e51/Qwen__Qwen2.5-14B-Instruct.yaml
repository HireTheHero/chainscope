      1. Sulfur (S) is located in Group 16 (previously known as Group VIA), Period
      3 of the periodic table.

      2. Chlorine (Cl) is also in Group 17 (previously known as Group VIIA), Period
      3 of the periodic table.


      The order of elements from left to right in the same period follows the increasing

      - Sodium (Na) is the first element, followed by Magnesium (Mg), Aluminum (Al),
