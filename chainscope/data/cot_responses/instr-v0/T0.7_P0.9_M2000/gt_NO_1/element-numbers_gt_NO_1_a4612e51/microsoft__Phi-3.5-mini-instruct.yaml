      The question is asking if hydrogen has a higher atomic number than helium.


      Step 2: Recall the atomic numbers of hydrogen and helium.

      The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, as it is the first element in the periodic
      table.

      The atomic number of helium is 2, as it is the second element in the periodic
      table.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers.

      We have hydrogen with an atomic number of 1, and helium with an atomic number
      of 2.


      Step 4: Determine if hydrogen has a higher atomic number than helium.

      Since 1 (hydrogen''s atomic number) is less than 2 (helium''s atomic number),
      hydrogen does not have a higher atomic number than helium.
