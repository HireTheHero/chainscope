      2. Boiling point is related to intermolecular forces.  Stronger intermolecular
      forces lead to higher boiling points.

      3. The primary intermolecular force for both nitrogen and oxygen is London Dispersion
      Forces.  These forces depend on the size and shape of the molecule.

      4. Nitrogen (N2) is a smaller molecule than oxygen (O2).

      5. Smaller molecules have weaker London Dispersion Forces.

      6. Weaker London Dispersion Forces lead to a lower boiling point.


      Therefore, oxygen has a higher boiling point than nitrogen.

      2.  Boiling points are related to intermolecular forces.  Stronger intermolecular
      forces lead to higher boiling points.


      3.  Nitrogen molecules (N2) are diatomic and experience relatively weak London
      Dispersion Forces.


      4.  Oxygen molecules (O2) are also diatomic and experience London Dispersion
      Forces.  Because oxygen molecules are more massive than nitrogen molecules,
      the electrons are more easily polarized, resulting in slightly stronger London
      Dispersion Forces.


      5.  Slightly stronger intermolecular forces in oxygen mean a higher boiling
      point.
