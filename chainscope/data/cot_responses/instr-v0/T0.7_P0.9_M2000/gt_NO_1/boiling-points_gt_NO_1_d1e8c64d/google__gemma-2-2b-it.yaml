      \ oxygen.\n5. **Comparing Intermolecular Forces:** Oxygen has stronger intermolecular\
      \ forces (dipole-dipole interactions) than nitrogen due to its larger size and\
      \ greater electronegativity.\n6. **Conclusion:**  Therefore, oxygen has a higher\
      \ boiling point than nitrogen.\n\n**Answer: NO** \n"

      \ point and molecular forces:**  Boiling point is determined by how much energy\
      \ it takes to overcome the intermolecular forces holding molecules together.\

      \ **Understanding Boiling Point:**  Boiling point is the temperature at which\
      \ a liquid changes into a gas. \n2. **Intermolecular Forces:** The strength\

      \ double bond.\n5. **Comparing Intermolecular Forces:**  The triple bond in\
      \ nitrogen is stronger than the double bond in oxygen.  \n\n**Conclusion:**\
