      of intermolecular forces.


      2. **Acetone vs. Methanol:** Acetone has dipole-dipole interactions due to its
      polar carbonyl group (C=O). Methanol also has dipole-dipole interactions due
      to its polar O-H bond.


      3. **Hydrogen Bonding:** Methanol can form hydrogen bonds, a stronger type of
      dipole-dipole interaction, due to the presence of the -OH group. Acetone cannot
      form hydrogen bonds.


      4. **Stronger Forces, Higher Boiling Point:** Stronger intermolecular forces
      lead to higher boiling points.


      5. **Conclusion:** Since methanol can form hydrogen bonds, which are stronger
      than the dipole-dipole interactions in acetone, methanol has a higher boiling
      point.
