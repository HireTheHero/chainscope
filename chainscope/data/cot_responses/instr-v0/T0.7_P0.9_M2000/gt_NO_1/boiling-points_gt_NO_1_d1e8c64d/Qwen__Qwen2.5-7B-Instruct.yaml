      1. **Molecular Structure and Polarity**: Acetone (C3H6O) and methanol (CH3OH)
      are both polar molecules due to their presence of oxygen. However, the structure
      and size of these molecules differ. Methanol has a smaller molecular size compared
      to acetone.


      2. **Boiling Point Determinants**: The boiling point of a substance is largely
      determined by the strength of intermolecular forces. Stronger intermolecular
      forces result in a higher boiling point.


      3. **Intermolecular Forces**: In acetone, the carbonyl group (-CO-) creates
      additional dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding capabilities. This
      results in stronger intermolecular forces compared to methanol.


      4. **Methanol''s Interactions**: Methanol also forms hydrogen bonds due to its
      -OH group, but because it is a smaller molecule, the overall intermolecular
      forces are generally weaker than those in acetone.


      5. **Comparing Boiling Points**: Given that acetone has stronger intermolecular
      forces, it will have a higher boiling point than methanol.

      1. **Molecular Structure**: Acetone (CH3COCH3) and methanol (CH3OH) both have
      the same number of carbon atoms in their main chain, but their structures differ.
      Methanol has one oxygen atom directly bonded to the methyl group, while acetone
      has an additional carbonyl group (C=O).


      2. **Boiling Point Factors**: The boiling point of a substance is influenced
      by intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions,
      and London dispersion forces.


      3. **Hydrogen Bonding**: Methanol can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence
      of the hydroxyl (-OH) group, which allows for strong intermolecular attractions.
      Acetone cannot form hydrogen bonds because it lacks a hydrogen atom directly
      bonded to a highly electronegative atom (such as oxygen or nitrogen).


      4. **Dipole-Dipole Interactions**: Both methanol and acetone are polar molecules,
      which allows them to experience dipole-dipole interactions. However, these are
      weaker than hydrogen bonds.

      6. **Comparing Boiling Points**: Given that methanol can form hydrogen bonds

      1. **Molecular Structure**: Acetone (C3H6O) and methanol (CH3OH) are both polar

      2. **Intermolecular Forces**: The strength of intermolecular forces affects
      the boiling point. Stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome,

      the strongest types of intermolecular forces.


      3. **Hydrogen Bonding**: Methanol can form hydrogen bonds between its hydroxyl
      (-OH) groups. Acetone, while capable of some dipole-dipole interactions and
      weak hydrogen bonding, does not form as strong hydrogen bonds as methanol because
      it lacks an -OH group.


      4. **Molar Mass**: Although molar mass can also play a role, in this case, the
      difference isn''t significant enough to be the deciding factor. Both acetone
      and methanol have relatively similar molar masses (58 g/mol for acetone, 32
      g/mol for methanol).
