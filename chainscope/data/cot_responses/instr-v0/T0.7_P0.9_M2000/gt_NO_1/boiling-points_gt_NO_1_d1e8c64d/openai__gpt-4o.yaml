    f83831db-2358-464a-b97d-08b39808027c: "To determine whether nitrogen has a higher\
      \ boiling point than oxygen, let's consider the following:\n\n1. **Chemical\
      \ properties**: Nitrogen (N\u2082) and oxygen (O\u2082) are both diatomic molecules\
      \ and are found in the gaseous state under standard conditions.\n\n2. **Boiling\
      \ points**: The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which it\
      \ changes from a liquid to a gas. For nitrogen, the boiling point is approximately\
      \ -195.8\xB0C (-320.4\xB0F). For oxygen, the boiling point is approximately\
      \ -183.0\xB0C (-297.4\xB0F).\n\n3. **Comparison**: Nitrogen's boiling point\
      \ (-195.8\xB0C) is lower than that of oxygen (-183.0\xB0C).\n\nBased on this\
      \ information, the answer to the question \"Does nitrogen have a higher boiling\
      \ point than oxygen?\" is NO."
