      points in alcohols:


      1. **Molecular Weight**: Generally, as molecular weight increases, so does the
      boiling point due to stronger van der Waals forces between molecules. Ethanol
      (C2H5OH) has a higher molecular weight than methanol (CH3OH).


      2. **Hydrogen Bonding**: Both methanol and ethanol can form hydrogen bonds,

      similar size. However, the strength of hydrogen bonding depends on the number
      of oxygen atoms available for hydrogen bonding per molecule. Ethanol has two
      hydroxyl groups (-OH) that can participate in hydrogen bonding per mole of alcohol,
      whereas methanol has one.


      3. **Intermolecular Forces**: Given the structure and molecular interactions,
      ethanol''s larger size and potential for more extensive hydrogen bonding contribute
      to its higher boiling point relative to methanol.
