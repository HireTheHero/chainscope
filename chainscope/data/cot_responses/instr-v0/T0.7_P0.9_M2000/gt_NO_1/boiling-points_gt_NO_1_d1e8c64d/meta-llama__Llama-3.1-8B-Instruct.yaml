      3.

      2. Consider the trend for boiling points as you move down a group in the periodic

      the electrons are farther away from the nucleus, resulting in weaker intermolecular
      forces. This typically leads to lower boiling points.

      3. Now, consider the trend for boiling points as you move across a period in

      decreases, the nuclear charge increases, and the electrons are pulled closer
      to the nucleus, resulting in stronger intermolecular forces. This typically

      the properties of carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetone (CH3COCH3) step by step.


      1. **Molecular weight**: The molecular weight of CO2 is 44 g/mol, while the
      molecular weight of acetone is 58 g/mol. A higher molecular weight generally
      indicates a higher boiling point, as the molecules are more tightly bound together
      and require more energy to break free from the liquid state.


      2. **Intermolecular forces**: Both CO2 and acetone are polar molecules, but
      acetone has a slightly higher polarity due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds
      with water (and itself) more readily than CO2. However, both are relatively
      nonpolar compared to many other substances. For molecules with similar polarity,
      the strength of intermolecular forces (such as dipole-dipole interactions or
      dispersion forces) is a key factor in determining boiling points. Since both
      molecules are relatively nonpolar, dispersion forces are the primary intermolecular
      forces at play.


      3. **Dispersion forces**: Dispersion forces depend on the size and shape of
      the molecules, as well as the number of electrons. CO2 has a linear shape, while
      acetone is more spherical. The spherical shape of acetone allows for more efficient
      packing and stronger dispersion forces between molecules, which generally results
      in a higher boiling point.


      Considering these factors, acetone (CH3COCH3) tends to have stronger intermolecular
      forces and a higher molecular weight than carbon dioxide (CO2), suggesting that
      acetone should have a higher boiling point.

      1. Recall that boiling point is a measure of the energy required to change a
      substance from a liquid to a gas. In general, the more energy required to vaporize
      a substance, the higher its boiling point.

      2. Compare the molecular weights of carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetone (CH3COCH3).
      Carbon dioxide has a molecular weight of 44 g/mol, while acetone has a molecular
      weight of 58 g/mol.

      3. Consider the intermolecular forces between the molecules of each substance.
      Carbon dioxide is a nonpolar molecule, while acetone is a polar molecule. However,
      both substances are capable of forming London dispersion forces (also known
      as van der Waals forces), which are relatively weak intermolecular forces.

      4. Consider the effect of molecular weight on intermolecular forces. In general,
      as molecular weight increases, the strength of London dispersion forces also
      increases. This is because heavier molecules tend to have a greater number of
      electrons and a larger electron cloud, which allows for stronger temporary dipoles
      and more extensive London dispersion forces.

      5. Based on the above reasoning, we can infer that acetone (with a higher molecular

      Step 1: Recall that boiling point is a measure of the energy required to change
      a substance from a liquid to a gas at standard atmospheric pressure. This energy
      is related to the strength of the intermolecular forces between the atoms or
      molecules of the substance.

      metals, but they belong to different groups in the periodic table. Copper is
      in group 11, while iron is in group 8. The elements in the same group tend to

      Step 3: Think about the atomic radius of copper and iron. Copper has an atomic
      radius of about 128 pm, while iron has an atomic radius of about 140 pm. The
      larger atomic radius of iron suggests that its atoms are more loosely packed

      1. **Molecular weight**: Compare the molecular weights of acetone (C3H6O) and
      methanol (CH3OH). Acetone has a molecular weight of 58 g/mol, while methanol
      has a molecular weight of 32 g/mol.

      2. **Intermolecular forces**: Acetone is a polar molecule with a carbonyl group
      (C=O), which allows it to form hydrogen bonds with other acetone molecules.
      Methanol is also a polar molecule with a hydroxyl group (OH), which can form
      hydrogen bonds with other methanol molecules. However, the carbonyl group in

      3. **Boiling point relationship**: In general, a higher molecular weight and
      stronger intermolecular forces result in a higher boiling point. Since acetone
      has a higher molecular weight and stronger intermolecular forces than methanol,
      it is expected to have a higher boiling point.

      1. Ethanol and water are both polar molecules, which means they have a partial
      positive charge on one end and a partial negative charge on the other end. This
      polarity allows them to form hydrogen bonds with each other.

      2. Hydrogen bonding is a type of intermolecular force that arises between molecules
      with a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (such as oxygen,
      nitrogen, or fluorine). In the case of ethanol and water, the hydrogen bonds

      1. Recall the general trend of boiling points for elements in the periodic table:
      As you go down a group (column) in the periodic table, the boiling point generally
      increases. This is because the molecules are larger and have more electrons,
      leading to stronger intermolecular forces.

      2. Compare the positions of helium (He) and nitrogen (N2) in the periodic table.
      Helium is in Group 18 (noble gases), while nitrogen is in Group 15 (nitrogen
      group).

      3. Since helium is in a lower group number than nitrogen, helium would be expected
      to have weaker intermolecular forces compared to nitrogen.

      4. Weaker intermolecular forces generally result in lower boiling points.

      5. Therefore, helium would be expected to have a lower boiling point than nitrogen.

      forces tend to have higher boiling points.

      2. Helium is a noble gas, which means it has a full outer energy level and is

      1. **Recall the periodic table**: Both mercury and lead are metals in the periodic
      table. Mercury is in group 12 (formerly group IB) and period 6, while lead is
      in group 14 (formerly group IVB) and period 6.

      2. **Consider the trends in the periodic table**: In general, as you move down
      a group in the periodic table, the boiling points of elements tend to increase
      due to the increasing atomic size and the associated increase in the strength
      of London dispersion forces between atoms. In contrast, as you move across a
      period from left to right, the boiling points tend to decrease due to the increase
      in the number of electrons shielding the nucleus, which reduces the effective
      nuclear charge and the strength of the metallic bonds.

      3. **Compare the positions of mercury and lead in the periodic table**: Since
      both elements are in the same period (period 6), the trend across the period
      applies. Lead is to the left of mercury in the periodic table, which means it

      4. **Consider the effect of atomic size**: Although lead is larger than mercury,
      the increase in atomic size is not sufficient to overcome the decrease in the
      effective nuclear charge. As a result, the strength of the metallic bonds in
      lead is weaker than in mercury.

      2. Generally, as you move down a group in the periodic table, the elements become

      3. However, the relationship between boiling point and atomic weight is not
      always straightforward. Atomic weight is related to the number of protons and
      neutrons in an atom''s nucleus, and it can affect the boiling point, but it''s
      not the only factor.

      1. Mercury and lead are both metals with atomic numbers 80 and 82, respectively.

      2. In general, as you go down a group in the periodic table, the boiling point
      of metals tends to decrease due to the decrease in the strength of the metallic
      bonds.

      3. Lead is below mercury in the periodic table, so it has a lower atomic number
      and a larger atomic radius.

      4. A larger atomic radius typically results in weaker metallic bonds, which
      in turn leads to a lower boiling point.

      5. Based on these general trends, lead is expected to have a lower boiling point
      than mercury.
