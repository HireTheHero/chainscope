      1. Copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) are both metals.

      2. The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure
      of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid, and bubbles of vapor
      form inside the liquid.

      3. The boiling point of a substance depends on the strength of the intermolecular
      forces between the particles (atoms or molecules) in the liquid.

      4. Generally, metals with higher atomic masses tend to have higher boiling points,
      as the intermolecular forces (metallic bonds) are stronger.

      5. Copper has an atomic mass of 63.55 g/mol, while iron has an atomic mass of
      55.85 g/mol.

      The boiling point of a liquid is primarily determined by the strength of the

      forces, the higher the boiling point.


      The main intermolecular forces in alcohols are hydrogen bonds. The strength
      of hydrogen bonds depends on the electronegativity difference between the hydrogen
      atom and the atom it is bonded to (in this case, oxygen).


      Methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) are both alcohols, but they have different
      molecular structures. Methanol has a smaller and simpler molecule compared to
      ethanol.


      When considering the intermolecular forces, the smaller methanol molecule has
      a stronger hydrogen bond network compared to the larger ethanol molecule. This
      is because the hydrogen atoms in methanol are more closely spaced, leading to
      a stronger overall hydrogen bonding interaction.


      Therefore, the intermolecular forces in methanol are stronger than those in

      When comparing methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH), we can observe the following:
