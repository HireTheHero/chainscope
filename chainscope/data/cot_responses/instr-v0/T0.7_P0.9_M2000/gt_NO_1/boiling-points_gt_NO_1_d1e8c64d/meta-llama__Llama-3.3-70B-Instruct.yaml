    943e67ad-baf1-44b5-94d0-fba5a73a3763: 'To answer this question, let''s consider
      the properties of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) step by step:


      1. **Chemical Properties**: Oxygen is a diatomic molecule (O2), and carbon dioxide
      is a triatomic molecule (CO2). Generally, as molecules get larger (more atoms),
      they tend to have higher boiling points due to increased intermolecular forces,
      such as London dispersion forces.


      2. **Intermolecular Forces**: The strength of intermolecular forces is a key
      factor in determining boiling points. London dispersion forces, which are the
      weakest of the intermolecular forces, increase with the size of the molecule
      because larger molecules tend to have a greater temporary dipole moment. Since
      CO2 is larger than O2, it would experience stronger London dispersion forces.


      3. **Polarity**: CO2 is a linear molecule and is nonpolar, while O2 is also
      nonpolar. The polarity of a molecule can significantly affect its boiling point,
      with polar molecules generally having higher boiling points than nonpolar molecules
      of similar size due to dipole-dipole interactions. However, since both molecules
      are nonpolar, this factor does not differentiate them in terms of boiling point
      based on polarity.


      4. **Molecular Weight**: CO2 has a molecular weight of approximately 44 g/mol,
      while O2 has a molecular weight of approximately 32 g/mol. Generally, higher
      molecular weight molecules have higher boiling points due to the increased strength
      of the intermolecular forces.


      Considering these points, carbon dioxide (CO2) would be expected to have a higher
      boiling point than oxygen (O2) due to its larger molecular size and weight,
      which result in stronger intermolecular forces.
