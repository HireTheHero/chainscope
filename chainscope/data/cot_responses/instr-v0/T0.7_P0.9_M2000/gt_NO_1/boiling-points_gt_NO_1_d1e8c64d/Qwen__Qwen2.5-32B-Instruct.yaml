    bb230a36-a76b-447f-8f5c-a8a10eb8e10f: 'To determine whether silver has a higher
      boiling point than aluminum, we need to compare the boiling points of both elements.


      Step 1: Identify the boiling point of silver.

      - The boiling point of silver (Ag) is approximately 2212 degrees Celsius (or
      4014 degrees Fahrenheit).


      Step 2: Identify the boiling point of aluminum.

      - The boiling point of aluminum (Al) is approximately 2519 degrees Celsius (or
      4566 degrees Fahrenheit).


      Step 3: Compare the two boiling points.

      - Since 2212 degrees Celsius (silver''s boiling point) is less than 2519 degrees

      a higher boiling point than aluminum.

      Step 1: Identify the boiling point of water.

      - Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric
      pressure (1 atmosphere).


      Step 2: Identify the boiling point of mercury.
