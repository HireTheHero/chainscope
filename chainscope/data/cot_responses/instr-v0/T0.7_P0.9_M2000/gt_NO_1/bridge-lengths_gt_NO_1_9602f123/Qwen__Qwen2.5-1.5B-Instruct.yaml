      1. **Seven Mile Bridge**: This bridge connects Prince Edward Island (PEI) in
      Canada to Cape North, Nova Scotia. It is approximately 30 kilometers long.

      2. **Confederation Bridge**: This bridge spans the Gulf of St. Lawrence between

      1. **Length of the Mackinac Bridge**: The Mackinac Bridge connects Mackinac
      Island in Lake Huron to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Its length is approximately
      24 miles (38.6 kilometers).


      2. **Length of the Seven Mile Bridge**: The Seven Mile Bridge crosses the St.
      Clair River between Detroit, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario. Its length is about
      90.5 miles (145.7 kilometers).


      By comparing these two values:

      - The Mackinac Bridge: 24 miles

      - The Seven Mile Bridge: 90.5 miles


      Clearly, 90.5 miles (the length of the Seven Mile Bridge) is greater than 24
      miles (the length of the Mackinac Bridge).


      Therefore, the final answer is: **NO**, the Seven Mile Bridge is not longer
      than the Mackinac Bridge.'

      Bridge is longer than the Brooklyn Bridge, let''s compare their lengths.


      1. **George Washington Bridge**: This bridge spans from Manhattan to Jersey
      City in New Jersey across the Hudson River. It has an official length of about
      4,760 feet (approximately 1,450 meters).


      2. **Brooklyn Bridge**: Located in New York City, this suspension bridge connects
      Brooklyn to Manhattan across the East River. Its total length, including its
      two towers, is approximately 1,390 yards (about 1,280 meters).


      Comparing these measurements:

      - The George Washington Bridge is significantly longer than the Brooklyn Bridge.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      1. **Identify Lengths**: \n   - The George Washington Bridge spans 4,760 feet\

      \ several factors:\n\n1. **Lengths**:\n   - The GWB spans approximately 4,760\
      \ feet across New York Harbor.\n   - The BB crosses the East River from Manhattan\
      \ to Brooklyn, covering about 2,598 feet.\n\n2. **Bridge Types**:\n   - The\
      \ GWB is an overpass bridge, which means it connects two land masses above water.\n\
      \   - The BB is a suspension bridge that also crosses the water but uses cables\
      \ for support rather than a deck above the water.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n  \
      \ - While both bridges span significant distances, the GWB has significantly\
      \ more length due to its structure and design.\n   - The GWB's approach involves\
