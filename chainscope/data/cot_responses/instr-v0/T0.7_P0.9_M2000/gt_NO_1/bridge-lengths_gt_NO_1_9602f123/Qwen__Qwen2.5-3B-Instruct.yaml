      - The Golden Gate Bridge has a main span length of approximately 4,200 feet
      (1,280 meters).

      - The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, also known as the Sunshine Skyway Suspension Bridge,
      has a total length of about 5,017 feet (1,529 meters) when including its approach

      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison.

      - Since 4,200 feet (Golden Gate Bridge) is less than 5,017 feet (Sunshine Skyway
      Bridge), we can conclude that the Golden Gate Bridge is not longer than the

      Bridge is longer than the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, we need to find out the
      lengths of both structures.


      Step 1: Find the length of the Confederation Bridge.

      The Confederation Bridge spans the Northumberland Strait between the province
      of New Brunswick in Canada and Prince Edward Island. Its total length is approximately
      12.95 kilometers (8.04 miles).


      Step 2: Find the length of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.

      The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is the longest bridge in the United States and
      the second-longest continuously paved highway bridge in the world. It connects
      the city of Metairie, Louisiana, to Caillou du Mality, Louisiana, across Lake
      Pontchartrain. The causeway consists of two parallel bridges, each 19 miles
      long. Therefore, the total length of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is approximately
      38 miles (61 kilometers).


      Step 3: Compare the two lengths.

      - Confederation Bridge length: 12.95 kilometers

      - Lake Pontchartrain Causeway length: 61 kilometers


      Given that 61 kilometers is significantly greater than 12.95 kilometers, the
      Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is longer than the Confederation Bridge.

      is longer than the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, let''s break down the information
      we need to find about each bridge.


      ### Step 1: Measure Length of the Confederation Bridge

      - The Confederation Bridge connects Prince Edward Island in Canada to New Brunswick
      on the Canadian mainland.

      - It is a suspension bridge that spans the Northumberland Strait.

      - The total length of the Confederation Bridge, including approaches, is approximately
      12.95 kilometers (8.04 miles).


      ### Step 2: Measure Length of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway

      - The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is a continuous bridge crossing the Gulf of
      Mexico off the coast of Louisiana, United States.

      - It is a single-span bridge running from Caillou du North Shore to Caillou
      du Sud, covering Lake Pontchartrain.

      - The total length of the causeway is approximately 23.85 kilometers (14.82
      miles).


      ### Step 3: Compare the Two Lengths

      - The Confederation Bridge is approximately 12.95 kilometers long.

      - The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is approximately 23.85 kilometers long.


      ### Conclusion

      Given that 12.95 kilometers is less than 23.85 kilometers, the Lake Pontchartrain
      Causeway is longer than the Confederation Bridge.


      Thus, the answer to the question "Is the Confederation Bridge longer than the

      1. **Confederation Bridge**: The Confederation Bridge connects Prince Edward
      Island to the province of New Brunswick in Canada. According to reliable sources,
      its total length is 12.9 km (8.0 miles).


      2. **Lake Pontchartrain Causeway**: The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway spans across

      than the Golden Gate Bridge, I''ll need to gather some facts about their lengths.


      Step 1: Identify the length of the Forth Bridge.

      The Forth Bridge is a wrought iron railway bridge across the Firth of Forth
      in Scotland. It has a total length of approximately 2,528 meters (or 8,295 feet).


      Step 2: Identify the length of the Golden Gate Bridge.

      The Golden Gate Bridge is located in San Francisco, California, USA. It is an
      iconic suspension bridge that spans the Golden Gate strait connecting San Francisco
      to Marin County. The main span of the Golden Gate Bridge measures 2,737 meters
      (or 8,980 feet) when measured from anchor to anchor.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - Forth Bridge: 2,528 meters

      - Golden Gate Bridge: 2,737 meters


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since 2,528 meters is less than 2,737 meters, the Forth Bridge is shorter than
      the Golden Gate Bridge.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      NO'

      Scotland.

      - Its total length is approximately 2,528 meters (8,296 feet).


      The Golden Gate Bridge:

      - Located in San Francisco, California, United States.

      - Its main span length is 2,737 meters (8,982 feet), which is the longest single-span

      \ Washington Bridge's main span is about 975.6 meters.\n\n4. Determine which\
      \ bridge is longer:\n   - Since 975.6 meters is greater than 486 meters, the\
      \ George Washington Bridge is indeed longer than the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nBased\
      \ on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\nYES"
    fceb49d7-6377-4439-9d33-14cd627f6f69: "To determine if the George Washington Bridge\
      \ is longer than the Brooklyn Bridge, let's break it down into a few steps:\n\
      \n1. **Identify the lengths of both bridges:**\n   - **Brooklyn Bridge:** The\
      \ original Brooklyn Bridge is approximately 1,595 meters (5,234 feet) long.\
      \ This includes the main span, anchorages, and approach spans.\n   - **George\
      \ Washington Bridge:** The main span of the George Washington Bridge is about\
      \ 2,760 meters (9,058 feet). The total length, including approach spans, is\
      \ around 3,500 meters (11,483 feet).\n\n2. **Compare the lengths:**\n   - The\
      \ Brooklyn Bridge's main span is approximately 1,595 meters.\n   - The George\
      \ Washington Bridge's main span is approximately 2,760 meters.\n\n3. **Conclude\
      \ based on the comparison:**\n   - Since 2,760 meters (George Washington Bridge)\
      \ is greater than 1,595 meters (Brooklyn Bridge), the George Washington Bridge\
      \ is indeed longer than the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the\
      \ question \"Is the George Washington Bridge longer than the Brooklyn Bridge?\"\
      \ is:\n\n**YES**"
