      1,595.5 feet (486.3 meters) in length.


      2. **Identify the length of the Manhattan Bridge**: The Manhattan Bridge has
      a total length of 6,855 feet (2,089 meters) from end to end, but its main span
      (the part that crosses the water) is 3,224 feet (982 meters) long. However,
      when comparing the total lengths of suspension bridges like these, we usually
      consider the entire structure, not just the main span.


      3. **Compare the lengths**: Comparing the total lengths, the Brooklyn Bridge
      is 1,595.5 feet long, while the Manhattan Bridge is 6,855 feet long.


      Given these lengths, the Brooklyn Bridge is significantly shorter than the Manhattan
      Bridge.

      6.9 to 7.0 kilometers (4.3 miles) long, depending on which span you''re referring
      to, as there are two separate spans. However, for simplicity, we''ll consider
      it as roughly 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) long.


      2. **Length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge**: The San Francisco-Oakland
      Bay Bridge is approximately 7.2 kilometers (4.5 miles) long. This bridge also
      has multiple spans, but the total length is what we''re interested in for comparison.


      Now, comparing the lengths:

      - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is approximately 7 kilometers long.

      - The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is approximately 7.2 kilometers long.


      Since 7 kilometers is less than 7.2 kilometers, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is
      not longer than the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

      2. **Identify the Length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge**: The San
      Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is a complex of bridges that spans the San Francisco

      3,500 feet (1,067 meters) long, and its total length, including approaches,
      is about 4,760 feet (1,450 meters) long.


      2. **Identify the Length of the Brooklyn Bridge**: The Brooklyn Bridge connects
      Brooklyn to Manhattan, spanning the East River. It has a main span of approximately
      1,595.5 feet (486.3 meters) and a total length of about 6,016 feet (1,834 meters).

      the steps:


      1. **Identify the Length of the George Washington Bridge**: The George Washington
      Bridge spans the Hudson River, connecting New York City to New Jersey. According
      to various sources, the main span of the George Washington Bridge is approximately
      3,500 feet (1,067 meters) long, but its total length, including approaches,
      is about 4,760 feet (1,450 meters) or more, depending on how one measures it.


      2. **Identify the Length of the Brooklyn Bridge**: The Brooklyn Bridge, which
      spans the East River, connects Brooklyn to Manhattan in New York City. The Brooklyn
      Bridge has a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 meters) and a total length of
      approximately 6,016 feet (1,834 meters).


      3. **Compare the Lengths**: Now, comparing the total lengths of both bridges,
      the George Washington Bridge''s total length is about 4,760 feet, while the
      Brooklyn Bridge''s total length is about 6,016 feet.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, the Brooklyn Bridge is longer than
      the George Washington Bridge.


      The answer to the question "Is the George Washington Bridge longer than the
      Brooklyn Bridge?" is: **NO**.'
    9acd70e5-46f4-4e67-96af-aa27eefee472: 'To answer this question, let''s consider
      the lengths of both bridges.


      1. **Identify the length of the George Washington Bridge**: The George Washington
      Bridge, which connects New York City to New Jersey, has a total length of approximately
      4,760 feet (1,450 meters) for its main span. However, its total length, including
      its approaches, is about 8,854 feet (2,698 meters) for the upper level and 8,514
      feet (2,595 meters) for the lower level. But for simplicity, we often refer
      to the main span when comparing lengths.


      2. **Identify the length of the Brooklyn Bridge**: The Brooklyn Bridge, connecting
      Brooklyn to Manhattan in New York City, has a main span of approximately 1,595.5
      feet (486.3 meters) and a total length of about 6,016 feet (1,834 meters).


      3. **Compare the lengths**: The main span of the George Washington Bridge (approximately
      4,760 feet) is longer than the total length of the Brooklyn Bridge (approximately
      6,016 feet). Even considering the total lengths, the George Washington Bridge
      is still longer when including its approaches.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether the George Washington Bridge is longer
      than the Brooklyn Bridge is **YES**.'
