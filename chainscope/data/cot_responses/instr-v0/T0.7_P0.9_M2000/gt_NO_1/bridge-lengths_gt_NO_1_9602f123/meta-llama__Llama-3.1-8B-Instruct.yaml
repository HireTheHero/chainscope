      to the center of the next pier.

      5. The Brooklyn Bridge has a longer main span (1,595.5 feet) than the Manhattan
      Bridge (1,470 feet).

      6. However, the total length of a bridge also depends on the length of its approaches
      and piers.

      7. According to various sources, the total length of the Brooklyn Bridge is
      approximately 6,016 feet.

      8. The total length of the Manhattan Bridge is approximately 5,944 feet.


      Based on the calculations above, the Brooklyn Bridge is indeed longer than the
      Manhattan Bridge.

      2. Look up the length of the Seven Mile Bridge: The Seven Mile Bridge is a bridge
      located in the Florida Keys in the United States. Its name suggests that it
      is 7 miles (11.3 km) long, which is indeed the case.


      Now that I have the lengths of both bridges, I can answer the question:


      The Mackinac Bridge is approximately 5 miles long, while the Seven Mile Bridge
      is 7 miles long. Therefore...


      The answer is: NO'
