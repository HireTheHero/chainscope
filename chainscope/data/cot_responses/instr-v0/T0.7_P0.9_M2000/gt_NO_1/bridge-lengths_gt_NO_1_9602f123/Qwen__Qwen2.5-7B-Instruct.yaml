      Since 8,614 feet is less than 13,952 feet, the Mackinac Bridge is not longer
      than the Seven Mile Bridge.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'
    9681b745-5923-46be-bcf6-203dd35b203b: 'To determine if the Mackinac Bridge is
      longer than the Seven Mile Bridge, I need to compare their lengths.


      1. **Mackinac Bridge**: This is a suspension bridge that spans the Straits of
      Mackinac, connecting Michigan''s Upper and Lower Peninsulas. According to reliable
      sources, the total length of the Mackinac Bridge is approximately 8,614 feet
      (2,625 meters).


      2. **Seven Mile Bridge**: This refers to a series of bridges in Florida, but
      the most well-known is the Seven Mile Bridge in the Florida Keys. The main span
      of this bridge is about 10,337 feet (3,150 meters) long.


      Given these measurements:

      - Mackinac Bridge: 8,614 feet

      - Seven Mile Bridge: 10,337 feet


      Since 8,614 feet is less than 10,337 feet, the Mackinac Bridge is not longer
      than the Seven Mile Bridge.

    7d223e88-3692-4ed2-8730-a0f72994f888: 'To determine if the George Washington Bridge
      is longer than the Brooklyn Bridge, let''s consider the lengths of each bridge:


      1. **George Washington Bridge**: The main span of the George Washington Bridge
      is approximately 4,260 feet long. However, to compare it to the Brooklyn Bridge,
      we need to consider its total length, which includes approaches and other structures.
      The total length of the George Washington Bridge is about 17,150 feet (or roughly
      3.27 miles).


      2. **Brooklyn Bridge**: The Brooklyn Bridge has a total length of about 6,020
      feet (including approaches), with the main span being approximately 1,595 feet.


      Comparing these two lengths:

      - George Washington Bridge: 17,150 feet

      - Brooklyn Bridge: 6,020 feet


      Since 17,150 feet is greater than 6,020 feet, the George Washington Bridge is
      indeed longer than the Brooklyn Bridge.


      **Answer: YES**'

      \  - The Brooklyn Bridge has one main suspension span that is 5,989 feet long.\n\
      \   - It also includes approach spans, but the primary measurement for comparison\
      \ is the main span.\n   - The total length of the Brooklyn Bridge, including\
