      the necessary information about both bridges.


      1. **Golden Gate Bridge**: The Golden Gate Bridge spans the Golden Gate strait,
      connecting San Francisco to Marin County in California. Its main span length
      is approximately 4,200 feet (about 1,280 meters).


      2. **Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is located over Tampa
      Bay in Florida. It consists of two main spans, each approximately 3,680 feet
      (about 1,122 meters) long.


      Now we compare the lengths:


      - The Golden Gate Bridge''s main span is about 4,200 feet.

      - Each main span of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is about 3,680 feet.


      Since the question asks if the Golden Gate Bridge is longer than the Sunshine
      Skyway Bridge, we need to clarify what aspect of "length" we''re comparing.
      If we consider the total length of the bridge structures including approaches,
      the Golden Gate Bridge is significantly longer overall. However, if we strictly
      compare the main spans:


      The main span of the Golden Gate Bridge is longer than the main span of the
      Sunshine Skyway Bridge.
