      long.

      2. Next, I need to know the length of the Brooklyn Bridge. According to my knowledge,
      the Brooklyn Bridge is approximately 1,595.5 feet (486 meters) long.

      3. Now, I need to compare the lengths. Since 4,760 is greater than 1,595.5,
      the George Washington Bridge is indeed longer than the Brooklyn Bridge.
