      - Brooklyn Bridge length: 5,989 feet


      2. To compare:

      - 5,989 feet (Brooklyn Bridge) is greater than 4,760 feet (George Washington
      Bridge)

      - The Brooklyn Bridge is actually about 1,229 feet longer


      Therefore the answer is: NO


      The George Washington Bridge is not longer than the Brooklyn Bridge.'

      - George Washington Bridge length: 4,760 feet

      - Brooklyn Bridge length: 5,989 feet


      2. To determine which is longer, I''ll compare these numbers:

      5,989 feet (Brooklyn Bridge) > 4,760 feet (George Washington Bridge)


      3. Since 5,989 is greater than 4,760, the Brooklyn Bridge is longer than the
      George Washington Bridge.


      Answer: NO
