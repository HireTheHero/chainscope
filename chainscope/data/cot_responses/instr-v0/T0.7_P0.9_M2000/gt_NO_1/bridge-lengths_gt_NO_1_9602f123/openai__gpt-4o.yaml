      However, since the question refers to the overall length of the bridge, we compare
      the total lengths. Based on these measurements, the answer is:


      NO, the George Washington Bridge is not longer than the Brooklyn Bridge in terms
      of total length.'
    bf93fe86-a25b-43d0-9ecc-a98a3f655b20: "To determine if the George Washington Bridge\
      \ is longer than the Brooklyn Bridge, we need to consider the main span lengths\
      \ and total lengths of each bridge. \n\n1. **George Washington Bridge**:\n \
      \  - The main span of the George Washington Bridge is approximately 1,450 meters\
      \ (4,760 feet).\n   - The total length of the bridge, including approaches,\
      \ is about 4,760 meters (15,900 feet).\n\n2. **Brooklyn Bridge**:\n   - The\
      \ main span of the Brooklyn Bridge is approximately 486 meters (1,595 feet).\n\
      \   - The total length of the bridge, including approaches, is about 1,834 meters\
      \ (5,989 feet).\n\nComparing the lengths, both in terms of the main span and\
      \ total length, the George Washington Bridge is significantly longer than the\
      \ Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: YES."
    c57044a9-4c97-427e-baf9-ece19c71c23b: "To answer whether the George Washington\
      \ Bridge is longer than the Brooklyn Bridge, let's consider the lengths of both\
      \ bridges:\n\n1. **George Washington Bridge:**\n   - The George Washington Bridge,\
      \ which connects New York City and New Jersey, has a total length of approximately\
      \ 4,760 feet (1,450 meters) for the main span and a total length of about 4,760\
      \ feet (1,450 meters).\n\n2. **Brooklyn Bridge:**\n   - The Brooklyn Bridge,\
      \ which connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City, has\
      \ a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 meters) and a total length of about 5,989\
      \ feet (1,825 meters).\n\nNow, comparing the main spans and total lengths:\n\
      - The main span of the George Washington Bridge (3,500 feet) is longer than\
      \ the main span of the Brooklyn Bridge (1,595.5 feet).\n- The total length of\
      \ the George Washington Bridge is shorter than the total length of the Brooklyn\
      \ Bridge.\n\nConsidering these factors, the question doesn't specify whether\
      \ \"longer\" refers to the main span or the total length. However, it is common\
      \ to compare the main spans when discussing the length of suspension bridges.\n\
      \nTherefore, based on the main span, the answer is YES, the George Washington\
      \ Bridge is longer than the Brooklyn Bridge."
