      Skyway Bridge, which is around 21,877 feet (6,668 m), it is still shorter than
      the Golden Gate Bridge.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison.

      Since the Golden Gate Bridge is longer than both the main span and the total
      length of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, we can conclude that the Golden Gate Bridge
      is indeed longer than the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.


      Final answer: YES, the Golden Gate Bridge is longer than the Sunshine Skyway

      Step 1: Confederation Bridge

      - The Confederation Bridge connects Prince Edward Island to the mainland of
      New Brunswick, Canada.

      - It was opened in 1997.

      - The total length of the Confederation Bridge is 12.9 kilometers (8 miles).

      - The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is located in southern Louisiana, United States.

      - It consists of two parallel bridges crossing Lake Pontchartrain.

      - The longer of the two bridges measures 38.35 kilometers (23.83 miles).


      Step 3: Comparison

      - The Confederation Bridge is 12.9 kilometers (8 miles) long.

      - The longer bridge of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is 38.35 kilometers (23.83

      - The Forth Bridge is a cantilever railway bridge across the Firth of Forth
      in the east of Scotland.

      - The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the
      one-mile-wide strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.
