      1) The Seven Mile Bridge is a bridge in the Florida Keys that connects Knight''s
      Key to Little Duck Key. Its total length is 6.79 miles or approximately 10.9
      kilometers.


      2) The Confederation Bridge is a bridge that connects the provinces of Prince
      Edward Island and New Brunswick in Canada. Its total length is 12.9 kilometers
      or approximately 8 miles.

      Step 1: Identify the bridges in question.

      - The Mackinac Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Straits of Mackinac,
      connecting the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan.

      - The Seven Mile Bridge is a bridge in the Florida Keys, connecting Knight''s
      Key to Little Duck Key.


      Step 2: Find the lengths of the bridges.

      - The Mackinac Bridge has a total length of 8,614 feet (2,625 meters or 5 miles).

      - The Seven Mile Bridge has a total length of 35,719 feet (10,887 meters or
      approximately 6.8 miles).
