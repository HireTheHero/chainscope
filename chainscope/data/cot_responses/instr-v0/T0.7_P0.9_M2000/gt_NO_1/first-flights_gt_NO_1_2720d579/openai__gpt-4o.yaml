      historic nonstop solo transatlantic flight. This flight took place in May 1927.
      The Spirit of St. Louis itself made its first flight on April 28, 1927.


      2. The DC-3 is a famous aircraft developed by the Douglas Aircraft Company.
      Its first flight was on December 17, 1935.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis first flew on April 28, 1927.

      - The DC-3 first flew on December 17, 1935.


      The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight before the DC-3.
