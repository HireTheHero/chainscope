      2. The Boeing 777 is a wide-body jet airliner that was first introduced in the
      1990s.

      3. However, Boeing has produced several variants of the 777 over the years,
      including the 777-300ER, which was introduced in 2004.

      4. The 777-300ER is a stretched version of the original 777-200, and it has
      a slightly different design and capabilities.


      Considering these points, it seems that the Boeing 777-300ER was likely the
      variant that made its first flight after the Airbus A380. However, I must consider
      the possibility that the original 777-200 made its first flight before the A380.

      is more than a decade before the A380''s first flight. However, the 777-300ER
      is a variant that was introduced later, in 2004.
