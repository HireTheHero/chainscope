      3. Compare these dates to determine if the Spirit of St. Louis made its first

      of St. Louis make its first flight after the DC-3?", let''s break down the information
      needed and analyze it step-by-step.


      1. **Spirit of St. Louis**: This aircraft was built for Charles Lindbergh''s
      transatlantic solo flight in 1927. The first flight of the Spirit of St. Louis
      took place on May 20-21, 1927.


      2. **Douglas DC-3**: This aircraft was developed in the late 1930s as a major

      made its first flight on December 17, 1935.

      was not used for commercial flights but rather as a historic airplane associated
      with that pioneering achievement. It made its famous flight in May 1927.

      was a modified Ryan M-2 aircraft that Lindbergh himself purchased and named
      "The Spirit of St. Louis." It made its first flight on May 10, 1927, when Lindbergh
      tested it before its famous transatlantic flight on May 20-21, 1927.


      2. **DC-3**: The Douglas DC-3 is a fixed-wing propeller-driven airliner that

      the plane itself was built much later than the Wright Flyer. The Spirit of St.
      Louis was not flown before 1927 in any significant historical context that compares
      to the Wright Brothers'' achievement.


      Step 3: Comparing the dates, the Wright Flyer''s first flight occurred in 1903,
      while the Spirit of St. Louis''s notable flight happened in 1927.


      Given these facts, the Wright Flyer did not make its first flight after the
      Spirit of St. Louis; rather, it was well over two decades before it.

      the dates of the first flights for both aircraft in question.


      1. **Wright Flyer**: The Wright Flyer made its first successful powered flight
      on December 17, 1903, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

      2. **Spirit of St. Louis**: Charles Lindbergh flew the Spirit of St. Louis on
      its historic transatlantic flight from New York to Paris on May 20-21, 1927.
      However, the plane''s first flight took place before that, specifically on February
      23, 1927, at Lambert-St. Louis Airport (now Lambert-McChord Field).


      Given these dates:

      - The Wright Flyer''s first flight was in 1903.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis'' first flight was in 1927.


      Therefore, the Wright Flyer did not make its first flight after the Spirit of
      St. Louis; it predates it by over two decades.

      1. The Wright Flyer made its first successful powered flight on December 17,

      2. The Spirit of St. Louis was not an early aircraft; it''s famous for Charles
      Lindbergh''s solo transatlantic flight in 1927. However, the question is asking
      about its first flight, which took place on May 10, 1927.


      Given these facts, the Wright Flyer made its first flight well before the Spirit

      the dates of the first flights of both the Wright Flyer and the Spirit of St.
      Louis.


      1. The Wright Flyer made its historic first flight on December 17, 1903, near
      Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This flight was conducted by Orville Wright and
      lasted for 12 seconds, covering 120 feet.


      2. The Spirit of St. Louis, flown by Charles Lindbergh, made its famous solo
      transatlantic flight in 1927, but the specific date we''re interested in here
      is May 20-21, 1927, when it completed the flight from New York to Paris. However,
      the critical information is about the first flight of the aircraft itself, which
      took place earlier in 1927.


      Since the Wright Flyer''s first flight occurred in 1903 and the Spirit of St.
      Louis''s first flight (in the context of this question) would be sometime in
      1927, we can conclude that the Wright Flyer did not make its first flight after
      the Spirit of St. Louis.


      NO.'
    e72439b1-d4ed-48c2-9f2a-ec990812ba18: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the dates of the first flights of both aircraft in question.


      1. The Wright Flyer was the first powered, heavier-than-air machine to achieve
      controlled, sustained flight with a pilot aboard. The Wright brothers made the
      first successful flight of the Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk,
      North Carolina.


      2. The Spirit of St. Louis was flown by Charles Lindbergh on his solo transatlantic
      flight from New York to Paris. However, the first flight of the Spirit of St.
      Louis took place much earlier than that famous journey. It was first flown on
      May 20, 1927, just before Lindbergh''s transatlantic flight, but it was designed
      and built in the months leading up to that date, with its initial test flights
      beginning around April 1927.


      Given these facts, we can conclude that the Wright Flyer made its first flight
      in 1903, while the Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight in 1927. Therefore,
      the Wright Flyer did not make its first flight after the Spirit of St. Louis.

      2. The Spirit of St. Louis was the plane used by Charles Lindbergh for his solo
      transatlantic flight in 1927. However, the question is not about the famous
      transatlantic flight but rather when the actual construction and first flights
      occurred. Lindbergh''s test flights of the Spirit of St. Louis began much later,
      around May 1927, leading up to his famous transatlantic flight.


      Given these points, it''s clear that the Wright Flyer made its first flight
      long before the Spirit of St. Louis had even been constructed.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**, the Wright Flyer did not make its first flight
      after the Spirit of St. Louis.'
