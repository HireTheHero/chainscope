      The SR-71 Blackbird was a supersonic reconnaissance plane developed by Lockheed
      Skunk Works in the 1950s and 1960s. It was designed to be a high-speed, high-altitude
      spy plane, capable of breaking the sound barrier.


      The Boeing 737, on the other hand, is a commercial airliner that was introduced
      in the 1960s. It was designed to be a wide-body, narrow-body jet airliner with
      a range of over 4,000 miles.


      The first flight of the SR-71 Blackbird took place in 1964. The first flight
      of the Boeing 737, however, did not occur until 1968.

      1. **Identify the correct answer**: The Spitfire is a British fighter aircraft,

      2. **Consider the timeline**: The Spitfire was first introduced in 1940, while
      the P-51 Mustang was introduced in 1942.

      3. **Look for a gap in production**: The Spitfire was produced in large numbers,
      with many aircraft being built before the P-51 Mustang. However, it''s possible
      that some Spitfires were produced after the P-51 Mustang.

      4. **Check the aircraft''s design and features**: The Spitfire was designed
      to be a high-performance fighter aircraft, with a strong emphasis on speed and
      maneuverability. The P-51 Mustang, on the other hand, was designed as a fighter-bomber,
      with a focus on range and payload capacity.

      5. **Consider the role of the aircraft**: The Spitfire was primarily used as
      a fighter aircraft, while the P-51 Mustang was used primarily as a fighter-bomber.
