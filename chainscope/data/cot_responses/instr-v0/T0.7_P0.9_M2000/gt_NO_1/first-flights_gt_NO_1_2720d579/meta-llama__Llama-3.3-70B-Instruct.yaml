      1. **Identify the first flight date of the SR-71 Blackbird**: The SR-71 Blackbird,
      a supersonic reconnaissance plane developed by Lockheed Skunk Works, made its
      first flight on December 22, 1964.

      on March 5, 1936.

      2. The North American P-51 Mustang, an American fighter aircraft, made its first
      flight on October 26, 1940.

      - The Spitfire''s first flight was in 1936.

      - The P-51 Mustang''s first flight was in 1940.


      Since 1936 is before 1940, the Spitfire made its first flight before the P-51
      Mustang.


      Therefore, the answer to whether the Spitfire made its first flight after the
      P-51 Mustang is: NO.'

      It was invented and built by the Wright brothers. The Wright Flyer made its
      first successful flight on December 17, 1903.


      2. **Spirit of St. Louis**: This aircraft is famous for being the first to fly
      solo non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean. It was flown by Charles Lindbergh.
      The historic flight took place on May 20-21, 1927.


      Given these dates:

      - The Wright Flyer''s first flight was in 1903.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis''s historic flight was in 1927.


      Since 1903 is before 1927, the Wright Flyer made its first flight before the
      Spirit of St. Louis made its historic flight.


      Therefore, the answer to the question of whether the Wright Flyer made its first
      flight after the Spirit of St. Louis is: **NO**.'

      1. **Identify the first flight of the Wright Flyer:** The Wright Flyer, designed
      and built by the Wright brothers, made its first powered, controlled, and sustained
      flight on December 17, 1903.


      2. **Identify the first flight of the Spirit of St. Louis:** The Spirit of St.
      Louis, flown by Charles Lindbergh, made its historic solo non-stop transatlantic
      flight on May 20-21, 1927. However, the first flight of the Spirit of St. Louis
