      step to determine the correct answer.


      **Step 1: Determine the First Flight Date of the Airbus A320**

      - The Airbus A320 is a popular narrow-body airliner developed by Airbus.

      - **First Flight:** The Airbus A320 made its maiden flight on **February 22,
      1987**.


      **Step 2: Determine the First Flight Date of the Boeing 777**

      - The Boeing 777 is a long-range wide-body airliner developed by Boeing.

      - **First Flight:** The Boeing 777 had its first flight on **June 12, 1994**.


      **Step 3: Compare the First Flight Dates**

      - Airbus A320 first flight: February 22, 1987

      - Boeing 777 first flight: June 12, 1994


      **Conclusion:**

      Since the Airbus A320 had its first flight in 1987 and the Boeing 777 in 1994,
      the Airbus A320 made its first flight **before** the Boeing 777.

      **Step 1: Identify the First Flight Date of the Wright Flyer**

      - The Wright Flyer, developed by the Wright brothers, made its historic first
      powered flight on **December 17, 1903**, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.


      **Step 2: Identify the First Flight Date of the Spirit of St. Louis**

      - The Spirit of St. Louis, piloted by Charles Lindbergh, had its first flight
      on **May 20-21, 1927**, when Lindbergh completed his solo nonstop transatlantic
      flight from New York to Paris.


      **Step 3: Compare the Two Dates**

      - **1903 (Wright Flyer)** vs. **1927 (Spirit of St. Louis)**


      **Step 4: Determine Which Event Occurred Later**

      - Since 1927 comes after 1903, the Spirit of St. Louis''s first flight occurred
      **after** the Wright Flyer''s first flight.
