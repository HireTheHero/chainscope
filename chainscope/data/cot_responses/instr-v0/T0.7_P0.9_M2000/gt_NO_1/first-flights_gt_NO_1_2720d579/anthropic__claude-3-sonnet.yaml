      Step 1: Find out when the SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight.

      The SR-71 Blackbird, a long-range strategic reconnaissance aircraft, made its
      first official flight on December 22, 1964.


      Step 2: Find out when the Boeing 737 made its first flight.

      The Boeing 737, a short-to-medium-range twinjet narrow-body airliner, made its
      first flight on April 9, 1967.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      The SR-71 Blackbird''s first flight (December 22, 1964) occurred before the
      Boeing 737''s first flight (April 9, 1967).

      the first flight dates of the Spirit of St. Louis and the DC-3 aircraft.


      Step 1: Identify the Spirit of St. Louis

      The Spirit of St. Louis was a single-engine monoplane that was flown by Charles
      Lindbergh in 1927 on the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight from New York
      to Paris.


      Step 2: Identify the DC-3

      The DC-3 (Douglas Commercial 3) was a pioneering commercial airliner that entered
      service in 1935. It was a significant advancement in commercial aviation and
      was widely used for passenger and cargo transportation.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates

      The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight on May 20, 1927, piloted by Charles
      Lindbergh.

      The DC-3 made its first flight on December 17, 1935, nearly 8 years after the
      Spirit of St. Louis.


      Step 4: Determine the answer

      Based on the comparison of the first flight dates, the Spirit of St. Louis made
      its first flight before the DC-3.

      production run from 1935 to 1947.


      2) The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft that was
      used by the Royal Air Force and other Allied countries before, during, and after
      World War II. Its first flight was on March 5, 1936.


      3) The DC-3 made its maiden flight on December 17, 1935, about three months
      before the first flight of the Spitfire.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Did the DC-3 make its first flight after
