      transatlantic flight from New York to Paris in 1927. This aircraft made its
      first flight before that historic trip.

      - The DC-3, also known as the Douglas DC-3, was an American propeller-driven
      airliner designed by Douglas Aircraft. Its first flight took place on December
      17, 1935.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight in 1927.

      - The DC-3 made its first flight in 1935.

      Step 2: Determine the historical context for each aircraft.

      - The Wright Flyer was the first successful powered, heavier-than-air aircraft
      designed and built by the Wright brothers.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis was a custom-built, single-engine high-wing monoplane
      that Charles Lindbergh flew solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927.


      Step 3: Establish the timeline for each event.

      - The Wright Flyer made its first controlled, sustained flight on December 17,
      1903.

      - The Spirit of St. Louis completed its transatlantic flight from New York to
      Paris on May 21, 1927.


      Step 4: Compare the timelines to answer the question.

      - Since 1903 comes before 1927, the Wright Flyer''s first flight predates the
      flight of the Spirit of St. Louis.
