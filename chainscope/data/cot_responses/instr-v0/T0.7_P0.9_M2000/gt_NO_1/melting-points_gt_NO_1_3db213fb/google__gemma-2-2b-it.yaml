      \n1. **Know the basic properties:**\n   - Copper is a metal with a relatively\
      \ high melting point.\n   - Iron is also a metal, but its melting point is lower\
      \ than copper.\n\n2. **General trend:**\n   - Metals tend to have higher melting\
      \ points the more tightly their atoms are bonded together.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n\
      \   -  Copper has a stronger metallic bond than iron. \n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\
      \   - Since copper has a stronger metallic bond, it has a higher melting point\
      \ than iron. \n\n\n**Answer:** YES \n"
