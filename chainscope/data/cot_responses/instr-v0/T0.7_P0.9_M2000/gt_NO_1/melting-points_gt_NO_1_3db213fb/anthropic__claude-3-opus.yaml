      1. Tin (Sn) and lead (Pb) are both metallic elements located in the p-block

      2. In general, melting points of elements are influenced by factors such as
      atomic size, electron configuration, and the strength of metallic bonding.


      3. Tin has an atomic number of 50, while lead has an atomic number of 82. This
      means that lead has more protons in its nucleus and more electrons surrounding
