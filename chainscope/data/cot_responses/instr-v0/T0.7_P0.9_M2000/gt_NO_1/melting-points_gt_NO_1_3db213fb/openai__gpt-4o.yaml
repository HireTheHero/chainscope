      1. **Melting point of copper:** Copper has a melting point of approximately
      1,085 degrees Celsius (1,985 degrees Fahrenheit).


      2. **Melting point of iron:** Iron has a melting point of about 1,538 degrees
      Celsius (2,800 degrees Fahrenheit).


      By comparing these values, we can see that iron has a higher melting point than
      copper.


      So, the answer is NO, copper does not have a higher melting point than iron.'

      has a higher melting point than iron, let''s consider the melting points of
      both elements:


      1. **Copper (Cu):** The melting point of copper is approximately 1,085 degrees
      Celsius (1,985 degrees Fahrenheit).


      2. **Iron (Fe):** The melting point of iron is approximately 1,538 degrees Celsius
