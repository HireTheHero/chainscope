    05fea3d3-05a0-4ed3-a45f-a9bdae2c15a3: 'To determine if gold has a higher melting
      point than copper, we need to follow these steps:


      1. Identify the melting point of gold.

      2. Identify the melting point of copper.

      3. Compare the two melting points.


      Step 1: The melting point of gold is approximately 1064 degrees Celsius (or
