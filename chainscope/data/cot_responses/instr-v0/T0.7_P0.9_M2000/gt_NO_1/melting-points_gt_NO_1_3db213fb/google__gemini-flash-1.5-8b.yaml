      2. Melting points of metals are generally related to the strength of the metallic
      bonds.


      3. Iron has a higher atomic number than copper.  This generally correlates with
      stronger metallic bonding due to more valence electrons and a greater attraction
      between the positive metal ions and the electron cloud.


      4.  Therefore, iron is typically expected to have a higher melting point than
      copper.
