      2. **GPS Program Start**: The Global Positioning System (GPS) program began
      in 1973 as the Navstar GPS program.

      1. **Early Bird Satellite**: This satellite was launched on February 19, 1966.
      It was the first geostationary communications satellite.


      2. **Syncom 3**: This satellite was launched on August 19, 1964, but it didn''t

      - Syncom 3 was launched in 1964, but its successful deployment in geosynchronous
