      \ communications satellite placed in geosynchronous orbit. It was designed to\
      \ provide telecommunication services across the Atlantic Ocean.\n   - *Launch\
      \ Date*: **April 6, 1965**.\n   - *Significance*: Early Bird enabled the first\
      \ live satellite television broadcasts and provided regular telephone and television\
      \ service between North America and Europe.\n\n2. **Landsat 1**:\n   - *Description*:\
      \ Landsat 1 was the first satellite in the **Landsat program**, a series of\
      \ Earth-observing missions jointly managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey.\
      \ It was initially named Earth Resources Technology Satellite 1 (**ERTS-1**)\
      \ before being renamed.\n   - *Launch Date*: **July 23, 1972**.\n   - *Significance*:\
      \ Landsat 1 was designed to collect data about Earth's land surface and provided\
      \ valuable information for agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning,\
      \ and education.\n\n3. **Comparing Launch Dates**:\n   - Early Bird was launched\

      \   - Comparing the years, **1965** (Early Bird) is **before** **1972** (Landsat\
      \ 1).\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n**NO**, Early Bird was not launched after Landsat\
      \ 1; it was launched **before** Landsat 1."
