      dates is relatively small, indicating that the launch of one spacecraft was
      likely a precursor to the launch of the other.

      launch dates often reflect the purpose of the mission. In this case, the launch
      of Voyager 1 was likely a precursor to the launch of Voyager 2, which was designed
