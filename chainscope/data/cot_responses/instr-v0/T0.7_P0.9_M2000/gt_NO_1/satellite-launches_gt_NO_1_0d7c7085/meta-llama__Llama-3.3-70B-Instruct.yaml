    965d131d-9c34-4876-87b2-c538a718a7aa: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the satellites in question**: We are dealing with two satellites,
      Early Bird and Landsat 1. Early Bird is also known as Intelsat 802, but in the
      context of Earth observation or similar missions, it seems there might be confusion.
      However, considering the context, it''s possible that "Early Bird" could be
      referring to a different satellite or project. For the sake of this question,
      let''s assume "Early Bird" refers to a satellite or mission that is being compared
      to Landsat 1 in terms of launch date.


      2. **Determine the launch date of Landsat 1**: Landsat 1 was launched on July
      23, 1972. This is a well-documented historical fact.


      3. **Determine the launch date of Early Bird**: Without specific information
      on "Early Bird," it''s challenging to provide a precise launch date. However,
      if we consider the context might imply the first commercial communications satellite,
      Intelsat''s Early Bird (also known as Intelsat 1), it was launched on April
      6, 1965. This satellite was indeed launched before Landsat 1.


      Given the above steps and assuming "Early Bird" refers to a satellite launched
      before Landsat 1 (such as Intelsat 1, the first commercial communications satellite),
      the answer would be based on the launch dates.


      Since Intelsat 1 (if this is the "Early Bird" in question) was launched in 1965
      and Landsat 1 in 1972, the answer to whether Early Bird was launched after Landsat
      1 is:
