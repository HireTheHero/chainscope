      Step 1: Determine the launch date of Voyager 2.

      Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977.


      Step 2: Determine the launch date of GPS 1.

      GPS 1, which refers to the first satellite in the Global Positioning System,
      was launched as part of the Navstar GPS program. The first GPS satellite, Navstar
      1, was launched on February 22, 1978.
