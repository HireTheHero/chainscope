      Step 1: Find the launch date of GPS 1.

      GPS 1, also known as Navstar 1, was the first satellite in the Global Positioning

      Step 2: Determine the launch date of Voyager 1.

      Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977.


      Step 3: Compare the launch dates.

      Landsat 1 launch date: July 23, 1972

      Voyager 1 launch date: September 5, 1977


      Since July 23, 1972 is earlier than September 5, 1977, Landsat 1 was launched
      before Voyager 1.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Was Landsat 1 launched after Voyager
      1?" is:


      NO'
