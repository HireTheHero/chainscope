      **Step 1: Identify the Launch Date of Luna 1**

      - Luna 1, also known as Lunik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union on January
      2, 1959.

      - It was the first spacecraft to reach the vicinity of the Moon and the first
      spacecraft to achieve a heliocentric orbit.


      **Step 2: Identify the Launch Date of TIROS-1**

      - TIROS-1 (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) was launched by the United
      States on April 1, 1960.

      - It was the first successful weather satellite and marked the beginning of
      the TIROS program.


      **Step 3: Compare the Launch Dates**

      - Luna 1 was launched on January 2, 1959.

      - TIROS-1 was launched on April 1, 1960.


      **Conclusion:**

      Since Luna 1 was launched on January 2, 1959, and TIROS-1 was launched later
      on April 1, 1960, Luna 1 was indeed launched **before** TIROS-1.


      **Final Answer:** **NO**, Luna 1 was launched before TIROS-1.'
