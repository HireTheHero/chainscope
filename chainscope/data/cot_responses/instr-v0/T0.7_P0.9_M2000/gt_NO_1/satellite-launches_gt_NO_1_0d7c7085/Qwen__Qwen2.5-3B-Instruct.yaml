      - It was launched on March 19, 1986.


      Comparing the dates:

      - GPS 1 was launched on February 22, 1978.

      - Mir was launched on March 19, 1986.


      Since 1978 comes before 1986, GPS 1 was indeed launched before Mir.

      after the Mir space station, I''ll need to consider two distinct timelines:
      the timeline of GPS satellite launches and the timeline of the construction
      and operation of the Mir space station.


      GPS 1:

      - The Global Positioning System (GPS) was initially developed by the U.S. Department
      of Defense.

      - The first operational GPS satellites were launched in the late 1970s.

      - The first operational GPS satellite, known as Block I, was launched on February
      22, 1978.


      Mir:

      - The Soviet Union began constructing the Mir space station in 1985.

      - The first module of Mir, named Salyut 7, was launched on February 19, 1986.

      - The space station continued to be constructed until its final module, Zvezda,
      was launched on November 15, 1996.

      - The Mir space station operated continuously from February 19, 1986, to January
      23, 2001.


      Comparing these dates:

      - The first GPS satellite (Block I) was launched in 1978.

      - The first module of Mir (Salyut 7) was launched in 1986.


      Based on this information, it''s clear that GPS 1 was launched before the Mir
      space station began construction.


      Therefore, the answer is NO. GPS 1 was not launched after Mir.'
