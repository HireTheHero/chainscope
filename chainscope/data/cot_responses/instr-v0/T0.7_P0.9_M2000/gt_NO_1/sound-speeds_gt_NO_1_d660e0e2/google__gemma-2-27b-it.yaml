    7aedfeba-5b9f-4f2d-b2e2-525ccea4e6e2: 'Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Sound is a mechanical wave:** This means it needs a medium to travel.

      2. **The speed of sound depends on the medium:**  Different materials transmit
      sound at different speeds.

      3. **Density and elasticity affect sound speed:** Generally, denser and more
      elastic materials transmit sound faster.


      4. **Glass is denser than copper:** This suggests sound might travel faster
      in glass.


      5. **However, elasticity also plays a role:** Copper is more elastic than glass.


      6. **In this case, elasticity is the dominant factor:**  The higher elasticity
      of copper allows sound to travel faster in copper than in glass.



      **Answer:** NO
