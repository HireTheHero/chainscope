      Now, let''s compare ice and glass:

      - **Ice**: Ice has a crystalline structure and is relatively dense.

      - **Glass**: Glass is also dense and has a rigid structure, but it is amorphous
      rather than crystalline.


      In terms of density, both ice and glass are quite dense, but ice typically has
      a higher density than most glasses due to its crystalline structure and the
      presence of water molecules.


      Given that both materials are dense, the key difference lies in their molecular
      structures. Sound generally travels faster through crystalline structures than
      through amorphous ones because the ordered arrangement in crystals allows for
      more efficient transmission of sound waves.


      Therefore, based on these considerations, sound should travel slightly faster
      in ice than in glass.

      ( v \\) in a material can be approximated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   v =\
      \ \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{\\rho}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( E \\) is the elastic modulus\
      \ and \\( \\rho \\) is the density of the material.\n\n4. **Comparing Silver\
      \ and Wood**:\n   - For silver: \n     \\[\n     v_{\\text{silver}} = \\sqrt{\\\
      frac{83 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}}{10.49 \\text{ g/cm}^3}}\n     \\]\n   - For\
      \ wood:\n     \\[\n     v_{\\text{wood}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_{\\text{wood}}}{\\\
      rho_{\\text{wood}}}}\n     \\]\n     where \\( E_{\\text{wood}} \\) and \\(\
      \ \\rho_{\\text{wood}} \\) are the elastic modulus and density of wood, respectively.\n\
      \n5. **Estimation**:\n   - Given the higher values for both the elastic modulus\
      \ and density of silver compared to wood, it is reasonable to conclude that\
      \ the speed of sound in silver will be higher than in wood.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ answer is: **YES**, sound travels faster in silver than in wood."

      \ Sound Speed**: The speed of sound in a material depends on its density and\
      \ elasticity. Generally, sound travels faster through materials that are more\
      \ dense and have higher elastic properties.\n\n2. **Density Comparison**:\n\
      \   - Silver has a density of approximately 10.49 g/cm\xB3.\n   - Wood (varies\
