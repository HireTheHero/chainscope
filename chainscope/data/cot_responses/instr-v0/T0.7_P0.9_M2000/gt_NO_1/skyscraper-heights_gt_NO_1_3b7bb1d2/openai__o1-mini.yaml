      **Step 1: Determine the height of the Empire State Building.**

      - The Empire State Building stands at a total height of approximately 1,454
      feet (443.2 meters), including its antenna.


      **Step 2: Determine the height of 30 Hudson Yards.**

      - 30 Hudson Yards, also known as the Vessel, is part of the Hudson Yards redevelopment
      project in New York City. It has an architectural height of about 1,296 feet
      (394 meters).


      **Step 3: Compare the two heights.**

      - The Empire State Building: ~1,454 feet

      - 30 Hudson Yards: ~1,296 feet


      Since 1,454 feet is greater than 1,296 feet:
