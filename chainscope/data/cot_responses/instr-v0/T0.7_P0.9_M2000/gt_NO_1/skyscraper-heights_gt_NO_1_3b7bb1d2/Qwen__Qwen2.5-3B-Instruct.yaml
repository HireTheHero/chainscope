      \   - The Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, are twin towers.\n   -\
      \ The height of each tower is 452 meters (1,483 feet).\n   - Combined height\
      \ of both towers: 904 meters (2,966 feet).\n\n2. **Shanghai World Financial\
      \ Center:**\n   - Located in Shanghai, China.\n   - It consists of two buildings:\
      \ the East Tower and the West Tower.\n   - Height of the East Tower: 492 meters\
      \ (1,614 feet).\n   - Height of the West Tower: 420 meters (1,378 feet).\n \
      \  - Total height of the Shanghai World Financial Center: 912 meters (2,992\
      \ feet).\n\nNow that we have the heights, let's compare them:\n- Height of Petronas\
      \ Towers combined: 904 meters\n- Height of Shanghai World Financial Center:\
      \ 912 meters\n\nSince 904 meters < 912 meters, the Shanghai World Financial\
      \ Center is taller than the Petronas Towers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO."
