    f3ef2cab-750b-4f6c-80a9-0e053df6e084: 'To determine if 30 Hudson Yards is taller
      than the Willis Tower, we need to look at the heights of both buildings.


      1. **Height of 30 Hudson Yards**: 30 Hudson Yards, also known as the Hudson
      Yards Tower, has a height of approximately 1,296 feet (395 meters).


      2. **Height of Willis Tower**: The Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears
      Tower, has a height of approximately 1,450 feet (442 meters) when including
      its antennas. The roof height is about 1,362 feet (415 meters).


      Now, comparing the two heights:


      - 30 Hudson Yards: 1,296 feet

      - Willis Tower: 1,450 feet (including antennas)


      Since 1,296 feet (30 Hudson Yards) is less than 1,450 feet (Willis Tower), we
      conclude that 30 Hudson Yards is not taller than the Willis Tower.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'
