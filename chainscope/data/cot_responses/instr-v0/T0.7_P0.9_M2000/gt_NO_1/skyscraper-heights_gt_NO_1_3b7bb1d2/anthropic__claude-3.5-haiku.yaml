      1. First, let''s find the height of the Chrysler Building:

      - The Chrysler Building is 1,046 feet (319 meters) tall

      - It was completed in 1930 and was briefly the world''s tallest building


      2. Next, let''s find the height of the Bank of America Tower:

      - The Bank of America Tower is 1,200 feet (366 meters) tall

      - It was completed in 2009


      3. Comparing the two heights:

      - Chrysler Building: 1,046 feet

      - Bank of America Tower: 1,200 feet

      - 1,200 feet is taller than 1,046 feet
