      1. **Empire State Building Height**: The Empire State Building stands at approximately

      ESB, as many buildings in the area tend to be around this size. For simplicity,
      I''ll use an average height of about 1,450 feet.


      Given these assumptions:

      - If both buildings were built to the same specifications, they would have roughly
      the same height.

      - In reality, some parts might not be visible due to different structural designs
      or other factors, but assuming full visibility and identical construction methods,
      the two buildings would likely be comparable in height.

      **YES**, the Empire State Building is typically considered to be about the same
      height as the 30 Hudson Yards.

      \ since its completion in 1930.\n\n2. **Height of the Bank of America Tower:**\n\
      \   - The height of the Bank of America Tower varies slightly depending on which\
      \ specific building you're referring to.\n   - However, it typically stands\
      \ around 541 feet (165 meters) tall.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - To compare\
      \ these two buildings, we look at their approximate heights:\n     - Chrysler\
      \ Building: 319 feet\n     - Bank of America Tower: 541 feet\n\nSince 541 feet\
      \ is greater than 319 feet, the Bank of America Tower is taller than the Chrysler\
      \ Building.\n\n**Answer:** No"
