      speed of 320 km/h (200 mph).


      Step 2: Identify the maximum speed of the ICE 3.

      The ICE 3, a high-speed train operated in Germany, has a maximum operating speed
      of 336 km/h (209 mph) under normal service conditions.

      1. **Talgo 350**: This is a high-speed train designed by the Spanish company
      Talgo. It was developed with the intention to achieve operational speeds up
      to 350 km/h (217 mph), hence its name.
