      of 4 cars as well. However, CR400 Fuxing is a high-speed train, with a top speed
      of 350 km/h (217 mph), while the ICE 3 has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph).

      2. What is the Japanese L0 Maglev? It''s a magnetic levitation train that can
      reach speeds of up to 603 km/h (375 mph), making it one of the fastest commercial
      trains in the world.

      3. To determine which train can travel faster, we need to consider the maximum
      speed of the CRH380A, which is around 350 km/h (217 mph).

      4. However, the L0 Maglev has a maximum speed of 603 km/h (375 mph), which is
      significantly higher than the CRH380A.
