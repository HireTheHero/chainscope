      combat aircraft.  The SR-71 Blackbird is a highly specialized, extremely high-speed,
      and long-range reconnaissance aircraft.  While the Typhoon can certainly reach
      supersonic speeds, the SR-71 was specifically designed for significantly higher
      sustained speeds.


      Therefore, the SR-71 Blackbird is faster.
