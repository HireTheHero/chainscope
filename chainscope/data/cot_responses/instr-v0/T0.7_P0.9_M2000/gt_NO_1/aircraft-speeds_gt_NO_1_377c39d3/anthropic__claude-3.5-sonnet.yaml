    90780bab-9fca-40b7-bc14-fce57ed59eea: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Let''s recall Concorde''s maximum speed:

      - Concorde''s maximum speed was Mach 2.04 (about 2,179 km/h or 1,354 mph)


      2) Let''s recall MiG-21''s maximum speed:

      - MiG-21''s maximum speed was Mach 2.1 (about 2,230 km/h or 1,385 mph)


      3) Comparing the speeds:

      - MiG-21: Mach 2.1

      - Concorde: Mach 2.04

      - MiG-21 is slightly faster by about 0.06 Mach


      Therefore: NO (Concorde is not faster than MiG-21)'
