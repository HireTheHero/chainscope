      While both aircraft can reach similar speeds, the MiG-21 has a slightly higher
      maximum speed compared to the Concorde.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, the Concorde is not faster than the MiG-21.'
    aa6ebea9-f937-4a62-bc52-89954bddb9b7: 'To determine if the Concorde is faster
      than the MiG-21, let''s consider their maximum speeds.


      1. **Concorde Speed**: The Concorde was a supersonic passenger jet that could
      reach a cruising speed of approximately Mach 2.04 (about 2,180 km/h or 1,355
      mph).


      2. **MiG-21 Speed**: The MiG-21 is a supersonic fighter jet capable of reaching
      a maximum speed of around Mach 2.05 (about 2,190 km/h or 1,360 mph).


      Comparing these two values:

      - Concorde: ~2,180 km/h

      - MiG-21: ~2,190 km/h


      Based on these speeds, the MiG-21 is slightly faster than the Concorde.


      **Answer**: NO'
    e81685d8-b62d-49a3-8be8-95fc572285fb: 'To answer the question "Is Concorde faster
      than MiG-21?", let''s compare their maximum speeds.


      Step 1: Identify the maximum speed of the Concorde.

      The Concorde, a supersonic passenger jet, had a maximum speed of Mach 2.04 (approximately
      2,180 km/h or 1,354 mph).


      Step 2: Identify the maximum speed of the MiG-21.

      The MiG-21, a supersonic fighter jet, has a maximum speed of Mach 2.05 (approximately
      2,190 km/h or 1,360 mph) at high altitude.


      Step 3: Compare the two speeds.

      Based on these figures, the MiG-21 has a slightly higher top speed than the
      Concorde.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Concorde faster than MiG-21?" is NO.'

      than the MiG-21, we need to compare their maximum speeds.


      Step 1: Identify the maximum speed of the Concorde.

      The Concorde, a supersonic passenger jet, had a maximum speed of Mach 2.04 (approximately
      2,180 km/h or 1,355 mph).

      Step 3: Compare the two speeds.

      While both aircraft can reach supersonic speeds, the MiG-21''s top speed slightly
      exceeds that of the Concorde.


      Conclusion: Based on the comparison of their maximum speeds, the answer to whether
      the Concorde is faster than the MiG-21 is:


      NO'
