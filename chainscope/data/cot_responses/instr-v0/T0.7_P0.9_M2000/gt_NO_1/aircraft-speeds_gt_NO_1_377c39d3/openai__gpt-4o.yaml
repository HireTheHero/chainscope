      1. **Concorde**: The Concorde is a supersonic passenger jet that was capable
      of reaching speeds up to Mach 2.04, which is approximately 1,354 miles per hour
      (2,180 kilometers per hour) at cruise altitude.


      2. **MiG-21**: The MiG-21 is a supersonic jet fighter that can reach speeds
      of up to Mach 2.05, which is approximately 1,385 miles per hour (2,230 kilometers
      per hour).
