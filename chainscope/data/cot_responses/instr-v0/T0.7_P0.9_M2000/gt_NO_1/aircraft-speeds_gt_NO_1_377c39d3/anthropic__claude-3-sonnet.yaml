      Step 1: Identify the aircraft in question.

      The F-14 Tomcat is a supersonic, twin-engine, variable-sweep wing fighter aircraft
      that was operated by the United States Navy from 1972 to 2006.

      The Eurofighter Typhoon is a twin-engine, multirole fighter aircraft designed
      and built by a consortium of European nations, including the United Kingdom,
      Germany, Italy, and Spain.


      Step 2: Compare the maximum speeds of the two aircraft.

      The F-14 Tomcat has a maximum speed of Mach 2.34 (approximately 1,544 mph or
      2,485 km/h) at high altitude.

      The Eurofighter Typhoon has a maximum speed of Mach 2.0 (approximately 1,320
      mph or 2,124 km/h) at high altitude.


      Step 3: Determine which aircraft is faster based on the maximum speeds.

      Since the F-14 Tomcat has a higher maximum speed of Mach 2.34 compared to the
      Eurofighter Typhoon''s maximum speed of Mach 2.0, it is evident that the F-14
      Tomcat is faster than the Eurofighter Typhoon.
