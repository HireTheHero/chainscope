      \   - Wolves are known for their endurance and speed. The average running speed\
      \ of a wolf is about 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), but they\
      \ can reach bursts of up to 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour) over\
      \ short distances.\n\n2. **Kangaroo's Top Speed:**\n   - Kangaroos are not as\
      \ fast as wolves. The fastest recorded speed for a kangaroo is around 35 miles\
      \ per hour (56 kilometers per hour), but they typically move at a slower pace,\
      \ especially over longer distances.\n\nComparing these speeds:\n- Wolf: 35-45\
      \ miles per hour (56-72 kilometers per hour)\n- Kangaroo: 35 miles per hour\
      \ (56 kilometers per hour)\n\nGiven this information, a wolf can indeed run\
      \ faster than a kangaroo, especially when considering the wolf's ability to\
      \ reach higher speeds in short bursts.\n\n**Answer: YES**"
