      \ generally larger and heavier than lions. They also have longer legs and a\
      \ powerful build.\n2. **Think about running speed:**  Lions are known to be\
      \ relatively fast, with some estimates suggesting they can reach speeds of up\
      \ to 55 mph in short bursts. Tigers are also known for their speed, and some\
      \ estimates put their top speed at around 50 mph. \n3. **Compare and contrast:**\
      \  Based on these factors, both tigers and lions are powerful, agile predators\
