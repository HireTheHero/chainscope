      of sodium (22.9897 g/mol).


      Step 4: Consider the atomic radii

      Generally, as you move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius
      increases due to the addition of electron shells. In this case, potassium is
      below sodium in the periodic table, meaning potassium has a larger atomic radius.


      Step 5: Evaluate the density

      Density is defined as mass per unit volume. The larger atomic radius of potassium
      compared to sodium means that potassium atoms occupy more volume. Even though
      potassium has a higher atomic mass, its larger atomic radius results in a lower
      overall density.


      Conclusion:

      Based on the comparison of atomic masses and atomic radii, potassium is not
      denser than sodium.


      Answer: NO'
    2d8af502-87ce-44b8-b362-ec08f58300b4: 'Step 1: Understand the question

      The question asks if potassium (K) is denser than sodium (Na). Density is the
      measure of mass per unit volume.


      Step 2: Recall atomic properties

      Potassium (K) and sodium (Na) are both elements found in Group 1 of the periodic
      table, also known as alkali metals. They share similar properties but differ
      in atomic mass and size.


      Step 3: Compare atomic masses

      The atomic mass of potassium is approximately 39.0983 atomic mass units (amu),
      while the atomic mass of sodium is approximately 22.9897 amu.


      Step 4: Consider atomic radii

      Since potassium has a higher atomic mass, its atomic radius is larger than that
      of sodium. A larger atomic radius generally means that the atoms are more spread
      out and thus have a lower density.


      Step 5: Evaluate density

      Due to potassium''s larger atomic radius and higher atomic mass, it is likely
      to have a lower density compared to sodium.


      Conclusion:

      Based on the reasoning above, the answer to the question "Is potassium denser
      than sodium?" is NO. Potassium is not denser than sodium.'

      The question asks whether potassium is denser than sodium. Density is a measure
      of mass per unit volume.


      Step 2: Research atomic properties of potassium and sodium

      Potassium (K) has an atomic number of 19 and an atomic weight of approximately
      39.10 atomic mass units (amu). Sodium (Na) has an atomic number of 11 and an
      atomic weight of approximately 22.99 amu.


      Step 3: Consider the effect of atomic structure on density

      Both potassium and sodium are alkali metals and have similar atomic structures
      with a single electron in their outermost shell. This electron configuration
      affects their properties, including density.


      Step 4: Compare densities

      Density can be estimated from atomic weight and atomic volume. The atomic volume
      is influenced by the atomic radius and the crystal structure of the element.
      Since both potassium and sodium are in the same group, they have similar atomic
      radii and crystal structures.


      Step 5: Analyze the results

      Although potassium has a higher atomic weight than sodium, we need to consider
      the atomic volume to determine density. Given that their atomic structures and
      crystal structures are similar, we can assume their atomic volumes are also
      comparable.


      Conclusion:

      Based on the analysis, potassium has a higher atomic weight than sodium, but

      The question is asking if lithium is denser than potassium. Density is a measure
      of mass per unit volume.

      Lithium and potassium are both elements in the alkali metal group on the periodic
      table. They are similar in some properties, but they also have some differences.


      Step 3: Compare their atomic masses and atomic radii

      Lithium (Li) has an atomic mass of approximately 6.94 g/mol and a smaller atomic

      Since both elements have similar atomic radii, the difference in density will
      be primarily due to the difference in atomic mass. Lithium, with a lower atomic
      mass, will have a smaller volume, leading to a higher density.

      Density is defined as mass per unit volume (density = mass/volume). It is a
      measure of how much matter is packed into a given space.


      Step 2: Recall the position of lithium and potassium in the periodic table

      Both lithium and potassium are alkali metals found in Group 1 of the periodic
      table. Lithium is located at the top of the group, while potassium is further
      down.


      Step 3: Consider trends in the periodic table

      In general, as you move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius
      (size) of the elements increases due to the addition of electron shells. This
      usually leads to a decrease in density, as the mass is spread over a larger
      volume.


      Step 4: Apply the trend to lithium and potassium

      Lithium, being higher up in the group, has a smaller atomic radius and hence
      a higher density compared to potassium, which has a larger atomic radius due
      to its position further down the group.


      Conclusion: Based on the periodic trend and the reasoning above, lithium is

      table. They have similar electron configurations with a single electron in their
      outermost shell.


      Step 2: Atomic mass

      The atomic mass of lithium is approximately 6.94 g/mol, while the atomic mass

      atomic radius of potassium is approximately 227 pm. Lithium has a smaller atomic
      radius compared to potassium.


      Step 4: Density calculation

      Density is calculated by dividing the atomic mass by the atomic volume. Since
