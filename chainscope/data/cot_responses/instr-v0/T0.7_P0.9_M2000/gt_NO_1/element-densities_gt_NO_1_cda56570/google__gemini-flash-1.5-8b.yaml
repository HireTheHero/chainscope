      3. Density depends on both atomic weight and atomic volume.  Without knowing
      the exact atomic volumes, we can infer that, generally, heavier elements tend
      to be denser, all other factors being equal.

      4. Zinc is heavier than chromium.


      Therefore, zinc is likely denser than chromium.
