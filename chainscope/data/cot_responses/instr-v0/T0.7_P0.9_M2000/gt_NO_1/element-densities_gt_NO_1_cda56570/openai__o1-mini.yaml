      \ Lead:** Approximately 11.34 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm\xB3).\n2. **Density\
      \ of Mercury:** Approximately 13.534 g/cm\xB3.\n\nSince mercury has a higher\
      \ density than lead, lead is **not** denser than mercury.\n\n**NO.**"
    cb6890d1-a40f-4a7c-89af-2695c8912a24: No, mercury is denser than lead.
    e857cf95-c15b-44fb-a626-5969970e5b13: "Let's determine whether lead is denser\
      \ than mercury by comparing their densities.\n\n1. **Density of Lead:**  \n\
      \   Lead has a density of approximately **11.34 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm\xB3\

      \ lead and mercury step by step:\n\n1. **Density of Lead**:\n   - Lead is a\
      \ heavy, malleable metal.\n   - Its density is approximately **11.34 grams per\
      \ cubic centimeter (g/cm\xB3)**.\n\n2. **Density of Mercury**:\n   - Mercury\
      \ is a liquid metal at room temperature.\n   - Its density is approximately\
      \ **13.6 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm\xB3)**.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n  \
      \ - When comparing the two, **13.6 g/cm\xB3 (mercury)** is greater than **11.34\
      \ g/cm\xB3 (lead)**.\n\n**Final Answer:** **NO**, lead is not denser than mercury."
