      Here are the steps:


      1. We know that potassium is an alkali metal, while sodium is a group 1 metal.

      2. Alkali metals are generally more electronegative than group 1 metals.

      3. Potassium has a higher atomic number (19) than sodium (11), which means it
      has a greater number of protons.

      4. The number of protons in an atom determines its atomic number, which in turn
      determines its chemical properties, including density.

      5. Potassium has a higher atomic number than sodium, so it must have a higher
      density.

      6. Therefore, potassium is denser than sodium.

      1. We know that density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. So, if we
      have two substances, we can compare their densities by comparing their masses
      and volumes.

      2. Tin is a metal with a relatively high atomic mass (about 118.69 g/mol). This
      means it has a lot of mass packed into a small volume.

      3. Iron is also a metal, but with a lower atomic mass (about 55.85 g/mol). This
      means it has less mass packed into a smaller volume compared to tin.

      4. To compare the densities of tin and iron, we need to know their masses. Let''s
      assume we have two samples of each metal, each with the same volume.

      5. Since tin has a higher atomic mass than iron, its mass is greater than that
      of iron. Let''s say the mass of a sample of tin is x grams and the mass of a
      sample of iron is y grams.

      6. Now, we can write the equation for density: density = mass/volume. Since
      both samples have the same volume (V), the density of each sample is the same.

      7. Let''s use the density formula to set up an equation for each sample: density_tin
      = x/V and density_iron = y/V.

      8. Since the density of each sample is the same, we can equate the two expressions:
      x/V = y/V.

      9. Simplifying this equation, we get x = y.

      10. Now, let''s compare the masses of the two samples. Since x = y, the mass
      of tin is equal to the mass of iron.

      11. This means that the volumes of tin and iron samples are also equal.

      12. Since the volumes are equal, the densities of tin and iron are equal.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**, tin is not denser than iron.

      \ of lead is approximately 11.34 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm\xB3).\n- The\
      \ density of mercury is approximately 13.546 g/cm\xB3.\n\nNow, let's compare\
      \ the densities:\n\nLead (11.34 g/cm\xB3) is less dense than mercury (13.546\

    f5228582-32fc-4948-bc03-fa8d1affd252: "A classic question with a clear answer.\n\
      \nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We need to compare the densities\
      \ of lead and mercury. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. So, we need\
      \ to know the masses and volumes of both substances.\n2. The atomic masses of\
      \ lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) are:\n\t* Lead: 207.2 g/mol\n\t* Mercury: 200.6\
      \ g/mol\n3. The molar volumes of lead and mercury are:\n\t* Lead: 19.27 cm\xB3\
      /mol (using Avogadro's number and the molar mass of lead)\n\t* Mercury: 23.45\
      \ cm\xB3/mol (using Avogadro's number and the molar mass of mercury)\n4. Now,\
      \ we can calculate the densities:\n\t* Lead density: 207.2 g/mol / 19.27 cm\xB3\
      /mol \u2248 10.7 g/cm\xB3\n\t* Mercury density: 200.6 g/mol / 23.45 cm\xB3/mol\
      \ \u2248 8.6 g/cm\xB3\n5. Comparing the densities, we can see that lead is indeed\
      \ denser than mercury.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: YES"
    fbdaefc9-e329-457c-8d85-b152b7dc686f: "To determine whether lead is denser than\
      \ mercury, I will break down the process into steps. Here's the reasoning:\n\
      \n1. Recall that density is defined as mass per unit volume. The formula for\
      \ density is:\n\ndensity = mass / volume\n\n2. The molar mass of lead (Pb) is\
      \ 207.2 g/mol. This is the mass of one mole of lead.\n\n3. The molar mass of\
      \ mercury (Hg) is 200.6 g/mol.\n\n4. To compare the densities of lead and mercury,\
      \ we need to know their respective volumes. The molar volume of a substance\
      \ is the volume occupied by one mole of that substance.\n\n5. Mercury has a\
      \ relatively small molar volume (approximately 22.4 liters per mole) because\
      \ it has a high atomic mass. Lead, on the other hand, has a relatively large\
      \ molar volume (approximately 25.5 liters per mole) because it has a lower atomic\
      \ mass.\n\n6. Using the molar volumes, we can calculate the densities of lead\
      \ and mercury:\n\nLead density = 207.2 g/mol / 25.5 liters/mol \u2248 8.08 g/L\n\
      Mercury density = 200.6 g/mol / 22.4 liters/mol \u2248 8.91 g/L\n\n7. Comparing\
      \ the densities, we can see that lead is indeed denser than mercury, with a\
      \ density of approximately 8.08 g/L compared to mercury's 8.91 g/L.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer is: YES"
