      Step 1: Recall the atomic masses of potassium (K) and sodium (Na).

      - Potassium has an atomic mass of approximately 39.10 amu.

      - Sodium has an atomic mass of approximately 22.99 amu.


      Step 2: Consider the electron configurations.

      - Sodium (Na): [Ne] 3s^1

      - Potassium (K): [Ar] 4s^1


      Step 3: Analyze the ionization energies.

      - Sodium''s outermost electron is in the 3s orbital, which is relatively close
      to the nucleus.

      - Potassium''s outermost electron is in the 4s orbital, which is farther from
      the nucleus compared to sodium.


      Step 4: Determine the effect on density based on these factors.

      - Since potassium''s outermost electron is in a higher energy level (4s), it
      is less tightly bound to the nucleus.

      - This makes potassium atoms more loosely packed when forming solid compounds,
      leading to a lower density compared to sodium atoms.

      No, potassium is not denser than sodium. Sodium is denser than potassium.'
