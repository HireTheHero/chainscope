      \ of a substance, given by the formula \\( \\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\\
      text{Volume}} \\).\n\n2. **Common Knowledge**:\n   - Lead (Pb) has a density\
      \ of approximately 11.34 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm\xB3).\n   - Mercury\
      \ (Hg) has a density of approximately 13.53 g/cm\xB3.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n\
      \   - Compare the densities: 11.34 g/cm\xB3 (lead) vs. 13.53 g/cm\xB3 (mercury).\n\
