      Step 2: Determine the densities of the solid elements.

      The density of a solid element is directly proportional to its atomic weight.
      Heavier atoms generally result in denser solids.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic weights of lithium and potassium.

      Potassium has a significantly higher atomic weight than lithium (39.10 g/mol
      vs. 6.94 g/mol).


      Step 4: Conclude based on the comparison.

      Since potassium has a higher atomic weight, it is expected to have a higher
      density in its solid form compared to lithium.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, lithium is not denser than potassium.'
