      1. **Atomic Number**: Chromium (Cr) has an atomic number of 24, while tin (Sn)

      (ccp) structures similar to each other. However, due to differences in electronegativity
      between the two elements, the arrangement within these ccp structures might
      slightly differ, but the overall packing efficiency remains similar.

      1. **Atomic Structure**: Aluminum has an atomic number of 13, which means it
      has 13 protons in its nucleus. Zinc has an atomic number of 30, meaning it has
      30 protons.


      2. **Density Properties**: Generally, metals with more protons (or electrons)
      tend to have higher densities due to stronger nuclear forces holding their atoms

      be denser than aluminum. However, this is not always the case as there can be
      exceptions based on specific conditions such as pressure or temperature affecting
      crystal structures.


      Given these points:

      - Zinc typically has a slightly higher density compared to aluminum because
      of its additional protons.

      2. **Comparison Method**:\n   - First, find the density of each substance:\n\
      \     - Lead has a density of approximately \\( 11.34 \\) g/cm\xB3.\n     -\
      \ Mercury has a density of approximately \\( 13.53 \\) g/cm\xB3.\n   - Next,\
