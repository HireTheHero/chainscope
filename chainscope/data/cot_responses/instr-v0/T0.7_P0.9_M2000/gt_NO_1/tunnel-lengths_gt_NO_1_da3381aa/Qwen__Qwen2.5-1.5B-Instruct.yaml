      \ It was completed in 2009 and consists of two tunnels:\n   - The north tunnel\
      \ runs from Chippa Point in the inner west to Pyrmont Island in the western\

    520e78ea-1fc8-4839-b806-254c350ea9f7: 'To determine if the Sydney Harbour Tunnel

      1. **Sydney Harbour Tunnel**: This tunnel connects Sydney''s central business
      district to the northern suburbs via the harbour. Its length can vary depending
      on the specific route used but generally ranges from about 25 km (16 miles)
      for the shorter route to around 30 km (19 miles) for the longer route.


      2. **Lincoln Tunnel**: Located in New Jersey, United States, this tunnel connects
      the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to Newark Liberty International
      Airport. The tunnel has a consistent length of approximately 4.8 kilometers
      (about 3 miles).


      Comparing these two values:

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel typically ranges between 25 km and 30 km.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is exactly 4.8 km long.


      Given that 4.8 km is less than both possible ranges for the Sydney Harbour Tunnel,
      we can conclude that the Lincoln Tunnel is indeed longer than the Sydney Harbour
      Tunnel.

      1. **Eisenhower Tunnel**: This tunnel connects Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United
      States, to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States. Its length can vary depending
      on the specific route chosen but typically ranges from 45 miles (72 km) to 60
      miles (97 km).


      2. **Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line**: This underwater rail line runs between Shinagawa
      Station in Tokyo, Japan, and Yokohama Station in Yokohama, Japan. The distance
      covered by this train is approximately 38 kilometers (23 miles), which includes
      both the land-based and water portions of its journey.


      Comparing these two:

      - The Eisenhower Tunnel has a significant range of lengths based on different

      - The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line covers an exact 38 kilometers (23 miles), which is
      shorter than the maximum possible length for the Eisenhower Tunnel.
