      \n1. **Identify the lengths of both structures:**\n   - The **Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line**\
      \ is a bridge-tunnel complex that connects Chiba Prefecture to the Odaiba area\
      \ in Tokyo. It consists of a 4.3-kilometer-long tunnel and a 2.6-kilometer-long\
      \ bridge. Therefore, the total length is \\(4.3 + 2.6 = 6.9\\) kilometers.\n\
      \   - The **Mont Blanc Tunnel** is a road tunnel that runs under the Mont Blanc\
      \ massif between France and Italy. Its total length is approximately 10.78 kilometers.\n\
      \n2. **Compare the lengths:**\n   - Length of Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line: 6.9 kilometers\n\
      \   - Length of Mont Blanc Tunnel: 10.78 kilometers\n\nSince 6.9 kilometers\
      \ is less than 10.78 kilometers, the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is not longer than\
