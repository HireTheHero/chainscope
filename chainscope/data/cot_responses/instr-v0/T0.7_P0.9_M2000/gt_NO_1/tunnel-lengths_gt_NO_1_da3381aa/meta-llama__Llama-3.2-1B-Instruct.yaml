      NO answer.


      To determine whether the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is longer than the Lincoln Tunnel,
      I''ll analyze the information step by step:


      1. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is a 1.7 km (1.06 mi) long tunnel that runs underneath
      Sydney Harbour.

      2. The Lincoln Tunnel is a 3.1 km (1.96 mi) long tunnel that runs underneath
      Manhattan in New York City.


      Comparing the two, we can see that the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is significantly
      shorter than the Lincoln Tunnel.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is not longer than
      the Lincoln Tunnel.'

      the lengths of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line and the Mont Blanc Tunnel.


      Step 1: Determine the lengths of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line and the Mont Blanc

      - The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is approximately 8.9 kilometers (5.6 miles) long.

      - The Mont Blanc Tunnel is approximately 12.9 kilometers (8 miles) long.


      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line and the Mont Blanc Tunnel.


      - Since 8.9 km is less than 12.9 km, the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is shorter than
      the Mont Blanc Tunnel.


      Step 3: Give a YES or NO answer.
