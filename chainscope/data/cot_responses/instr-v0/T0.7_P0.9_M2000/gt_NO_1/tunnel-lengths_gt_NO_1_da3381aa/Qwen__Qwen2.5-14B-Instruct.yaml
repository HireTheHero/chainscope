      Gotthard Base Line project which includes rail tunnels. However, the Gotthard

      Step 3: Comparing the two:

      - St. Gotthard Road Tunnel (Monte Ceneri section): ~17 km

      - Simplon Tunnel: 19.844 km


      The Simplon Tunnel is longer than the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel (Monte Ceneri
