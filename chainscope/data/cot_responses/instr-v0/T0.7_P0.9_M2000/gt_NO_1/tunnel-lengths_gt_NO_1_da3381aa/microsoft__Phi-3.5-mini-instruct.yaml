      To answer this question, we need to know the lengths of the St. Gotthard Road
      Tunnel and the Simplon Tunnel.


      The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, located in Switzerland, is approximately 15.7
      kilometers (9.8 miles) long.


      The Simplon Tunnel, also located in Switzerland, is approximately 19.8 kilometers

      Step 2: Compare the lengths

      Now that we have the lengths of both tunnels, we can compare them to determine
      which one is longer.


      The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is 15.7 kilometers long, while the Simplon Tunnel
      is 19.8 kilometers long.


      Step 3: Answer the question

      Since 15.7 kilometers (the length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel) is shorter
      than 19.8 kilometers (the length of the Simplon Tunnel), we can conclude that
      the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is not longer than the Simplon Tunnel.
