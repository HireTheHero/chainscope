      the Hudson River, connecting Jersey City, New Jersey, to Lower Manhattan in
      New York City. It also consists of two tubes. The Holland Tunnel is approximately
      2.5 miles (4 kilometers) long, similar to the Lincoln Tunnel.


      Given these lengths, both tunnels are roughly the same length, approximately
      2.5 miles (4 kilometers) each. Therefore, when comparing their lengths directly:
