      Step 1: Identify the Sydney Harbour Tunnel and its length.

      The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is a tunnel in Sydney, Australia, that runs beneath
      Sydney Harbour. It is 3.8 kilometers (2.4 miles) long.


      Step 2: Identify the Lincoln Tunnel and its length.

      The Lincoln Tunnel is a tunnel that connects New Jersey and New York City, running
      under the Hudson River. It is approximately 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is 3.8 kilometers long, while the Lincoln Tunnel is
      2.5 kilometers long.


      Step 4: Determine the answer based on the comparison.

      Since 3.8 kilometers is greater than 2.5 kilometers, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel
      is longer than the Lincoln Tunnel.


      Therefore, the answer is:
