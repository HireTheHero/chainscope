      is longer than the Lincoln Tunnel, we need to compare their lengths.


      Step 1: Find the length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is approximately 3.6 kilometers (2.2 miles) long.


      Step 2: Find the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel is approximately 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) long.

      Step 1: Determine the length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is approximately 1.6 km (0.99 miles) long.


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

      - The Lincoln Tunnel has three tubes, but when considering its length as a single
      passage from one end to the other, it is about 3.5 km (2.2 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the two lengths.

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is shorter than the Lincoln Tunnel.

      Step 1: Identify the length of the Chunnel Service Tunnel.

      The Channel Tunnel (Chunnel) consists of three tunnels: two for rail traffic
      and one service tunnel between them. The total length of the tunnel system is
      about 50.5 kilometers (31.4 miles). However, since the question specifies the
      service tunnel, we should note that the service tunnel runs parallel to the
      other two tunnels for much of the route but is shorter in total length as it
      does not extend the full distance in some sections. For precise comparison,
      we consider the overall length of the tunnel system which includes the service
      tunnel.
