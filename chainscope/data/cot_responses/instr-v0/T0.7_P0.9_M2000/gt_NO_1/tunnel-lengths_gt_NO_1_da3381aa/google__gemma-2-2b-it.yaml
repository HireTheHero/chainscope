      \ **What is the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line?** It's a bridge-tunnel complex that spans\
      \ Tokyo Bay.\n2. **What is the Mont Blanc Tunnel?** It's a road tunnel under\
      \ the Alps.\n3. **Comparing Lengths:**  To compare lengths, we need to know\
      \ the distance of each structure. \n4. **Availability of Information:**  We\
      \ can't easily find the exact lengths of these structures without searching.\
      \ \n\n\n**Therefore, we can't answer \"YES\" or \"NO\" definitively.** \n\n\
      **To get the correct answer, you would need to find the lengths of both structures\
      \ and compare them.** \n"
