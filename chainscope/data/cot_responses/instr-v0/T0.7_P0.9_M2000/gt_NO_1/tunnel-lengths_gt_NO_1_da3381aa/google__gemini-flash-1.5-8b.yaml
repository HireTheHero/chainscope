    212ef845-00cb-44fd-947d-364d383af3d2: '1. The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a bridge-tunnel
      combination.  Its length is approximately 13 kilometers.


      2. The Mont Blanc Tunnel is a road tunnel. Its length is approximately 11.6
      kilometers.


      3. Comparing the lengths, 13 kilometers is greater than 11.6 kilometers.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      complex.

      2. The Mont Blanc Tunnel is a tunnel.

      3.  Information about the lengths of these structures is needed to compare.

      4.  A quick search reveals the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is approximately 11 km long.

      5.  The Mont Blanc Tunnel is approximately 11.6 km long.


      Therefore, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is slightly longer.

      combination.

      2. The Mont Blanc Tunnel is a tunnel.

      3.  I need to find the lengths of both.

      4.  A quick search reveals the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is approximately 13.3 km
      long.

      5.  The Mont Blanc Tunnel is approximately 11.6 km long.


      6.  13.3 km is longer than 11.6 km.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      and tunnel complex.

      2. The Mont Blanc Tunnel is a tunnel.

      3.  Comparing lengths requires knowing the lengths of each.

      4.  Researching the lengths:  The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is approximately 11 km.  The
      Mont Blanc Tunnel is approximately 11.6 km.


      5.  11 km is shorter than 11.6 km.

    661d0ca4-5630-409f-9aeb-dff8714d72f3: '1. The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a bridge.

      2. The Mont Blanc Tunnel is a tunnel.

      3. Bridges are typically longer than tunnels of similar purpose (connecting
      two points).

      4.  The Aqua-Line connects points across Tokyo Bay.

      5. The Mont Blanc Tunnel connects points through the Alps.


      Considering the general principles of bridge and tunnel construction, and the
      fact that the Aqua-Line likely covers a longer distance, the Aqua-Line is likely
      longer.


      NO.
