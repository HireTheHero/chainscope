      Tunnel is longer than the Seikan Tunnel, let''s follow these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the Chunnel Service Tunnel and its length.

      The Chunnel Service Tunnel is part of the Channel Tunnel, which connects Folkestone,
      England, to Coquelles, France, beneath the English Channel. The total length
      of the Channel Tunnel is 50.45 km (31.35 miles), consisting of two running tunnels
      and one service tunnel.


      Step 2: Identify the Seikan Tunnel and its length.

      The Seikan Tunnel is a railway tunnel in Japan, connecting the islands of Honshu
      and Hokkaido beneath the Tsugaru Strait. It is 53.85 km (33.46 miles) long,
      making it the longest underwater tunnel in the world.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the Chunnel Service Tunnel and the Seikan Tunnel.

      The Chunnel Service Tunnel is part of the 50.45 km long Channel Tunnel, which
      is shorter than the Seikan Tunnel''s length of 53.85 km.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      NO, the Chunnel Service Tunnel is not longer than the Seikan Tunnel.'

      Tunnel is longer than the Seikan Tunnel, let''s break down the problem into
      steps:


      Step 1: Identify the Chunnel Service Tunnel and its length.

      The Chunnel, also known as the Channel Tunnel, is a 50.45 km (31.35 miles) rail
      tunnel linking Folkestone, Kent, in the United Kingdom, with Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais,
      near Calais in northern France, beneath the English Channel. The Chunnel consists
      of three tunnels: two rail tunnels and a service tunnel. The service tunnel
      is located between the two rail tunnels and is used for maintenance and emergency
      purposes.


      Step 2: Identify the Seikan Tunnel and its length.

      The Seikan Tunnel is a 53.85 km (33.46 miles) railway tunnel in Japan, with
      a 23.3 km (14.5 miles) long portion under the seabed. It connects the islands
      of Honshu and Hokkaido.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the Chunnel Service Tunnel and the Seikan Tunnel.

      The Chunnel Service Tunnel is part of the overall Chunnel structure, which has
      a total length of 50.45 km (31.35 miles). On the other hand, the Seikan Tunnel
      has a total length of 53.85 km (33.46 miles).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison.

      Since the Seikan Tunnel (53.85 km) is longer than the entire Chunnel structure
      (50.45 km), which includes the service tunnel, it can be concluded that the
      Seikan Tunnel is also longer than the Chunnel Service Tunnel.


      Final answer: NO, the Chunnel Service Tunnel is not longer than the Seikan Tunnel.'
