      1. The Eisenhower Tunnel is a road tunnel located in Colorado, USA.

      2. The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a bridge-tunnel complex that connects the city
      of Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture to the Kisarazu area of Chiba Prefecture
      in Japan.

      3. To determine which one is longer, we need to compare the lengths of the two
      structures.
