    d05db300-046f-41f1-a3e5-547d740ebad6: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall the length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel:

      - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is 16.9 kilometers (10.5 miles) long


      2. Now, let me recall the length of the Simplon Tunnel:

      - The Simplon Tunnel is 19.8 kilometers (12.3 miles) long


      3. Comparing the two lengths:

      - Simplon: 19.8 km

      - St. Gotthard: 16.9 km

      - 19.8 km > 16.9 km


      Therefore, NO - the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is not longer than the Simplon
      Tunnel.'

      1. First, let me recall the lengths of both tunnels:

      - St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is 16.9 km (16,942 meters) long

      - Simplon Tunnel is 19.8 km (19,823 meters) long


      2. To compare:

      19.8 km > 16.9 km

      The Simplon Tunnel is approximately 2.9 km longer than the St. Gotthard Road
      Tunnel


      3. The question asks if St. Gotthard is longer than Simplon

      Since Simplon is actually the longer one, St. Gotthard cannot be longer


      Answer: NO'
