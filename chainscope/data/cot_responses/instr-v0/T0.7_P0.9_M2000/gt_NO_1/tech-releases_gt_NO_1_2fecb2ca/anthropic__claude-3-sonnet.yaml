      The Sony PlayStation was released in Japan before Windows 95 (December 1994
      vs August 1995).

      However, the PlayStation was released in North America after Windows 95 (September
      1995 vs August 1995).


      Step 4: Decide on the answer based on the question.

      The question asks if the PlayStation was released after Windows 95, without
      specifying a region.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO, the Sony PlayStation was not released after Microsoft Windows 95, as it
      was released in Japan before Windows 95.'
