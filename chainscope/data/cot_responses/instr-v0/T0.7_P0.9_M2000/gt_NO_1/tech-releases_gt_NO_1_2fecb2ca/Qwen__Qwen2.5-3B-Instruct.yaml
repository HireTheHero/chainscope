      The Nintendo Game Boy was released in Japan on July 15, 1989, and internationally
      in 1990.


      Step 2: Identify the release date of the Sony PlayStation.

      The Sony PlayStation was first released in Japan on March 4, 1994, and later
      in North America on October 26, 1994.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Nintendo Game Boy: July 15, 1989

      - Sony PlayStation: March 4, 1994


      Since the Sony PlayStation''s release date (March 4, 1994) is after the Nintendo
      Game Boy''s release date (July 15, 1989), we can conclude that the Nintendo
      Game Boy was indeed released before the Sony PlayStation.

      Step 1: Determine the release date of the Motorola DynaTAC.

      The Motorola DynaTAC (which stands for "Dynamic Adaptive Transceiver") was the
      first commercially successful handheld mobile phone. It was introduced in 1983.


      Step 2: Determine the release date of the Apple Macintosh.

      The original Apple Macintosh computer was released on January 24, 1984. However,
      it''s worth noting that a previous prototype called the Apple Lisa had been
      released earlier, but the full-featured Macintosh was released in 1984.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      The Motorola DynaTAC was released in 1983, while the Apple Macintosh was released
      in 1984.


      Based on this information, we can conclude that the Motorola DynaTAC was indeed
      released before the Apple Macintosh.

      Step 1: Identify the release date of the Commodore 64.

      - The Commodore 64 was officially announced on July 17, 1982, but it became
      available to the public on January 23, 1982.


      Step 2: Identify the release date of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).
