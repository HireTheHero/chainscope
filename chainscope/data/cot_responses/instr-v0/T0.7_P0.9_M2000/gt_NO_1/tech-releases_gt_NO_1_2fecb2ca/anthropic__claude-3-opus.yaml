      computers and helped popularize home computing.


      2. The VHS (Video Home System) format was developed by JVC (Victor Company of

      the Apple II.


      Given this information, the answer to the question "Was the VHS Player released

      Step 2: Determine the release year of the VHS Player.

      The VHS (Video Home System) format was developed by JVC and released in Japan

      United States until the late 1970s, which is after the release of the Apple
