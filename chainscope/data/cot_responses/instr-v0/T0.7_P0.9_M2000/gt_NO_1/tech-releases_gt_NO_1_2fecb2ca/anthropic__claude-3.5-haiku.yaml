      2. Next, let''s determine the release date of Windows 95:

      3. Comparing the dates:

      - The PlayStation was first released in Japan in December 1994

      - The PlayStation''s North American release was in September 1995, which is

      4. Therefore, the PlayStation was released both before (in Japan) and after

      - Xerox Alto: 1973


      4. Since the Polaroid SX-70 was released in 1972, and the Xerox Alto was released
      in 1973, the Polaroid SX-70 came BEFORE the Xerox Alto.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      - The original Apple Macintosh was released on January 24, 1984


      2. Next, let''s determine the release date of the Nintendo Entertainment System
      (NES):

      - The NES was first released in Japan in 1983 (as the Famicom)

      - It was released in North America on October 18, 1985

      - The Apple Macintosh was released in 1984

      - The NES was released in 1983 (in Japan) and 1985 (in North America)

      - Even using the North American release date, the NES came out after the Macintosh
