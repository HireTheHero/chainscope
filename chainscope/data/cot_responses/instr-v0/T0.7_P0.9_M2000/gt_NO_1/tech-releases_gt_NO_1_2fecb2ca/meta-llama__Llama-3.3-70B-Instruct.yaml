      first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. It was released in
      June 1977.


      2. **Identify the release year of the VHS Player**: The VHS (Video Home System)
      player was a home video format developed by JVC. The first VHS player, the JVC
      HR-3300, was released in Japan on October 31, 1976, and later in the United
      States in August 1977, but initially under the name "Video Home System" without
      the VHS acronym.


      3. **Compare the release years**: The Apple II was released in June 1977, and
      the first VHS player was released in October 1976 in Japan, but it was also
      made available in the United States in August 1977. Since the initial release
      of the VHS player was before the release of the Apple II, even though both were
      made available in the U.S. market in 1977, the VHS player''s initial release
      was earlier.
