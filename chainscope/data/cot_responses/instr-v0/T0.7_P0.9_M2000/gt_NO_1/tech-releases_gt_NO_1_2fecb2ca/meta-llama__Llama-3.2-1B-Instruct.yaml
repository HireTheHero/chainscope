      To answer this question, I''ll follow the steps:


      1. Identify the key pieces of information: VHS Player and Apple II.

      2. Look for any possible relationships or connections between the two.

      3. Determine the logical outcome of these relationships.

      4. Provide a yes or no answer based on the outcome.


      After considering these steps, I conclude that the answer is... YES!

      * The VHS Player is a type of home video game console.

      * The Apple II is a popular personal computer released in the 1970s and 1980s.

      * The Apple II was widely used in the 1970s and 1980s, which means it was likely
      released in the late 1970s or early 1980s.
