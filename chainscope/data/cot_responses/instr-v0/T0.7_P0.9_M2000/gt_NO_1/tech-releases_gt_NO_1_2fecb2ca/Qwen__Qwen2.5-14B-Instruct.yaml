      was first publicly demonstrated on June 5, 1977, at the Consumer Electronics
      Show in Chicago. It began to be commercially available later that year.

      - The Apple II was released in April 1977.

      - The VHS player was publicly demonstrated in June 1977 and became commercially
      available shortly thereafter.


      Therefore, the VHS player was indeed released after the Apple II.

      1. **Xerox Alto**: The Xerox Alto was developed in 1973 but was primarily used
      as a research tool within Xerox until its commercialization started around the
      mid-1970s. It was officially introduced in 1973 but became more widely known
      through various research and development projects throughout the late 1970s.


      2. **VHS Player**: The VHS (Video Home System) format was introduced by JVC
      (Victor Company of Japan) in 1976. The first VHS players were available on the
      market shortly after that year.


      Given these timelines:

      - The initial development and introduction of the Xerox Alto began in 1973.

      American release came after Windows 95 had already been released.

      global market focus for such comparisons typically considers the first major
