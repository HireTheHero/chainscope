      Since the question asks whether the NES was released after the Macintosh, we
      need to consider the release in North America, as that is when it would be relevant
      to a direct comparison.


      Therefore, since the NES was released in North America in 1985, after the Macintosh''s
      release in 1984, the answer to the question is:


      **YES**.'
