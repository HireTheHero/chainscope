      Comparing the dates:


      - Apple Macintosh: January 1984

      - NES (Japan): July 1983

      - NES (North America): October 1985


      Since the NES was released in Japan before the Macintosh but in North America
      after the Macintosh, the answer depends on the region in question.


      Assuming we''re referring to the North American release dates:


      **Yes**, the Nintendo Entertainment System was released after the Apple Macintosh
      in North America.'
