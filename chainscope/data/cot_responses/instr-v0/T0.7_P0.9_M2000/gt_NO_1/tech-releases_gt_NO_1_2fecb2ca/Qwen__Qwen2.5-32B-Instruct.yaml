    3d8a8794-87da-40cc-8dc8-c13626d27bee: 'To answer this question accurately, let''s
      first determine the release dates of both products.


      1. The Sony PlayStation was released in Japan on December 3, 1994. It was then
      released in North America in September 1995, followed by Europe and Australia
      in late 1995.

      2. Microsoft Windows 95 was launched on August 24, 1995.


      Given these dates, the Sony PlayStation was initially released before Microsoft
      Windows 95 in Japan (December 3, 1994). However, when considering its global
      availability, particularly in North America where it came out in September 1995,
      the North American launch was after the release of Microsoft Windows 95 (August
      24, 1995).


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Was the Sony PlayStation released after
      the Microsoft Windows 95?" is:


      NO


      This is based on the global availability timeline, focusing on the North American
      market, which is often considered a primary market for such comparisons.'

      1. The Sony PlayStation was released in Japan on December 3, 1994.

      2. Microsoft Windows 95 was launched worldwide on August 24, 1995.


      Since the Sony PlayStation was released in late 1994 and Microsoft Windows 95

      the PlayStation came out after Windows 95.
