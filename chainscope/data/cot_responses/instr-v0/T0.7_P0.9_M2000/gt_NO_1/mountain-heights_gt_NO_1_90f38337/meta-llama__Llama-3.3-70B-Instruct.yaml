      5. **Conclusion**: Given that 4,810 meters (the height of Mont Blanc) is less
      than 5,642 meters (the height of Mount Elbrus), we can conclude that Mont Blanc
      is not higher than Mount Elbrus.


      The answer is: NO'

      the border between France and Italy, is known for being the highest peak in
      the Alps. Its height is approximately 4,810 meters (15,781 feet) above sea level.


      2. **Identify the height of Mount Elbrus**: Mount Elbrus, situated in the Caucasus
      mountain range in Russia, is recognized as the highest peak in both Europe and
      the Caucasus. Its height is approximately 5,642 meters (18,510 feet) above sea
      level.


      3. **Compare the heights**: Now, we compare the heights of the two mountains.
      Mont Blanc stands at about 4,810 meters, while Mount Elbrus stands at about
      5,642 meters.


      Based on the comparison, since 4,810 meters (the height of Mont Blanc) is less
