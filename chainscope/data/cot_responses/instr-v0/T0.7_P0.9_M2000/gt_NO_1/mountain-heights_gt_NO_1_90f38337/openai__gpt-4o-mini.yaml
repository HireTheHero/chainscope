      higher than Mont Blanc, we need to look at the elevations of both mountains.


      1. **Elevation of Mont Blanc**: Mont Blanc, located in the Alps, is the highest
      mountain in Western Europe, with an elevation of approximately 4,808 meters
      (15,774 feet).


      2. **Elevation of The Matterhorn**: The Matterhorn, also located in the Alps,

      - Mount Elbrus: 5,642 meters


      Since 5,642 meters (Mount Elbrus) is greater than 4,808 meters (Mont Blanc),
      we conclude that Mont Blanc is not higher than Mount Elbrus.
