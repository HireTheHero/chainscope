      - Mount Kilimanjaro is 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level

      - Mount Denali is 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level


      2. To compare them, I''ll use the same unit (meters):

      - Kilimanjaro: 5,895 m

      - Denali: 6,190 m


      3. 6,190 is greater than 5,895

      - Therefore, Denali is higher than Kilimanjaro by 295 meters


      NO (Mount Kilimanjaro is not higher than Mount Denali)'
