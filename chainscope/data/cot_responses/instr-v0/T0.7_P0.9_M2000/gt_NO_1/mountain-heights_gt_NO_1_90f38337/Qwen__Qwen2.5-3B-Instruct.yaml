      6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Compare the two elevations.

      6,190 meters (Mount Denali) > 5,895 meters (Mount Kilimanjaro)


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Mount Kilimanjaro higher than Mount
      Denali?" is:

      NO'
    d920e0b6-f8be-4da3-a7db-ddb89f04ca7c: 'To determine if Mount Kilimanjaro is higher

      1. Identify the current elevations of both mountains.

      2. Compare the elevations.


      Step 1: Identifying the Current Elevations


      Mount Kilimanjaro:

      - The highest peak is Uhuru Peak, which has an elevation of approximately 5,895
      meters (19,341 feet) above sea level.


      Mount Denali:

      - The summit of Mount Denali is about 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level.


      Step 2: Comparing the Elevations


      Comparing these two values:

      - Mount Kilimanjaro: 5,895 meters

      - Mount Denali: 6,190 meters


      Since 6,190 meters is greater than 5,895 meters, Mount Denali is taller than
      Mount Kilimanjaro.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Mount Kilimanjaro higher than Mount
      Denali?" is:
