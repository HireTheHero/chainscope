      following information:

      1. Mount Everest''s elevation: It stands at 8,848 meters above sea level.

      2. The Matterhorn''s elevation: It stands at 3,540 meters above sea level.


      To find the difference in their elevations, we can subtract the lower elevation
      from the higher one:

      3,540 meters - 8,848 meters = -5,308 meters


      Since the result is negative, it means that the Matterhorn is actually lower

    97bb4e8d-c107-4b19-ad7d-81d292f089b2: YES. The Matterhorn, located in the Swiss
      Alps, is indeed higher than Mont Blanc (also known as Mount Everest), which
      stands at 8, 840 meters above sea level. The Matterhorn reaches an elevation
      of approximately 5, 192 meters, while Mont Blanc's peak sits at about 4, 861
      meters. Therefore, the Matterhorn does exceed Mont Blanc's height.
    ac76f4db-d79c-4da9-b5fc-7c5ae11cd256: Yes. The Matterhorn stands at 4, 891 meters
      (16,037 feet) above sea level, while Mont Blanc, also known as the Aiguille
      des Jominhons in French, rises to 4, 810 meters (15,720 feet). Therefore, it's
      accurate that the Matterhorn is indeed higher than Mont Blanc.

    77255b2c-6d70-4e5e-84e7-2f2944d6bca6: YES. The Matterhorn is located in the Swiss
      Alps, while Mount Whitney is situated in California, United States. Therefore,
      Mount Whitney is higher than The Matterhorn.
    808e67d2-bd50-4e43-b02e-01c682a9ea36: 'To determine whether Mount Whitney is higher

      2. Geographical context: Mountains typically have significant elevations in
      their respective areas.

      3. Climbing difficulty: While both mountains offer challenging climbs, there''s
      no information about any known climbing routes that would make one potentially
      higher than another.


      Given these points, it would be impossible to definitively compare the heights
      of Mount Whitney and The Matterhorn without knowing more details such as elevation
      measurements, potential climbing routes, or specific geographical contexts.

    89e5f4de-5cc7-42c7-a88e-5cd174b24fa6: Yes, Mount Whitney (also known as the Whitney
      Peak) is generally considered to be higher than The Matterhorn. The Matterhorn
      in Austria is located in Switzerland and has been standing at 2,387 meters (7,591
      feet) since its creation in 1864. On the other hand, Mount Whitney stands at
      2,064 meters (6,777 feet) above sea level in California. Therefore, based on
      this information, it can be concluded that Mount Whitney is indeed higher than
      The Matterhorn.
    aa32d248-314f-45a4-b0fa-63426c00b6b7: Yes, Mount Whitney (also known as the Denali
      in some countries) is indeed higher than The Matterhorn. Both mountains are
      located in the United States and both have a height range that makes them distinguishable
      from each other based on their elevation above sea level. Therefore, it's accurate
      to say that Mount Whitney is higher than The Matterhorn.
    bbe3fd36-8651-40b5-833b-42d7bcbdfac3: "To determine whether Mount Whitney is higher\

    eb8b4508-aaba-4577-8daf-26928fb8686f: YES. Mount Whitney (also known as the Vinson
      Massif) is indeed higher than The Matterhorn in terms of elevation. The Matterhorn,
      located in Switzerland, reaches an altitude of around 3,540 meters above sea
      level, while Mount Whitney stands at 21,094 feet (6,411 meters) high. This difference
      in elevation makes Mount Whitney the highest peak in the Alps.
    f0623260-75f9-4c25-af4e-488de380b884: YES. Mount Whitney is approximately 14,
      590 feet (4, 426 meters) higher than the Matterhorn in Switzerland.
    f081f730-cdc1-455d-bb99-7db68d822cef: YES. Mount Whitney, located in California's
      Sierra Nevada mountains, is indeed higher than the Matterhorn in Switzerland.
      Mount Whitney stands at an elevation of 3,520 meters (11, 841 feet) above sea
      level, while the Matterhorn reaches an elevation of 4,611 meters (15, 679 feet).
    f9f0934f-c444-4fd9-9568-644b76b07805: 'Yes. To determine the relative height between
      Mount Whitney and The Matterhorn, we need to compare their elevations in kilometers.


      1. **Mount Whitney**: This mountain stands at an elevation of 4,370 meters (14,429
      feet) above sea level.

      2. **The Matterhorn**: This mountain sits at an elevation of 5,895 meters (19,346
      feet) above sea level.


      To find out which one is higher:

      - Compare 4,370 meters (14,429 feet) to 5,895 meters (19,346 feet).


      By subtracting the smaller elevation from the larger one:

      \[ 14,429 \text{ feet} - 5,895 \text{ feet} = 8,534 \text{ feet} \]


      So, Mount Whitney is 8,534 feet higher than The Matterhorn. Therefore, yes,
      Mount Whitney is higher than The Matterhorn.'

    03e12648-89f2-4a21-9e45-2146f82198f0: YES. Mountain peak heights can vary significantly
      based on location and geological factors. While both Mount Denali and Mount
      Kangchenjunga are considered among the highest mountains in the world, their
      elevations differ greatly due to factors such as elevation differences between
      their summits, different rock types, and varying atmospheric conditions. Without
      specific geographical information about the locations of these two mountains,
      it's difficult to definitively say whether one is higher than the other. However,
      given that Mount Denali is located in Alaska, USA, which is situated at approximately
      20,310 meters (65,782 feet) above sea level, while Mount Kangchenjunga is located
      in Nepal, which is also around 20,500 meters (65,924 feet) above sea level,
      it would be reasonable to assume that Mount Denali is indeed higher than Mount
      Kangchenjunga.
    1459c28b-d16f-41d5-89a7-1958d3f9a1f6: YES. The highest mountain peak in the world,
      Mount Denali, stands at 20,310 feet (6,138 meters) above sea level, while Mount
      Kangchenjunga, also known as K2, reaches an elevation of 5,895 feet (1,785 meters).
      Therefore, Mount Denali is indeed higher than Mount Kangchenjunga.
    25750670-0ea8-43c7-a83d-24ebd37d5f18: Yes, Mount Denali is higher than Mount Kangchenjunga.
      The highest peak in the world is Mount Everest (formerly known as K2), which
      stands at an elevation of approximately 8, 840 meters above sea level. While
      Mount Denali does not have a direct equivalent to Mount Everest in terms of
      altitude, it remains the tallest mountain range on Earth and is generally considered
      higher than any other mountain range in the world.
    5bd4ee4c-38ae-4356-bb63-85127d0ffad9: Yes.
    6e317c10-7ac3-4597-aacc-9d1e84b3dc32: YES. Mount Denali, the highest mountain
      in the world at 20,310 feet (6,190 meters) above sea level, is indeed higher
      than Mount Kangchenjunga, which stands at 8,516 feet (2,607 meters). The difference
      between these two mountains is about 19,794 feet (5,963 meters), making them
      the highest mountains on Earth.
    757c5e51-574c-4cb9-afdf-f13f90d22413: YES. Mount Denali (Mount McKinley) stands
      at 20,310 feet above sea level, while Mount Kangchenjunga (also known as Kanchenjunga)
      stands at 55,924 feet. The difference in altitude between the two mountains
      is 36,214 feet. Therefore, Mount Denali is indeed higher than Mount Kangchenjunga.

    a7e1172f-bd80-4592-9076-196d6043b13f: Yes. The highest peak in the world that
      I know of is Mount Everest, which stands at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above
      sea level, while Mount Kangchenjunga, also known as K2, rises to 8,516 meters
      (27,929 feet). Both peaks are located in the Himalayas, making them among the
      tallest mountains on Earth. Therefore, Mount Denali (also known as Mt. McKinley)
      would indeed be higher than both Mount Everest and Mount Kangchenjunga.
    ffa51e91-ce4f-4052-b138-cd3799d09295: Yes. Mount Denali is indeed higher than
      Mount Kangchenjunga. Both peaks are located in the Himalayas and stand at approximately
      20,596 meters (67,143 feet) above sea level.

      the geographical location and elevation differences between the two mountains.
      Mount Elbrus stands at an altitude of 5, 793 meters above sea level, while Mount

      Mount Everest) is higher than Mount K2. The difference between the two mountains
      is approximately 8, 840 meters (29, 571 feet) in altitude. This makes Mount

      \ both mountains. \n\nMount Kangchenjunga has an average elevation of 8,570\
      \ meters above sea level. On the other hand, Mount K2 has an average elevation\
      \ of 8,611 meters.\n\nTo climb Mount K2 from the base of Kangchenjunga, one\
