      step:


      1. The Matterhorn and Mont Blanc are both famous mountains in the Alps.


      2. The Matterhorn is located on the border between Switzerland and Italy, while
      Mont Blanc is located on the border between France and Italy.


      3. To determine which mountain is higher, we need to compare their elevations.


      4. The Matterhorn has an elevation of 4,478 meters (14,692 feet) above sea level.


      5. Mont Blanc has an elevation of 4,808 meters (15,774 feet) above sea level.


      6. Since Mont Blanc''s elevation is 4,808 meters, which is higher than the Matterhorn''s
      elevation of 4,478 meters, we can conclude that Mont Blanc is higher than the
      Matterhorn.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is The Matterhorn higher than Mont Blanc?"
