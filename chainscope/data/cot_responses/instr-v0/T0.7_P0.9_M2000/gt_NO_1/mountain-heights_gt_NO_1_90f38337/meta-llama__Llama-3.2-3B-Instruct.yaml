      To answer this question, I need to know the heights of The Matterhorn and Mont
      Blanc. According to my knowledge, The Matterhorn has a height of 4,478 meters
      (14,692 feet) and Mont Blanc has a height of 4,810 meters (15,781 feet).


      Now, let me reason step by step:


      1. I need to compare the heights of the two mountains.

      2. If Mont Blanc is taller than The Matterhorn, the answer is NO.

      3. If The Matterhorn is taller than Mont Blanc, the answer is YES.

      4. Based on the heights, I can see that Mont Blanc is taller than The Matterhorn.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      Mont Blanc has a height of 4,810 meters (15,781 ft).
