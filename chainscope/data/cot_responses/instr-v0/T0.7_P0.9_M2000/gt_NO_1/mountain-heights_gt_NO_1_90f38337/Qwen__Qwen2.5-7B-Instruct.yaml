      1. **The Matterhorn**: This mountain is located in the Alps on the border between
      Switzerland and Italy. Its elevation is approximately 4,478 meters (14,692 feet).


      2. **Mont Blanc**: Also located in the Alps, Mont Blanc spans the border between

      1. Identify the height of Mount Kangchenjunga.

      2. Identify the height of Mount K2.

      3. Compare the two heights.


      Step 1: The height of Mount Kangchenjunga is approximately 8,586 meters (28,169
      feet).


      Step 2: The height of Mount K2 is approximately 8,611 meters (28,251 feet).
