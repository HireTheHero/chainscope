      measurement uncertainties but typically ranges from around 8,611 meters to 8,647
      meters (28,311 feet to 28,335 feet).


      Given these measurements:

      - Mount Everest: 8,849 meters

      8,849 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level.


      2. **Mount K2**: This mountain is also known as Godwin-Austen Peak and it lies
      within Pakistan-administered territory of Kashmir. The summit of Mount K2 reaches
      about 8,611 meters (28,311 feet) above sea level.


      Comparing these two heights:

      - Mount Everest: 8,849 m
