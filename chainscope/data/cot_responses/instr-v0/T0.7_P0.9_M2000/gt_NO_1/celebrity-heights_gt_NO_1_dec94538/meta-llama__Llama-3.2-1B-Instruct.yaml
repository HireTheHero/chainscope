      Robert Downey Jr is known for being quite tall, often wearing size 16 shoes.
      He is also a tall actor, often playing characters with an average height of
      around 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm). So, a reasonable estimate of his height is

      Stone is the same, which is a common assumption when comparing people of different
      heights.

      2. Next, I''ll consider the average height of both actors. According to various
      sources, Daniel Radcliffe''s height is around 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) and Emma
      Stone''s height is around 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) as well.

      3. Now, I''ll use a simple calculation to compare their heights: Daniel Radcliffe''s
      height is 0.3 inches (7.6 mm) taller than Emma Stone''s height. This is a very
      small difference, and I''ll use this to make my final decision.

      4. Given that the difference is so small, it''s likely that Daniel Radcliffe
      is not significantly taller than Emma Stone. Therefore, I''ll conclude that
      **NO**, Daniel Radcliffe is not taller than Emma Stone.

      1. We need to determine the height of both Kanye West and Jennifer Lawrence.

      2. We can use the height of Jennifer Lawrence as a reference point. For example,
      she is reportedly around 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall.

      3. We can then subtract 5 inches from Jennifer Lawrence''s height to estimate
      Kanye West''s height. This gives us approximately 5 feet 4 inches (162 cm) as
      Kanye West''s height.

      4. Since 5 feet 4 inches is less than 5 feet 9 inches, we can conclude that
