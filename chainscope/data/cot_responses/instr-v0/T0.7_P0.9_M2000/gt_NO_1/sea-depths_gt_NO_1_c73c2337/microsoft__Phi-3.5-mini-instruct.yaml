      The question asks if the South China Sea is deeper than the Tasman Sea. We need
      to compare the depths of both seas.


      Step 2: Research and gather data

      We need to find reliable information about the depths of both seas. According
      to various sources, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
      (NOAA), the average depth of the South China Sea is approximately 3,000 meters
      (9,842 feet). The Tasman Sea, located between Australia and New Zealand, has
      an average depth of around 2,000 meters (6,562 feet).

      of the Coral Sea is approximately 3,280 meters (10,760 feet).


      Step 4: Compare depths - The Coral Sea has an average depth of 3,280 meters,
      while the Caribbean Sea has an average depth of 2,200 meters.


      Step 5: Answer the question - Since 3,280 meters (Coral Sea) is greater than

      Alaska and Russia. Its average depth ranges from about 500 meters (1,640 feet)
      to over 3,000 meters (9,840 feet) in some areas, with the deepest point being
