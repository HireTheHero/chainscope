      3. **Historical Depth Records**: The Mediterranean Sea has been measured and
      recorded since ancient times due to its strategic importance. Historical documents
      often mention its significant depth. For instance, it''s known that the Mediterranean
      averages about 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) deep at its deepest point.

      deeper than the Caribbean Sea, we need to consider several factors:

      1. **Geographical Location**: The Sargasso Sea is located in the North Atlantic
      Ocean, while the Caribbean Sea is part of the South Atlantic Ocean. This geographical
      separation can influence their depths due to different ocean currents and tectonic
      activities.


      2. **Ocean Currents**: Both oceans experience significant current patterns that
      affect water depth. In the North Atlantic, the Gulf Stream brings warm waters
      northward, which can lead to shallower areas near the surface compared to the
      deep trenches often found in other parts of the world''s oceans.


      3. **Tectonic Activity**: The location of these seas on different plates could
      also play a role. However, this factor alone does not necessarily mean one sea
      will be significantly deeper than another unless there are specific geological
      features unique to each area.

      1. **Geographical Features**: The Red Sea is an inland sea located between Africa
      and Asia. It has a significant amount of fresh water flowing into it from rivers,
      which dilutes its salinity compared to the open oceans. This freshwater input
      can make it appear shallower in some areas relative to the deep oceanic waters
      surrounding it.


      2. **Water Depth Measurement**: According to various sources, including scientific

      1. **Yellow Sea**: The Yellow Sea is an estuary located between China and Korea,

      Korea. It is considered one of the deepest bays in the world.


      2. **Irish Sea**: The Irish Sea is a large body of water that separates Great

      - The Yellow Sea has a depth range typically around 500 meters at its deepest

      to be more shallow compared to other seas.


      Given this information, while both bodies of water are significant geographical

      to this strait, the Arabian Sea experiences more pronounced seasonal variations
      in water levels compared to other bodies of water within its oceanic domain.
