      1. The Baltic Sea is a brackish body of water, meaning it has a mixture of fresh
      and saltwater.

      2. The North Sea is also a brackish body of water.

      3. Brackish water is typically less saline than seawater, meaning it has a lower

      than a sea with higher salinity, such as the North Sea.

      5. The North Sea is a larger body of water than the Baltic Sea, with a much
      greater volume of water.

      1. The Tasman Sea is a body of water located in the Indian Ocean, bounded by
      Australia to the west, New Zealand to the north, and Antarctica to the south.

      2. The Sargasso Sea is a body of water located in the North Atlantic Ocean,
      bounded by the Azores Islands to the west, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the east,
      and the coast of the United States to the north.

      3. The Tasman Sea is a relatively shallow body of water, with an average depth
      of about 1,200 meters (4,000 feet).

      4. The Sargasso Sea is also a relatively shallow body of water, with an average
      depth of about 600 meters (2,000 feet).

      5. Both the Tasman Sea and the Sargasso Sea are generally considered to be relatively
      shallow compared to other bodies of water in the world.
