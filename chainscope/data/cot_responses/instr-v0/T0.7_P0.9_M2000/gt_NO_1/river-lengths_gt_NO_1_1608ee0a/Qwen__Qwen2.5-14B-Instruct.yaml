      \n1. The length of the River Danube: The Danube is Europe\u2019s second-longest\
      \ river, stretching from Germany to Romania, where it empties into the Black\
      \ Sea. Its total length is approximately 2,860 kilometers (1,777 miles).\n\n\

      \ United States. Its main stem alone is about 3,766 kilometers (2,341 miles)\
      \ long, but including its entire drainage network, the length can be even longer.\n\
      \nComparing these lengths:\n- The Danube is approximately 2,860 kilometers long.\n\

      Step 1: Identify the length of the River Thames.

      The River Thames is approximately 346 kilometers (215 miles) long.


      Step 2: Identify the length of the River Seine.

      The River Seine is approximately 777 kilometers (483 miles) long from its source
