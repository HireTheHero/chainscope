      \ of both rivers.\n3. **Compare the lengths:**  Compare the length of the Thames\
      \ to the length of the Seine. \n\n**Since I don't have access to real-time information,\
      \ I can't give you an exact length.  However, I can tell you that the River\
      \ Thames is generally considered longer than the River Seine.**\n\n**Therefore,\
