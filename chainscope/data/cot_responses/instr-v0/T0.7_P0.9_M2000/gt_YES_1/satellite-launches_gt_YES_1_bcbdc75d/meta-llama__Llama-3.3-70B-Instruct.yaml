      after Syncom 3, let''s first identify what each of these is and their launch
      dates.


      1. **Early Bird**: Also known as Intelsat I, Early Bird was the first commercial
      communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit. It was launched on April 6,
      1965.


      2. **Syncom 3**: Syncom 3 was a geosynchronous communications satellite launched
      by NASA on August 19, 1964. It was the first satellite to be placed in a geosynchronous
      orbit over the equator, and it was used to broadcast the 1964 Summer Olympics
      from Tokyo to the United States.


      Given these details:

      - Syncom 3 was launched on August 19, 1964.

      - Early Bird (Intelsat I) was launched on April 6, 1965.


      Since April 6, 1965, is after August 19, 1964, Early Bird was indeed launched
      after Syncom 3.

      launched on January 2, 1959. It was the first spacecraft to reach the vicinity
      of the Moon and was a significant milestone in space exploration.
