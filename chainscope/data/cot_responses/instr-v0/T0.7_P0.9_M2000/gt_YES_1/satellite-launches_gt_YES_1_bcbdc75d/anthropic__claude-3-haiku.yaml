      Mir was a space station operated by the Soviet Union and later by Russia from
      1986 to 2001.


      Step 2: Identify when GPS 1 was launched.

      GPS 1, also known as Navstar 1, was the first satellite of the Global Positioning
      System (GPS) and was launched in 1978.


      Step 3: Compare the launch dates of Mir and GPS 1.

      Mir was launched in 1986, which is after the launch of GPS 1 in 1978.


      Based on the information provided, the answer to the question "Was Mir launched
      after GPS 1?" is:


      YES'
