      Sputnik 1 was launched on October 4, 1957.


      Step 2: Identify the launch date of Vanguard 1.

      Vanguard 1 was launched on March 17, 1958.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      Since March 17, 1958, comes after October 4, 1957, it is clear that Vanguard
      1 was indeed launched after Sputnik 1.
