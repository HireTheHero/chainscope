      Vanguard 1, the first satellite launched by the United States, was launched
      on March 17, 1958.


      Step 2: Compare the launch dates.


      Since Sputnik 1 was launched in 1957 and Vanguard 1 was launched in 1958, we
      can conclude that Vanguard 1 was launched after Sputnik 1.


      Answer: YES, Vanguard 1 was launched after Sputnik 1.'
