      Early Bird (OSIRIS-1) was launched on March 22, 1966.

      Early Bird was a series of Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) launches
      by NASA, starting with ERTS-1 (also known as Landsat 1) in 1972.


      Landsat 1, also known as ERTS-1, was launched on January 23, 1972.

      Landsat 4 was launched on June 7, 1982.

      4), I can conclude that Landsat 1 was indeed launched before Landsat 4.

      1. First, I need to identify what "Early Bird" refers to in the context of Landsat
      1. From my knowledge, the Early Bird program was a NASA program that launched
      several satellites into Earth orbit in the 1960s and 1970s. Specifically, Landsat
      1 was one of the satellites launched under the Early Bird program.

      2. Next, I need to know the launch dates of Landsat 1 and Early Bird. According
      to NASA''s records, Landsat 1 was launched on January 16, 1972. Early Bird was
      a program that launched several satellites, including Landsat 1, between 1966
      and 1972.

      3. Based on the launch dates, I can conclude that Landsat 1 was indeed launched
      after Early Bird.

      So, to answer the question, I need to know the launch year of Early Bird. Since
      there were multiple satellites in the Early Bird series, I''ll assume you''re
      referring to the first satellite in the series, which was ERTS-1, also known
      as Early Bird.


      ERTS-1 was launched in August 1972.


      Landsat 1 was launched in January 1972.

      Step 1: What is the order of launch dates for these two space-related projects?

      The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 24, 1990.

      The International Space Station (ISS) was launched on November 20, 1998.


      Step 2: Compare the launch dates to determine which one was launched first.

      The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990, while the ISS was launched
      in 1998.


      Step 3: Determine the answer based on the comparison.

      Since the Hubble Space Telescope was launched before the International Space
      Station, the answer is:'
    38f71d9b-f9a1-443b-9ded-1ca4eb435fce: 'Let me break it down step by step.


      1. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 24, 1990.

      2. The International Space Station (ISS) was initially conceived in the early
      1990s, but its development and planning phase started later.

      3. The ISS''s core components, including the Zarya functional cargo block, were
      launched in November 1998.

      4. The first ISS module, Zarya, was docked with the Russian spacecraft Progress
      55 on November 2, 1998.

      5. The first crew arrived at the ISS on November 2, 2000, aboard the Soyuz TMK-10
      spacecraft.

      6. The ISS was officially occupied by a continuous crew in December 2000, marking
      the beginning of its operational phase.


      Considering the above steps, I can conclude that the International Space Station
      was launched after the Hubble Space Telescope.
