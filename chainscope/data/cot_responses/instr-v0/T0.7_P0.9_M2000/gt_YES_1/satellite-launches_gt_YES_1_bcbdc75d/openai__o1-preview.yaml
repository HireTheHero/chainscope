      \ 3.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Syncom 3:**\n   - **Launch Date:**\
      \ August 19, 1964.\n   - **Significance:** Syncom 3 was the first geostationary\
      \ communication satellite. It successfully demonstrated the feasibility of geostationary\
      \ satellite communications and relayed live television coverage of the 1964\
      \ Summer Olympics in Tokyo to the United States.\n\n2. **Early Bird (Intelsat\
      \ I):**\n   - **Launch Date:** April 6, 1965.\n   - **Significance:** Early\
      \ Bird, officially known as Intelsat I, was the first commercial communications\
      \ satellite placed in geosynchronous orbit. It provided the first direct and\
      \ near-instantaneous communications between North America and Europe.\n\n3.\
