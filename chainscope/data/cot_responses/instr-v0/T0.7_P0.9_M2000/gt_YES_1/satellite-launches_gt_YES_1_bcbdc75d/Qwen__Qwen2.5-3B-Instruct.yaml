      Since March 1, 1972 comes after April 6, 1965, it logically follows that Landsat
      1 was launched after Early Bird.


      ### Conclusion:

      Yes, Landsat 1 was launched after Early Bird.'

      Step 1: Identify the launch date for Landsat 1.

      Landsat 1 was launched on July 23, 1972.


      Step 2: Identify the launch date for Early Bird.

      Early Bird was a communications satellite that was launched into geostationary

      2. Identify the launch date of the International Space Station (ISS).

      3. Compare the two dates to determine which came later.


      Step 1: The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 24, 1990, from the
      Space Shuttle Discovery.


      Step 2: The ISS was launched in multiple stages, but its assembly began in 1998
      when the first component, the Zarya control module, was launched. However, the
      complete ISS was not fully operational until 2011. To find the specific launch
      date for the ISS, we need to consider the first major launch that contributed
      significantly to the station''s structure. The first component to be permanently
      attached was the Unity module, which was launched on October 31, 1998, on board
      the Space Shuttle Endeavour.


      Step 3: Comparing the dates:

      - Hubble Space Telescope: April 24, 1990

      - International Space Station: October 31, 1998


      Since October 31, 1998, comes after April 24, 1990, the International Space
      Station was indeed launched after the Hubble Space Telescope.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      2. Compare these launch dates to determine which came first.


      Step 1: Identifying Launch Dates


      - The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 24, 1990, by space shuttle
      Discovery.

      - The first module of the International Space Station (ISS) was launched on
      October 31, 1998, by space shuttle Endeavour.

      - Hubble Space Telescope: April 24, 1990

      - First ISS module: October 31, 1998


      By comparing these dates, it''s evident that the Hubble Space Telescope was
      launched before the first module of the International Space Station.

      1. **Launch Date of the Hubble Space Telescope**: The Hubble Space Telescope
      was launched on April 24, 1990, from the Space Shuttle Discovery.


      2. **Launch Date of the International Space Station**: The ISS has a complex
      history of launches and assembly. It wasn''t launched as a single unit in one
      mission; it''s built incrementally over many years. However, the first module,
      Zarya, was launched on November 20, 1998, aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery.
