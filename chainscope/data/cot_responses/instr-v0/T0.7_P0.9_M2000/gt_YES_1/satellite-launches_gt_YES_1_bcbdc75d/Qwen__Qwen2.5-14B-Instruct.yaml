      - Since February 1, 1958, comes after October 4, 1957, Explorer 1 was indeed
      launched after Sputnik 1.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      NO


      Explorer 1 was not launched before Sputnik 1; it was launched after. Therefore,
      the correct interpretation of the question (whether Explorer 1 was launched
      after Sputnik 1) leads to an affirmative answer, but the format asks for a "YES"
      if the statement in the question is true, leading to "NO" as the statement implies
      the opposite order than what actually happened. However, clarifying: Explorer
      1 was launched after Sputnik 1, so the event described in the question is accurate.
      Thus, the correct response should be:


      YES'
