      5. Therefore, potassium is less dense than sodium.\n\n\n\n**Answer: NO** \n"
    e4b6faa0-30ad-470b-9a86-dc1b1c81ed98: "Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Density is\
      \ mass per unit volume.**  \n\n2. **Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K) are both alkali\
      \ metals.** Alkali metals have a similar atomic structure.\n\n3. **Potassium\
      \ (K) has a larger atomic radius than sodium (Na).** This means its electrons\
      \ are spread out over a larger volume.\n\n4. **For the same mass, a larger volume\
