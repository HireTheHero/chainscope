      \ (Li) are both elements in the periodic table, specifically in Group 1, known\

      \ mass per unit volume of a substance. It's expressed as kilograms per cubic\
      \ meter (kg/m\xB3) in the metric system.\n\n3. **Compare Atomic Mass and Atomic\
      \ Radius**: \n   - **Atomic Mass**: The atomic mass of an element is a measure\
      \ of the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. Generally, as\
      \ you move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic mass increases because\
      \ each subsequent element has more protons and neutrons.\n   - **Atomic Radius**:\
      \ This is a measure of the size of an atom's electron cloud. Moving down a group,\
      \ the atomic radius increases due to the addition of new energy levels (shells),\
      \ which increases the distance from the nucleus to the outermost electrons.\n\
      \n4. **Potassium vs. Lithium**:\n   - **Atomic Mass**: Potassium (K) has an\
      \ atomic mass of approximately 39 u (unified atomic mass units), while Lithium\
      \ (Li) has an atomic mass of about 7 u. So, potassium has a higher atomic mass.\n\
      \   - **Atomic Radius**: The atomic radius of potassium is larger than that\
      \ of lithium because potassium is below lithium in the periodic table, and as\
      \ mentioned, atomic radius increases down a group.\n\n5. **Density Calculation**:\
      \ Density = Mass / Volume. For elements, we can think of this in terms of atomic\
      \ mass and atomic volume (related to atomic radius). Even though potassium has\
      \ a larger atomic mass (which would increase density), its atomic radius is\
      \ also larger (which increases volume and thus would decrease density).\n\n\
      6. **Conclusion**: Given that density is directly proportional to mass but inversely\
      \ proportional to volume, and considering that potassium has a significantly\
      \ larger atomic mass but also a larger atomic radius compared to lithium, we\
      \ need to consider which effect dominates.\n\nIn general, as you move down the\
      \ alkali metal group, the increase in atomic radius (and thus atomic volume)\
      \ tends to outweigh the increase in atomic mass, leading to a decrease in density.\
      \ Therefore, despite potassium having a higher atomic mass, its larger size\
      \ (and thus larger volume) compared to lithium means it is less dense.\n\nSo,\
