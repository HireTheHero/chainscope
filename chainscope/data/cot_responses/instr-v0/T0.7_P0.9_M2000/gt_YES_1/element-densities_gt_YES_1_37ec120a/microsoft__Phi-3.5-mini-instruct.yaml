      of potassium and lithium.

      3. Calculate or compare the densities of potassium and lithium.

      - Potassium (K): 39.0983 atomic mass units (amu)

      - Potassium (K): 248 pm (picometers)

      - Lithium (Li): 152 pm


      Step 3: Calculate or compare densities

      Density is calculated using the formula: Density = Mass / Volume


      Since we have the atomic masses, we can compare the masses directly. However,
      we need to consider the atomic radii (volume) as well. Generally, a smaller
      atomic radius implies a smaller volume.


      Based on the atomic masses and radii, we can infer the following:


      - Potassium has a higher atomic mass (39.0983 amu) compared to lithium (6.94
      amu).

      - Potassium has a larger atomic radius (248 pm) compared to lithium (152 pm).


      A higher atomic mass typically indicates a higher density, while a larger atomic
      radius usually indicates a lower density.

      density, but its larger atomic radius might counteract this effect. However,

      of iron and tin.


      Iron (Fe) and tin (Sn) are both elements found on the periodic table. Iron is
      in the transition metals group, while tin is in the post-transition metals group.


      Step 2: Find the atomic masses of iron and tin.


      The atomic mass of iron (Fe) is approximately 55.845 atomic mass units (amu).

      The atomic mass of tin (Sn) is approximately 118.71 amu.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic masses of iron and tin.


      Comparing the atomic masses, we see that tin has a higher atomic mass (118.71

      Step 4: Relate atomic mass to density.


      Generally, the density of a substance is directly proportional to its atomic
      mass. This means that if one element has a higher atomic mass, it is likely
      to have a higher density as well.

      Step 1: Find the atomic weights of sodium and potassium.

      - Sodium (Na) has an atomic weight of approximately 22.99 g/mol.

      - Potassium (K) has an atomic weight of approximately 39.10 g/mol.

      - Potassium has a higher atomic weight (39.10 g/mol) than sodium (22.99 g/mol).


      Step 3: Consider atomic volumes.

      - Generally, atomic volume decreases as we move from left to right across a
      period in the periodic table due to the increase in nuclear charge, which pulls
      the electrons closer to the nucleus.

      - Both sodium and potassium are in the same group (alkali metals) and in the
      same period (Period 4), but potassium is further to the right.


      Step 4: Analyze the relationship between atomic weight and atomic volume.

      - Since potassium has a higher atomic weight and a smaller atomic volume (being

      Sodium (Na) has an atomic mass of approximately 22.99 g/mol, while potassium

      Density is defined as mass per unit volume. For elements in the same group,
      density can be affected by atomic mass and atomic structure.


      Step 4: Analyze atomic structure

      in their outermost shell. However, potassium has more electron shells, making
      its atomic radius larger than sodium''s.
