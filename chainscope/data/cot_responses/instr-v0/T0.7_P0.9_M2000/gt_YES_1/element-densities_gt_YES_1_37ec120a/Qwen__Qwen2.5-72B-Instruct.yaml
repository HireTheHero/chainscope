      \ structure, which means they pack in a similar manner.\n\n4. **Density Calculation**:\n\
      \   - Density is given by the formula: \\( \\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\\
      text{Volume}} \\).\n   - For elements in the same crystal structure, the density\
      \ depends on the ratio of the atomic mass to the volume occupied by the atoms.\n\
      \n5. **Volume Occupied**:\n   - Since both elements have a BCC structure, the\
      \ volume occupied by each atom is proportional to the cube of the atomic radius.\n\
      \   - The volume for sodium is \\( V_{\\text{Na}} \\propto (186 \\, \\text{pm})^3\
      \ \\).\n   - The volume for potassium is \\( V_{\\text{K}} \\propto (243 \\\
      , \\text{pm})^3 \\).\n\n6. **Comparing Densities**:\n   - Sodium has a smaller\
      \ atomic radius but also a smaller atomic mass compared to potassium.\n   -\
      \ Despite having a larger atomic mass, potassium's larger atomic radius means\
      \ it occupies more volume, which would generally result in a lower density.\n\
      \n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that sodium has a smaller atomic radius and\
      \ a smaller atomic mass, it will have a higher density compared to potassium,\
      \ which has a larger atomic radius and a larger atomic mass.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ answer is **YES**, sodium is denser than potassium."
