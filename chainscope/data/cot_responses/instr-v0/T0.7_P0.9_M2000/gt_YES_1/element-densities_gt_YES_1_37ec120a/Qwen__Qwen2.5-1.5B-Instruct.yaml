      1. **Atomic Structure**: Tin (Sn) has an atomic number of 50, while Chromium

      in their nuclei compared to chromium atoms.


      2. **Density Comparison**: The density of a material depends on the mass of
      its atoms per unit volume. Since tin has more protons (and thus more positive
      charge) in its nucleus, it will exert stronger nuclear forces, which can lead
      to higher density if the electrons are not significantly affected.

      may be held tighter. However, this does not directly correlate with density
      alone but rather with conductivity and other properties.


      Given these factors, although chromium might have a slight advantage due to

      \ magnesium, we need to consider their respective densities.\n\n1. **Density\
      \ Definition**: Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. The formula\
      \ for density (\\(\\rho\\)) is:\n   \\[\n   \\rho = \\frac{m}{V}\n   \\]\n \
      \  where \\(m\\) is the mass and \\(V\\) is the volume.\n\n2. **Comparing Aluminums\
      \ and Magnesium**:\n   - Aluminum (Al) has an atomic number of 13, meaning each\
      \ atom of aluminum has 13 protons and 13 electrons.\n   - Magnesium (Mg) has\
      \ an atomic number of 12, meaning each atom of magnesium has 12 protons and\
      \ 12 electrons.\n\n3. **Atomic Masses**:\n   - The average atomic mass of aluminum\
      \ is approximately 26.98 g/mol.\n   - The average atomic mass of magnesium is\
      \ approximately 24.31 g/mol.\n\n4. **Density Calculation**:\n   - To compare\
      \ their densities, we can use their atomic masses since they have similar sizes.\n\
      \   - However, it's important to note that these calculations assume ideal conditions\
      \ without considering real-world factors like crystal structure which could\
      \ affect packing efficiency differently between them.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based\
      \ on Atomic Mass**:\n   - Since magnesium has a lower atomic mass compared to\
      \ aluminum, it means there are fewer atoms in the same volume of magnesium as\
      \ there would be in a given amount of aluminum.\n   - Therefore, magnesium will\
      \ generally occupy less space within the same volume as aluminum does, leading\
      \ to a higher density.\n\nBased on this analysis, aluminum is denser than magnesium.\
      \ Thus, the answer is:\n\nYES"

      \ than just their atomic weights.\n\n3. **Relative Sizes:**\n   - Aluminum atoms\
      \ are larger in size compared to magnesium atoms due to the difference in their\
      \ electron configurations and valence shell structures.\n   - This means that\
      \ even though aluminum might not be heavier per unit mass, its atoms take up\
      \ more space when packed together because of their greater diameter.\n\nGiven\
      \ these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that aluminum is indeed denser\
