      - The Ming Dynasty lasted from 1368 to 1644

      - The Great Wall was significantly expanded and fortified during this period


      2. When was the Taj Mahal built?

      - The Taj Mahal was constructed between 1632 and 1653

      - It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife


      3. Comparing the timelines:

      - The Ming Dynasty period (1368-1644) overlaps with the Taj Mahal''s construction
      period (1632-1653)

      - The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653, which is after the start of the Ming
      Dynasty
