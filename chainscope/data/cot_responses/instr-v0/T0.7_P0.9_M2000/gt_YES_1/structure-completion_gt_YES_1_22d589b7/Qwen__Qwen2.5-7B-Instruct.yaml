      was completed after the Panama Canal, let''s break down the dates of completion
      for both projects.


      1. **Panama Canal Completion**: The Panama Canal was completed in 1914. This
      project began in 1881 but faced numerous challenges and delays. The United States
      took over the project from France in 1904 and completed it in 1914.


      2. **Empire State Building Completion**: The Empire State Building was completed
      in 1931. Construction began in 1930 and it topped out in 1930, with the building
      being finished and open to tenants in May 1931.


      Given these dates:

      - Panama Canal: Completed in 1914

      - Empire State Building: Completed in 1931


      Since 1931 comes after 1914, the Empire State Building was indeed completed

      1. **Panama Canal**: The construction of the Panama Canal began on May 4, 1904,
      under the direction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Panama
      Canal Commission. The canal was officially opened to traffic on August 15, 1914.
