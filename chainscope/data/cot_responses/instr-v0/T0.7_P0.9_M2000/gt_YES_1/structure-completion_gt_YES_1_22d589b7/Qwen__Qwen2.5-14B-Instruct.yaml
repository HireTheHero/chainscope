      Taj Mahal.


      1. **Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty)**: The construction of the Great Wall
      as we know it today was largely carried out during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
      While the wall had been built and rebuilt throughout Chinese history, significant
      construction during the Ming Dynasty occurred between 1368 and 1644.


      2. **Taj Mahal**: Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed
      around 1653 under the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.


      Given these timelines:

      - The Great Wall of China saw significant construction during the Ming Dynasty,
      which ended in 1644.

      - The Taj Mahal''s construction started in 1632 and concluded in 1653.


      Since the completion of the Taj Mahal took place after the end of the Ming Dynasty
      period of the Great Wall''s construction, the answer is:


      **YES**'

      the timelines of both the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China during the Ming
      Dynasty.


      1. **Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty Segment)**: The Great Wall of China underwent
      significant construction during the Ming Dynasty, which lasted from 1368 to
      1644. While earlier versions of the wall existed, major rebuilding and reinforcement
      occurred during the Ming period.


      2. **Taj Mahal**: The Taj Mahal was built in Agra, India, during the reign of
      Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Construction began around 1632 and was completed
      around 1653.


      Given these dates:

      - The Ming Dynasty''s era overlaps with part of the construction period for
      the Taj Mahal.

      - More specifically, the Taj Mahal''s completion in 1653 occurred well after
      the end of the Ming Dynasty in 1644.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**, the Taj Mahal was indeed completed after the
      Great Wall of China''s Ming Dynasty period.'
    9c1cfaf1-44bf-4b4f-9110-7a69d5d3c19d: 'To answer this question, we need to identify
      the periods during which the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China (specifically
      the sections built during the Ming Dynasty) were constructed.


      1. The Great Wall of China was extensively rebuilt and fortified during the
      Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD). Construction during this period continued for several
      centuries within that timeframe.


      2. The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632 and completed
      around 1653.


      Given these timelines:

      - The Great Wall of China''s construction during the Ming Dynasty overlaps with
      and precedes the construction of the Taj Mahal.

      - Therefore, the Taj Mahal was indeed completed after parts of the Great Wall
      of China were constructed during the Ming Dynasty.


      So, the answer is: **YES**'
    dc3222bf-99ac-4e9a-ae7a-975cfbd0d5bf: 'To determine whether the Taj Mahal was
      completed after the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty, let''s consider
      the timelines of these two structures.


      1. **Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty Section):** The majority of the Great
      Wall that people commonly refer to today was built during the Ming Dynasty,
      which lasted from 1368 to 1644. Construction of this part of the wall began
      in the early 14th century and continued throughout the Ming period.


      2. **Taj Mahal:** The construction of the Taj Mahal started around 1632 and
      was completed around 1653. It was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan
      to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.


      Given these dates:

      - The Great Wall of China''s construction during the Ming Dynasty occurred primarily
      between 1368 and 1644.

      - The Taj Mahal''s construction started in 1632 and ended in 1653.


      Therefore, the Taj Mahal was indeed completed after the Great Wall of China
      during the Ming Dynasty.


      **Answer: YES**'

      1. **Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty section):** The majority of the Great

      1368 to 1644. Construction of the Great Wall during the Ming Dynasty was extensive

      the earlier part of this dynasty.


      2. **Taj Mahal:** The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed

      Comparing these timelines:

      as it exists today was significantly extended and fortified during the Ming
