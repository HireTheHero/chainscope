      was completed after the Hoover Dam, let''s consider the completion dates of
      each structure:


      Step 1: Determine the completion date of the Hoover Dam.

      The Hoover Dam, originally known as Boulder Dam, was constructed between 1931
      and 1936. The dam was officially dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President
      Franklin D. Roosevelt.


      Step 2: Determine the completion date of the Golden Gate Bridge.

      The construction of the Golden Gate Bridge began on January 5, 1933, and the
      bridge was opened to pedestrian traffic on May 27, 1937. The following day,
      May 28, 1937, it was opened to vehicular traffic.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates.

      The Hoover Dam was officially dedicated on September 30, 1935, while the Golden
      Gate Bridge was opened to traffic on May 28, 1937. Therefore, the Golden Gate
      Bridge was completed approximately 1 year and 8 months after the Hoover Dam.

      Step 1: Determine the completion date of the Taj Mahal.

      The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his
      wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Construction began in 1632 and was completed in approximately
      1653.


      Step 2: Determine the time period of the Ming Dynasty and the construction of
      the Great Wall during this period.

      The Ming Dynasty ruled China from 1368 to 1644. During this time, the Great
      Wall was extensively rebuilt, fortified, and expanded. The majority of the Great
      Wall that we see today was built during the Ming Dynasty.


      Step 3: Compare the completion dates.

      The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653, which falls within the time period of the
      Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). This means that the Great Wall of China, as it was
      rebuilt and expanded during the Ming Dynasty, was completed before the Taj Mahal.
