    0dfcd483-35cc-42ee-ae8d-45244805da39: 'To answer this question accurately, let''s
      determine the completion dates for both structures.


      Step 1: Identify the completion date of the Hoover Dam.

      The Hoover Dam was completed in 1935.


      Step 2: Identify the completion date of the Golden Gate Bridge.

      The Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Since 1937 (Golden Gate Bridge) comes after 1935 (Hoover Dam), the Golden Gate
      Bridge was indeed completed after the Hoover Dam.

      \ the Great Wall during the Ming Dynasty.\n\n**Answer: YES**"
    ccd60ddf-a185-47c1-bdbd-7776211925c1: "To answer this question accurately, let's\
      \ break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the completion dates for each structure:**\n\
      \   - The Great Wall of China, particularly the sections built during the Ming\
      \ Dynasty (which are the most famous), were largely constructed between the\
      \ 14th and 17th centuries, with significant work done in the 15th century under\
      \ Emperor Hongwu and Emperor Yongle.\n   - The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653\
      \ under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.\n\n2. **Compare the dates:**\n\
      \   - The Ming Dynasty Great Wall sections were mostly completed before the\
      \ mid-17th century.\n   - The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653, which falls within\
      \ the 17th century.\n\nGiven these facts:\n- The Great Wall sections built during\
      \ the Ming Dynasty were largely completed by the early to mid-1600s.\n- The\
      \ Taj Mahal was completed in 1653.\n\nTherefore, the Taj Mahal was indeed completed\
      \ after the Great Wall sections built during the Ming Dynasty.\n\n**Answer:**\
      \ YES"
