    94f920ab-4a21-4462-b473-5a2cd24d7011: 'Let''s break it down step by step:


      1. The Eiffel Tower was built in France.

      2. The Statue of Liberty was built in the United States.

      3. The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889.

      4. The Statue of Liberty was completed in 1886.


      Based on this information, we can conclude that the Eiffel Tower was not completed
      after the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty was completed before the
      Eiffel Tower was even built.'
