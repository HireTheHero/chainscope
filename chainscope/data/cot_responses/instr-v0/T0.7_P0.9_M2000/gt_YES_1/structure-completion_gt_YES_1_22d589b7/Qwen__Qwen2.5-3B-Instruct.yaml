      1. **Panama Canal**: The construction of the Panama Canal began in 1904 and

      15, 1914.

    f9595433-5235-4fa7-8350-3a8ac137fa07: "To determine if the Taj Mahal was completed\
      \ after the completion of the Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty, let's\
      \ break down the timelines for both structures.\n\n1. **Taj Mahal Construction**:\n\
      \   - The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was largely completed\
      \ by 1653.\n   - This means the Taj Mahal was finished around 12 years after\
      \ the death of Emperor Shah Jahan, who initiated its construction in 1632.\n\
      \n2. **Great Wall of China during the Ming Dynasty**:\n   - Construction on\
      \ the Great Wall started much earlier than the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).\n \
      \  - During the Ming Dynasty, the wall was continuously expanded and maintained.\
      \ One of the most significant phases of expansion occurred under Emperor Zhu\
      \ Di (1402-1424), during whose reign the walls were rebuilt and strengthened.\n\
      \   - However, even this major phase of expansion did not complete the entire\

      \n3. **Timeline Considerations**:\n   - The construction of the Great Wall during\
      \ the Ming Dynasty could have been ongoing until 1644, when the Ming Dynasty\
      \ fell.\n   - It\u2019s important to note that the timeline of the Great Wall\u2019\
      s completion varies based on different segments and regions. However, by 1644,\
      \ the wall would have still been incomplete compared to its total length.\n\n\
      Given these details:\n\n- The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653.\n- The Great\
      \ Wall of China was likely still being constructed or expanded into the mid-to-late\
      \ 17th century, at least into the reign of the last Ming Dynasty emperor, Chongzhen\
      \ (1628-1644).\n\nTherefore, the Taj Mahal was indeed completed before the completion\
