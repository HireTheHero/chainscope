    1adf8bc3-908c-4a52-97d3-0727387ec8f5: 'To determine whether nitrogen has a higher
      boiling point than helium, we need to look at the boiling points of both substances.


      1. **Identify the boiling point of nitrogen (N2)**: Nitrogen is a diatomic molecule
      and its boiling point is approximately -196 degrees Celsius (-321 degrees Fahrenheit).


      2. **Identify the boiling point of helium (He)**: Helium is a noble gas and
      its boiling point is approximately -269 degrees Celsius (-452 degrees Fahrenheit).


      3. **Compare the boiling points**: Since -196 degrees Celsius (boiling point
      of nitrogen) is warmer than -269 degrees Celsius (boiling point of helium),
      it indicates that nitrogen boils at a higher temperature than helium.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      YES.'

      1. The boiling point of carbon dioxide is about -78.5 degrees Celsius at standard

      2. The boiling point of oxygen is about -183 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric
      pressure.


      Next, we compare the two boiling points:


      - CO2 boils at -78.5 degrees Celsius, which is higher than -183 degrees Celsius

      Since -78.5 degrees Celsius is greater than -183 degrees Celsius, we conclude
