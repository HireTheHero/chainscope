      3.  Copper and aluminum are both relatively good conductors, which suggests
      similar strength in their metallic bonding. However, copper has a higher atomic
      weight than aluminum.


      4.  Higher atomic weight often correlates with stronger metallic bonding, and
      thus higher boiling points.


      5.  Therefore, copper likely has a higher boiling point than aluminum.

      2.  Boiling points of metals are generally related to their strength of metallic
      bonding.  Stronger metallic bonding leads to higher boiling points.


      3.  Copper and aluminum are both relatively good conductors of electricity,
      but copper is generally considered a slightly better conductor than aluminum.


      4.  Copper''s atomic number is higher than aluminum''s, meaning it has more
      protons and electrons. This generally leads to a slightly stronger overall attraction
      between the nucleus and the outer electrons, contributing to stronger metallic
      bonding.


      5.  Therefore, copper is expected to have a stronger metallic bonding than aluminum.


      6.  Stronger metallic bonding implies a higher boiling point.
