      boiling point than ethanol, let''s break down the reasoning:


      1. **Chemical Structure**: Water (\(\text{H}_2\text{O}\)) is a polar molecule
      with strong hydrogen bonds between its molecules. Ethanol (\(\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}\))
      is also polar and can form hydrogen bonds, but its molecular structure includes
      a non-polar ethyl group that affects its boiling point.


      2. **Boiling Points**: The boiling point of a substance is influenced by the
      strength of intermolecular forces. Stronger intermolecular forces result in
      a higher boiling point.


      3. **Comparison**: Water has strong hydrogen bonding due to its simple polar
      structure, leading to a relatively high boiling point. Ethanol, while capable
      of hydrogen bonding, has weaker overall intermolecular forces compared to water
      due to the presence of the ethyl group.

      of approximately 2,470 degrees Celsius.


      By comparing these two values, we can see that copper''s boiling point is higher
      than that of aluminum.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
    bbd6886c-d598-4c07-bad1-64fcde2b4890: 'To determine whether copper has a higher
      boiling point than aluminum, we need to consider the boiling points of both
      metals:


      1. **Boiling Point of Copper**: Copper has a boiling point of approximately
      2,562 degrees Celsius (4,644 degrees Fahrenheit).


      2. **Boiling Point of Aluminum**: Aluminum has a boiling point of about 2,470
      degrees Celsius (4,478 degrees Fahrenheit).


      By comparing these two values, we can see that copper has a higher boiling point
      than aluminum.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
