      \ boiling point than helium, let's consider the properties of both elements:\n\
      \n1. **Atomic Structure and Intermolecular Forces:**\n   - Helium (He) is a\
      \ noble gas with a very simple atomic structure. It has a full outer shell of\
      \ electrons, making it highly stable and non-reactive. The primary intermolecular\
      \ forces in helium are weak van der Waals forces.\n   - Nitrogen (N\u2082) exists\
      \ as diatomic molecules (N\u2082). The nitrogen atoms in N\u2082 are held together\
      \ by a strong triple bond, which results in stronger intermolecular forces compared\
      \ to helium.\n\n2. **Boiling Point:**\n   - The boiling point of a substance\
      \ is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the external pressure,\
      \ typically 1 atmosphere (atm).\n   - Stronger intermolecular forces require\
      \ more energy to overcome, leading to a higher boiling point.\n\n3. **Specific\
      \ Boiling Points:**\n   - The boiling point of helium (He) is approximately\
      \ -269\xB0C (-452\xB0F) or 4.2 K.\n   - The boiling point of nitrogen (N\u2082\
      ) is approximately -195.8\xB0C (-320.4\xB0F) or 77.4 K.\n\nGiven these points,\
      \ we can conclude that nitrogen has a higher boiling point than helium because\
      \ the stronger intermolecular forces in nitrogen require more energy to break.\n\
