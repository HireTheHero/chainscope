      1. **Molecular Structure**: Both ethanol (C2H5OH) and methanol (CH3OH) are alcohols,
      which means they contain an -OH group. The primary difference is the carbon
      chain length: ethanol has a two-carbon chain, while methanol has a one-carbon
      chain.


      2. **Intermolecular Forces**: The boiling point of a substance is primarily
      determined by the strength of its intermolecular forces. For alcohols, the strength
      of these forces increases as the molecular weight and the surface area of the
      molecules increase.


      3. **Surface Area and Molecular Weight**: Ethanol has a longer carbon chain
      (two carbons) compared to methanol (one carbon). This results in a larger surface
      area for ethanol, which allows for more effective hydrogen bonding between ethanol
      molecules.


      4. **Boiling Point Comparison**: Because ethanol can form stronger hydrogen
      bonds due to its larger size, it requires more energy to break these bonds during
      boiling. Therefore, ethanol will have a higher boiling point than methanol.
