      The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is
      a fundamental property that defines the chemical identity of an element.


      Step 2: Identify the atomic number of hydrogen.

      Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table and has an atomic number
      of 1. This means that a hydrogen atom has one proton in its nucleus.


      Step 3: Identify the atomic number of helium.

      Helium is the second element in the periodic table and has an atomic number
      of 2. This means that a helium atom has two protons in its nucleus.


      Step 4: Compare the atomic numbers of helium and hydrogen.

      Since helium has an atomic number of 2, and hydrogen has an atomic number of
      1, helium has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.


      After considering the steps, the answer is:


      YES, helium has a higher atomic number than hydrogen.'
