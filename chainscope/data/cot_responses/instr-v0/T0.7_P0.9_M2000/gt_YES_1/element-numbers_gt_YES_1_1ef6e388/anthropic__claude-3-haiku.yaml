      this question.


      Step 1: Determine the atomic number of mercury (Hg).

      The atomic number of mercury is 80.


      Step 2: Determine the atomic number of gold (Au).

      The atomic number of gold is 79.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers of mercury and gold.

      Since the atomic number of mercury (80) is higher than the atomic number of
      gold (79), we can conclude that:


      YES, mercury has a higher atomic number than gold.'
