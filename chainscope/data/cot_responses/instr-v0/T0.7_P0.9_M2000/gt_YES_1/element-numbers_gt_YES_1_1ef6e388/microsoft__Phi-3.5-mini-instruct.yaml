      of an atom of that element. It uniquely identifies the element.


      Step 2: Find the atomic numbers for sodium (Na) and oxygen (O).


      - Sodium (Na) has an atomic number of 11.

      - Oxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers of sodium and oxygen.


      11 (sodium) > 8 (oxygen)


      Step 4: Determine if the statement "sodium has a higher atomic number than oxygen"
      is true.


      Based on the comparison, sodium (with atomic number 11) does indeed have a higher
      atomic number than oxygen (with atomic number 8).


      Answer: YES, sodium has a higher atomic number than oxygen.'

      From the periodic table:


      - Sodium (Na) has an atomic number of 11.

      - Oxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8.


      Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers.


      Now that we know the atomic numbers, we can compare them. Sodium has an atomic
      number of 11, while oxygen has an atomic number of 8.


      Step 4: Determine if sodium has a higher atomic number than oxygen.


      Since 11 (sodium''s atomic number) is greater than 8 (oxygen''s atomic number),
