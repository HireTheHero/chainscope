      \n1. **Understanding Atomic Number:** The atomic number of an element is the\
      \ number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element.\n\n2. **Identifying\
      \ Silver:** Silver is represented by the chemical symbol **Ag** and has an atomic\
      \ number of **47**.\n\n3. **Identifying Gold:** Gold is represented by the chemical\
      \ symbol **Au** and has an atomic number of **79**.\n\n4. **Comparing the Atomic\
      \ Numbers:** When comparing the two atomic numbers:\n   - Gold (79) versus Silver\
      \ (47)\n   - 79 is greater than 47.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**Yes**, gold has\
      \ a higher atomic number than silver."
