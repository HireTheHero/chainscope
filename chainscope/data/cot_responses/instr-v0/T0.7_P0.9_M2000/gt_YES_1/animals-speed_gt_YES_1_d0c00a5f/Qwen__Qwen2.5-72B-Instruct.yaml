      3. **Comparison**: Comparing the two, the cheetah''s top speed of 70-75 mph
      is significantly higher than the lion''s top speed of 50 mph.


      Given these facts, the answer is:


      **YES**, a cheetah can run faster than a lion.'

      faster than a lion, let''s break down the information we need:


      1. **Cheetah Speed**: Cheetahs are known for their incredible speed. They can
      reach speeds of up to 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour) in short bursts.


      2. **Lion Speed**: Lions, while also fast, do not match the cheetah''s top speed.
      Lions can run at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour).


      3. **Comparison**: Comparing the two, the cheetah''s top speed of 70 mph is
      significantly higher than the lion''s top speed of 50 mph.

    a687f5ee-c972-4bab-a7b1-82deff025412: 'To determine if a cheetah can run faster
      than a lion, let''s consider the following steps:


      1. **Cheetah''s Speed**: Cheetahs are known for their incredible speed. They
      can reach speeds of up to 60-70 miles per hour (97-113 kilometers per hour)
      in short bursts.


      2. **Lion''s Speed**: Lions are also fast, but they do not match the speed of
      cheetahs. Lions can run at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers
      per hour).


      3. **Comparison**: When comparing the top speeds of both animals, the cheetah''s
      maximum speed (60-70 mph) is higher than the lion''s maximum speed (50 mph).
