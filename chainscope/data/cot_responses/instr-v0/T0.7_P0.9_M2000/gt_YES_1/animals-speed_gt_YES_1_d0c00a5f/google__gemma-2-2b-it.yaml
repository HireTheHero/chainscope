      \ **Size and Build:** Elephants are generally much larger than hippos. They\
      \ have a longer leg structure and a heavier body mass. \n2. **Purpose:**  Hippos\
      \ are adapted for living in water, spending most of their time in it. Elephants\
      \ are land animals and are built for long-distance travel.\n3. **Speed:**  While\
      \ hippos can swim at surprisingly good speeds, their body structure is not designed\
