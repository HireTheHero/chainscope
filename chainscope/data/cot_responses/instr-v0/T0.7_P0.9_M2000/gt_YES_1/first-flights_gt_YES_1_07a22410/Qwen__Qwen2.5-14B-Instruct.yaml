    7958adbb-16d7-4ff1-a57e-7abbbde5d165: 'To answer this question, we need to consider
      the dates of the first flights of both the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright
      Flyer.


      1. **Wright Flyer**: The Wright Flyer made its historic first flight on December
      17, 1903, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This was the first powered, heavier-than-air
      machine to achieve controlled, sustained flight with a pilot aboard.


      2. **Spirit of St. Louis**: The Spirit of St. Louis was flown by Charles Lindbergh
      on its transatlantic solo flight from New York City to Paris, France, but the
      first flight of the aircraft itself took place before that. It was built in
      1927, and its initial test flight occurred on May 10, 1927.


      Comparing the dates:

      - Wright Flyer''s first flight: December 17, 1903.

      - Spirit of St. Louis'' first flight: May 10, 1927.


      Since 1927 is significantly later than 1903, it is clear that the Spirit of
      St. Louis made its first flight after the Wright Flyer did.

      1. Identify the dates of the first flights of both the Spirit of St. Louis and
      the Wright Flyer.

      2. Compare these dates to determine which aircraft made its first flight later.


      **Step 1: Identify the dates**


      - **Wright Flyer**: The Wright brothers made their historic first flight in
      the Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903.

      - **Spirit of St. Louis**: Charles Lindbergh flew the Spirit of St. Louis for
      the first time on May 20, 1927, from Roosevelt Field near New York City to Le
      Bourget Field in Paris, but its first test flight occurred earlier, on May 10,
      1927.


      **Step 2: Compare the dates**


      The Wright Flyer''s first flight was in 1903, while the Spirit of St. Louis''s
      first flight (test flight) was in 1927.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**, the Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight
      after the Wright Flyer.'

      1. **Wright Flyer:** The Wright brothers made the first successful powered,
      heavier-than-air flight with the Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903.


      2. **Spirit of St. Louis:** Charles Lindbergh flew the Spirit of St. Louis on
      its transatlantic flight in May 1927, but its first flight actually occurred
      earlier. The Spirit of St. Louis had its first test flight in February 1927.


      Now comparing these dates:

      - First flight of the Wright Flyer: December 17, 1903

      - First flight of the Spirit of St. Louis: February 1927 (approximately February
      23, 1927)

      1. Identify the first flight date of the Boeing 737.

      2. Identify the first flight date of the SR-71 Blackbird.

      3. Compare these dates to determine which aircraft made its first flight later.


      Step 1: The Boeing 737 made its first flight on February 9, 1967.


      Step 2: The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on December 22, 1964.
