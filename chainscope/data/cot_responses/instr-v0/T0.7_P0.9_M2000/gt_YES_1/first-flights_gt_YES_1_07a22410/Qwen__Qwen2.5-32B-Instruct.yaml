      made its first flight after the Concorde, we need to compare their respective
      first flight dates.


      Step 1: Identify the first flight date of the Concorde.

      The Concorde made its first flight on March 2, 1969.


      Step 2: Identify the first flight date of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

      The F-16 Fighting Falcon made its first flight on January 20, 1974.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      Since January 20, 1974 (F-16''s first flight) comes after March 2, 1969 (Concorde''s
      first flight), the F-16 did indeed make its first flight after the Concorde.

      The Concorde, a supersonic passenger jet, made its first test flight on March
      2, 1969.


      Step 2: Identify the first flight date of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

      The F-16 Fighting Falcon, a multirole fighter aircraft, made its maiden flight
      on January 20, 1974.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Given that the Concorde''s first flight was in 1969 and the F-16''s first flight
      was in 1974, the F-16 indeed made its first flight after the Concorde.
