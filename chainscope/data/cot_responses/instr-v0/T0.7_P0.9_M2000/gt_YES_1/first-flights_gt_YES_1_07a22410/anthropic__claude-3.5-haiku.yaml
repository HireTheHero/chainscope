      - The Wright Flyer made its first successful powered flight on December 17,
      1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina


      2. Next, identify when the Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight:

      - The Spirit of St. Louis was built in 1927

      - Charles Lindbergh flew it from New York to Paris in May 1927, completing the
      first solo non-stop transatlantic flight


      3. Compare the dates:

      - Wright Flyer: First flight in 1903

      - Spirit of St. Louis: First flight in 1927


      4. Conclusion:

      - The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight AFTER the Wright Flyer

    a373bc4c-5a62-42ea-9beb-687923916979: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, the Wright Flyer was the first successful powered, controlled, sustained
      aircraft, which made its historic first flight on December 17, 1903.


      2. The Spirit of St. Louis was the airplane Charles Lindbergh flew in his famous
      transatlantic flight in May 1927.


      3. Since the Wright Flyer flew in 1903 and the Spirit of St. Louis flew in 1927,
      the Spirit of St. Louis came much later.


      4. Therefore, the Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight after the Wright

    baeea92c-04a0-43ca-93b3-33f71006a3fa: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, recall the Wright Flyer:

      - The Wright Brothers first flew their aircraft, the Wright Flyer, in 1903

      - This was the first powered, controlled, sustained flight by a heavier-than-air
      aircraft


      2. Next, consider the Spirit of St. Louis:

      - This was the aircraft Charles Lindbergh flew in his famous transatlantic flight
      in 1927

      - This means the Spirit of St. Louis was built much later than the Wright Flyer


      3. Comparing their first flights:

      - The Wright Flyer made its first flight in 1903

      - The Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight in 1927


      4. Conclusion:

      Since the Spirit of St. Louis first flew in 1927, which is after the Wright
      Flyer''s first flight in 1903, the answer is:


      YES'
