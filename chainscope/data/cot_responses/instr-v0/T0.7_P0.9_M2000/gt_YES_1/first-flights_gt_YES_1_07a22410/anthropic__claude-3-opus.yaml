      Falcon made its first flight after the Concorde, let''s break down the question
      and find the relevant information:


      Step 1: Identify the first flight date of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

      The F-16 Fighting Falcon, also known as the "Viper," made its first flight on
      January 20, 1974.


      Step 2: Identify the first flight date of the Concorde.

      The Concorde, a supersonic passenger airliner, made its first flight on March
      2, 1969.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates of the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Concorde.

      The Concorde''s first flight (March 2, 1969) occurred before the F-16 Fighting
      Falcon''s first flight (January 20, 1974).

      The Spirit of St. Louis was the aircraft Charles Lindbergh used for his famous

      Step 1: Determine the first flight date of the P-51 Mustang.

      The P-51 Mustang was a World War II fighter aircraft. It was developed in the
      early 1940s and first flew on October 26, 1940.

      3. The B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic

      4. Given that the P-51 Mustang was used during World War II, it must have had
      its first flight before the end of the war in 1945.


      5. Since the B-52 Stratofortress entered service in the 1950s, it is likely
      that its first flight took place after World War II, and therefore after the

      The P-51 Mustang was a World War II fighter aircraft. It was introduced in 1942

      taken place before or during 1942.

      The B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic bomber.
