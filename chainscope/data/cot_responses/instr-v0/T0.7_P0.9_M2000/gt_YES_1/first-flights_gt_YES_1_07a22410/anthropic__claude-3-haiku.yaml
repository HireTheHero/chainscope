      we need to follow these steps:


      Step 1: Identify the key information in the question.

      - The question is asking about the first flight of the F-16 Fighting Falcon
      in relation to the first flight of the Concorde.


      Step 2: Gather relevant information about the first flights of the F-16 and
      the Concorde.

      - The F-16 Fighting Falcon made its first flight on December 8, 1976.

      - The Concorde made its first flight on March 2, 1969.


      Step 3: Compare the first flight dates of the F-16 and the Concorde.

      - The F-16 made its first flight after the Concorde made its first flight.


      Step 4: Provide the final YES or NO answer.

      Based on the information gathered, the answer to the question "Did the F-16
      Fighting Falcon make its first flight after the Concorde?" is:


      YES'
