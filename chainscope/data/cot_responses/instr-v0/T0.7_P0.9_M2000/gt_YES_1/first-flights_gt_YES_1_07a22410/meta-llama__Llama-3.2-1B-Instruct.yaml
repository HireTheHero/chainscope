      bomber that was in service from 1956 to 1994.

      2. Identify the SR-71 Blackbird: The SR-71 Blackbird is a supersonic reconnaissance
      plane that was in service from 1964 to 1998.

      3. Consider the production and delivery schedule: The SR-71 Blackbird was produced
      in two batches, with the first batch beginning production in 1964 and the second
      batch starting production in 1966.

      4. Analyze the flight data: According to various sources, including the National
      Air and Space Museum, the SR-71 Blackbird made its first flight on October 1,
      1964.

      and 1940s, and it was used by several airlines, including Imperial Airways and
      British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).

      an airliner, while the Spitfire was a fighter aircraft. The Spitfire made its
      first flight in 1936, while the DC-3 was introduced in the late 1930s.

      The Spitfire, on the other hand, was a British single-seat fighter aircraft
