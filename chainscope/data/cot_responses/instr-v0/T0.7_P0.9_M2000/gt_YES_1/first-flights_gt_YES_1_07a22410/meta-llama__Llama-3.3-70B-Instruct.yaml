      3. **Compare the dates of the first flights**: The Wright Flyer''s first flight
      was in 1903, and the Spirit of St. Louis''s historic flight was in 1927.


      Given these steps, it''s clear that the Spirit of St. Louis made its first flight
      (and its historic transatlantic flight) many years after the Wright Flyer''s
      first flight. Therefore, the answer to whether the Spirit of St. Louis made

      1. **Wright Flyer''s First Flight**: The Wright Flyer, designed and built by
      the Wright brothers, made its first successful flight on December 17, 1903.
      This event marked the beginning of controlled, powered, and sustained heavier-than-air
      human flight.


      2. **Spirit of St. Louis''s First Flight**: The Spirit of St. Louis, famously
      flown by Charles Lindbergh, was designed and built for his historic solo non-stop
      transatlantic flight in 1927. However, before attempting the transatlantic flight,
      the aircraft had to undergo test flights. The Spirit of St. Louis made its first
      flight on April 28, 1927.

      - The Wright Flyer first flew in 1903.

      the first flight dates of both the Boeing 737 and the SR-71 Blackbird.


      1. **Identify the first flight date of the Boeing 737**: The Boeing 737 made
      its first flight on April 9, 1967.


      2. **Identify the first flight date of the SR-71 Blackbird**: The SR-71 Blackbird
      made its first flight on December 22, 1964.


      3. **Compare the first flight dates**: Since the SR-71 Blackbird first flew
      in 1964 and the Boeing 737 first flew in 1967, the Boeing 737 made its first
      flight after the SR-71 Blackbird.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **YES**.'
    c8daeff9-44fe-4a9f-9e5e-691799e5c06d: 'To determine if the Boeing 737 made its
      first flight after the SR-71 Blackbird, let''s consider the first flight dates
      of both aircraft.


      1. **SR-71 Blackbird First Flight**: The SR-71 Blackbird, a supersonic reconnaissance
      plane developed by Lockheed Skunk Works, made its first flight on December 22,
      1964.


      2. **Boeing 737 First Flight**: The Boeing 737, a short- to medium-haul, narrow-body
      commercial passenger jet airliner, made its first flight on April 9, 1967.


      Given these dates, the Boeing 737 made its first flight approximately 2 years
      and 3 months after the SR-71 Blackbird''s first flight.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **YES**.'
    cb6ac4af-17a0-42d6-8f6d-14028a69b42e: 'To answer this question, let''s break it
      down into steps:


      1. **Identify the first flight date of the Boeing 737**: The Boeing 737 made
      its first flight on April 9, 1967.


      2. **Identify the first flight date of the SR-71 Blackbird**: The SR-71 Blackbird
      made its first flight on December 22, 1964.


      3. **Compare the first flight dates**: Since the SR-71 Blackbird''s first flight
      was in 1964 and the Boeing 737''s first flight was in 1967, the Boeing 737 made
      its first flight after the SR-71 Blackbird.


      Based on the comparison, the answer is: **YES**'
