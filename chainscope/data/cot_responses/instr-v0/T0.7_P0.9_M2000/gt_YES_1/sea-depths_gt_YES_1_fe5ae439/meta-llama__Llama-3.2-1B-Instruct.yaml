      The North Sea is a marginal sea located in the North Sea, bounded by the British

      To determine if the Irish Sea is deeper than the Yellow Sea, we need to consider

      1. **Understand the definitions**: The Irish Sea is a body of water located
      between the UK and Ireland, and it''s a semi-enclosed sea.

      The Yellow Sea, on the other hand, is a part of the East China Sea, located

      you may be able to find the information you need to answer this question.

      The Arabian Sea is one of the five oceans, but it is smaller than the Pacific
