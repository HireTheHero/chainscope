      \ the question:\n\n1. **Location:**  The Sargasso Sea is in the North Atlantic\
      \ Ocean. The Tasman Sea is in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.\n2. **Depth:**\
      \  Depth is a measure of how far underwater a body of water is.\n3. **Oceanic\
      \ Size:**  Oceans are vast bodies of water, and their depth varies significantly.\
      \ \n4. **General Knowledge:**  The oceans are generally quite deep, with the\
      \ deepest parts of the ocean being in the Pacific and Atlantic basins.\n\n**Conclusion:**\
      \  We can't definitively determine the depth of either the Sargasso Sea or the\
      \ Tasman Sea without specific data and research.  \n\n**Therefore, the answer\
