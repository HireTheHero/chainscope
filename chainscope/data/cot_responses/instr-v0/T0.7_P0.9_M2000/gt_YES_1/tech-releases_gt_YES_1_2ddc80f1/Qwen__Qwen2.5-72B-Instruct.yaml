    46be38ec-302f-43bc-a6c2-c7b9ad8064aa: 'To determine if the VHS Player was released
      after the Xerox Alto, let''s look at the release dates for both:


      1. **Xerox Alto**: The Xerox Alto was developed in 1973 at Xerox PARC (Palo
      Alto Research Center). It was one of the first computers designed for individual
      use with a graphical user interface (GUI).


      2. **VHS Player**: The VHS (Video Home System) format was introduced by JVC
      (Victor Company of Japan) in September 1976. The first VHS players became commercially
      available around this time.
