      look at the release dates of both products:


      1. The IBM Personal Computer was first released on August 12, 1981.

      2. The Sony Walkman, model TPS-L2, was introduced in July 1979.


      Given these dates, we can see that the Sony Walkman preceded the IBM Personal
      Computer by about two years.
