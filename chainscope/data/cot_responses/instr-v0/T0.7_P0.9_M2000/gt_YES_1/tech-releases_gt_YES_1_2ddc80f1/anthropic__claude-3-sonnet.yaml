      Step 1: Find the release year of the TRS-80.

      The TRS-80, also known as the Tandy Radio Shack Micro Computer System, was a
      pioneering personal computer introduced by Tandy Corporation in 1977.


      Step 2: Find the release year of the VHS player.

      The VHS (Video Home System) format was introduced by JVC in 1976. The first
      VHS player, the HR-3300, was released in Japan in late 1976.


      Step 3: Compare the release years.

      The TRS-80 was released in 1977, while the VHS player was released in 1976.

      1. The Sony Walkman, the world''s first portable audio cassette player, was
      released in July 1979.


      2. The IBM Personal Computer, also known as the IBM PC or IBM 5150, was IBM''s
      first personal computer and was introduced on August 12, 1981.


      3. Since the Sony Walkman was released in 1979, and the IBM Personal Computer
      was released in 1981, this means that the IBM Personal Computer was released
      after the Sony Walkman.


      After going through the reasoning, the answer is:


      YES, the IBM Personal Computer was released after the Sony Walkman.'
