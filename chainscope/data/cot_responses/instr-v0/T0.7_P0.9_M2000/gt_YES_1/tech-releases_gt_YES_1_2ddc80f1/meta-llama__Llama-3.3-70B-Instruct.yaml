      1. **Xerox Alto Release Year**: The Xerox Alto was a revolutionary computer
      designed to be a personal workstation, and it was first introduced in 1973.


      2. **Polaroid SX-70 Release Year**: The Polaroid SX-70 is a type of instant
      film camera that was introduced by Polaroid in 1972. It was known for its ability
      to produce a physical photograph shortly after taking the picture.


      Given these release years:

      - The Polaroid SX-70 was released in 1972.

      - The Xerox Alto was released in 1973.


      Since 1973 is after 1972, the Xerox Alto was indeed released after the Polaroid
      SX-70.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      the steps to determine the release order of these two computers:


      1. **Identify the Release Year of the ZX Spectrum**: The ZX Spectrum, a home
      computer developed by Sinclair Research, was released in the United Kingdom
      in 1982.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of the IBM Personal Computer**: The IBM Personal
      Computer (IBM PC), developed and marketed by IBM, was released on August 12,
      1981.


      3. **Compare the Release Years**: By comparing the release years, we can determine
      which computer was released first. The IBM PC was released in 1981, and the
      ZX Spectrum was released in 1982.


      Given these steps, the conclusion is that the ZX Spectrum was indeed released
      after the IBM Personal Computer.

      the release dates of both the VHS player and the Xerox Alto.


      1. **Xerox Alto Release Date**: The Xerox Alto was a computer developed in the
      early 1970s. It was first introduced in 1973. The Alto was a groundbreaking
      computer that was the first to use a graphical user interface (GUI), among other
      innovations.


      2. **VHS Player Release Date**: The VHS (Video Home System) player was introduced
      by JVC (Victor Company of Japan, Limited) in 1976. It was a home video format
      that became widely popular in the late 1970s and 1980s, known for its videocassette
      tapes used for playing back recorded video content.


      Now, comparing the release dates:

      - The Xerox Alto was released in 1973.

      - The VHS player was released in 1976.


      Given these dates, it''s clear that the VHS player was released after the Xerox
      Alto.
