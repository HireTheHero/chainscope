      **Step 1: Identify the Release Date of the Apple II**

      - The Apple II, one of Apple''s early personal computers, was officially released
      in April 1977.


      **Step 2: Identify the Introduction of the VHS Player**

      - The VHS (Video Home System) format was developed by JVC in 1976.

      - The first VHS VCRs (Video Cassette Recorders), which allowed consumers to
      play VHS tapes, were introduced to the market in the mid to late 1970s.

      - Specifically, commercial VHS VCRs became available around 1977.
