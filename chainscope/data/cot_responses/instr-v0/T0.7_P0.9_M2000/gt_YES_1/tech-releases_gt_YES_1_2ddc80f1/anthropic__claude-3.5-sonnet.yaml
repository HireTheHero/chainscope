      - And in September 1995 in North America and Europe


      2. Now, let me recall Windows 95''s release date:

      3. Comparing the dates:

      - PlayStation came first in Japan (December 1994)

      - Windows 95 was released after that (August 1995)

      - Even though PlayStation came to US/Europe after Windows 95, the product itself
