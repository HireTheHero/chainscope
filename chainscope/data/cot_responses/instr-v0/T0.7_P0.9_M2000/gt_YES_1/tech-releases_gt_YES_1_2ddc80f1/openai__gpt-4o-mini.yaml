      Now, comparing these dates:


      - The Sony Walkman was released in July 1979.

      - The IBM Personal Computer was released in August 1981.


      Since August 1981 is after July 1979, we can conclude that the IBM Personal
      Computer was indeed released after the Sony Walkman.


      Thus, the answer is: YES.'
