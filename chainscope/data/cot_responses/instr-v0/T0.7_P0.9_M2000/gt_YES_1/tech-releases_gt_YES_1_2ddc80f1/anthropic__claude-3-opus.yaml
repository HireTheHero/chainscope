      later. In the United States, for example, the first VHS players were introduced
      in 1977.


      4. While the VHS format was introduced slightly earlier than the Apple II, the
      consumer-ready VHS players and the Apple II computer were both introduced to
      the market around the same time, with the Apple II being released in the same
      year that VHS players became available in the United States.


      5. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the Apple II was released after
      the VHS player, as they were introduced to the market at roughly the same time.


      So, to answer the question: Was the Apple II released after the VHS Player?


      NO.'

      Step 2: Find the release date of the IBM Personal Computer.

      The IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) was released on August 12, 1981.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      The IBM PC was released in August 1981, while the Commodore 64 was released
      in August 1982. This means that the Commodore 64 was released approximately
      one year after the IBM PC.

      Step 2: Determine the release year of the VHS Player.

      The VHS (Video Home System) format was developed by JVC (Victor Company of Japan)
      and released in Japan in 1976. The first VHS players were introduced to the
      consumer market in 1977.


      Step 3: Compare the release years of the Xerox Alto and the VHS Player.

      The Xerox Alto was developed in 1973, while the VHS Player was released in 1976
      (Japan) and 1977 (worldwide).


      Therefore, the answer is YES, the VHS Player was released after the Xerox Alto.'
