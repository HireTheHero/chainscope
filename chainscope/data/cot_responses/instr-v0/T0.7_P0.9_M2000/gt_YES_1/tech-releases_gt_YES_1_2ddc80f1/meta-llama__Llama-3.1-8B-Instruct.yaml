      * The first generation of the Amazon Kindle was released on November 19, 2007.

      * The original Xbox was released on November 15, 2001.

      * The Xbox 360 was released on November 22, 2005.

      - The Xerox Alto was released in 1973.

      - The Polaroid SX-70 was released in 1972.


      Step 2: Compare the release dates of the two devices.

      - Since the Polaroid SX-70 was released in 1972 and the Xerox Alto in 1973,
      the Xerox Alto was released after the Polaroid SX-70.


      Based on these steps, the answer is:


      YES'

      computer system developed by Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) and was
      first released in 1973.


      2. **Identify the VHS Player''s release date**: The first VHS (Video Home System)
      player was released in Japan in 1976 by JVC (Victor Company of Japan).


      3. **Compare the release dates**: The VHS Player was released in 1976, and the
      Xerox Alto was released in 1973.


      4. **Determine the relationship**: Since 1976 is after 1973, the VHS Player
      was released after the Xerox Alto.


      **YES**'
