      NO, the Microsoft Windows 95 was not released after the Sony PlayStation. It
      was released after the PlayStation, but not "after" in the sense that it was
      released later in the same year.

      Since the question does not specify a particular country, we need to consider
      both scenarios. The Apple II was released after the VHS Player in some countries
      (e.g., the United States) but before in others (e.g., Japan). Without a specific
      context, it''s challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO answer.


      If we must choose a general answer, we might lean towards NO, as the VHS Player
      was introduced in Japan before the Apple II, but it''s essential to clarify
      the context when providing such an answer.


      Given the ambiguity, a more appropriate response might be:


      NO, but with the caveat that the release order depends on the country in question.
