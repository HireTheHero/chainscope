      1. **Xerox Alto**: The Xerox Alto was a prototype computer developed at Xerox
      PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) in the late 1970s. It was one of the first
      computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. The first Alto prototype
      was completed in 1973, but it wasn''t commercially available.


      2. **VHS Player**: The VHS (Video Home System) format for video recording and
      playback was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The first commercial
      VHS player was launched by JVC in Japan in September 1976. It became widely
      available in the United States by the mid-1980s.


      Given this information:

      - The Xerox Alto was developed in the late 1970s but was not commercially available
      until much later.

      - The first VHS player was commercially available in the mid-1970s.
