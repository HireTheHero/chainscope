      \ step:\n\n**Step 1:** *Determine the melting point of iron.*\n\n- The melting\
      \ point of iron is approximately **1,538\xB0C** (2,800\xB0F).\n\n**Step 2:**\
      \ *Determine the melting point of copper.*\n\n- The melting point of copper\
      \ is approximately **1,085\xB0C** (1,984\xB0F).\n\n**Step 3:** *Compare the\
      \ two melting points.*\n\n- **1,538\xB0C (Iron)** vs. **1,085\xB0C (Copper)**\n\
      \n**Conclusion:**  \nYes, iron has a higher melting point than copper."
