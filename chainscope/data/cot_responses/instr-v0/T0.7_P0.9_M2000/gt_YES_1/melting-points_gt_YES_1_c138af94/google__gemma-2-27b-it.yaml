      1. **Recall what melting point means:** Melting point is the temperature at\
      \ which a solid turns into a liquid.\n2. **Consider the properties of iron:**\
      \ Iron is known to be a strong, durable metal often used in construction and\
      \ manufacturing. This suggests it has a high melting point.\n3. **Consider the\
      \ properties of copper:** Copper is also a metal, but it is softer and more\
      \ malleable than iron. This might suggest a lower melting point.\n4. **Compare:**\
      \  Iron is generally considered to be a more robust metal than copper.\n\n**Answer:\
      \ YES** \n\n\nIron has a higher melting point than copper. \n\n"
