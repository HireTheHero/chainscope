      2. Transition metals tend to have lower melting points than post-transition

      is because the atomic radii decrease, which allows the atoms to gain more energy

      2. Identify the positions of silver and aluminum in the periodic table: Silver
      (Ag) is in Group 11, and aluminum (Al) is in Group 13.


      3. Compare the positions: Since silver is in Group 11 and aluminum is in Group
      13, it is clear that silver is to the right of aluminum in the periodic table.


      4. Recall the general trend for metals in the same group: As you move down a
      group, the melting point increases. This is because the atoms in the same group

      To determine the answer, I''ll go through the steps:


      1. Identify the elements: Silver (Ag) and aluminum (Al).

      2. Recall their atomic masses: Silver''s atomic mass is approximately 107.87
      g/mol, while aluminum''s atomic mass is approximately 26.98 g/mol.

      3. Recall their atomic numbers: Silver''s atomic number is 47, while aluminum''s
      atomic number is 13.

      4. Recall the atomic weights of the isotopes: Silver has two stable isotopes
      (107.87 g/mol and 109.87 g/mol), while aluminum has one stable isotope (26.98
      g/mol).

      5. Recall the relationship between atomic mass and atomic weight: The atomic
      weight of an element is approximately equal to its atomic mass.

      6. Compare the atomic masses: Silver''s atomic mass (107.87 g/mol) is greater
      than aluminum''s atomic mass (26.98 g/mol).

      7. Determine the melting point: The melting point of a substance is the temperature
      at which it changes state from solid to liquid.


      Since silver''s atomic mass is greater than aluminum''s atomic mass, silver
      will have a higher melting point than aluminum.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      \nTo determine whether silver has a higher melting point than aluminum, let's\
      \ analyze the properties of both metals.\n\nSilver (Ag) has a melting point\
      \ of 962\xB0C (1764\xB0F), while aluminum (Al) has a melting point of 660.32\xB0\
      C (1220.58\xB0F).\n\nFirst, we need to consider the atomic masses of these two\
      \ metals. The atomic mass of silver is approximately 107.8682 g/mol, while the\
      \ atomic mass of aluminum is approximately 26.9815 g/mol.\n\nNow, let's calculate\
      \ the heat capacity of each metal. Heat capacity is the amount of heat energy\
      \ required to raise the temperature of a substance by one degree Celsius (or\
      \ Kelvin). We can estimate the heat capacity using the following formula:\n\n\
      Heat capacity (J/g\xB0C) = (molecular weight) / (atomic mass)\n\nFor silver:\n\
      Heat capacity = 107.8682 g/mol / 107.8682 g/mol \u2248 1.0000 J/g\xB0C\n\nFor\
      \ aluminum:\nHeat capacity = 26.9815 g/mol / 26.9815 g/mol \u2248 0.9986 J/g\xB0\
      C\n\nNext, we need to consider the thermal expansion coefficients of these two\
      \ metals. Thermal expansion coefficient is a measure of how much a substance\
      \ expands per unit change in temperature. We can estimate the thermal expansion\
      \ coefficient using the following formula:\n\nThermal expansion coefficient\
      \ (1/K) = (1/\u0394H) / (V \\* \u0394T)\n\nwhere \u0394H is the enthalpy change,\
      \ V is the molar volume, and \u0394T is the change in temperature.\n\nFor silver:\n\
      Thermal expansion coefficient \u2248 (1/\u0394H) / (V \\* \u0394T) \u2248 (1/66.45\

      \ required to raise the temperature of each metal by one degree Celsius (or\
      \ Kelvin). Let's assume that the heat capacity is directly proportional to the\
      \ thermal expansion coefficient.\n\nFor silver:\nHeat capacity = (Thermal expansion\
      \ coefficient) \\* (\u0394T) \u2248 (0.0368 K^-1) \\* (1 K) \u2248 0.0368 J/g\xB0\

      T) \u2248 (0.0213 K^-1) \\* (1 K) \u2248 0.0213 J/g\xB0C\n\nNow, let's compare\
      \ the heat capacities of silver and aluminum. We can see that the heat capacity\
      \ of silver is approximately twice that of aluminum.\n\nFinally, we can calculate\
      \ the melting points of these two metals using the heat capacities and thermal\
      \ expansion coefficients. Let's assume that the heat capacity is directly proportional\
      \ to the melting point.\n\nFor silver:\nMelting point = Heat capacity / (Thermal\
      \ expansion coefficient) \u2248 0.0368 J/g\xB0C / (0.0368 K^-1) \u2248 1000\

      \ \u2248 0.0213 J/g\xB0C / (0.0213 K^-1) \u2248 1000 K\n\nWe can see that the\

      4. Silver, on the other hand, is a more reactive metal, which means it is more
      likely to melt at lower temperatures.
