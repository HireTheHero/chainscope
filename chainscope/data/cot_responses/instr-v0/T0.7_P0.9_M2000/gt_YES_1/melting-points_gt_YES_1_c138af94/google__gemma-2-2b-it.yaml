      \ We need to know the melting points of iron and copper.\n2. **Identify:** \
      \ According to reliable sources, the melting point of iron is 1538 degrees Celsius.\n\
      3. **Compare:** The melting point of copper is 1085 degrees Celsius.\n4. **Compare\
      \ again:**  We see that iron's melting point is higher than copper's.\n\n**Answer:**\
      \ YES \n"

      \n1. **What are melting points?** Melting points are the temperatures at which\
      \ a solid turns into a liquid. \n2. **What are the properties of iron and copper?**\
      \ Both iron and copper are metals. Metals tend to have high melting points.\
      \ \n3. **General trends:**  Generally, metals with a higher atomic weight have\
      \ a higher melting point.\n4. **Comparing the atomic weights:** Iron has a higher\
      \ atomic weight than copper.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is YES.** \n"

      \n1. **Melting point** is the temperature at which a solid turns into a liquid.\
      \ \n2. **Iron and copper** are both metals.\n3. **Metals** generally have high\
      \ melting points. \n4. **Generally speaking**, higher melting points mean the\

      \ the answer is likely YES.** \n\n**However, it's important to note:**\n\n*\
      \ There can be slight variations in melting points between specific types of\
      \ iron and copper. \n* The exact melting points are found in reference materials.\
