      Step 2: Compare the melting points.


      Now, let''s compare the two melting points. Aluminum''s melting point is 660.3
      degrees Celsius, and zinc''s melting point is 419.53 degrees Celsius.


      Step 3: Determine if aluminum has a higher melting point than zinc.


      Since 660.3 degrees Celsius (aluminum''s melting point) is greater than 419.53
      degrees Celsius (zinc''s melting point), we can conclude that aluminum does
      have a higher melting point than zinc.


      Answer: YES, aluminum has a higher melting point than zinc.'
