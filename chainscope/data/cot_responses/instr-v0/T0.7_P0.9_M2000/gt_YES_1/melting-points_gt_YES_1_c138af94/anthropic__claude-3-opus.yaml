      1. Melting point is the temperature at which a substance changes from a solid
      to a liquid state.


      2. Lead and tin are both metallic elements.


      3. Generally, metals with higher atomic numbers tend to have higher melting
      points due to stronger metallic bonding.


      4. The atomic number of lead (Pb) is 82, while the atomic number of tin (Sn)
      is 50.


      5. Since lead has a higher atomic number than tin, it is likely to have stronger
      metallic bonding.


      6. Stronger metallic bonding usually results in a higher melting point.


      Therefore, based on the atomic numbers and the general trend of metallic bonding
      strength, it is reasonable to conclude that lead has a higher melting point
      than tin.
