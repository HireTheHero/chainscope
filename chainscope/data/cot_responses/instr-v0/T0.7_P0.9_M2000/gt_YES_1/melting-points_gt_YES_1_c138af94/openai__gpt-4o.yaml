      **Answer: YES**'
    ddc8f332-f738-4ba7-88b6-a82da34089c8: "To determine whether iron has a higher\
      \ melting point than copper, let's consider the melting points of both metals:\n\
      \n1. **Melting Point of Iron**: Iron has a melting point of approximately 1538\xB0\
      C (2800\xB0F).\n\n2. **Melting Point of Copper**: Copper has a melting point\
      \ of approximately 1085\xB0C (1985\xB0F).\n\nNow, comparing these values:\n\n\
      - Iron's melting point (1538\xB0C) is higher than copper's melting point (1085\xB0\

    fec934e4-d834-40eb-a19e-10e7ab4fc513: 'To answer whether iron has a higher melting
      point than copper, we need to compare their melting points step by step:


      1. **Identify the melting point of iron:** The melting point of iron is approximately
      1,538 degrees Celsius (2,800 degrees Fahrenheit).


      2. **Identify the melting point of copper:** The melting point of copper is
      approximately 1,085 degrees Celsius (1,985 degrees Fahrenheit).


      3. **Compare the melting points:** Iron has a melting point of 1,538 degrees
      Celsius, while copper melts at 1,085 degrees Celsius.


      Based on this comparison, the answer to the question is:


      **YES**'
    ffcb78bd-6570-4a88-85fc-7ea4e9300b0b: 'To determine whether iron has a higher
      melting point than copper, let''s examine the melting points of both elements:


      1. Iron (Fe) has a melting point of approximately 1,538 degrees Celsius (2,800
      degrees Fahrenheit).

      2. Copper (Cu) has a melting point of approximately 1,085 degrees Celsius (1,985

      By comparing these values, we can see that iron''s melting point is higher than
      copper''s.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
