      melting point than lead, we need to consider the physical properties of both
      metals.


      1. **Density**: Zinc has a lower density compared to lead. This means that zinc
      will occupy more space for the same mass as lead does. Since the volume occupied
      by a substance increases at higher temperatures (because heat energy allows
      particles to move further apart), zinc''s molecules will spread out faster,
      requiring less energy to reach their new positions. Therefore, zinc melts at
      a lower temperature than lead.


      2. **Melting Point**: The melting point of an element depends on its molecular
      structure, intermolecular forces, and atomic size. Zinc has a relatively small
      atomic radius and a simple crystal lattice structure, which makes it easier
      to deform when heated without completely changing shape until all atoms melt
      simultaneously. Lead, being heavier and having a larger atomic radius, has stronger
      van der Waals forces between its atoms, making it harder to deform uniformly
      before melting.


      Given these points:

      - Zinc has a higher density than lead.

      - Zinc melts at a lower temperature because of its smaller atomic radius and
      simpler crystal structure.


      Therefore, the correct answer is: **NO**. Zinc has a lower melting point than
      lead.'

      4. **Comparison**: Given that gold has significantly stronger metallic bonds,
