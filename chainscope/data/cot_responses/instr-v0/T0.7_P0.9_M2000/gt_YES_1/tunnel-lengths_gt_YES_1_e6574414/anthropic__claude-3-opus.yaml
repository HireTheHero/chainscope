      YES, the Lincoln Tunnel is longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.'
    92833539-55af-4b09-936e-fa982a20d540: 'To determine whether the Lincoln Tunnel
      is longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, let''s gather some information and
      reason step by step:


      Step 1: Find the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

      The Lincoln Tunnel, which connects Weehawken, New Jersey, to Midtown Manhattan
      in New York City, consists of three tubes. Each tube is approximately 7,500
      feet (2,286 meters) long.


      Step 2: Find the length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

      The Sydney Harbour Tunnel, which connects the central business district of Sydney
      with the North Shore, is 2.3 kilometers (1.4 miles) long, which is approximately
      7,546 feet.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      Lincoln Tunnel: 7,500 feet (2,286 meters)

      Sydney Harbour Tunnel: 7,546 feet (2,300 meters)


      The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is slightly longer than the Lincoln Tunnel by about
      46 feet (14 meters).


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is the Lincoln Tunnel longer than the
      Sydney Harbour Tunnel?" is:


      NO'

      is longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, let''s break it down step by step:


      Step 1: Find the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

      The Lincoln Tunnel, which connects New York City and New Jersey under the Hudson
      River, has a total length of approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km).


      Step 2: Find the length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

      The Sydney Harbour Tunnel, which connects the central business district of Sydney
      with the northern suburbs, passing under Sydney Harbour, has a total length
      of approximately 1.4 miles (2.3 km).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two tunnels.

      The Lincoln Tunnel is approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long, while the Sydney
      Harbour Tunnel is approximately 1.4 miles (2.3 km) long.


      Therefore, YES, the Lincoln Tunnel is longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.'
