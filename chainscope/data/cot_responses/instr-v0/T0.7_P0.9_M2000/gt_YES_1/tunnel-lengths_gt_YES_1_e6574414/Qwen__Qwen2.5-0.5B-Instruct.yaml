    211ade43-f0b6-4792-99e3-4eaf7f861ab1: YES. The length of both the Sydney Harbour
      Tunnel and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel is approximately 6.7 kilometers each, making
      them about equal in length.
    6c2d8a8d-8211-4489-97c0-9381dd98b8e3: YES. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is significantly
      longer than the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. The length difference between these two
      tunnels varies depending on whether they are designed for high-speed rail (HST)
      or light rail (LRT). For HST tunnels, the total length typically ranges from
      10 to 20 kilometers, whereas for LRT tunnels, it can be up to 40 kilometers.
      Therefore, if we assume both tunnels have been built to their maximum capacity,
      the Sydney Harbour Tunnel would be approximately twice as long as the Queens-Midtown
      Tunnel due to its longer design for high-speed rail services.

      1. **Sydney Harbour Tunnel**: This tunnel spans 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from
      Bondi Beach in Sydney to the Port Jackson waterfront area in South Australia.
      It''s approximately 750 meters wide at its widest point.


      2. **Queens-Midtown Tunnel**: This tunnel runs from the Port Adelaide station
      in Melbourne to the northern suburbs of Melbourne, through a complex network
      of roads. It''s about 3.5 kilometers long and includes several interchanges,
      making it slightly more extensive than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.


      Given these measurements, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel indeed exceeds the length
      of the Queens-Midtown Tunnel by about 400 meters, which makes it significantly
      longer. Therefore, the answer is "YES."'

      Bridge) and the Eisenhower Tunnel both pass through Tokyo Bay in Japan, and
      they have different lengths. However, if we consider the Tokyo Bay Bridge as
      a single entity that includes both the Tokyo Bay Bridge and the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line,
      it would be shorter than the Eisenhower Tunnel. Therefore, yes, the Tokyo Bay
      Aqua-Line is indeed longer than the Eisenhower Tunnel.
    1922f620-c342-4095-b189-5e3dea06e488: YES. The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is significantly
      longer than the Eisenhower Tunnel. The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, also known as the
      Tokyo Bay Railway Line, extends from the central part of Tokyo to its southern
      suburbs. It spans about 52 kilometers (32 miles) and is designed to be the primary
      rail transportation line for Japan's eastern region. This distance makes it
      one of the longest rail lines in the world, surpassing even some of Japan's
      largest cities like Yokohama and Kobe. In contrast, the Eisenhower Tunnel connects
      Pennsylvania and Maryland across the Potomac River, which is about 67 kilometers
      long at its widest point. Therefore, the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is much longer
      than the Eisenhower Tunnel.
    496721ed-409f-4d4a-9b50-572e32ed8c16: YES. The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line (TBA) is 23

      - Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line: 16 kilometers = 16,000 meters

      - Eisenhower Tunnel: 800 meters


      Comparing these two numbers:

      16,000 meters > 800 meters


      Therefore, the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is indeed longer than the Eisenhower Tunnel.'
    ee5c5fa0-a590-4da9-b164-4e5cf67a939f: NO. The Tokyo Bay Aqua Line does not extend
      to or through the Eisenhower Tunnel in Washington D.C., which was completed
      in 1965 as part of the Interstate Highway System (IHS). The Tokyo Bay Aqua Line,
      also known as the Shinkansen (High-Speed Railway), runs from Tokyo Station to
      Yokohama Station on Japan's Mainland, connecting several cities including Kobe,
      Osaka, and Kyoto. It passes through Tokyo Bay but does not reach or cross the
      Eisenhower Tunnel located at 23rd Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington
      D.C.

    4e2d5732-5ba2-4e94-a285-6f1060391083: 'YES. The length of the Holland Tunnel and
      the Lincoln Tunnel differs significantly due to their different construction
      methods and designs:

      1. The Holland Tunnel (also known as the "Great Western Tunnel") was designed

      tunnels, which makes it slightly shorter compared to the 6.8 miles (10.7 kilometers)
      of the Lincoln Tunnel.

      2. The Lincoln Tunnel, on the other hand, was built specifically for freight
      traffic and has a total length of around 2 miles (3.2 kilometers), including
      both passenger and freight lanes.


      The difference in tunnel lengths between these two tunnels reflects the architectural

    ca555344-30dd-4d67-99c2-87d4a6f32a37: YES. The length of both tunnels can vary
      slightly due to construction errors and other factors. However, I have taken
      into account this uncertainty and determined that the lengths are approximately
      840 feet (257 meters) for both tunnels. Therefore, it is possible that the length
      difference between the two tunnels could be less than 100 feet, making the question
      somewhat ambiguous.

      The length difference between the Lincoln Tunnel and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel
      cannot be definitively determined without additional information such as actual
      distances measured at the time of construction. However, we can consider some

      1. The Lincoln Tunnel in New Jersey, USA, was completed in 1965.

      2. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia opened in 1973.

      3. Both tunnels have been significantly expanded over the years to accommodate
      larger vehicles, which could potentially extend their total lengths.


      Given that both tunnels were built using similar methods (i.e., concrete tunnel
      bored into a solid rock) and considering the expansion periods, it is reasonable
      to conclude that they are not exactly the same length but will likely differ
      slightly due to the different materials used and the varying levels of expansion
      required for large vehicles. Therefore, based on available data, we can say
      that while the two tunnels do intersect in terms of the bridge''s location and
      design, there is no definitive evidence to determine if one is longer than the
