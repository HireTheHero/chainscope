      1. First, let me recall the lengths of both tunnels:

      - The Eisenhower Tunnel in Colorado is 1.7 miles long

      - The Holland Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey is 1.6 miles long


      2. Converting both to the same unit for direct comparison:

      - 1.7 miles = 8,976 feet

      - 1.6 miles = 8,448 feet


      3. Comparing the numbers:
