      is longer than the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, we need to follow these steps:


      ### Step 1: Identify the Length of Each Tunnel


      **Sydney Harbour Tunnel**

      - The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is a pair of twin tunnels under the Sydney Harbour
      in Australia.

      - It consists of two tunnels that are approximately 1.87 kilometers (1.16 miles)
      long each.


      **Queens-Midtown Tunnel**

      - This tunnel is located in New York City, United States.

      - It consists of four lanes under the East River.

      - The main tunnel is approximately 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles) long.


      ### Step 2: Compare the Lengths


      Now we compare the lengths:

      - Sydney Harbour Tunnel: 1.87 km (each tunnel)

      - Queens-Midtown Tunnel: 2.7 km (main tunnel)


      ### Step 3: Determine Which Tunnel is Longer


      Given the lengths:

      - Each Sydney Harbour Tunnel is 1.87 km long.

      - The Queens-Midtown Tunnel''s main tunnel is 2.7 km long.


      Since 1.87 km is less than 2.7 km, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel is longer than
      the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

      The Seikan Tunnel is a railway tunnel connecting the islands of Hokkaido and
      Honshu in Japan. Its total length is approximately 53.85 kilometers (or about
      33.46 miles).


      ### Step 2: Determine the Length of the Chunnel Service Tunnel

      The Chunnel, also known as the Channel Tunnel, is the rail link under the English
      Channel between England and France. The service tunnel itself runs from Folkestone,
      Kent, to Sangatte, Northern France. Its length is approximately 50.5 kilometers

      Step 3: Determine the length of the service tunnels in the Chunnel.

      The service tunnels for the Chunnel are not typically measured separately, but
      there are two main service tunnels: one on each side of the tunnel. Each of

    f0981e2e-320d-40d5-9e92-5c84c978fe65: 'To determine whether the Seikan Tunnel
      is longer than the Chunnel Service Tunnel, we need to gather and compare the
      lengths of both tunnels.


      Step 1: Determine the length of the Seikan Tunnel.

      The Seikan Tunnel, located in Japan, runs between the main islands of Honshu
      and Hokkaido. It is approximately 53.9 km (or 33.5 miles) long.


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Chunnel Service Tunnel.

      The Chunnel Service Tunnel, part of the Channel Tunnel (also known as the Eurotunnel),
      runs underneath the English Channel between England and France. The service
      tunnel is about 50.5 km (or 31.4 miles) long.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - Seikan Tunnel: 53.9 km

      - Chunnel Service Tunnel: 50.5 km


      Step 4: Make a conclusion.

      Since 53.9 km is greater than 50.5 km, the Seikan Tunnel is longer than the
      Chunnel Service Tunnel.


      Therefore, the answer is:

      YES'

      \ longer than the Simplon Tunnel, we need to gather information about the lengths\
      \ of both tunnels. Let's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the\
      \ Lengths of Each Tunnel:**\n   - **L\xE6rdal Tunnel:** The L\xE6rdal Tunnel\
      \ is the longest road tunnel in Norway. Its length is approximately 18.2 kilometers\
      \ (11.3 miles).\n   - **Simplon Tunnel:** The Simplon Tunnel is located in Switzerland,\
