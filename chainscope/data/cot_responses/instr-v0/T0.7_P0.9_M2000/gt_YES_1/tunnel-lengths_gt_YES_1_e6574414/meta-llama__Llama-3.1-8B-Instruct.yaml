      my information, it is approximately 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers) long.

      2. The Holland Tunnel, on the other hand, is a underwater tunnel in New York
      City, USA. According to my information, it is approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 kilometers)
      long.


      Now, comparing the lengths:


      Since 1.7 miles (Eisenhower Tunnel) is greater than 1.6 miles (Holland Tunnel),
      the answer is:


      YES'

      1. The Eisenhower Tunnel is located in Colorado, USA, and it is a mountain tunnel

      1. The Seikan Tunnel is a railway tunnel in Japan, and it is a combination of
      a bored tunnel and a immersed tube tunnel. It has a total length of approximately
      53.85 kilometers (33.5 miles).

      a fraction of the main tunnel''s length.

      4. Given the lengths of the main Chunnel and the Seikan Tunnel, it''s clear
      that the Seikan Tunnel is longer than the main Chunnel.


      However, since the question asks about the Chunnel Service Tunnel, I''ll consider
      its length. While I couldn''t find a specific length for the Chunnel Service
      Tunnel, I can infer that it''s likely to be shorter than the main tunnel. Assuming
      it''s at least half the length of the main tunnel (a generous estimate), its

      Comparing this to the Seikan Tunnel''s length of 53.85 kilometers (33.5 miles),

    edcb712e-5084-463a-9d35-d484b73d9aa8: 'To answer this question, I''ll follow these
      steps:


      1. **Measure the length of the Lincoln Tunnel**: The Lincoln Tunnel is approximately
      1.5 miles (2.4 km) long.

      2. **Measure the length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel**: The Sydney Harbour Tunnel
      is approximately 1.1 kilometers (0.68 miles) long.

      3. **Compare the lengths**: Since 2.4 km is greater than 0.68 miles (or 1.1
      km), the Lincoln Tunnel is longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'
