      The Queens-Midtown Tunnel is 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) long, while the Zion-Mount
      Carmel Tunnel is 3.7 miles (6 kilometers) long.


      Step 4: Determine if the Queens-Midtown Tunnel is longer than the Zion-Mount
      Carmel Tunnel.

      Based on the comparison of lengths, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel (1.3 miles) is
      shorter than the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel (3.7 miles).


      Answer: NO, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel is not longer than the Zion-Mount Carmel

      Step 1: Researching the lengths

      - The Eisenhower Tunnel, located in Colorado, USA, has a length of approximately
      11.3 miles (18.2 kilometers).

      - The Holland Tunnel, connecting New York City, New York, USA, with Jersey City,
      New Jersey, USA, has a length of approximately 8,352 feet (2,545 meters).


      Step 2: Converting the Holland Tunnel''s length to miles for easier comparison

      - To convert feet to miles, we divide the length in feet by 5,280 (the number
