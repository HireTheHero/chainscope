      York City, is approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) long.


      2. **Sydney Harbour Tunnel**: The Sydney Harbour Tunnel, which runs under Sydney
      Harbour in Australia, is approximately 1.5 kilometers (0.93 miles) long.


      Now we can compare the two lengths:


      - Lincoln Tunnel: 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers)

      - Sydney Harbour Tunnel: 1.5 kilometers (0.93 miles)


      Since 1.5 miles is longer than 1.5 kilometers, we can conclude that the Lincoln
      Tunnel is indeed longer than the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
