      1. Identify the length of the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel.

      2. Identify the length of the Mont Blanc Tunnel.

      3. Compare the two lengths.


      Step 1: The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel (also known as the Gotthard North-South
      Road) is not actually a tunnel but a road that crosses the Alps. However, if
      we consider the question to be about the Gotthard Base Tunnel which is the longest
      railway tunnel in the world and sometimes confused with a road tunnel, it is
      important to note that there isn''t an equivalent major road tunnel at this
      location. But for the sake of answering the specific comparison asked, we''ll
      need to clarify that we''re comparing the direct tunnel lengths, not the roads
      above ground.


      However, if we interpret the question as asking about the road network through
      the Gotthard Pass, the shortest route through the St. Gotthard Pass via tunnels
      and surface roads is significantly shorter than the Mont Blanc Tunnel in terms
      of tunnel length alone.


      Step 2: The Mont Blanc Tunnel runs for approximately 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles).


      Step 3: Comparing the lengths:

      - The Gotthard Base Tunnel (railway), which is the closest reference, is much
      longer at 57 kilometers (35.4 miles).

      - However, the Mont Blanc Tunnel is specifically a road tunnel, and there isn''t
      a direct road tunnel equivalent in length comparison for the Gotthard Pass.
      If we consider just the road tunnel component, it would be significantly shorter
      than the Mont Blanc Tunnel.


      Given the direct tunnel length comparison required by the question, we need
      to conclude based on the available information that there isn''t a direct road
      tunnel at the Gotthard Pass that rivals the length of the Mont Blanc Tunnel.

      1. **Eisenhower Tunnel**: The Eisenhower Tunnel, located in Colorado on Interstate
      70, has a length of approximately 8,960 feet (1.7 miles) when considering the
      total length of the tunnel structure, but the actual distance that vehicles
      travel through the tunnel is about 5,150 feet (0.975 miles).


      2. **Holland Tunnel**: The Holland Tunnel, connecting New York City and Jersey
      City under the Hudson River, is approximately 8,341 feet (1.58 miles) long for
      each tube, totaling around 16,682 feet (3.16 miles) for both tubes combined.
