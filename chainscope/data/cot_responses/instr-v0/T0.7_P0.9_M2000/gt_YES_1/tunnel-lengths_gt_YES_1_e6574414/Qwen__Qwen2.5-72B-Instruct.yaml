      \ Service Tunnel:**\n   - The Channel Tunnel, also known as the Chunnel, is\
      \ a 50.45-kilometer (31.35-mile) rail tunnel linking Folkestone, Kent, in the\
      \ United Kingdom, with Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais, near Calais in northern France.\n\
      \   - The Chunnel consists of three tunnels: two main railway tunnels and one\
      \ service tunnel. The service tunnel runs parallel to the main tunnels and is\
      \ used for maintenance and emergency purposes.\n   - The length of the service\
      \ tunnel is the same as the main tunnels, which is 50.45 kilometers (31.35 miles).\n\
      \n2. **L\xE6rdal Tunnel:**\n   - The L\xE6rdal Tunnel is a road tunnel in Norway,\
      \ connecting the villages of L\xE6rdal and Aurland.\n   - It is the longest\
      \ road tunnel in the world, with a total length of 24.5 kilometers (15.2 miles).\n\
      \nNow, comparing the lengths:\n- Chunnel Service Tunnel: 50.45 kilometers (31.35\
      \ miles)\n- L\xE6rdal Tunnel: 24.5 kilometers (15.2 miles)\n\nSince 50.45 kilometers\
      \ is greater than 24.5 kilometers, the Chunnel Service Tunnel is indeed longer\
      \ than the L\xE6rdal Tunnel.\n\n**Answer: YES**"
