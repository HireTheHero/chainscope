      ranges from approximately 57 to 62 kilometers (35 to 39 miles).

      1. **Mont Blanc Tunnel**: The Mont Blanc Tunnel is located in Switzerland and

      ### Step 1: Lengths of Each Tunnel


      **Lincoln Tunnel**

      - The Lincoln Tunnel connects New Jersey to Manhattan across the Hudson River.

      - It has an official length of approximately **3.85 miles (6.2 kilometers)**.


      **Sydney Harbour Tunnel**

      - This tunnel runs through the Sydney Harbour in Australia.

      Now that we have the lengths:

      - Lincoln Tunnel: 3.85 miles

      - Sydney Harbour Tunnel: 10.79 miles

      \ longer than the Simplon Tunnel, we need to compare their lengths.\n\n1. **L\xE6\
      rdal Tunnel:**\n   - The L\xE6rdal Tunnel is located in Norway.\n   - It connects\
      \ the towns of L\xE6rdal and Haugstuen.\n   - The length of this tunnel is approximately\
      \ 8 kilometers (5 miles).\n\n2. **Simplon Tunnel:**\n   - The Simplon Tunnel\
      \ is situated on the border between France and Switzerland.\n   - This tunnel\
      \ is famous for being one of the highest railway tunnels in Europe.\n   - The\
      \ length of the Simplon Tunnel is about 9 kilometers (6 miles) long.\n\nNow,\
      \ comparing these two:\n- The L\xE6rdal Tunnel is 8 kilometers long.\n- The\
      \ Simplon Tunnel is 9 kilometers long.\n\nSince 8 kilometers is shorter than\
      \ 9 kilometers, the L\xE6rdal Tunnel is not longer than the Simplon Tunnel.\n\
      \n**Answer:** No."
    eada5a81-f43b-4406-b109-6f223fd5797c: "To determine whether the L\xE6rdal Tunnel\
      \ is longer than the Simplon Tunnel, we need to compare their lengths.\n\n1.\
      \ **Identify the lengths:**\n   - The L\xE6rdal Tunnel has an approximate length\
      \ of 60 kilometers (km).\n   - The Simplon Tunnel has an approximate length\
      \ of 39 kilometers (km).\n\n2. **Compare the lengths:**\n   - Length of L\xE6\
      rdal Tunnel = 60 km\n   - Length of Simplon Tunnel = 39 km\n\nSince 60 km >\
      \ 39 km, it follows that the L\xE6rdal Tunnel is indeed longer than the Simplon\
      \ Tunnel.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**"
