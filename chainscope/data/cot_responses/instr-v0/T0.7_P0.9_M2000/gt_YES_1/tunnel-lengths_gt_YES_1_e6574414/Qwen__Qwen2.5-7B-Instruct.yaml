    08408046-cb67-4bf2-ae02-9c925ab05d8b: 'To determine if the Sydney Harbour Tunnel
      is longer than the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, we need to compare their respective
      lengths.


      1. **Sydney Harbour Tunnel**: The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is part of the Sydney
      Harbour Tunnel and Westconnex motorway project. Its total length is approximately
      3,800 meters (or about 3.8 kilometers).


      2. **Queens-Midtown Tunnel**: The Queens-Midtown Tunnel in New York City consists
      of two parallel tunnels. Each tunnel is approximately 2,500 feet long. Since
      there are two tunnels, the combined length is 5,000 feet. To convert this to
      meters, we use the conversion factor 1 foot = 0.3048 meters. Therefore, 5,000
      feet * 0.3048 meters/foot = 1,524 meters.


      Now, comparing the two:

      - Sydney Harbour Tunnel: 3,800 meters

      - Queens-Midtown Tunnel: 1,524 meters


      Since 3,800 meters is greater than 1,524 meters, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is
      indeed longer than the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.

      1. **Simplon Tunnel**: This is a railway tunnel that runs under the Simplon
      Pass in the Alps between Italy and Switzerland. Its length is approximately
      10,798 meters (or 10.798 kilometers).


      2. **St. Gotthard Road Tunnel**: This is a road tunnel that runs under the Gotthard
      Massif in the Swiss Alps. Its length is approximately 5,712 meters (or 5.712

      Now, comparing the two:

      - Simplon Tunnel: 10,798 meters

      - St. Gotthard Road Tunnel: 5,712 meters
