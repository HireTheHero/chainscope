      1) The Seikan Tunnel is a railway tunnel that connects the islands of Honshu
      and Hokkaido in Japan. It is 53.85 km (33.49 miles) long, making it the longest
      and deepest operational rail tunnel in the world.


      2) The Chunnel (or Channel Tunnel) is a 50.45 km (31.35 miles) long railway
      tunnel that runs underneath the English Channel, connecting Folkestone, Kent
      in England with Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais in northern France.


      3) The Chunnel has three separate tunnels - two for rail traffic and a smaller
      service tunnel. The service tunnel is 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) in diameter and
      runs parallel to the two rail tunnels.


      4) While the length of the Chunnel service tunnel is not explicitly stated,
      it is reasonable to assume that it runs the full 50.45 km length of the Chunnel,
      as it needs to provide access and services along the entire tunnel.


      5) Therefore, the Seikan Tunnel at 53.85 km is longer than the Chunnel service
      tunnel, which is approximately 50.45 km long.


      After considering the facts, the answer is:
