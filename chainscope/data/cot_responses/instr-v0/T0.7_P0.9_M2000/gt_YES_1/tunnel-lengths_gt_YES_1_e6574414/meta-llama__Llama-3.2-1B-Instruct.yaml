      York City.

      3. By definition, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel is longer than the Sydney Harbour

      Queens, New York, to Midtown Manhattan. The Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel is a major

      2. Note that the Eisenhower Tunnel is located in New Jersey, USA, while the
      Holland Tunnel is located in New York City, USA.

      3. Since the Eisenhower Tunnel is in New Jersey and the Holland Tunnel is in
      New York City, we can infer that the Eisenhower Tunnel is farther west than
      the Holland Tunnel.


      4. Since the question asks if the Eisenhower Tunnel is longer than the Holland
      Tunnel, we can conclude that the Eisenhower Tunnel is indeed longer.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      on the length of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel either. Can you please provide that
      information?


      Once I have that information, I can proceed to answer the question.


      (If you don''t have the information, I can try to estimate the answer or provide
      a general answer that is "I don''t know". Let me know what you''d prefer!)'
