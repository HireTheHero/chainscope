      the Shanghai Tower has a height of approximately 632 meters (2,073 feet).


      Step 3: Compare the heights of the two buildings.


      Since 828 meters (Burj Khalifa) is greater than 632 meters (Shanghai Tower),
      the answer is:


      YES'

      1. The Burj Khalifa is a building in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

      2. The Shanghai Tower is a building in Shanghai, China.

      3. Both buildings are among the tallest in the world, but I need to know their
      exact heights to compare them.

      4. According to my knowledge, the Burj Khalifa has a height of 828 meters (2,722
      feet).

      5. The Shanghai Tower has a height of 632 meters (2,073 feet).


      Now, comparing the heights:


      828 meters (Burj Khalifa) > 632 meters (Shanghai Tower)


      Therefore, the Burj Khalifa is indeed taller than the Shanghai Tower.


      Answer: YES'
