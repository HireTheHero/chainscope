    4b023b7f-ceac-44fb-ba9e-fe0a726b6f00: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the height of One World Trade Center:

      - One World Trade Center is located in New York City

      - Its total height is 1,776 feet (541.3 meters)


      2. Next, let''s find the height of Taipei 101:

      - Taipei 101 is located in Taiwan

      - Its total height is 1,671 feet (509.2 meters)


      3. Compare the heights:

      - One World Trade Center: 1,776 feet

      - Taipei 101: 1,671 feet

      - 1,776 is greater than 1,671


      4. Conclusion:

      One World Trade Center is taller than Taipei 101.
