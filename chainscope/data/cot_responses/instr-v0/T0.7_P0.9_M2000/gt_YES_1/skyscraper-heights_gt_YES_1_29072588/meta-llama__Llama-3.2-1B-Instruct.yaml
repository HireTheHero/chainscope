      2. The Empire State Building is a well-known skyscraper in New York City, and

      feet, and I know that 30 Hudson Yards is 1,368 feet (415.3 meters) tall.

      4. Since the height of 30 Hudson Yards (1,368 feet) is less than the height

      Let''s break it down step by step:


      1. The Shanghai Tower is a skyscraper located in Shanghai, China. It stands
      at a height of 632 meters (2,073 feet).

      2. The Makkah Royal Clock Tower is a skyscraper located in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
      It stands at a height of 601 meters (1,972 feet).

      3. To determine which tower is taller, we need to compare their heights.


      Comparing the heights of the two towers:


      * Shanghai Tower is taller than Makkah Royal Clock Tower by 31 meters (102 feet).


      Therefore, the answer is: NO. The Shanghai Tower is not taller than the Makkah
      Royal Clock Tower.'

    afbd5e97-50d7-4ce4-9df4-0d788f24acbd: 'Let''s break it down step by step:


      1. Shanghai Tower is a megastructure in Shanghai, China, and its height is not
      publicly disclosed.

      2. Makkah Royal Clock Tower is a 601-meter-tall (1,972 ft) tower in Mecca, Saudi
      Arabia, and it is one of the tallest free-standing buildings in the world.

      3. Since Shanghai Tower''s height is not publicly disclosed, we can''t directly
      compare it to Makkah Royal Clock Tower.

      4. However, we can use the height of Makkah Royal Clock Tower as a reference
      point. If Shanghai Tower is taller than Makkah Royal Clock Tower, it must be
      taller than 601 meters.

      5. Since Shanghai Tower is not taller than Makkah Royal Clock Tower, we can
      conclude that Shanghai Tower is not taller than Makkah Royal Clock Tower.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      Here''s my step-by-step reasoning:


      1. The Shanghai Tower is located in Shanghai, China.

      2. The Makkah Royal Clock Tower is located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

      3. The Shanghai Tower is the tallest building in the world, standing at 632
      meters (2,073 feet).

      4. The Makkah Royal Clock Tower is the tallest building in the world, standing
      at 601 meters (1,972 feet).

      5. Since the Makkah Royal Clock Tower is taller than the Shanghai Tower, it
      is taller than the Shanghai Tower.

      Now, let''s compare the heights:


      * Shanghai Tower is 632 meters tall.

      * Makkah Royal Clock Tower is approximately 601 meters tall.


      Since 632 meters is greater than 601 meters, Shanghai Tower is indeed taller

      1. The Shanghai Tower is a skyscraper located in Shanghai, China.

      2. The Makkah Royal Clock Tower is a skyscraper located in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

      3. The height of a building is typically measured from its foundation to its
      highest point, which is called the architectural height.

      4. The Shanghai Tower is approximately 632 meters (2,073 feet) tall, while the
      Makkah Royal Clock Tower is approximately 601 meters (1,972 feet) tall.

      5. Since the Makkah Royal Clock Tower is taller than the Shanghai Tower, the
