      1. Identify the height of the Lotte World Tower.

      2. Identify the height of the One World Trade Center.

      3. Compare the two heights.


      Step 1: The Lotte World Tower, located in Seoul, South Korea, has a total height
      including its spire, which is 634 meters (2,080 feet).


      Step 2: The One World Trade Center, located in New York City, USA, has a total
      height to the tip of its antenna of 541 meters (1,776 feet). However, when considering
      the building''s architectural height without the antenna, it is 417 meters (1,368
      feet).


      Step 3: Comparing the two:

      - Lotte World Tower: 634 meters

      - One World Trade Center (architectural height): 417 meters


      Since 634 meters is greater than 417 meters, the Lotte World Tower is indeed
      taller than the One World Trade Center.
