      Step 1: Determine the height of the Empire State Building.

      The Empire State Building''s current height is approximately 443.2 meters (1,454
      feet) when measured from its foundation to the tip of its antenna.


      Step 2: Determine the height of the 30 Hudson Yards.

      The 30 Hudson Yards currently stands at around 300 meters (984 feet) in height
      when measured from the ground level to its roof.


      Step 3: Compare the two heights.

      The Empire State Building''s height is approximately 443.2 meters.

      The 30 Hudson Yards'' height is approximately 300 meters.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since 443.2 meters is greater than 300 meters, the Empire State Building is
      taller than the 30 Hudson Yards.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'

      taller than the Empire State Building, I''ll need to compare their heights.


      Step 1: Identify the height of the 30 Hudson Yards.

      The 30 Hudson Yards building, formerly known as One57, stands at approximately
      928 feet (283 meters) tall when measured from its base to the tip of its antenna.


      Step 2: Identify the height of the Empire State Building.

      The original Empire State Building was completed in 1931 and stands at approximately
      1,454 feet (443.2 meters) tall when measured from its foundation to the top
      of its antenna.

      height (1,454 feet).


      Step 4: Formulate the answer based on the comparison.

      Since the 30 Hudson Yards is shorter than the Empire State Building, the answer
      to the question "Is the 30 Hudson Yards taller than the Empire State Building?"
      is NO.

      1. Find the current height of the 30 Hudson Yards.

      2. Find the current height of the Empire State Building.

      3. Compare the two heights.


      Step 1: The 30 Hudson Yards is a supertall skyscraper located in New York City.
      As of now (as of 2023), its height is approximately 946 feet (288.4 meters)
      when including spires and antennas.


      Step 2: The Empire State Building, completed in 1931, stands at an official
      height of 1,454 feet (443.2 meters) when measuring from ground level to the
      top of its antenna. However, this includes the building''s spires, which were
      removed in 2016, reducing its official height to 1,250 feet (381 meters) without
      the spires.


      Step 3: Comparing the two heights:

      - 30 Hudson Yards: 946 feet

      - Empire State Building (without spires): 1,250 feet


      Since 946 feet is less than 1,250 feet, the 30 Hudson Yards is not taller than
