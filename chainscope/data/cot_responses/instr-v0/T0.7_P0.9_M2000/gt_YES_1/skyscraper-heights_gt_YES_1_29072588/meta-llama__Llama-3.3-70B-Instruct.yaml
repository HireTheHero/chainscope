      typically be found in various architectural or real estate databases.


      2. **Compare the Heights**: Once we have the heights, we can compare them to

      meters (1,965 feet) to its architectural top.

      - The Lotte World Tower, located in Seoul, South Korea, has a height of 555

      a total height of 555 meters is the architectural height, and with the antenna

      height vs. total height including antennas or spires), but according to most

      1. The Petronas Towers, located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, were the tallest
      buildings in the world when completed in 1998. They stand at a height of 452
      meters (1,483 feet) to the tip.


      2. The Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower), located in Chicago,
      Illinois, USA, was the tallest building in the world when completed in 1974.
      It stands at a height of 527 meters (1,730 feet) to the tip, including the antennas.
      However, without the antennas, its architectural height is 442 meters (1,450
      feet).


      Comparing the two:


      - The Petronas Towers have a total height of 452 meters.

      - The Willis Tower has an architectural height of 442 meters but a total height
      (including antennas) of 527 meters.


      Given these heights:


      - The Petronas Towers are taller than the architectural height of the Willis
      Tower (442 meters vs 452 meters).

      - However, the Willis Tower is significantly taller than the Petronas Towers
      when including its total height with antennas (527 meters vs 452 meters).


      Since the question does not specify whether to consider the total height (including
      antennas and other structural elements) or the architectural height (the height
      of the building itself to the top of the roof), the answer could depend on the
      interpretation. However, in general comparisons, especially in terms of the
      height to the architectural top, the Petronas Towers are indeed taller than
      the Willis Tower''s architectural height but not its total height including
      antennas.


      For simplicity and sticking to a straightforward comparison without overcomplicating
      the interpretation, considering the heights typically discussed, the answer
      would lean towards "yes" if we strictly compare architectural heights, but it''s
      essential to note this depends on how one defines "taller."


      Given the potential for confusion and the need for clarity in the comparison,
      the most straightforward interpretation (comparing the heights as typically
      referenced) would suggest:


      NO'

      2. **30 Hudson Yards Height**: 30 Hudson Yards, located in New York City, has
      a height of 1,296 feet (394.7 meters) to the architectural top.


      3. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the heights. The Willis Tower is 1,451 feet
      tall (without considering the antennas), and 30 Hudson Yards is 1,296 feet tall.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that 1,451 feet (the height of the Willis Tower) is
      greater than 1,296 feet (the height of 30 Hudson Yards), we can conclude that
      the Willis Tower is indeed taller than 30 Hudson Yards.
