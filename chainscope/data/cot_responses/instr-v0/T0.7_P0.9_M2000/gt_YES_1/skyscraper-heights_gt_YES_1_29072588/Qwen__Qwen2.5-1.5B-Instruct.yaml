      1. **Willis Tower**: The height of the Willis Tower was originally 442 meters
      when it was completed in 1973. However, due to structural reinforcement during
      renovation in 2018, its current height is around 569.7 meters.

      Step-by-step reasoning:

      1. The Empire State Building is an iconic skyscraper located in New York City.

      2. 30 Hudson Yards is a new skyscraper under construction on the west side of
      Manhattan.

      3. Both structures have been designed to be tall buildings for aesthetic and
      practical reasons.

      4. However, 30 Hudson Yards has yet to reach completion, while the Empire State
      Building is already completed.

      5. As of my last update (2023), 30 Hudson Yards was not fully constructed at
      its current height, but it''s expected to surpass the Empire State Building
      once finished.

      6. Given that both were built as high-rise structures, they compete for prominence
      among their peers.

      7. Without knowing the exact height of 30 Hudson Yards when it reaches completion,
      we can''t definitively say if it will surpass the Empire State Building.


      Therefore, based on the available information and typical design practices for
