      - The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is approximately 1.7 miles (2.7 km)
      long


      3. Compare the lengths:

      - Sunshine Skyway: 4.1 miles

      - Golden Gate: 1.7 miles

      - 4.1 is greater than 1.7


      4. Conclusion:

      The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is longer than the Golden Gate Bridge.
