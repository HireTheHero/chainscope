      Step 2: Find the length of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

      According to various sources, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge has a total
      length of approximately 8.4 miles (13.5 km).


      Step 3: Find the length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, also known as the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, is
      a combined bridge and tunnel structure that spans the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia.
      Its total length is approximately 17.6 miles (28.3 km).


      Step 4: Compare the lengths of the two bridges.

      The Chesapeake Bay Bridge (17.6 miles) is longer than the San Francisco-Oakland
      Bay Bridge (8.4 miles).


      After considering the steps above, the answer is:
