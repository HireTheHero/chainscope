      lengths of each bridge.


      1. **San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge**: The total length of the San Francisco-Oakland
      Bay Bridge is approximately 8.4 miles (13.5 kilometers) when considering both
      the western and eastern spans.


      2. **Chesapeake Bay Bridge**: The Chesapeake Bay Bridge is approximately 4.3

      spans the Firth of Forth. It has a total length of about 2,528 meters (8,281
      feet).


      2. The Manhattan Bridge, located in New York City, is a suspension bridge that
      spans the East River. It has a total length of about 2,489 meters (8,442 feet).


      Now comparing the two lengths:

      - Forth Bridge: 2,528 meters

      Since 2,528 meters (Forth Bridge) is greater than 2,489 meters (Manhattan Bridge),

      meters (5,591 feet) and a total length of about 2,528 meters (8,281 feet).


      Now comparing the two:


      - The main span of the Forth Bridge (1,706 meters) is longer than that of the
      Golden Gate Bridge (1,280 meters).

      - The total length of the Golden Gate Bridge (2,737 meters) is longer than that
      of the Forth Bridge (2,528 meters).


      Based on this analysis, while the Forth Bridge has a longer main span, the Golden
      Gate Bridge has a longer total length.
