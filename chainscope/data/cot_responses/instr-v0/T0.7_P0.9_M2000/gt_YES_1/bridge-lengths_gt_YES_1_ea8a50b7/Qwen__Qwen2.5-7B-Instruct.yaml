    fc0e403c-14b4-45c5-8fd0-8a4c83846b1a: "To determine if the Sunshine Skyway Bridge\
      \ is longer than the Golden Gate Bridge, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify\
      \ the lengths of both bridges:**\n   - The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is located\
      \ in Florida, USA. Its total length is approximately 2.27 miles (3.65 kilometers).\n\
      \   - The Golden Gate Bridge is located in California, USA. Its total length\
      \ is approximately 1.7 miles (2.74 kilometers).\n\n2. **Compare the lengths:**\n\
      \   - Sunshine Skyway Bridge: 2.27 miles\n   - Golden Gate Bridge: 1.7 miles\n\
      \n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 2.27 miles is greater than 1.7 miles, the Sunshine\
      \ Skyway Bridge is indeed longer than the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer is: **YES**"
