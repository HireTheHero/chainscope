      **Step 1: Determine the length of the George Washington Bridge.**

      - The George Washington Bridge spans the Hudson River between New York and New
      Jersey.

      - Its total length is approximately 4,760 feet (1,450 meters).


      **Step 2: Determine the length of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.**

      - The Sydney Harbour Bridge spans Sydney Harbour in Australia.

      - Its total length is about 3,770 feet (1,149 meters).


      **Step 3: Compare the two lengths.**

      - The George Washington Bridge is 4,760 feet long.

      - The Sydney Harbour Bridge is 3,770 feet long.

      - 4,760 feet is longer than 3,770 feet.
