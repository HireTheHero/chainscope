      Step 1: The Manhattan Bridge, also known as the East River Bridge, has a total
      length of approximately 6,100 feet (1,860 meters).


      Step 2: The Brooklyn Bridge has a total length of approximately 1,595 feet (486

      Based on this reasoning, the answer is YES, the Manhattan Bridge is longer than
      the Brooklyn Bridge.'
