      Bridge is longer than the Golden Gate Bridge, we need to compare their lengths:


      1. **Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: This bridge, located in Florida, spans Tampa
      Bay. The entire length of the bridge is approximately 4.14 miles (6.7 kilometers).


      2. **Golden Gate Bridge**: This iconic bridge is located in San Francisco, California.
      The total length of the bridge is about 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers).


      Now, compare the lengths:
