      1. **Length**: The George Washington Bridge spans 4,760 feet (approximately
      1,450 meters). The Sydney Harbour Bridge has a total length of about 1,892 meters
      (or approximately 6,200 feet).


      2. **Span Length**: The George Washington Bridge''s main span is 1,350 feet
      long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge''s main span is also around 1,350 feet long.


      Given these details:

      - Both bridges have similar lengths in overall width, but they differ slightly
      in their span lengths due to different design considerations for each location.


      Since both bridges have spans that are nearly equal (about 1,350 feet), it can
      be concluded that neither one is definitively longer than the other. Therefore,
      the correct answer is:


      **NO**'

      1. **Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: This bridge connects north to south in Tampa,
      Florida. It is approximately 4 miles (6.5 kilometers) long.

      2. **Golden Gate Bridge**: This famous suspension bridge spans the San Francisco
      Bay from Marin County to San Pablo Peninsula. Its total length varies slightly
      depending on the measurement method used but generally ranges between about
      2.73 miles (4.4 km) for its central span and 2.79 miles (4.5 km) when measured
      at its full width.


      Comparing these:

      - The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is significantly shorter than the Golden Gate Bridge,
      as it measures around 6.5 kilometers while the Golden Gate Bridge measures roughly
      4.5 kilometers under certain conditions.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is not longer than
      the Golden Gate Bridge.'

      1. **Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: This bridge spans Tampa Bay in Florida, United
      States. It was completed in 2005 and has an official length of approximately
      4.6 miles (7.4 kilometers) from north to south.


      2. **Golden Gate Bridge**: Located across San Francisco Bay in California, this
      iconic suspension bridge was completed in 1937 and measures about 2.7 miles
      (4.3 kilometers) from north to south at its widest point.


      **Comparison**:

      - The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is about 3.8 miles shorter than the Golden Gate
      Bridge.


      Given these measurements, it is clear that the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is not
      longer than the Golden Gate Bridge.
