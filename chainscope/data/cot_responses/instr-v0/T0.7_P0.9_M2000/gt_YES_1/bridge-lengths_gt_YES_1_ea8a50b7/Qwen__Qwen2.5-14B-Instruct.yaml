      \ let's break it down into a few steps.\n\n1. **Identify the length of the San\

      \ has two main sections: the self-anchored suspension span (SAS) and the cantilevered\
      \ span. However, when discussing the overall length of the bridge, we often\
      \ refer to its total length including all segments.\n   - The total length of\
      \ the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is approximately 8.4 miles (about 13.5\
      \ kilometers).\n\n2. **Identify the length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge:**\n\
      \   - The Chesapeake Bay Bridge consists of two spans, the original bridge from\
      \ Sandy Point to Kent Island (built in 1952), and the second bridge (built in\
      \ 1973) which runs parallel to the first.\n   - The total length of both bridges\
      \ combined is about 4.3 miles (approximately 6.9 kilometers).\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ the lengths:**\n   - Comparing the two, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge\

      1. **Identify the length of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge**: The Chesapeake Bay
      Bridge actually refers to two parallel bridges that span the Chesapeake Bay
      in Maryland: the original 1952 bridge (now called the William Preston Lane Jr.
      Memorial Bridge) and the newer 1973 bridge (also known as the Arthur B. McCallum
      Jr. Memorial Bridge). The total length of both bridges combined is approximately
      4.3 miles (or about 6.9 kilometers), but if you''re asking for the longest single
      span, it''s around 4.3 miles for the entire structure of either bridge.


      2. **Identify the length of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: The current Sunshine
      Skyway Bridge, which opened in 1987, spans Tampa Bay in Florida. It has a total
      length of about 3.2 miles (or approximately 5.1 kilometers).

      Step 1: Determine the length of the Brooklyn Bridge.

      - The Brooklyn Bridge has a total length of about 6,016 feet (1,834 meters)
      including its approaches.


      Step 2: Determine the length of the Manhattan Bridge.

      - The Manhattan Bridge is shorter, with a total length of about 6,855 feet (including
      approaches), but more specifically, the main span is 3,713 feet (1,132 meters).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - Comparing the total lengths including approaches, the Manhattan Bridge''s
      total length (including approaches) is greater than that of the Brooklyn Bridge.
      However, if we strictly compare the main spans, the Brooklyn Bridge''s main
      span is longer at approximately 1,595.5 meters (5,236 feet) compared to the
      Manhattan Bridge''s main span of 1,132 meters (3,713 feet).


      Since the question seems to imply comparing the total lengths including approaches
      rather than just the main spans, the answer would be:


      NO, the Manhattan Bridge is not longer than the Brooklyn Bridge when considering
      the main spans. However, if we consider the total lengths including approaches,
      the Manhattan Bridge is indeed longer. Given the typical understanding in such
      comparisons, the answer aligns more closely with the main span comparison.


      Thus, based on the main spans, the answer is NO. But strictly following the
      common approach which includes total lengths, it would be a YES. For clarity
      in standard bridge comparisons, the answer should lean towards the main span
