      * Eurofighter Typhoon''s maximum speed: Mach 2.0 (about 1,550 mph / 2,495 km/h)


      3. Compare the speeds:

      * SR-71 Blackbird: Mach 3.3+

      * Eurofighter Typhoon: Mach 2.0

      * Mach 3.3 is clearly greater than Mach 2.0


      YES (SR-71 Blackbird is faster than Eurofighter Typhoon)'

      1. First, let''s find the maximum speed of SR-71 Blackbird:

      - SR-71''s official maximum speed was Mach 3.3 (about 2,200 mph / 3,540 km/h)

      - Some sources suggest it could go even faster


      2. Now, let''s find the maximum speed of Eurofighter Typhoon:

      - Eurofighter Typhoon''s maximum speed is Mach 2 (about 1,550 mph / 2,495 km/h)


      3. Comparing the speeds:

      - SR-71: Mach 3.3 (2,200 mph)

      - Typhoon: Mach 2.0 (1,550 mph)

      - The SR-71 is faster by Mach 1.3 (about 650 mph)


      YES - The SR-71 Blackbird is faster than the Eurofighter Typhoon.'

      3. Compare the speeds:

      * SR-71: Mach 3.3+

      * Typhoon: Mach 2.0

      * Mach 3.3 is significantly faster than Mach 2.0


      Answer: YES


      The SR-71 Blackbird is faster than the Eurofighter Typhoon.'
