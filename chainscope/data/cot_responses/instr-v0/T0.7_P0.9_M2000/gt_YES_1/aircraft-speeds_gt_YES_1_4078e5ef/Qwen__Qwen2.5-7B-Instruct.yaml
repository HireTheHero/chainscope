      faster than the Eurofighter Typhoon, let''s break down the information needed
      and compare their top speeds.


      1. **SR-71 Blackbird**: This is a high-altitude strategic reconnaissance aircraft.
      Its maximum speed is approximately Mach 3.2 (around 3,530 km/h or 2,194 mph).


      2. **Eurofighter Typhoon**: This is a multirole combat aircraft designed for
      air superiority, interdiction, and ground attack. Its top speed is around Mach
      2.0 (around 2,536 km/h or 1,576 mph).


      Now, let''s compare these speeds:

      - The SR-71 Blackbird can reach speeds up to Mach 3.2.

      - The Eurofighter Typhoon can reach speeds up to Mach 2.0.


      Since Mach 3.2 is significantly higher than Mach 2.0, the SR-71 Blackbird is
      indeed faster than the Eurofighter Typhoon.

      1. **SR-71 Blackbird Speed**: The SR-71 Blackbird is a retired American spy
      aircraft known for its exceptional speed and altitude capabilities. It can reach
      speeds of Mach 3.2 (over 2,190 mph or 3,520 km/h) and fly at altitudes up to
      85,000 feet (25,908 meters).
