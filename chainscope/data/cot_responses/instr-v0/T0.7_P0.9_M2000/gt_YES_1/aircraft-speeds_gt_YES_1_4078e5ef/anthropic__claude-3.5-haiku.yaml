      1. First, let''s look at the typical cruise speeds of these aircraft:

      - Boeing 787 Dreamliner: Around 0.85 Mach (approximately 656 mph or 1,056 km/h)

      - Boeing 737-800: Around 0.78 Mach (approximately 530 mph or 853 km/h)


      2. Comparing their cruise speeds:

      - The 787 Dreamliner is faster

      - The difference is about 0.07 Mach or roughly 126 mph


      3. This speed difference is due to several factors:

      - The 787 is a newer, more advanced aircraft

      - It''s designed for longer, intercontinental routes

      - It has more advanced aerodynamics and more powerful engines
