    0365bfb8-bc34-4aab-9568-c24e4aad0b9f: 'To determine if the F-4 Phantom II is faster
      than the MiG-21, let''s break down the key performance specifications for each
      aircraft.


      ### Step 1: Maximum Speed Comparison


      #### F-4 Phantom II

      - **Maximum speed at high altitude:** Approximately Mach 2.23 (1,473 mph or
      2,370 km/h)


      #### MiG-21

      - **Maximum speed at high altitude:** Approximately Mach 2.0 (1,355 mph or 2,180
      km/h)


      ### Step 2: Analyze the Data

      - The F-4 Phantom II has a maximum speed of Mach 2.23.

      - The MiG-21 has a maximum speed of Mach 2.0.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Speeds

      - Mach 2.23 (F-4 Phantom II) is greater than Mach 2.0 (MiG-21).


      ### Conclusion
