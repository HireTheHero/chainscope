      Falcon is faster than the Boeing 747-400, we need to consider the following
      steps:


      Step 1: Understand the performance characteristics of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

      The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a multi-role fighter aircraft designed for high-performance
      air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. It is known for its exceptional speed and
      maneuverability.
