      1. **SR-71 Blackbird**: The SR-71 Blackbird is known for its high speed and
      altitude capabilities. Its top speed is approximately Mach 3.3, which is about
      2,200 miles per hour (3,540 kilometers per hour) at high altitude.

      is faster than the Eurofighter Typhoon, let''s consider their maximum speeds:


      1. **SR-71 Blackbird**: The SR-71 is a long-range, advanced, strategic reconnaissance
      aircraft that was developed by Lockheed. It is known for its incredible speed,
      reaching a maximum speed of approximately Mach 3.3 (around 2,200 mph or 3,540
      km/h).


      2. **Eurofighter Typhoon**: The Eurofighter Typhoon is a modern multirole fighter
      aircraft used by several air forces. Its maximum speed is around Mach 2.0 (approximately
      1,550 mph or 2,495 km/h).


      Now, compare the maximum speeds:

      - Mach 3.3 (SR-71) vs. Mach 2.0 (Eurofighter Typhoon).


      Since Mach 3.3 is greater than Mach 2.0, the SR-71 Blackbird is faster than
      the Eurofighter Typhoon.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
