      designed for long-haul, high-capacity flights.

      2. The A320 is a smaller, lighter aircraft designed for shorter-haul, medium-capacity
      flights.

      3.  Larger, heavier aircraft generally have less speed potential than smaller,
      lighter ones due to aerodynamic and fuel efficiency considerations.

      4. Therefore, the A320 is likely faster than the A380 on comparable routes.

      than the A320.

      2. Larger aircraft generally have more powerful engines.

      3. More powerful engines typically allow for higher cruising speeds.

      4. Therefore, the A380 is likely faster than the A320.
