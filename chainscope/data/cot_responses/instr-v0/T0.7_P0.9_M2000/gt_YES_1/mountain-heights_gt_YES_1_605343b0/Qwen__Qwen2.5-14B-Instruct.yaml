      1. Identify the elevation of The Matterhorn.

      2. Identify the elevation of Mount Whitney.

      3. Compare the two elevations.


      Step 1: The Matterhorn is located in the Alps on the border between Switzerland
      and Italy. Its summit elevation is approximately 4,478 meters (14,692 feet)
      above sea level.

      - The Matterhorn: 4,478 meters

      - Mount Whitney: 4,421 meters


      Since 4,478 meters is greater than 4,421 meters, The Matterhorn is higher than
      Mount Whitney.


      Answer: NO (The Matterhorn is not lower than Mount Whitney; the correct answer
      based on the question''s phrasing should be interpreted as acknowledging its
      height exceeds that of Mount Whitney, thus the direct response to "is it higher"
      is affirmatively in the context of the question, but strictly following the
      ''yes/no'' format provided: NO to ''is it lower''). However, for clarity and
      directness: The Matterhorn is indeed higher than Mount Whitney, so the affirmative
