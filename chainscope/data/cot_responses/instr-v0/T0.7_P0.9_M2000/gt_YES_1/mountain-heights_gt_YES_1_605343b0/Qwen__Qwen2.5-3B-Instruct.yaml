      1. Find the elevation of The Matterhorn.

      2. Find the elevation of Mount Whitney.

      3. Compare the two elevations.


      Step 1: Finding the elevation of The Matterhorn

      The Matterhorn is a mountain located in the Alps, near the border between Switzerland
      and Italy. Its highest peak is known as the Great Peak and has an elevation
      of 4,478 meters (14,692 feet) above sea level.


      Step 2: Finding the elevation of Mount Whitney

      Mount Whitney is the highest peak in the contiguous United States, located in
      the Sierra Nevada range in California. Its elevation is 4,421 meters (14,505
      feet) above sea level.


      Step 3: Comparing the two elevations

      Now, let''s compare the two:

      - The Matterhorn: 4,478 meters

      - Mount Whitney: 4,421 meters


      Since 4,478 meters is greater than 4,421 meters, we can conclude that The Matterhorn
      is indeed higher than Mount Whitney.

      the heights of these mountains.


      1. **Mount Denali (formerly known as Mount McKinley):** The official height
      of Mount Denali is approximately 6,190 meters (20,310 feet) above sea level.
      This measurement comes from measurements taken in 2010 using GPS technology.


      2. **Mount Kangchenjunga:** The highest point on Mount Kangchenjunga is around
      8,586 meters (28,169 feet) above sea level. This figure is also based on recent
      scientific measurements.


      Now, comparing the two:

      - Height of Mount Denali: 6,190 meters

      - Height of Mount Kangchenjunga: 8,586 meters


      Since 8,586 meters (Mount Kangchenjunga) is greater than 6,190 meters (Mount
      Denali), we can conclude that Mount Kangchenjunga is indeed higher than Mount
      Denali.


      Answer: **YES**'
