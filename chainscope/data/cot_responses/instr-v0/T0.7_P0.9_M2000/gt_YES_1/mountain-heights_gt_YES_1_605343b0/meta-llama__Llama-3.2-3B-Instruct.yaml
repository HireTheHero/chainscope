      1. First, I need to know the heights of both mountains. According to my knowledge,
      Mount Kangchenjunga is approximately 8,586 meters (28,208 ft) high, and Mount
      Denali is approximately 6,190 meters (20,310 ft) high.

      2. Now, I need to compare the heights of the two mountains. If Mount Kangchenjunga
      is higher than Mount Denali, then the answer is YES.

      3. Based on the heights I provided earlier, Mount Kangchenjunga is indeed higher
      than Mount Denali.
