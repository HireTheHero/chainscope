      2. **Mount Kilimanjaro**: This mountain has an elevation of approximately 19,341
      feet (5,895 meters).


      Comparing these two values:

      - Mount Denali: 20,310 feet

      - Mount Kilimanjaro: 19,341 feet


      Since 20,310 feet is greater than 19,341 feet, Mount Denali is indeed higher
      than Mount Kilimanjaro.


      **Answer**: Yes'
