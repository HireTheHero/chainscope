      on the main island of Honshu in Japan. Its height is 12,388 feet (3,776 meters)
      above sea level.


      3. **Compare the heights**: Now, we compare the heights of the two mountains.
      Mount Whitney is 14,505 feet tall, and Mount Fuji is 12,388 feet tall.


      Given that 14,505 feet (the height of Mount Whitney) is greater than 12,388
      feet (the height of Mount Fuji), we can conclude that Mount Whitney is indeed
      higher than Mount Fuji.


      YES'
    aae3efe5-bc68-4ea3-af28-cec29f7a027d: 'To answer this question, let''s first gather
      the necessary information about the heights of Mount Whitney and Mount Fuji.


      1. **Mount Whitney''s Height**: Mount Whitney is located in the Sierra Nevada
      mountain range in California, USA. It is known for being the highest summit
      in the contiguous United States.


      2. **Mount Fuji''s Height**: Mount Fuji is an iconic, active volcano located
      on the main island of Honshu in Japan. It is the country''s highest peak.


      Now, let''s look at the actual heights:

      - Mount Whitney stands at a height of 14,505 feet (4,421 meters) above sea level.

      - Mount Fuji stands at a height of 12,388 feet (3,776 meters) above sea level.

      feet (5,895 meters) above sea level.


      3. **Compare the heights**: Now, we compare the heights of the two mountains.
      Mount Denali stands at about 20,310 feet, while Mount Kilimanjaro stands at
      about 19,341 feet.


      Given that 20,310 feet (the height of Mount Denali) is greater than 19,341 feet
      (the height of Mount Kilimanjaro), we can conclude that Mount Denali is indeed
      higher than Mount Kilimanjaro.


      YES.'
    ff33157a-0cad-467a-8cc7-6a0b2028f8bc: 'To answer this question, we need to compare
      the heights of Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro.


      1. **Identify the heights**: Mount Denali, formerly known as Mount McKinley,
      is located in Alaska, USA. Its height is approximately 20,310 feet (6,190 meters)
      above sea level. Mount Kilimanjaro, located in Tanzania, Africa, has a height
      of approximately 19,341 feet (5,895 meters) above sea level.


      2. **Compare the heights**: To determine which mountain is higher, we compare
      their heights. Mount Denali is 20,310 feet tall, and Mount Kilimanjaro is 19,341
      feet tall.


      3. **Conclusion**: Since 20,310 feet (the height of Mount Denali) is greater
      than 19,341 feet (the height of Mount Kilimanjaro), Mount Denali is indeed higher
      than Mount Kilimanjaro.


      The answer is: **YES**'
