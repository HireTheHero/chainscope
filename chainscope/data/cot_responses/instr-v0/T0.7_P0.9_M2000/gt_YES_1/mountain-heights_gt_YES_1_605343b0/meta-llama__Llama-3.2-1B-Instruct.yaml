      Step 1: Mount Whitney is located in California, USA.

      Step 2: Mount Fuji is located in Japan.

      Step 3: The height of a mountain is usually measured in meters (m) or feet (ft),
      and is typically reported in the metric system.


      Now, let''s compare the heights of Mount Whitney (at 14,505 ft) and Mount Fuji
      (at 3,776 m or 12,388 ft).


      Step 4: Convert the heights to a common unit, such as feet. We can do this by
      multiplying the height of Mount Whitney by 3.2808 (since 1 m = 3.2808 ft).


      14,505 ft x 3.2808 = 47,227.33 ft

      3,776 m x 3.2808 = 12,500.44 ft


      Step 5: Now, we can compare the heights in feet. Mount Whitney is significantly
      taller than Mount Fuji.
