      the heights of the two mountains.


      Step 1: Recall the height of Mount Elbrus.

      Mount Elbrus is the highest peak in Europe, and its height is approximately
      5,642 meters (18,510 feet).


      Step 2: Recall the height of Mont Blanc.

      Mont Blanc is the highest peak in the Alps and Western Europe, and its height
      is approximately 4,810 meters (15,781 feet).


      Step 3: Compare the heights.

      Since 5,642 meters (Mount Elbrus) is greater than 4,810 meters (Mont Blanc),
      Mount Elbrus is indeed higher than Mont Blanc.

    b35e5937-b551-4fe9-ba93-52f82929b681: 'Let''s break it down step by step.


      1. Mount Elbrus is located in the Caucasus mountain range, while Mont Blanc
      is located in the Alps.

      2. The Caucasus mountain range is generally considered to be a younger and less
      eroded range compared to the Alps.

      3. As a result, the Caucasus mountains tend to have a more extreme relief, with
      higher peaks and deeper valleys.

      4. Mount Elbrus is the highest peak in the Caucasus mountain range.

      5. Mont Blanc is the highest peak in the Alps.

      3. The contiguous United States is a geographical region that does not include
      Alaska or Hawaii.

      4. Therefore, Mount Whitney is not the highest mountain in the entire United
      States, as that title belongs to Denali (formerly known as Mount McKinley) in
      Alaska.

      5. Mount Fuji''s height is approximately 3,776 meters (12,388 feet).

      6. Denali''s height is approximately 6,190 meters (20,310 feet).

      7. Mount Whitney''s height is approximately 4,421 meters (14,505 feet).


      Now, considering that Mount Whitney is not the highest mountain in the entire
      United States, and comparing its height to Mount Fuji''s, I would conclude that:


      **No**, Mount Whitney is not higher than Mount Fuji.'
