      - The AVE Class 103 has a maximum commercial operating speed of **310 km/h**
      (193 mph).


      ### Step 3: Compare the speeds

      - TGV POS: 320 km/h

      - AVE Class 103: 310 km/h


      Since 320 km/h is greater than 310 km/h, the TGV POS can indeed travel faster
      than the AVE Class 103.
