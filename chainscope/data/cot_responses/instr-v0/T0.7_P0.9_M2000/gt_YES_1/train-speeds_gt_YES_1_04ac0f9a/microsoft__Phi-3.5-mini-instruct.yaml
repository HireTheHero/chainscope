      step:


      1. Eurostar e320: This is a high-speed train developed by Siemens, primarily
      designed for the UK-France high-speed rail network. Its top speed is 320 km/h
      (199 mph).


      2. AVE Class 103: This is a high-speed train developed by Spanish company Talgo
      and manufactured by Alstom. Its top speed is around 310 km/h (193 mph).


      Now, comparing the top speeds of both trains:


      - Eurostar e320: 320 km/h

      - AVE Class 103: 310 km/h


      The Eurostar e320 has a higher top speed than the AVE Class 103.


      Answer: YES, the Eurostar e320 can travel faster than the AVE Class 103.'

      The Shinkansen E5 is a high-speed train in Japan, capable of reaching speeds
      up to 320 km/h (198.8 mph) under optimal conditions.


      The AVE Class 103 is a high-speed train in Spain, capable of reaching speeds
      up to 310 km/h (193 mph) under optimal conditions.


      Step 2: Compare the speeds of both trains.


      Shinkansen E5 speed: 320 km/h (198.8 mph)

      AVE Class 103 speed: 310 km/h (193 mph)
