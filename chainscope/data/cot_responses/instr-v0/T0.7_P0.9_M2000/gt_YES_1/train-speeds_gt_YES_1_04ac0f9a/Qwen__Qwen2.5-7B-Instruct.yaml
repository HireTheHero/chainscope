      can travel faster than the AVE Class 103, let''s break down the information
      needed and compare their top speeds.


      Step 1: Identify the top speed of the Eurostar e320.

      The Eurostar e320 is a high-speed train operated by Eurostar, connecting London
      to Paris and Brussels. According to the official Eurostar website, the top speed
      of the Eurostar e320 is 300 km/h (186 mph).


      Step 2: Identify the top speed of the AVE Class 103.

      The AVE (Alvia Velocidad Ejecutiva) Class 103 is a high-speed train used in
      Spain, primarily on the AVE network. The AVE Class 103 has a top speed of 250
      km/h (155 mph), as stated on the Spanish railway operator RENFE''s website.


      Step 3: Compare the top speeds.

      The Eurostar e320 has a top speed of 300 km/h, while the AVE Class 103 has a
      top speed of 250 km/h.


      Step 4: Determine if the Eurostar e320 can travel faster than the AVE Class
      103.

      Since 300 km/h is greater than 250 km/h, the Eurostar e320 can indeed travel
      faster than the AVE Class 103.
