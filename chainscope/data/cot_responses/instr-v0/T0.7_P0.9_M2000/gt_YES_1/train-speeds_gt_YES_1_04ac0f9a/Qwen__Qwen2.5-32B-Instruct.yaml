      3. Compare these speeds to determine which one is faster.


      Step 1: The Japanese L0 Maglev is designed to operate at a maximum speed of
      500 km/h (311 mph).


      Step 2: The CRH380A, a high-speed train used in China, has a maximum operational

      is faster than the operational speed of the CRH380A at 350 km/h. Even considering
      the test speed of the CRH380A at 486.1 km/h, the L0 Maglev is still faster.
