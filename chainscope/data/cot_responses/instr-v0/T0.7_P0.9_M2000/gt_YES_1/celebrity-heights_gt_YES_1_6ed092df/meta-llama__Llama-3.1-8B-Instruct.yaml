      1. Daniel Radcliffe is an English actor, best known for playing Harry Potter
      in the film series.

      2. Kevin Hart is an American actor and comedian, known for his short stature.

      3. Generally, English actors tend to be of average or above-average height,
      while American actors may have a wider range of heights.

      4. However, there is no specific information available about Daniel Radcliffe''s
      height, but we do know that Kevin Hart is 5 feet 2 inches (1.57 m) tall, which
      is significantly below average height.

      5. Without specific information about Daniel Radcliffe''s height, it''s difficult
      to say for certain whether he is taller than Kevin Hart.


      But, let''s make an educated guess based on general information about the two
      individuals. Since Kevin Hart is known to be quite short, and Daniel Radcliffe
      is a tall English actor, it''s likely that Daniel Radcliffe is taller than Kevin
      Hart.


      So, based on these steps of reasoning, I''ll give a tentative answer:


      YES'
