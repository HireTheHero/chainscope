      To solve this, let''s analyze the information we have:


      1. Emma Stone is an American actress.

      2. Daniel Radcliffe is a British actor, best known for his role as Harry Potter.


      From this, we can infer that Emma Stone is likely an American actress, and Daniel
      Radcliffe is a British actor. This implies that Emma Stone is probably taller
      than Daniel Radcliffe.

      1. We don''t know Emma Stone''s height.

      2. We don''t know Daniel Radcliffe''s height.

      3. We are comparing two celebrities who are known to be relatively short.


      Since we don''t have any information about their heights, we can''t make a definitive
      judgment about which one is taller. However, we can use the following reasoning:


      If Emma Stone is taller than Daniel Radcliffe, then Emma Stone must be taller
      than Daniel Radcliffe. This is because if Emma Stone is taller than Daniel Radcliffe,
      then it must be true that Emma Stone is taller than Daniel Radcliffe.


      If Emma Stone is shorter than Daniel Radcliffe, then Daniel Radcliffe must be
      taller than Emma Stone. This is because if Emma Stone is shorter than Daniel
      Radcliffe, then it must be true that Daniel Radcliffe is taller than Emma Stone.

      3. We can make an educated guess based on the average height of the two actresses.

      4. Based on the information that Emma Stone is an American actress, we can infer

      actresses tend to be in the 5''5" to 6''0" range.

      record producer, and we know that he is a tall person.

      6. Given that Kanye West is a tall person, it is unlikely that he would be significantly
      shorter than Emma Stone, who is likely to be in the same height range.
