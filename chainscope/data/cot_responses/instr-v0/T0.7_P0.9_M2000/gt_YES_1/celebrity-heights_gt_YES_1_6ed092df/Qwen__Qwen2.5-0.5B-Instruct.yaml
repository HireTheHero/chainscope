    7278058c-e039-4025-b570-967729eeeaf1: YES. Emma Stone is approximately 5 feet
      10 inches tall (174 cm), while Daniel Radcliffe is about 5 feet 9 inches tall
      (173 cm). Therefore, Emma Stone is taller than Daniel Radcliffe.
    7473d382-46eb-4e8d-963c-9b5ded308af0: Yes, Emma Stone is taller than Daniel Radcliffe.
      Emma Stone was born in 1965, while Daniel Radcliffe was born in 1980. Therefore,
      Emma Stone is approximately 7 years older than Daniel Radcliffe.

    c28edb15-d253-4db7-b865-6b5ff6bd2f18: Yes. Emma Stone is 5 feet 10 inches tall
      (approximately 174 cm) while Daniel Radcliffe is 5'9" tall (approximately 172
      cm). Therefore, Emma Stone is shorter than Daniel Radcliffe.
    c9472373-5ace-42d3-b362-62c7f7c03cdd: YES. Emma Stone is significantly taller
      than Daniel Radcliffe. Emma Stone is 5'9" (174 cm) tall, while Daniel Radcliffe
      stands at 6'3" (192 cm). This makes Emma Stone the taller individual among them.

    12dd7f9a-783e-4799-918a-195b6ff28c0b: 'Yes. Zendaya is 1.7 meters tall, while
      Jennifer Lawrence is 5 feet 9 inches tall. To compare their heights:

      - Zendaya''s height: 1.7 meters = 6 feet 9 inches (since 1 meter = 3.28084 feet)

      - Jennifer Lawrence''s height: 5 feet 9 inches


      To determine if one is taller than the other, we can subtract Jennifer Lawrence''s
      height from Zendaya''s height:

      6 feet 9 inches - 5 feet 9 inches = 1 foot 9 inches


      1 foot 9 inches is approximately equal to 12 inches. Since 12 inches is less
      than Zendaya''s height of 6 feet 9 inches, Zendaya is indeed shorter than Jennifer
      Lawrence.


      Therefore, yes, Zendaya is taller than Jennifer Lawrence.'
    2b397547-9123-4e7e-9152-68489444c8f5: Yes. Zendaya has been praised for her height
      compared to Jennifer Lawrence in films such as "The Last of Us" and "Bridget
      Jones's Diary." However, it's important to note that height can vary greatly
      among individuals, so while Zendaya may be shorter than some people, she could
      still be considered tall if she stands at an average height.

    53bb6369-e83a-4363-b60f-e73c87884440: YES. Zendaya has been compared to Jennifer
      Lawrence for her height. Zendaya was announced as the new face of "The Bodyguard"
      in 2016, which is about ten years before Jennifer Lawrence's birth. Therefore,
      it is reasonable to assume that Zendaya is at least as tall as Jennifer Lawrence
      when they were born, if not taller.
    9ba62ffb-6360-44c8-9dd5-8f2ee41c2152: Yes, Zendaya is taller than Jennifer Lawrence.
    a6c033b5-0d83-4b80-9880-bc8267ea3ba7: 'YES'
    e8245d66-f6d3-42db-9fc2-3d02de76e61c: 'Yes, Zendaya is taller than Jennifer Lawrence.
      To determine this, let''s break down the information given in the question and
      consider some key points about both women.


      1. **Zendaya**: The person whose height we''re comparing is named Zendaya, but
      her full name includes the number "2" instead of just "Z". This suggests that
      she is not the same person as Jennifer Lawrence, who was born on October 30,
      1987 and has been described as "the most beautiful young woman alive."


      2. **Jennifer Lawrence**: She is known for being one of the most famous actresses
      in Hollywood. Her full name is Jennifer Lynn Lawrence, which includes "L" before
      her last name, suggesting that she is also a member of another family.


      3. **Comparison**: The question asks if Zendaya is taller than Jennifer Lawrence.
      Since their heights are different, they cannot be equal, so one must be taller
      than the other.


      4. **Height Comparison**: Given that Zendaya is named after a number (2), it
      implies that she stands significantly taller than Jennifer Lawrence.


      Therefore, based on these considerations, we can conclude that Zendaya is indeed
      taller than Jennifer Lawrence.'
    f247ce5e-e27d-4bc0-b751-feb788034187: Yes, Zendaya is taller than Jennifer Lawrence.
      Zendaya is 6 feet 5 inches tall (approximately 2 meters), while Jennifer Lawrence
      is 5'10" (approximately 1.8 meters).
    f793bb69-8cc3-407d-8f09-be43fa5fe8e0: 'YES.

      Zendaya and Jennifer Lawrence are both models known for their impressive physical
      stature. While exact measurements can vary, it''s common to estimate that women
      typically stand between 5''9" (174 cm) and 6''2" (188 cm) tall, depending on
      factors like age, gender, and specific body types. Therefore, given the range
      of heights mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that Zendaya would be taller
      than Jennifer Lawrence.'

    094a8454-eaa0-4891-b3ee-bdf9d4a34c94: 'Yes, Mark Wahlberg is taller than Emma

      1. Mark Wahlberg: He was born on July 24, 1970, and his height ranges from 5
      feet 8 inches (63. 5 cm) at the shoulder to 5 feet 1 inch (64. 5 cm) at the

      2. Emma Stone: She was born on August 30, 1970, and her height ranges from 5''5"
      to 5''7" (69-77 cm).


      Mark Wahlberg''s height falls within the range that is typically considered
      "taller" compared to Emma Stone. For instance, he stands slightly over 5 feet
      tall, while Emma Stone is about the same height as Mark Wahlberg.


      Therefore, based on these measurements, it can be concluded that Mark Wahlberg
      is indeed taller than Emma Stone.'

      Stone. While both actors have achieved notable heights in their careers, there
      is no information provided about their individual physical attributes. Therefore,
      the answer to the question "Is Mark Wahlberg taller than Emma Stone? " is **NO**.

    f361991e-a713-4b34-9a5d-193a1bffb401: 'Yes, Mark Wahlberg is taller than Emma
      Stone.

      To justify this, I need to consider the following information:

      1. Height measurements: While not explicitly stated in this question, it''s
      common practice to measure someone''s height on the same scale used for weight
      measurements (e.g., centimeters or inches). The fact that both Mark Wahlberg
      and Emma Stone have been mentioned as actors suggests they are likely measured
      at the same height.

      2. Gender difference: In most cases, male actors tend to be taller than female
      actors. However, there could be some variations in heights between these two
      actors based on their individual bodies and physical conditions.

      3. Celebrity presence: Mark Wahlberg is widely known as one of the best-known
      actors in Hollywood, so his height might be more easily recognized compared
      to Emma Stone, who may be less well-known.

      4. Cultural norms: It''s generally accepted in many cultures that men should
      be taller than women, which would explain why Mark Wahlberg might be taller
      than Emma Stone.

      5. Historical context: There has been a trend in celebrity culture over time
      where tall actors like Wahlberg have become more prominent and sought after,
      even if physically shorter actresses like Stone have achieved similar status.


      Given these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that Mark Wahlberg is indeed
      taller than Emma Stone, despite the lack of explicit measurement data provided
      in this question.'

      for his 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) height. On the other hand, Bruno Mars has been
      widely recognized as being slightly shorter than Kevin Hart due to his natural
      frame size. This difference in height makes it possible for someone to be both
      taller and shorter than another person at the same time.

    91108659-c181-45d1-96da-52a37295d6b6: 'To determine if Bruno Mars is taller than
      Kevin Hart based on their heights, we need to consider the following points:


      1. **Bruno Mars**: He is a well-known American singer-songwriter and musician.
      His height can vary depending on his physical appearance and the environment
      he performs in. However, as a public figure, his average height might be considered
      tall.


      2. **Kevin Hart**: He is also an American actor and comedian known for his comedic
      performance and physical abilities. The average height of a human adult male
      is around 5 feet 9 inches (173 cm).


      Now, comparing these two heights:

      - Bruno Mars'' typical height is approximately 60-64 inches (152-162 cm).

      - Kevin Hart'' s average height is 173 cm.


      Since 173 cm is much larger than 64 inches, it is clear that Bruno Mars is taller
