      follow a few steps. Here''s my thought process:


      Step 1: I know that the River Rhine is a major river in Europe, and it flows
      through several countries, including Switzerland, Austria, Germany, France,
      and the Netherlands.


      Step 2: I also know that the River Seine is a major river in France, and it
      flows through the heart of Paris.


      Step 3: Next, I''ll look up the approximate lengths of both rivers. According
      to various sources, the River Rhine is approximately 1,232 kilometers (766 miles)
      long, while the River Seine is approximately 777 kilometers (483 miles).


      Step 4: Now, I''ll compare the lengths of both rivers. Since the River Rhine
      is approximately 455 kilometers (284 miles) longer than the River Seine, I can
      conclude that the River Rhine is indeed longer than the River Seine.


      Therefore, my final answer is:


      YES'

      To answer this, I need to know the lengths of both rivers. According to my knowledge:


      * The Colorado River is approximately 1,450 miles (2,334 km) long.

      * The River Rhine is approximately 820 miles (1,320 km) long.


      Using these lengths, I can now answer the question:
