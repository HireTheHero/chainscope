      \ miles (2,334 kilometers) long.\n   - The River Rhine is approximately 768\
      \ miles (1,236 kilometers) long.\n\n2. **Compare the Lengths:**\n   - The Colorado\
      \ River is significantly longer than the River Rhine.\n   - To be more precise,\
      \ we can calculate the difference in length:\n     \\( 1,450 \\text{ miles}\
      \ - 768 \\text{ miles} = 682 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n3. **Conclude the Answer:**\n\
      \   - Since the Colorado River is longer than the River Rhine by 682 miles,\
      \ the answer to the question \"Is the Colorado River longer than the River Rhine?\"\
      \ is clearly **YES**."
