      1. The River Nile and Amazon River are the two longest rivers in the world.


      2. For many years, the Nile was considered the longest river, with a length
      of about 6,650 kilometers (4,132 miles).


      3. However, in 2007, a scientific expedition using GPS technology determined
      that the Amazon River is actually longer.


      4. The Amazon River was measured at approximately 6,800 kilometers (4,225 miles),
      slightly longer than the Nile.


      5. This means the Amazon River is now recognized as the world''s longest river,
