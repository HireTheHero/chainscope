      longer than the River Seine, let''s approach this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the length of the River Rhine.

      The River Rhine is 1,230 kilometers (764 miles) long. It flows from the Swiss
      Alps, through Germany and the Netherlands, before emptying into the North Sea.


      Step 2: Identify the length of the River Seine.

      The River Seine is 777 kilometers (483 miles) long. It rises in northeastern
      France and flows through Paris before emptying into the English Channel at Le
      Havre.


      Step 3: Compare the lengths of the two rivers.

      The River Rhine is 1,230 kilometers long, while the River Seine is 777 kilometers
      long. 1,230 kilometers is greater than 777 kilometers.
