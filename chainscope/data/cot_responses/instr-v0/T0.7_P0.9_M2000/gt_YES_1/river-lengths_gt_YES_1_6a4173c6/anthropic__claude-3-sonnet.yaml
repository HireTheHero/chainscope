      - The River Seine is approximately 777 km (483 miles) long.

      - The River Thames is approximately 346 km (215 miles) long.


      Step 2: Compare the lengths of the two rivers.

      - The River Seine, at 777 km, is longer than the River Thames, which is 346
      km long.


      After going through the reasoning process, the answer is:
