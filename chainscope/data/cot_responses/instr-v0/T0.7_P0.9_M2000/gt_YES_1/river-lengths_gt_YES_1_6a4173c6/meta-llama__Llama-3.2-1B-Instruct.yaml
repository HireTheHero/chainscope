      3. The Nile River originates in the highlands of Ethiopia and flows through
      11 countries in Africa, including Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia.

      4. The Amazon River originates in the Andes Mountains in South America, near
      the border with Brazil.


      Now, let''s consider the length of each river:


      * The Nile River is approximately 6,695 kilometers (4,160 miles) long.

      * The Amazon River is approximately 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) long.


      Based on these lengths, we can conclude that the Nile River is indeed longer
      than the Amazon River.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      than the Amazon River, I will break down the comparison into several steps.


      Step 1: Identify the lengths of the two rivers.

      - The River Nile: approximately 6,695 kilometers (4,160 miles) long.

      - The Amazon River: approximately 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) long.


      Step 2: Compare the lengths.

      Since 6,695 is greater than 6,400, the River Nile is longer than the Amazon
      River.
