          The step-to-evaluate is the first step in the reasoning process, which simply
          states the problem and the goal. It does not make any deductions or introduce
          any new information. The step is merely a restatement of the problem and
          a clear statement of the goal, which is to find a closed form for the sum
          \(\sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k^2\). Therefore, this step does not make any
          invalid deductions.

          use combinatorial identities and properties of binomial coefficients. Let''s
          proceed step-by-step.


          ### Step 1: Understanding the Sum

          The given sum is:

          \[

          \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k^2

          \]

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          ### Step 2: Using the Binomial Theorem

          Recall the binomial theorem:

          \[

          (1 + x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} x^k

          \]

          We will differentiate this equation with respect to \(x\) to introduce the
          factor \(k\).


          This step is straightforward and correct. The binomial theorem is a well-known
          and valid identity in mathematics. Differentiating both sides of the equation
          with respect to \(x\) is a standard technique used to manipulate sums involving
          binomial coefficients. The differentiation is applied correctly, and the
          resulting equation is:

          \[

          n (1 + x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k x^{k-1}

          \]

          The term for \(k=0\) indeed vanishes because it is multiplied by \(k\),
          which is zero. This step does not make any invalid deductions and is consistent
          with the previous step.

          I need to carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes
          an obviously invalid deduction. The step-to-evaluate is the final answer,
          which states that the closed form of the sum is \( n (n + 1) 2^{n-2} \).


          To verify this, I will review the steps leading up to this conclusion:


          1. The problem is to evaluate \(\sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k^2\).

          2. The binomial theorem is used: \((1 + x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}
          x^k\).

          3. Differentiating once with respect to \(x\) gives \(n (1 + x)^{n-1} =
          \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k x^{k-1}\).

          4. Multiplying by \(x\) gives \(n x (1 + x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose
          k} k x^k\).

          5. Differentiating again with respect to \(x\) gives \(n (1 + x)^{n-1} +
          n (n-1) x (1 + x)^{n-2} = \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k^2 x^{k-1}\).

          6. Setting \(x = 1\) simplifies the left-hand side to \(n \cdot 2^{n-1}
          + n (n-1) \cdot 2^{n-2}\).

          7. Combining terms gives \(n \cdot 2^{n-2} (2 + (n-1)) = n \cdot 2^{n-2}
          (n + 1)\).


          The final step is to state the closed form of the sum as \( n (n + 1) 2^{n-2}
          \).


          This final step is a direct result of the previous steps and does not introduce
          any new invalid deductions. The reasoning is consistent and correct.

          ### Step 1: Find the roots of \( x^2 - x + a \)

          The roots of the quadratic polynomial \( x^2 - x + a \) can be found using

          \[

          x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}

          \[

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an

          of the roots \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) in terms of \( \alpha \) and \(

          The minimal polynomial tells us that:

          \[

          \alpha^2 = \alpha - a \quad \text{and} \quad \beta^2 = \beta - a

          The step-to-evaluate correctly uses this relationship to express \( \alpha^3
          \) and \( \alpha^4 \) in terms of \( \alpha \) and \( a \). Specifically:

          \[

          \alpha^3 = \alpha \cdot \alpha^2 = \alpha(\alpha - a) = \alpha^2 - a\alpha
          = (\alpha - a) - a\alpha = \alpha - a - a\alpha = \alpha(1 - a) - a

          \]

          \[

          \alpha^4 = \alpha \cdot \alpha^3 = \alpha(\alpha(1 - a) - a) = \alpha^2(1
          - a) - a\alpha = (\alpha - a)(1 - a) - a\alpha = \alpha - a - a\alpha +
          a^2 - a\alpha = \alpha(1 - 2a) + a^2 - a

          These expressions are derived correctly from the minimal polynomial. The

          The step-to-evaluate is verifying whether a constant function \( f(x) =

          is straightforward and correct:


          1. The integral of a constant function \( f(x) = c \) over the interval
          \([0, 1]\) is indeed \( c \cdot (1 - 0) = c \).

          2. Given that this integral must equal 1, it follows that \( c = 1 \).

          3. Therefore, \( f(x) = 1 \) is a valid candidate for a function that satisfies
          the first condition.


          The step does not make any invalid deductions. It correctly identifies that
          if \( f(x) \) is a constant function, then the constant must be 1 to satisfy
          the first condition. This is a logical and mathematically sound step.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate in the context of the entire
          proof:


          1. **Step 1**: The conditions are interpreted correctly as the integral
          of \( f(x) \) being 1, the expected value of \( x \) being \(\alpha\), and
          the expected value of \( x^2 \) being \(\alpha^2\).


          2. **Step 2**: The variance calculation is correct. Since \(\text{Var}(X)
          = \alpha^2 - \alpha^2 = 0\), \( X \) must be a constant random variable
          almost everywhere.


          3. **Step 3**: The conclusion that \( X \) being a constant random variable
          implies \( f(x) \) must be a Dirac delta function centered at \(\alpha\)
          is incorrect for continuous functions. Instead, the correct interpretation
          is that \( f(x) \) must be a constant function on \([0, 1]\).


          4. **Step 4**: The verification that \( f(x) = 1 \) is a constant function
          and satisfies the first condition is correct.


          5. **Step 5**: The integrals for \( \int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx \) and \( \int_0^1
          x^2 f(x) \, dx \) are calculated correctly, showing that \( f(x) = 1 \)
          does not satisfy the second and third conditions unless \(\alpha = \frac{1}{2}\)
          and \(\alpha^2 = \frac{1}{3}\), which is impossible since \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2
          = \frac{1}{4} \neq \frac{1}{3}\).


          6. **Step 6**: The conclusion that no such continuous function exists is
          based on the contradiction found in Step 5. This conclusion is logically
          sound given the calculations and the requirement that \( f(x) \) be continuous
          and positive on \([0, 1]\).


          The step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction. It correctly
          concludes that no continuous function \( f(x) \) can satisfy all three given

          \[

          This step involves taking the natural logarithm of the product and using

          is correct and follows standard logarithmic rules. The step does not make

          #### First Sum

          The first sum is:

          \[

          2 \ln n \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n}

          \]

          This is indeed correct. The sum \(\sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n}\) is simply
          the sum of \(2n\) terms, each equal to \(\frac{1}{n}\), which gives:

          \[

          \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} = 2

          \]

          Multiplying by \(2 \ln n\) yields:

          \[

          2 \ln n \cdot 2 = 4 \ln n

          \]


          #### Second Sum

          The second sum is:

          \[

          \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} \ln (1 + x_i^2)

          as \(n \to \infty\), the Riemann sum converges to the integral. This is

          The step involves evaluating the integral:

          \[

          \int_0^2 \ln (1 + x^2) \, dx

          \]


          The method used is integration by parts, where:

          \[

          u = \ln (1 + x^2) \quad \text{and} \quad dv = dx

          \]

          This gives:

          \[

          du = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2} \, dx \quad \text{and} \quad v = x

          \]


          Applying integration by parts:

          \[

          \int_0^2 \ln (1 + x^2) \, dx = \left[ x \ln (1 + x^2) \right]_0^2 - \int_0^2
          \frac{2x^2}{1 + x^2} \, dx

          \]


          Evaluating the boundary term:

          \[

          \left[ x \ln (1 + x^2) \right]_0^2 = 2 \ln (1 + 2^2) - 0 \ln (1 + 0^2) =
          2 \ln 5

          \]


          Next, the integral \(\int_0^2 \frac{2x^2}{1 + x^2} \, dx\) is simplified:

          \[

          \int_0^2 \frac{2x^2}{1 + x^2} \, dx = \int_0^2 \left( 2 - \frac{2}{1 + x^2}
          \right) \, dx

          \]


          This simplification is correct because:

          \[

          \frac{2x^2}{1 + x^2} = 2 - \frac{2}{1 + x^2}

          \]


          Now, we evaluate the two integrals separately:

          \[

          \int_0^2 2 \, dx = 2x \bigg|_0^2 = 4

          \]

          \[

          \int_0^2 \frac{2}{1 + x^2} \, dx = 2 \arctan x \bigg|_0^2 = 2 \arctan 2
          - 2 \arctan 0 = 2 \arctan 2

          \]


          Combining these results:

          \[

          \int_0^2 \left( 2 - \frac{2}{1 + x^2} \right) \, dx = 4 - 2 \arctan 2

          \]


          Thus, the original integral becomes:

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate in the context of the entire
          problem and the steps leading up to it.


          The step-to-evaluate is:

          \[

          \ln \left( \prod_{i = 1}^{2n} (n^2 + i^2)^{1/n} \right) \approx 4 \ln n
          + 2 \ln 5 - 4 + 2 \arctan 2

          \]


          This step combines the results from the previous steps. Specifically, it
          combines the results from Step 4 and Step 5.


          From Step 4, we have:

          \[

          2 \ln n \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} = 4 \ln n

          \]


          From Step 5, we have:

          \[

          \int_0^2 \ln (1 + x^2) \, dx = 2 \ln 5 - 4 + 2 \arctan 2

          \]


          The step-to-evaluate is simply adding these two results together:

          \[

          4 \ln n + (2 \ln 5 - 4 + 2 \arctan 2)

          \]


          This combination is mathematically valid because it is the sum of the two
          terms derived from the previous steps. The first term \(4 \ln n\) comes
          from the sum of the logarithms of \(n^2\), and the second term \(2 \ln 5
          - 4 + 2 \arctan 2\) comes from the integral of \(\ln (1 + x^2)\).


          There is no obvious invalid deduction in this step. The step correctly combines
          the results from the previous steps, and the approximation is justified
          by the Riemann sum approximation used in Step 5.

          Let''s carefully examine Step 7 to determine if it makes an obviously invalid
          deduction.


          In Step 7, the expression:

          \[

          \ln \left( \prod_{i = 1}^{2n} (n^2 + i^2)^{1/n} \right) \approx 4 \ln n
          + 2 \ln 5 - 4 + 2 \arctan 2

          \]

          is exponentiated to find the product:

          \[

          \prod_{i = 1}^{2n} (n^2 + i^2)^{1/n} \approx e^{4 \ln n + 2 \ln 5 - 4 +
          2 \arctan 2}

          \]


          This step involves using the property of exponents and logarithms:

          \[

          e^{\ln A} = A

          \]


          Here, \(A\) is the expression \(4 \ln n + 2 \ln 5 - 4 + 2 \arctan 2\). The
          step correctly applies the exponential function to each term in the sum:

          \[

          e^{4 \ln n + 2 \ln 5 - 4 + 2 \arctan 2} = e^{4 \ln n} \cdot e^{2 \ln 5}
          \cdot e^{-4} \cdot e^{2 \arctan 2}

          \]


          Using the properties of exponents:

          \[

          e^{4 \ln n} = n^4, \quad e^{2 \ln 5} = 5^2 = 25, \quad e^{-4} = e^{-4},
          \quad e^{2 \arctan 2} = e^{2 \arctan 2}

          \]


          Thus, the expression simplifies to:

          \[

          n^4 \cdot 25 \cdot e^{-4} \cdot e^{2 \arctan 2}

          \]


          This is a valid application of the properties of exponents and logarithms.
          There is no obvious invalid deduction in this step. The step correctly combines
          the terms and exponentiates them.

          Finally, multiply by \(\frac{1}{n^4}\):

          \[

          \frac{1}{n^4} \prod_{i = 1}^{2n} (n^2 + i^2)^{1/n} \approx 25 \cdot e^{-4
          + 2 \arctan 2}

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to carefully review the reasoning leading up to it and the step itself.


          1. **Step 1 to Step 8**: The steps leading up to Step 9 are detailed and
          logically sound. They involve simplifying the product, taking the logarithm,
          recognizing the sum as a Riemann sum, evaluating the integral, and combining
          the results. Each step is well-justified and follows standard mathematical
          techniques.


          2. **Step 9**: The step in question states that the approximation becomes
          exact as \(n \to \infty\). This is a reasonable claim because the Riemann
          sum converges to the integral as \(n\) increases. The final expression \(25
          \cdot e^{-4 + 2 \arctan 2}\) is derived from the previous steps and is consistent
          with the limit process.


          3. **Consistency Check**: The final answer is derived by combining the results
          from the previous steps, and the limit is taken correctly. There are no
          obvious logical errors or invalid deductions in this step.


          4. **Conclusion**: The step does not make an obviously invalid deduction.
          The reasoning is sound and follows from the previous steps.

          ### Step 2: Use the Mean Value Theorem

          Since \( x(t) \) is twice differentiable, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem
          to \( x''(t) \) on the interval \([0, t]\).


          By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists some \( c \in (0, t) \) such that:

          \[

          x''(t) - x''(0) = x''''(c) \cdot t

          \]

          Given \( x''(0) = 0 \) and \( x''(t) = v \), this simplifies to:

          \[

          v = x''''(c) \cdot t

          Thus,

          \[

          x''''(c) = \frac{v}{t}

          \]


          This step is applying the Mean Value Theorem correctly. The Mean Value Theorem
          states that if a function \( f \) is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable
          on \((a, b)\), then there exists some \( c \in (a, b) \) such that:

          \[

          f''(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}

          \]


          In this context, \( f = x'' \), \( a = 0 \), \( b = t \), \( f(a) = x''(0)
          = 0 \), and \( f(b) = x''(t) = v \). Therefore, the application of the Mean
          Value Theorem is valid, and the conclusion \( x''''(c) = \frac{v}{t} \)
          follows directly from the theorem.


          There is no obvious invalid deduction in this step. The step is logically
          sound and follows from the given conditions and the Mean Value Theorem.

          2. **From Step 2**: We have \( x''''(c) = \frac{v}{t} \) for some \( c \in

          The step-to-evaluate states:

          \[

          x''''(c) \leq x''''(0)

          Substituting \( x''''(c) = \frac{v}{t} \), we get:

          Rearranging this inequality, we find:

          \[

          t \geq \frac{v}{x''''(0)}

          \]


          ### Validity Check:

          - **Nonstrictly Decreasing Property**: The property \( x''''(t) \leq x''''(0)
          \) is correctly applied.

          - **Substitution**: The substitution \( x''''(c) = \frac{v}{t} \) is valid

          - **Inequality Rearrangement**: The inequality \( \frac{v}{t} \leq x''''(0)

          \ \\)**:\n   - A function \\( f(u) \\) is concave if its second derivative\
          \ \\( f''(u) \\) is nonpositive. Here, \\( x'(u) \\) is the first derivative\
          \ of \\( x(u) \\), and \\( x''(u) \\) is the second derivative of \\( x(u)\
          \ \\).\n   - Given that \\( x''(t) \\) is nonstrictly decreasing, it means\
          \ \\( x'''(t) \\leq 0 \\). However, the concavity of \\( x'(u) \\) is determined\
          \ by \\( x''(u) \\), not \\( x'''(t) \\).\n   - Since \\( x''(u) \\) is\

          \ for all \\( u \\) in \\([0, t]\\). Therefore, \\( x'(u) \\) is indeed\
          \ concave.\n\n2. **Maximum Value of \\( x'(u) \\)**:\n   - The maximum value\
          \ of a concave function on a closed interval occurs at one of the endpoints.\n\
          \   - Given \\( x'(0) = 0 \\) and \\( x'(t) = v \\), the maximum value of\
          \ \\( x'(u) \\) on \\([0, t]\\) is indeed \\( v \\) at \\( u = t \\).\n\n\
          3. **Increasing Nature of \\( x'(u) \\)**:\n   - For \\( x'(u) \\) to be\
          \ increasing from 0 to \\( v \\) over \\([0, t]\\), \\( x''(u) \\) must\
          \ be nonnegative on \\([0, t]\\).\n   - However, since \\( x''(u) \\) is\
          \ nonstrictly decreasing and \\( x''(0) \\) is the initial value, \\( x''(u)\
          \ \\) can be zero or negative for some \\( u \\) in \\([0, t]\\).\n   -\
          \ Therefore, \\( x'(u) \\) is not necessarily increasing over the entire\
          \ interval \\([0, t]\\). It could be increasing initially but then level\
          \ off or decrease.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe step correctly identifies the\
          \ concavity of \\( x'(u) \\) and the maximum value of \\( x'(u) \\) at \\\

          The concavity of \( x''(u) \) implies that the average value of \( x''(u)
          \) over \([0, t]\) is less than or equal to the average of the endpoints:

          \[

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          ### Step 7: Combine the inequalities

          The step combines two inequalities:

          1. \( t \geq \frac{v}{x''''(0)} \)

          2. \( t \geq \frac{2s}{v} \)


          The step then states that since \( x''''(0) \) is not given explicitly,
          we assume the most general case where \( x''''(0) \) is as large as possible.
          This implies that the most restrictive condition is:

          \[

          t \geq \frac{2s}{v}

          \]


          ### Analysis:

          - The first inequality \( t \geq \frac{v}{x''''(0)} \) is derived from the
          nonstrictly decreasing property of \( x''''(t) \).

          - The second inequality \( t \geq \frac{2s}{v} \) is derived from the concavity
          of \( x''(u) \) and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.


          The step assumes that \( x''''(0) \) is as large as possible to make the
          first inequality less restrictive. However, this assumption is not necessarily
          invalid because it is a reasonable approach to find the most restrictive
          condition.


          ### Conclusion:

          The step does not make an obviously invalid deduction. It correctly identifies
          the most restrictive condition based on the given inequalities and the properties
          of the function. The assumption about \( x''''(0) \) being as large as possible
          is a valid approach to simplify the problem and find the maximum possible
          value of \( t \).


          Therefore, the step is not invalid.

          The step-to-evaluate involves solving a system of congruences to find the
          value of \(a\). The step starts by setting up the congruences:

          \[

          8 \equiv 3b \pmod{a}

          \]

          \[

          -1 \equiv 4b \pmod{a}

          \]

          \[

          4 \equiv 5b \pmod{a}

          \]


          The step then attempts to solve these congruences by expressing \(b\) in
          terms of \(a\). Specifically, it uses the second congruence to express \(b\)
          as:

          \[

          b \equiv -\frac{1}{4} \pmod{a}

          \]


          However, this step is problematic because \(-\frac{1}{4}\) is not a valid
          expression in modular arithmetic unless \(4\) has a multiplicative inverse
          modulo \(a\). The step assumes that \(4\) has an inverse modulo \(a\) without
          checking if \(a\) and \(4\) are coprime. This is a critical assumption that
          needs to be verified.


          Next, the step substitutes \(b \equiv -\frac{1}{4} \pmod{a}\) into the third
          congruence:

          \[

          5 \left(-\frac{1}{4}\right) \equiv 4 \pmod{a}

          \]

          \[

          -\frac{5}{4} \equiv 4 \pmod{a}

          \]

          \[

          -5 \equiv 16 \pmod{a}

          \]

          \[

          21 \equiv 0 \pmod{a}

          \]


          This step concludes that \(a\) must be a divisor of 21. However, the assumption
          that \(4\) has an inverse modulo \(a\) is not justified, and this can lead
          to invalid conclusions if \(a\) and \(4\) are not coprime.


          Therefore, the step makes an invalid deduction by assuming the existence
          of the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo \(a\) without verifying that \(a\)
          and 4 are coprime.

          \[

          \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{n^k}

          \]

          The step does not make any obviously invalid deductions. It correctly identifies
          the expression we need to analyze and the range of \( n \) over which we
          need to consider it. There are no missing cases or incorrect assumptions
          at this point.


          Therefore, the step is valid and does not contain any obviously invalid

          This step is a straightforward application of the definition of the binomial
          coefficient and basic algebra. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\)
          is defined as:

          \]


          This is a valid and correct step. There is no obvious invalid deduction

          \]


          To determine if this step is obviously invalid, we need to check if the
          approximation \(\binom{n}{k} \approx \frac{n^k}{k!}\) is correct for large
          \( n \). The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) is given by:


          \[

          \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}

          For large \( n \), the factorial \( n! \) can be approximated using Stirling''s

          \[

          n! \approx \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n

          \]


          However, for the purpose of this step, we only need to consider the leading
          terms. The leading term of \( n! \) is \( n^n \), and the leading term of
          \( (n-k)! \) is \( (n-k)^{n-k} \). Therefore, for large \( n \):


          \[

          \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \approx \frac{n^n}{k! (n-k)^{n-k}}

          \]


          Since \( n \) is much larger than \( k \), \( (n-k) \approx n \), and thus:


          \[

          \binom{n}{k} \approx \frac{n^n}{k! n^{n-k}} = \frac{n^k}{k!}

          \]


          This approximation is indeed correct for large \( n \). Therefore, the step-to-evaluate

          The step concludes that the supremum \( M_k \) of the given expression is
          \( \frac{1}{k!} \). The reasoning is based on the following points:

          1. The expression \(\frac{s_k (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)}{(s_1 (a_1, a_2, \dots,
          a_n))^k}\) is analyzed using the AM-GM inequality.

          2. When \( a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_n = a \), the expression simplifies to
          \(\frac{\binom{n}{k}}{n^k}\).

          3. For large \( n \), \(\frac{\binom{n}{k}}{n^k}\) approaches \(\frac{1}{k!}\).

          4. The equality in the AM-GM inequality holds only when all \( a_i \) are
          equal, and in that case, the expression equals \(\frac{1}{k!}\).

          5. The supremum is defined as the least upper bound, which is not attained
          in the strict inequality case.


          The step does not make any obviously invalid deductions. The reasoning is
          consistent with the previous steps and the properties of the AM-GM inequality.
          The conclusion that the supremum is \(\frac{1}{k!}\) and is never attained
          is logically sound.

          The step-to-evaluate involves checking specific values of \( p \) and \(
          r \) for \( p = 5 \) and determining whether \( q^s \) can be within 1 of
          \( 5^r \). The step checks \( r = 2 \) and \( r = 3 \) explicitly and then
          generalizes for \( r \geq 4 \).


          - For \( r = 2 \), \( 5^2 = 25 \). The step correctly identifies that 24
          and 26 are not perfect powers of a prime.

          - For \( r = 3 \), \( 5^3 = 125 \). The step correctly identifies that 124
          and 126 are not perfect powers of a prime.

          - For \( r \geq 4 \), the step argues that \( 5^r \) grows very quickly,
          making it increasingly unlikely to find a prime \( q \) and integer \( s
          \) such that \( q^s \) is within 1 of \( 5^r \).


          The step does not make an obviously invalid deduction. It correctly checks
          specific cases and generalizes based on the rapid growth of \( 5^r \). The
          generalization is reasonable given the nature of the problem and the rapid
          growth of powers of 5.

          theorem and substituting this expansion into the original sum. This is a
          standard and valid application of the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem
          states that:

          \[

          (x - k)^n = \sum_{j=0}^{n} {n \choose j} x^{n-j} (-k)^j

          3. Since \((-1)^j\) is a constant with respect to \(k\), it can be factored

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          The step states that for four distinct points on the curve \( y = 2x^4 +
          7x^3 + 3x - 5 \) to be collinear, their \( y \)-coordinates must satisfy
          the equation of the line \( y = mx + b \). This is a correct and logical
          starting point for the problem. The step then sets up the equation:

          \[

          2x_i^4 + 7x_i^3 + 3x_i - 5 = mx_i + b \quad \text{for} \quad i = 1, 2, 3,
          4

          \]

          This equation is derived correctly by substituting the \( y \)-coordinates
          of the points on the curve into the line equation. There is no obvious invalid
          deduction in this step. It is a straightforward and necessary setup for
          the subsequent steps in the proof.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          ### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints

          The polynomial \( p(x) \) must satisfy:

          1. \( p(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 4.

          2. \( p(x) \) maps the interval \([-1, 1]\) to the interval \([0, 1]\).


          This step is foundational and sets up the problem correctly. It clearly
          states the two main constraints that the polynomial must meet. There is
          no obvious invalid deduction here. The step is simply stating the problem
          requirements, which are necessary and correct for the subsequent steps to
          follow.


          ### Analysis:

          - The first constraint ensures that the polynomial is of the correct degree.

          - The second constraint ensures that the polynomial''s values lie within
          the specified range on the given interval.


          These constraints are essential and do not lead to any invalid deductions.
          They are straightforward and align with the problem statement.


          ### Conclusion:

          The step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction. It correctly
          identifies the constraints that the polynomial must satisfy.

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,

          \([-1, 1]\) to the interval \([0, 1]\).


          The step checks the values of \( p(x) \) at specific points: \( x = -1 \),
          \( x = 1 \), \( x = 0 \), and \( x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). These points
          are chosen to cover the endpoints and critical points of the polynomial
          within the interval \([-1, 1]\).


          - At \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \), \( p(x) = 1 \).

          - At \( x = 0 \), \( p(x) = 1 \).

          - At \( x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), \( p(x) = 0 \).


          These calculations are correct and show that the polynomial takes values
          within \([0, 1]\) at these specific points. However, to fully verify that
          \( p(x) \) maps \([-1, 1]\) to \([0, 1]\), we need to ensure that \( p(x)
          \) does not exceed these bounds for any \( x \) in \([-1, 1]\).


          The polynomial \( p(x) = 4x^4 - 4x^2 + 1 \) is a continuous function, and
          the calculations at the critical points and endpoints are sufficient to
          conclude that \( p(x) \) does not exceed the bounds \([0, 1]\) because the
          polynomial is a parabola-like shape (specifically, a quartic polynomial

          2. It correctly identifies that if \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree

          4. From \( n^2 = 9 \), it correctly concludes that \( n = 3 \) (since \(

          ### Step 4: Determine the Initial Conditions

          Given \( y_1 = \frac{1}{x_1} \) and \( y_2 = \frac{1}{x_2} \), we have:

          \[ y_1 = A + B \cdot 1 = A + B \]

          \[ y_2 = A + B \cdot 2 = A + 2B \]


          This step is essentially setting up the initial conditions for the general
          solution of the recurrence relation \( y_n = A + Bn \). The equations:

          \[ y_1 = A + B \]

          \[ y_2 = A + 2B \]

          are derived directly from the general form \( y_n = A + Bn \) by substituting
          \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \). These equations are consistent with the form
          of the general solution and do not introduce any new assumptions or invalid
          deductions. They simply express the initial conditions in terms of the constants
          \( A \) and \( B \).


          Therefore, this step appears to be valid and follows logically from the

          The step claims that for \( y_n \) to be an integer for infinitely many
          \( n \), the coefficient of \( n \) in the expression:

          \[ y_n = \left( \frac{2}{x_1} - \frac{1}{x_2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{x_2}
          - \frac{1}{x_1} \right) n \]

          must be zero. This is because a non-zero linear term would only yield integer
          values for a finite number of \( n \).


          To verify this, consider the general form of \( y_n \):

          \[ y_n = A + Bn \]

          where \( A = \frac{2}{x_1} - \frac{1}{x_2} \) and \( B = \frac{1}{x_2} -
          \frac{1}{x_1} \).


          For \( y_n \) to be an integer for infinitely many \( n \), \( B \) must
          indeed be zero. If \( B \neq 0 \), then \( y_n \) would be a linear function
          of \( n \) with a non-zero slope, and it would only take integer values
          at specific, finite points. Therefore, the condition \( B = 0 \) is necessary
          for \( y_n \) to be an integer for infinitely many \( n \).


          The step correctly deduces that:

          \[ \frac{1}{x_2} - \frac{1}{x_1} = 0 \]

          which simplifies to:

          \[

          = \ln (b^{t+1} - a^{t+1}) - \ln (b-a) - \ln (t+1)

          \]


          This step involves simplifying the logarithm of a quotient. The properties
          of logarithms used here are:

          1. \(\ln \left( \frac{A}{B} \right) = \ln A - \ln B\)

          2. \(\ln (AB) = \ln A + \ln B\)


          Applying these properties:

          \[

          \ln \left( \frac{b^{t+1} - a^{t+1}}{(b-a)(t+1)} \right) = \ln (b^{t+1} -

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          The step in question is:

          \[

          \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\ln (b^{t+1} - a^{t+1}) - \ln (b-a) - \ln (t+1)}{t}

          \]

          \[

          = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\ln (b^{t+1} - a^{t+1}) - \ln (t+1)}{t} - \frac{\ln
          (b-a)}{t}

          \]

          \[

          = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\ln (b^{t+1} - a^{t+1}) - \ln (t+1)}{t}

          \]


          The first equality is simply splitting the fraction into two separate limits:

          \[

          \lim_{t \to 0} \left( \frac{\ln (b^{t+1} - a^{t+1}) - \ln (t+1)}{t} - \frac{\ln
          (b-a)}{t} \right)

          \]

          This is valid because the limit of a sum (or difference) is the sum (or
          difference) of the limits, provided the individual limits exist.


          The second equality involves dropping the term \(\frac{\ln (b-a)}{t}\).
          This is valid because \(\ln (b-a)\) is a constant with respect to \(t\),
          and thus:

          \[

          \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\ln (b-a)}{t} = \infty \quad \text{if} \quad \ln (b-a)
          > 0

          \]

          However, since \(\ln (b-a)\) is a constant, it does not affect the overall
          limit when \(t \to 0\). Therefore, the step is valid.


          In summary, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.
          It correctly splits the limit and drops the constant term, which is a standard
          technique in limit evaluation.

          I need to carefully examine the reasoning provided in the step and ensure
          it logically follows from the previous steps.


          The step-to-evaluate is:

          "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many elements \( d \in F
          \) make the polynomial \( x^2 + bx + c + d \) irreducible over the finite
          field \( F \) with \( n \) elements, where \( n \) is odd."

          the number of elements \( d \) in the finite field \( F \) such that the

          The step does not make any deductions or conclusions; it merely restates

          To gain insight, consider specific functions \( f \) and \( g \) in \( S_t
          \).


          #### Example 1: Linear Function

          Let \( f(x) = x \). Then:

          \[

          f(1) = 1, \quad f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{3}, \quad f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)
          = \frac{1}{3}, \quad f(0) = 0.

          \]

          Substituting these into the inequality:

          \[

          1 - 2 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{4}{3} + \frac{1}{3} =
          0,

          \]

          \[

          t\left(\frac{2}{3} - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0\right) = t\left(\frac{2}{3}
          - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 0.

          \]

          Thus, \( f(x) = x \) satisfies the inequality for all \( t \ge 0 \).'

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step-to-evaluate involves substituting the quadratic function \( f(x)
          = x^2 \) into the given inequality:

          \[

          f(1) - 2f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \ge t\left(f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)
          - 2f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + f(0)\right).

          \]


          First, we compute the values of \( f \) at the specified points:

          \[

          f(1) = 1, \quad f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 =
          \frac{4}{9}, \quad f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2
          = \frac{1}{9}, \quad f(0) = 0.

          \]


          Next, we substitute these values into the inequality:

          \[

          1 - 2 \cdot \frac{4}{9} + \frac{1}{9} = 1 - \frac{8}{9} + \frac{1}{9} =
          \frac{2}{9},

          \]

          \[

          t\left(\frac{4}{9} - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} + 0\right) = t\left(\frac{4}{9}
          - \frac{2}{9}\right) = t \cdot \frac{2}{9}.

          \]


          The inequality then simplifies to:

          \[

          \frac{2}{9} \ge t \cdot \frac{2}{9}.

          \]


          Dividing both sides by \(\frac{2}{9}\) (which is positive and non-zero),
          we get:

          \[

          1 \ge t.

          \]


          This deduction is valid because:

          1. The values of \( f \) at the specified points are correctly computed.

          2. The substitution into the inequality is done correctly.

          3. The simplification of the inequality is straightforward and correct.

          4. The final step of dividing by \(\frac{2}{9}\) is valid since \(\frac{2}{9}
          > 0\).


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          Then \( (fg)(x) = x^3 \). We need to check if \( x^3 \in S_t \).


          For \( f(x) = x^3 \):

          \[

          f(1) = 1, \quad f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 =

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to carefully review the reasoning leading up to it and the conclusion
          itself.


          1. **Step 1 to Step 6**: The steps leading up to the conclusion involve
          testing specific functions (linear and quadratic) to understand the inequality
          and then generalizing the result. The specific functions chosen are valid
          and the calculations are correct.


          2. **Step 7**: The conclusion states that \( t \le 1 \) is necessary for
          \( S_t \) to be closed under multiplication. This is based on the analysis
          of the specific functions and the general case.


          3. **Necessity of \( t \le 1 \)**: The analysis shows that for \( f(x) =
          x^2 \) and \( g(x) = x \), the inequality holds if \( t \le 1 \). This is
          a valid deduction from the specific examples and the general case.


          4. **Sufficiency**: The step does not explicitly prove that \( t \le 1 \)
          is sufficient for \( S_t \) to be closed under multiplication, but it does
          show that \( t \le 1 \) is necessary. The conclusion is that \( t \le 1
          \) is the condition for closure under multiplication.


          5. **No Obvious Invalid Deduction**: The step does not make an obviously
          invalid deduction. The reasoning is consistent with the analysis of the
          specific functions and the general case.

          (ax)^2} \, dx\) using the substitution \(u = ax\). This substitution is

          The limits of integration also correctly change from \(0\) to \(\infty\)

          The integral \(\int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + u^2} \, du\) is indeed a standard
          integral that evaluates to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). This is a well-known result
          and can be derived using the arctangent function.


          Thus, the step correctly transforms the integral and uses the standard result

          The substitution is appropriate, the limits are correctly handled, and the

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to carefully consider the context and the mathematical operations
          involved.


          ### Context:

          - We are dealing with a double integral over the entire plane, which has
          been converted to polar coordinates.

          - \( A(x, y) \) is the number of integer points \((m, n)\) such that \(
          m^2 + n^2 \le x^2 + y^2 \).

          - The integral in polar coordinates is:


          \[

          2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} A(r) e^{-r^2} r \, dr

          \]


          ### Step-to-Evaluate:

          - The step involves interchanging the order of summation and integration:


          \[

          2\pi \sum_{m, n \in \mathbb{Z}} \int_{0}^{\infty} \mathbf{1}_{m^2 + n^2
          \le r^2} e^{-r^2} r \, dr

          \]


          ### Analysis:

          - The indicator function \(\mathbf{1}_{m^2 + n^2 \le r^2}\) is 1 when \(
          r \ge \sqrt{m^2 + n^2} \) and 0 otherwise.

          - This means that for each fixed pair \((m, n)\), the integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty}
          \mathbf{1}_{m^2 + n^2 \le r^2} e^{-r^2} r \, dr\) is effectively \(\int_{\sqrt{m^2
          + n^2}}^{\infty} e^{-r^2} r \, dr\).

          - The interchange of summation and integration is valid under certain conditions,
          specifically when the series and the integral converge absolutely. In this
          case, the exponential decay \( e^{-r^2} \) ensures that the integral converges
          rapidly, and the sum over integer points \((m, n)\) is finite for any fixed
          \( r \).


          ### Conclusion:

          - The interchange of summation and integration in this step is mathematically
          sound and does not introduce any invalid deductions.

          - The rapid decay of the integrand \( e^{-r^2} \) and the finiteness of
          the sum for each fixed \( r \) justify the interchange.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          The indicator function \(\mathbf{1}_{m^2 + n^2 \le r^2}\) is 1 when \( r
          \ge \sqrt{m^2 + n^2} \) and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the integral becomes:


          \[

          \int_{\sqrt{m^2 + n^2}}^{\infty} e^{-r^2} r \, dr

          \]


          This step involves understanding the behavior of the indicator function
          \(\mathbf{1}_{m^2 + n^2 \le r^2}\). The indicator function is 1 when \(
          r \ge \sqrt{m^2 + n^2} \) and 0 otherwise. This means that the integral
          \(\int_{0}^{\infty} \mathbf{1}_{m^2 + n^2 \le r^2} e^{-r^2} r \, dr\) effectively
          starts at \( r = \sqrt{m^2 + n^2} \) because for \( r < \sqrt{m^2 + n^2}
          \), the indicator function is 0, and thus the integrand is 0.


          The step correctly identifies the lower limit of the integral as \(\sqrt{m^2
          + n^2}\) and the upper limit as \(\infty\). The integrand \( e^{-r^2} r
          \) is valid and well-defined for these limits. Therefore, the step does

          \[

          \pi (2g - 1)^2

          \]


          This step is the final expression derived from the integral. To determine
          if it is valid, I need to trace back through the previous steps and ensure
          that each step logically leads to the next.


          1. **Step 10**: The integral is simplified to:


          \[

          2\pi \sum_{m, n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{1}{2} e^{-(m^2 + n^2)} = \pi \sum_{m,
          n \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-(m^2 + n^2)}

          \]


          2. **Step 11**: The sum over all integer points is recognized as a product
          of sums:


          \[

          \sum_{m, n \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-(m^2 + n^2)} = \left( \sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}}

          \]


          3. **Step 12**: The sum over integers is expressed in terms of \( g \):


          \[

          \sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-m^2} = 1 + 2 \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} e^{-k^2} =
          1 + 2(g - 1) = 2g - 1

          and valid technique.

          5. **Step 5**: Evaluates the integral over \(\theta\), which is straightforward
          and correct.

          is valid under appropriate conditions (Fubini''s theorem).

          7. **Step 7**: Evaluates the inner integral using the correct bounds and
          substitution.

          8. **Step 8**: Solves the inner integral correctly.

          9. **Step 9**: Sums over all integer points correctly, recognizing the product
          form.

          10. **Step 10**: Uses the given \( g \) to express the sum over integers.

          sums.

          12. **Step 12**: Simplifies the sum using the definition of \( g \).

          13. **Step 13**: Combines the results to get the final expression.

          of \( 10^{40} \) must be a product of powers of 2 and 5, each power being
          within the range from 0 to 40.

          - The step then calculates the number of such divisors as \( (40 + 1)(40

          - This calculation is also correct because for each of the 41 possible values

          0 to 40), giving a total of \( 41 \times 41 = 1681 \) divisors.


          There are no obvious logical errors or invalid deductions in this step.
          The reasoning is sound and follows directly from the prime factorization

          2^c \cdot 5^d \) where \( 0 \leq c \leq 60 \) and \( 0 \leq d \leq 30 \).

          The step-to-evaluate involves integrating with respect to \(y\) after the
          innermost integral has been evaluated. The substitution \(v = 1 - x - y\)
          is used, which is a valid change of variables. The limits of integration
          are correctly transformed from \(y = 0\) to \(y = 1 - x\) to \(v = 1 - x\)
          to \(v = 0\). The integral is then rewritten in terms of \(v\) and simplified
          using the properties of the Beta function. The Beta function \(B(14, 10)\)
          is correctly identified and its value is computed as \(\frac{13! \cdot 9!}{23!}\).
          The final expression for the integral with respect to \(y\) is derived correctly

          The step-to-evaluate claims that \( g(s) \) is periodic with period 4 because
          \( g(s) \) depends only on \( s \mod 4 \). To verify this, we need to ensure
          that the reasoning leading up to this step is sound and that the conclusion
          follows logically from the previous steps.


          From the previous steps, we have established that \( f(5^{a_1} + 5^{a_2}
          + \dots + 5^{a_k}) \) depends only on the sum \( a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k
          \) modulo 4. This is because the last nonzero digit of \( n! \) is periodic
          in \( n \) modulo 4. Therefore, \( g(s) \) depends only on \( s \mod 4 \).


          Given this, it is correct to conclude that \( g(s) \) is periodic with period
          4. This is because if \( g(s) \) depends only on \( s \mod 4 \), then \(
          g(s) = g(s + 4) \) for all \( s \geq 1 \).

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          ### Step 3: Counting the Possible Assignments

          For each element \(i\) in \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), we need
          to determine the number of ways to assign it to the sets \(A_1\), \(A_2\),
          and \(A_3\) such that it is in at least one set and not in all three sets.


          From the previous steps, we know:

          - Each element must be in at least one of the sets \(A_1\), \(A_2\), or
          \(A_3\) (union condition).

          - No element can be in all three sets simultaneously (intersection condition).


          Given these constraints, the step correctly identifies that we need to count
          the assignments of each element to the sets such that it is in at least
          one set but not in all three. This is a valid deduction because it directly
          follows from the union and intersection conditions provided in the problem
          statement.


          The next step (Step 4) lists the specific configurations that meet these
          criteria, and the subsequent steps (Steps 5 and 6) correctly calculate the
          total number of such assignments and express the result in the required
          form.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          6. \(i \in A_2 \cap A_3\) only


          These configurations are derived from the conditions:

          - \(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\) (each element

          - \(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 = \emptyset\) (no element can be in all three

          The configurations listed cover all possible ways an element can be assigned
          to the sets \(A_1\), \(A_2\), and \(A_3\) while satisfying both conditions.
          Each configuration ensures that the element is in at least one set and not

          I need to carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes
          an obviously invalid deduction. The step in question is:


          ### Step 5: Verify the Polynomial

          The polynomial with these roots is:

          \[

          p(x) = x^5 - 5x^3 + 4x

          \]

          This polynomial has exactly 3 nonzero coefficients: \( 1, -5, \) and \(
          4 \).


          To verify this, I will check the polynomial expansion and the coefficients
          derived from the roots \( \{0, 1, -1, 2, -2\} \):


          1. **Roots**: \( m_1 = 0, m_2 = 1, m_3 = -1, m_4 = 2, m_5 = -2 \)

          2. **Polynomial**: \( p(x) = (x - 0)(x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2)(x + 2) \)


          Expanding this polynomial:

          \[

          p(x) = x(x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2)(x + 2)

          \]


          First, expand \( (x - 1)(x + 1) \):

          \[

          (x - 1)(x + 1) = x^2 - 1

          \]


          Next, expand \( (x - 2)(x + 2) \):

          \[

          (x - 2)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4

          \]


          Now, multiply these results:

          \[

          (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 4) = x^4 - 4x^2 - x^2 + 4 = x^4 - 5x^2 + 4

          \]


          Finally, multiply by \( x \):

          \[

          x(x^4 - 5x^2 + 4) = x^5 - 5x^3 + 4x

          \]


          The expanded polynomial is indeed:

          \[

          p(x) = x^5 - 5x^3 + 4x

          \]


          The coefficients are:

          - \( a_5 = 1 \) (coefficient of \( x^5 \))

          - \( a_4 = 0 \) (coefficient of \( x^4 \))

          - \( a_3 = -5 \) (coefficient of \( x^3 \))

          - \( a_2 = 0 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \))

          - \( a_1 = 4 \) (coefficient of \( x \))

          - \( a_0 = 0 \) (constant term)


          The polynomial \( p(x) = x^5 - 5x^3 + 4x \) has exactly 3 nonzero coefficients:
          \( 1, -5, \) and \( 4 \).


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate correctly verifies the polynomial and the
          number of nonzero coefficients.

          The step-to-evaluate involves subtracting the second equation from the first

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to verify if all possible cases have indeed been considered and if
          the solutions provided are exhaustive.


          From the previous steps, we derived the following cases:

          1. \( x = y = z \)

          2. \( x = y \) and \( y + z - 1 = 2x \)

          3. \( y = z \) and \( z + x - 1 = 2y \)

          4. \( z = x \) and \( x + y - 1 = 2z \)


          Each case was analyzed, and the corresponding ordered triples \( T \) were
          found:

          - For \( x = y = z \), \( T = (0, 0, 0) \).

          - For \( x = y \) and \( y + z - 1 = 2x \), \( T = (0, -1, 1) \).

          - For \( y = z \) and \( z + x - 1 = 2y \), \( T = (1, 0, -1) \).

          - For \( z = x \) and \( x + y - 1 = 2z \), \( T = (-1, 1, 0) \).


          These cases cover all the scenarios where at least two of the variables
          \( x, y, z \) are equal, and the remaining variable satisfies the derived
          linear equation. There are no other combinations of equalities or linear
          relationships among \( x, y, z \) that were not considered. Therefore, the
          step-to-evaluate correctly concludes that these are the only possible ordered
          triples \( T \).


          The step does not claim to have considered all possible values of \( x,
          y, z \) but rather all possible cases of the relationships derived from
          the equations. This is a valid approach in solving such symmetric systems
          of equations.

          The step-to-evaluate is the first step in the reasoning process, where the
          author deduces that \( P(x, y, z) \) must be a homogeneous polynomial of
          degree 2 based on the given functional equation \( P(ux, uy, uz) = u^2 F(y-x,
          z-x) \).


          To verify this deduction, let''s consider the properties of homogeneous
          polynomials. A polynomial \( P(x, y, z) \) is homogeneous of degree \( n
          \) if for any scalar \( u \), \( P(ux, uy, uz) = u^n P(x, y, z) \). In this
          case, the right-hand side of the given equation is \( u^2 F(y-x, z-x) \),
          which is a polynomial in \( u \) of degree 2. Therefore, for the equality
          to hold for all \( u \), \( P(x, y, z) \) must indeed be a homogeneous polynomial
          of degree 2.


          This deduction is valid and follows directly from the definition of homogeneous

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step involves substituting specific values into the polynomial \( P(x,
          y, z) \) to find the coefficients \( a, b, \) and \( c \). The polynomial
          is given by:

          \[

          P(x, y, z) = a(y-x)^2 + b(z-x)^2 + c(y-x)(z-x).

          \]


          1. For \( P(1, 0, 0) = 4 \):

          \[

          P(1, 0, 0) = a(0-1)^2 + b(0-1)^2 + c(0-1)(0-1) = a + b + c = 4.

          \]


          2. For \( P(0, 1, 0) = 5 \):

          \[

          P(0, 1, 0) = a(1-0)^2 + b(0-0)^2 + c(1-0)(0-0) = a = 5.

          \]


          3. For \( P(0, 0, 1) = 6 \):

          \[

          P(0, 0, 1) = a(0-0)^2 + b(1-0)^2 + c(0-0)(1-0) = b = 6.

          \]


          From these substitutions, we get:

          \[

          a = 5, \quad b = 6, \quad a + b + c = 4.

          \]


          Substituting \( a \) and \( b \) into the third equation:

          5 + 6 + c = 4 \implies c = -7.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step starts by substituting \( B - A = 10 \) into the equation derived
          from the polynomial:

          \[

          5(B-A)^2 + 6(C-A)^2 - 7(B-A)(C-A) = 0.

          \]

          This substitution is valid because \( |B - A| = 10 \) implies \( B - A =
          10 \) or \( B - A = -10 \). The step assumes \( B - A = 10 \) without loss
          of generality, which is reasonable since the absolute value is given and
          the quadratic equation will yield the same magnitude for both \( 10 \) and
          \( -10 \).


          Next, the step simplifies the equation:

          \[

          5(10)^2 + 6(C-A)^2 - 7(10)(C-A) = 0,

          \]

          which results in:

          \[

          500 + 6(C-A)^2 - 70(C-A) = 0.

          \]

          This simplification is correct.


          Then, the step introduces \( t = C - A \) and transforms the equation into
          a standard quadratic form:

          \[

          6t^2 - 70t + 500 = 0.

          \]

          This transformation is also valid.


          The step proceeds to solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

          \[

          t = \frac{70 \pm \sqrt{70^2 - 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 500}}{2 \cdot 6} = \frac{70
          \pm \sqrt{4900 - 12000}}{12} = \frac{70 \pm \sqrt{-7100}}{12}.

          \]

          The discriminant calculation is correct, and the discriminant is indeed
          negative, indicating that \( t \) is complex.


          Finally, the step calculates the magnitude of \( t \):

          \[

          t = \frac{70 \pm 10i\sqrt{71}}{12} = \frac{35 \pm 5i\sqrt{71}}{6}.

          \]

          The magnitude of \( t \) is:

          \[

          |t| = \left| \frac{35 \pm 5i\sqrt{71}}{6} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{35^2 + (5\sqrt{71})^2}}{6}
          = \frac{\sqrt{1225 + 1775}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3000}}{6} = \frac{10\sqrt{30}}{6}
          = \frac{5\sqrt{30}}{3}.

          \]

          This calculation is correct and follows from the properties of complex numbers.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.
          It correctly handles the substitution, simplification, and solving of the
          quadratic equation, and accurately computes the magnitude of the complex

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          The step-to-evaluate is the first step where the integral is denoted by
          \(I\):

          \[

          I = \int_2^4 \frac{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}\,dx}{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}+\sqrt{\ln(x+3)}}.

          \]


          This step is simply defining the integral and giving it a name. It does
          not make any deductions or transformations. It is a straightforward and
          valid step in setting up the problem. There is no obvious invalid deduction
          here, as it merely restates the given integral in a more convenient form
          for further manipulation.


          The subsequent steps involve a substitution and symmetry argument, which
          are standard techniques in solving integrals. The substitution \(u = 6 -
          x\) is correctly applied, and the limits of integration are adjusted accordingly.
          The integrand is then simplified, and the symmetry in the integrand is used
          to combine the two resulting integrals. These steps are all logically sound
          and do not introduce any invalid deductions.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate is not misleading or invalid.

          \[

          The step in question is:

          \[

          I = \int_4^2 \frac{\sqrt{\ln(9-(6-u))}(-du)}{\sqrt{\ln(9-(6-u))}+\sqrt{\ln((6-u)+3)}}.

          \]


          1. **Substitution**: The substitution \(u = 6 - x\) is correctly applied.
          When \(x = 2\), \(u = 4\), and when \(x = 4\), \(u = 2\). This is correct.

          2. ** Limits of Integration**: The limits of integration are correctly reversed
          from \([2, 4]\) to \([4, 2]\).

          3. **Differential**: The differential \(dx\) is correctly transformed to
          \(-du\).


          The step correctly transforms the integral using the substitution \(u =
          6 - x\). The transformation of the integrand and the limits of integration
          are consistent with the substitution.


          There are no obvious invalid deductions in this step. The transformation
          is mathematically sound and follows the rules of integration and substitution.

          The step involves simplifying the arguments of the logarithms after performing
          the substitution \(u = 6 - x\). The original integral was:

          \[

          I = \int_2^4 \frac{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}\,dx}{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}+\sqrt{\ln(x+3)}}.

          \]


          After the substitution \(u = 6 - x\), the integral becomes:

          \[

          I = \int_4^2 \frac{\sqrt{\ln(9-(6-u))}(-du)}{\sqrt{\ln(9-(6-u))}+\sqrt{\ln((6-u)+3)}}.

          \]


          Simplifying the arguments inside the logarithms:

          - For the numerator: \(\ln(9-(6-u)) = \ln(3+u)\).

          - For the denominator: \(\ln((6-u)+3) = \ln(9-u)\).


          So, the integral simplifies to:

          \[

          I = \int_4^2 \frac{\sqrt{\ln(3+u)}(-du)}{\sqrt{\ln(3+u)}+\sqrt{\ln(9-u)}}.

          \]


          This step is mathematically correct. The substitution \(u = 6 - x\) is valid,
          and the simplification of the logarithmic arguments is straightforward and
          follows from basic algebraic manipulation. There is no invalid deduction
          or missing case in this step.

          This follows from the previous steps where a substitution \(u = 6 - x\)
          was made. The substitution changes the limits of integration from \(x =
          2\) to \(x = 4\) to \(u = 4\) to \(u = 2\), and the differential \(dx\)

          To determine if this step is valid, we need to check if the substitution
          and the reasoning leading to these two expressions are correct.


          1. **Substitution**: The substitution \(u = 6 - x\) was used, which changes
          the limits of integration and the integrand. This substitution is valid
          and correctly applied in the previous steps.


          2. **Reversing the limits of integration**: The limits of integration were
          reversed, and the negative sign from \(dx = -du\) was correctly handled.


          3. **Simplification**: The integrand was simplified correctly after the
          substitution.


          4. **Rewriting the integral**: The integral was rewritten in terms of \(u\),
          and then \(u\) was replaced by \(x\) to show that the form is the same as
          the original integrand.


          Given these points, the step-to-evaluate is a direct result of the valid
          substitution and simplification. There is no obvious invalid deduction in

          \]


          Combining like terms in the numerator:

          \[

          2 \sqrt{\ln(9-x) \cdot \ln(3+x)} + \ln(9-x) + \ln(3+x).

          The denominator is:

          \]


          Expanding the denominator:

          \[

          \sqrt{\ln(9-x)} \cdot \sqrt{\ln(3+x)} + \sqrt{\ln(9-x)} \cdot \sqrt{\ln(9-x)}

          The reasoning is that the sum of the two fractions is always 1 for all \(x\)

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to carefully review the reasoning leading up to it. The steps provided
          are as follows:


          1. The integral is defined and denoted by \(I\).

          2. A substitution \(u = 6 - x\) is performed, changing the limits of integration
          and the integrand.

          3. The integral is rewritten in terms of \(u\).

          4. The integral is rewritten back in terms of \(x\) to show symmetry.

          5. Two expressions for \(I\) are derived.

          6. These two expressions are added together.

          7. The integrand simplifies to 1.

          8. The integral of 1 over the interval \([2, 4]\) is evaluated.

          9. The value of \(I\) is determined to be 1.


          The step-to-evaluate is the final step, where the value of \(I\) is stated
          as \(\boxed{1}\).


          To check for an invalid deduction, I need to ensure that each step logically
          follows from the previous ones and that no assumptions or conclusions are
          made without proper justification. The steps provided are logically sound
          and follow a clear and valid reasoning process. The substitution and symmetry
          arguments are correctly applied, and the simplification of the integrand
          to 1 is valid.


          Therefore, the final step, which states that the value of \(I\) is 1, is
          a valid conclusion based on the preceding steps.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an

          The step in question is:

          \[

          N_n = \frac{100^{\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil} - 1}{99}

          \]


          This formula is derived from the sum of a geometric series. The series in
          question is:

          \[

          N_n = 1 + 100 + 100^2 + \cdots + 100^{\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil
          - 1}

          \]


          The sum of the first \(m\) terms of a geometric series with first term \(a\)
          and common ratio \(r\) is given by:

          \[

          S_m = \frac{a(r^m - 1)}{r - 1}

          \]


          In this case, \(a = 1\) and \(r = 100\), and the number of terms \(m\) is
          \(\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil\). Substituting these values into
          the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we get:

          \[

          N_n = \frac{100^{\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil} - 1}{99}

          \]


          This formula is correct and follows directly from the standard formula for
          the sum of a geometric series. There is no obvious invalid deduction in
          this step. The step correctly identifies the number of terms in the series

          The step involves checking the primality of specific numbers \(N_n\) for
          small values of \(n\):


          - For \(n = 1\), \(N_1 = 1\) is correctly identified as not a prime number.

          is correct and shows it is not a prime number.

          - For \(n = 7\), \(N_7 = 1010101\) is factored as \(101 \times 10001\),

          Each of these factorizations is valid and correctly demonstrates that the

          considered, but rather provides specific examples to support the generalization

          The step-to-evaluate claims that for \(n > 3\), \(N_n\) is not a prime number
          because it can be factored as \(101 \times \text{(some integer)}\). To verify
          this, we need to check if the pattern observed in the specific cases (for
          \(n = 5, 7, 9\)) holds for all \(n > 3\).


          From the previous steps, we see that:

          - For \(n = 5\), \(N_5 = 10101 = 101 \times 101\).

          - For \(n = 7\), \(N_7 = 1010101 = 101 \times 10001\).

          - For \(n = 9\), \(N_9 = 101010101 = 101 \times 1000101\).


          These specific cases suggest that \(N_n\) can indeed be factored as \(101
          \times \text{(some integer)}\) for \(n > 3\). However, to generalize this,
          we need to consider the mathematical form of \(N_n\).


          The general form of \(N_n\) is:

          \[

          N_n = \frac{100^{\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil} - 1}{99}

          \]


          For \(n > 3\), \(\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil \geq 3\). We need
          to check if \(101\) is a factor of \(N_n\) for all such \(n\).


          Given the pattern observed in the specific cases, it is reasonable to conclude
          that \(101\) is a factor of \(N_n\) for \(n > 3\). This is because the structure
          of \(N_n\) as a sum of powers of 100 suggests that it can be factored in
          a way that includes 101 as a factor.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.
          The pattern observed in the specific cases is consistent with the general

          #### Region 1: \(0 \leq y \leq \frac{b}{a}x\)

          In this region, \(b^2x^2 \geq a^2y^2\), so \(\max\{b^2x^2, a^2y^2\} = b^2x^2\).
          The integral over this region is:

          \[

          \int_0^a \int_0^{\frac{b}{a}x} e^{b^2x^2} \, dy \, dx

          \]

          First, integrate with respect to \(y\):

          \[

          \int_0^{\frac{b}{a}x} e^{b^2x^2} \, dy = e^{b^2x^2} \left[ y \right]_0^{\frac{b}{a}x}
          = e^{b^2x^2} \cdot \frac{b}{a}x = \frac{b}{a}x e^{b^2x^2}

          Now, integrate with respect to \(x\):

          \[

          \int_0^a \frac{b}{a}x e^{b^2x^2} \, dx

          The reasoning in the step is that in the region \(\frac{b}{a}x \leq y \leq
          b\), \(a^2y^2 \geq b^2x^2\), so \(\max\{b^2x^2, a^2y^2\} = a^2y^2\). This
          is correct because in this region, \(y\) is greater than or equal to \(\frac{b}{a}x\),
          and thus \(a^2y^2\) is greater than or equal to \(b^2x^2\).


          The integral is then set up as:

          The result is \(\frac{a}{b}y e^{a^2y^2}\), which is correct.


          3. **Integration with Respect to \(y\)**: The step then integrates \(\frac{a}{b}y
          e^{a^2y^2}\) with respect to \(y\) over the interval \([0, b]\). The substitution

          \, du\) is correctly evaluated to \(\frac{1}{2b} (e^{a^2b^2} - 1)\).

          invalid deduction. The step-to-evaluate is the final combination of the
          results from the two regions of integration. The previous steps have already
          split the region of integration into two parts and evaluated the integrals
          over each part. The step-to-evaluate sums these results to get the final
          answer.


          Let''s break it down:

          1. The integral over Region 1 is \(\frac{1}{2a} (e^{b^2a^2} - 1)\).

          2. The integral over Region 2 is \(\frac{1}{2b} (e^{a^2b^2} - 1)\).

          The step-to-evaluate claims that the left-hand side of the equation simplifies
          to zero using the fundamental theorem of calculus. Specifically, it states:

          \[

          \left[ x^n f(x) \right]_0^\infty = 0

          \]

          To verify this, we need to check the behavior of \(x^n f(x)\) at the boundaries
          \(x = 0\) and \(x \to \infty\).


          1. **At \(x = 0\)**: Since \(f(x)\) is defined on \([0, \infty)\) and is
          differentiable, \(f(0)\) is finite. Therefore, \(x^n f(x)\) at \(x = 0\)
          is \(0^n f(0) = 0 \cdot f(0) = 0\).


          2. **As \(x \to \infty\)**: We are given that \(|f(x)| \le e^{-\sqrt{x}}\).
          This implies that \(f(x)\) decays faster than any polynomial as \(x \to
          \infty\). Specifically, for any \(n\),

          \[

          x^n |f(x)| \le x^n e^{-\sqrt{x}}

          \]

          Since \(e^{-\sqrt{x}}\) decays exponentially, \(x^n e^{-\sqrt{x}} \to 0\)
          as \(x \to \infty\). Therefore, \(x^n f(x) \to 0\) as \(x \to \infty\).


          Given these two points, the expression \(\left[ x^n f(x) \right]_0^\infty\)
          indeed evaluates to \(0 - 0 = 0\). This step is valid and follows directly
          from the given conditions and the fundamental theorem of calculus.

          0 = n \mu_{n-1} - 3 \mu_n + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \mu_n

          \]


          It then simplifies the term \(6 \cdot \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \mu_n\):

          \[

          6 \cdot \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \mu_n = \frac{6}{2^{n+1}} \mu_n = \frac{6}{2 \cdot
          2^n} \mu_n = \frac{3}{2^n} \mu_n

          \]


          Next, it combines the terms involving \(\mu_n\):

          \[

          0 = n \mu_{n-1} - 3 \mu_n + \frac{3}{2^n} \mu_n

          0 = n \mu_{n-1} - 3 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^n} \right) \mu_n

          \]


          Finally, it solves for \(\mu_n\):

          \[

          n \mu_{n-1} = 3 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^n} \right) \mu_n

          small \(x\). This is a standard and valid approximation in calculus, particularly
          when \(x\) is close to 0. In this context, \(x = \frac{1}{2^k}\), and since
          \(2^k\) grows exponentially with \(k\), \(\frac{1}{2^k}\) becomes very small
          for large \(k\). Therefore, the approximation \(\ln(1 - \frac{1}{2^k}) \approx
          -\frac{1}{2^k}\) is indeed valid for each term in the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^n

          Thus,

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to carefully examine the equation provided and see if it holds true
          for all \( n \geq 3 \).


          The step-to-evaluate claims:

          \[ 2^n = (n+4)2^{n-1} - 4n2^{n-2} + (4n-8)2^{n-3}. \]


          Let''s simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

          \[ (n+4)2^{n-1} = n2^{n-1} + 4 \cdot 2^{n-1} = n2^{n-1} + 2^{n+1}, \]

          \[ -4n2^{n-2} = -4n \cdot 2^{n-2} = -n2^n, \]

          \[ (4n-8)2^{n-3} = 4n \cdot 2^{n-3} - 8 \cdot 2^{n-3} = n2^{n-1} - 2^{n-1}.
          \]


          Combining these terms:

          \[ n2^{n-1} + 2^{n+1} - n2^n + n2^{n-1} - 2^{n-1}. \]


          Grouping like terms:

          \[ (n2^{n-1} + n2^{n-1}) + 2^{n+1} - n2^n - 2^{n-1} = 2n2^{n-1} + 2^{n+1}
          - n2^n - 2^{n-1}. \]


          Simplifying further:

          \[ 2n2^{n-1} = n2^n, \]

          \[ 2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^n = 2^{n+1}, \]

          \[ -2^{n-1} = -2^{n-1}. \]


          So the equation becomes:

          \[ n2^n + 2^{n+1} - n2^n - 2^{n-1} = 2^{n+1} - 2^{n-1}. \]


          Now, let''s simplify \( 2^{n+1} - 2^{n-1} \):

          \[ 2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^n = 2^{n+1}, \]

          \[ 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}. \]


          Thus:

          \[ 2^{n+1} - 2^{n-1} = 2 \cdot 2^n - 2^{n-1} = 2^n \cdot 2 - 2^{n-1} = 2^n
          \cdot 2 - 2^{n-1} = 2^n \cdot (2 - \frac{1}{2}) = 2^n \cdot \frac{3}{2}
          = 2^n. \]


          This simplification shows that the equation \( 2^n = (n+4)2^{n-1} - 4n2^{n-2}
          + (4n-8)2^{n-3} \) is indeed valid for all \( n \geq 3 \).

          The step breaks down the expression:

          Each of these simplifications is correct based on standard properties of
          exponents. For instance:

          - \( (n+4)2^{n-1} \) is correctly expanded to \( n2^{n-1} + 4 \cdot 2^{n-1}
          \), which simplifies to \( n2^{n-1} + 2^{n+1} \).

          - \( -4n2^{n-2} \) is correctly simplified to \( -n2^n \).

          - \( (4n-8)2^{n-3} \) is correctly expanded to \( 4n \cdot 2^{n-3} - 8 \cdot
          2^{n-3} \), which simplifies to \( n2^{n-1} - 2^{n-1} \).


          There are no obvious logical errors or invalid deductions in these simplifications.

          \[ n! = (n+4)(n-1)! - 4n(n-2)! + (4n-8)(n-3)!. \]


          To determine if this is an obviously invalid deduction, I need to verify
          if the equation holds for all \( n \geq 3 \).


          Let''s expand and simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

          \[ (n+4)(n-1)! = n(n-1)! + 4(n-1)! = n! + 4(n-1)!, \]

          \[ -4n(n-2)! = -4n(n-2)!, \]

          \[ (4n-8)(n-3)! = 4n(n-3)! - 8(n-3)!. \]


          Combining these, we get:

          \[ n! + 4(n-1)! - 4n(n-2)! + 4n(n-3)! - 8(n-3)!. \]


          Now, let''s simplify further:

          \[ -4n(n-2)! = -4n(n-2)!, \]

          \[ 4n(n-3)! = 4n(n-3)!, \]

          \[ -8(n-3)! = -8(n-3)!. \]


          So the equation becomes:

          \[ n! + 4(n-1)(n-2)! - 4n(n-2)! + 4n(n-3)! - 8(n-3)!. \]


          We can factor out common terms:

          Since \( (n-2)! = (n-2)(n-3)! \), we have:

          the formula \( T_n = 2^n + n! \) matches the given initial conditions \(
          T_0 = 2 \), \( T_1 = 3 \), and \( T_2 = 6 \).


          2. **Recurrence Relation Verification**: Steps 5 through 11 break down the
          verification into two parts: the powers of 2 and the factorials. Each part
          is simplified and shown to satisfy the recurrence relation.

          relation are satisfied, and thus concludes that the formula \( T_n = 2^n

          The key point to consider is whether the verification process is logically
          sound and complete. The steps show detailed algebraic manipulations and
          substitutions, which appear to be correct. There is no obvious logical error
          or missing case in the verification process. The conclusion in step 12 follows
          directly from the successful verification of both parts of the recurrence
          relation.

          to check if the previous steps leading to this conclusion are logically

          relation and initial conditions.


          1. **Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions \( T_0 = 2 \), \( T_1

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step involves differentiating both sides of the given functional equation:


          \[

          (f(x))^2 = \int_0^x [(f(t))^2 + (f''(t))^2] \, dt + 1990

          \]


          On the left-hand side, the derivative is correctly computed as:


          \[

          \frac{d}{dx} (f(x))^2 = 2f(x)f''(x)

          \]


          On the right-hand side, the integral is from 0 to \( x \). According to
          the Leibniz rule for differentiation under the integral sign, the derivative
          of the integral with respect to the upper limit \( x \) is the integrand
          evaluated at \( x \):


          \[

          \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_0^x [(f(t))^2 + (f''(t))^2] \, dt \right) = (f(x))^2
          + (f''(x))^2

          \]


          Adding the constant term 1990, which is independent of \( x \), its derivative
          is zero:


          \[

          \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_0^x [(f(t))^2 + (f''(t))^2] \, dt + 1990 \right)
          = (f(x))^2 + (f''(x))^2

          \]


          Thus, the step correctly differentiates both sides of the equation and sets
          them equal to each other:


          \[

          2f(x)f''(x) = (f(x))^2 + (f''(x))^2

          \]


          This step is valid and follows standard calculus rules. There is no obvious
          invalid deduction here.

          \]


          ### Step 1: Differentiate both sides with respect to \( x \)


          First, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \( x
          \). The left-hand side is straightforward:


          \[

          \frac{d}{dx} (f(x))^2 = 2f(x)f''(x)

          \]


          For the right-hand side, we use the Leibniz rule for differentiation under

          \[

          + (f''(x))^2

          \]


          Thus, the right-hand side becomes:


          \[

          \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_0^x [(f(t))^2 + (f''(t))^2] \, dt + 1990 \right)

          This step is derived by differentiating both sides of the original equation:


          \[

          (f(x))^2 = \int_0^x [(f(t))^2 + (f''(t))^2] \, dt + 1990

          \]


          The left-hand side is differentiated as:


          \[

          \frac{d}{dx} (f(x))^2 = 2f(x)f''(x)

          \]


          The right-hand side is differentiated using the Leibniz rule for differentiation

          \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_0^x [(f(t))^2 + (f''(t))^2] \, dt + 1990 \right)
          = (f(x))^2 + (f''(x))^2

          Subtracting \(2f(x)f''(x)\) from both sides of the equation:

          of these sets and their subsets.


          ### Step 1: Understanding Selfish Sets

          A set \(S\) is called a *selfish set* if its cardinality (number of elements)
          is an element of the set. For example, if \(S = \{1, 2, 3\}\), then \(|S|
          = 3\) and since \(3 \in S\), \(S\) is a selfish set.'

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          ### Step 2: Minimal Selfish Sets

          A *minimal selfish set* is a selfish set none of whose proper subsets is
          selfish. This means that if \(S\) is a minimal selfish set, then for any
          proper subset \(T \subset S\), \(T\) is not a selfish set.


          This step is defining what a minimal selfish set is. It states that a minimal
          selfish set \(S\) is a selfish set where no proper subset \(T\) of \(S\)
          is also a selfish set. This definition is consistent with the standard definition
          of minimality in set theory, where a set is minimal with respect to a property
          if no smaller set (proper subset) has that property.


          The step does not make any deductions or claims beyond this definition.
          It simply restates the definition of a minimal selfish set in a clear and
          precise manner. There are no logical errors or invalid deductions in this
          step.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          ### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of Minimal Selfish Sets

          The step states:

          - Consider a minimal selfish set \(S\) with \(|S| = k\). Since \(S\) is
          selfish, \(k \in S\).

          - We need to ensure that no proper subset of \(S\) is selfish.

          - This implies that for any proper subset \(T \subset S\) with \(|T| = m
          < k\), \(m \notin T\).


          ### Analysis:

          1. **Selfish Set Property**: The step correctly states that since \(S\)
          is a selfish set, \(k \in S\). This is a valid deduction based on the definition
          of a selfish set.

          2. **Minimal Selfish Set Property**: The step correctly states that no proper
          subset of \(S\) should be selfish. This is a valid requirement for a minimal
          selfish set.

          3. **Implication for Proper Subsets**: The step deduces that for any proper
          subset \(T \subset S\) with \(|T| = m < k\), \(m \notin T\). This is a logical
          consequence of the minimality condition. If \(m \in T\), then \(T\) would
          be a selfish set, contradicting the minimality of \(S\).


          The step does not make any obviously invalid deductions. The reasoning is
          consistent with the definitions and properties of minimal selfish sets.

          ### Step 4: Constructing Minimal Selfish Sets

          The step states:

          - To construct a minimal selfish set \(S\) with \(|S| = k\), we need to
          include \(k\) in \(S\) and ensure that no other element \(m < k\) is in

          - This is because if \(m < k\) were in \(S\), then the subset \(\{m\}\)
          would be a selfish set, contradicting the minimality of \(S\).


          ### Analysis:

          1. **Inclusion of \(k\)**: The step correctly states that \(k\) must be
          in \(S\) because \(S\) is a selfish set.

          2. **Exclusion of \(m < k\)**: The step correctly states that no element
          \(m < k\) should be in \(S\) to ensure that no proper subset of \(S\) is
          selfish. If \(m < k\) were in \(S\), then \(\{m\}\) would be a selfish set,
          which would contradict the minimality of \(S\).


          The reasoning in this step is logically sound and follows directly from

          I need to carefully examine the reasoning provided in Step 5.


          1. **Context and Assumptions**: The step assumes that \(S\) is a minimal
          selfish set with \(|S| = k\). This means \(k \in S\) and no proper subset
          of \(S\) is selfish.

          2. **Element Selection**: The step states that the remaining \(k-1\) elements
          must be chosen from \(\{k+1, k+2, \ldots, n\}\). This is because if any
          element \(m < k\) were in \(S\), then the subset \(\{m\}\) would be a selfish
          set, contradicting the minimality of \(S\).

          3. **Counting**: The step then counts the number of ways to choose \(k-1\)
          elements from \(\{k+1, k+2, \ldots, n\}\) using the binomial coefficient
          \(\binom{n-k}{k-1}\).


          The reasoning in Step 5 is logically sound and follows from the previous
          steps. The step correctly identifies the constraints on the elements of
          \(S\) and uses combinatorial methods to count the valid sets. There is no
          obvious invalid deduction in this step.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          ### Step 6: Summing Over All Possible \(k\)

          To find the total number of minimal selfish sets, we sum the number of minimal
          selfish sets for each possible value of \(k\) from 1 to \(n\):

          \[

          \sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n-k}{k-1}

          \]


          From the previous steps, we know:

          - A minimal selfish set \(S\) with \(|S| = k\) must contain \(k\) and \(k-1\)
          other elements chosen from \(\{k+1, k+2, \ldots, n\}\).

          - The number of ways to choose \(k-1\) elements from \(\{k+1, k+2, \ldots,
          n\}\) is \(\binom{n-k}{k-1}\).


          The step-to-evaluate correctly states that to find the total number of minimal
          selfish sets, we need to sum the number of minimal selfish sets for each
          possible value of \(k\) from 1 to \(n\). This is a valid approach because
          it accounts for all possible sizes of minimal selfish sets.


          The formula \(\sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n-k}{k-1}\) is derived from the correct
          reasoning in the previous steps. Each term \(\binom{n-k}{k-1}\) represents
          the number of ways to form a minimal selfish set of size \(k\), and summing
          these terms over all possible values of \(k\) gives the total number of

          The step involves reindexing a sum and then using a known combinatorial
          identity. Specifically, the sum is:

          \[

          \sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n-k}{k-1}

          \]

          The reindexing is done by letting \( j = k-1 \). This implies \( k = j+1
          \), and the limits of the sum change accordingly:

          - When \( k = 1 \), \( j = 0 \)

          - When \( k = n \), \( j = n-1 \)


          Thus, the sum becomes:

          \[

          \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-(j+1)}{j} = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1-j}{j}

          \]


          This reindexing is mathematically correct and does not introduce any invalid
          steps. The next part of the step claims that this sum is a well-known identity
          in combinatorics, which equals the \(n\)-th Fibonacci number \(F_n\). This
          is indeed a well-known identity in combinatorics, and it is correct.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          The step involves calculating the distance \(A''A''''\) where \(A'' = (a,
          -b)\) and \(A'''' = (b, a)\). The formula used for the distance between
          two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:

          \[

          \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}

          \]


          Substituting \(A'' = (a, -b)\) and \(A'''' = (b, a)\) into the formula,
          we get:

          \[

          A''A'''' = \sqrt{(b - a)^2 + (a - (-b))^2} = \sqrt{(b - a)^2 + (a + b)^2}

          \]


          Expanding the squares:

          \[

          (b - a)^2 = b^2 - 2ab + a^2

          \]

          \[

          (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

          \]


          Adding these together:

          \[

          A''A'''' = \sqrt{b^2 - 2ab + a^2 + a^2 + 2ab + b^2} = \sqrt{2a^2 + 2b^2}
          = \sqrt{2(a^2 + b^2)}

          \]


          This calculation is correct and follows directly from the distance formula.
          There are no obvious logical errors or invalid deductions in this step.
          The simplification is straightforward and valid.

          To verify this, we need to check if the terms \(\frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m
          \cdot 3^{m-n})}\) and \(\frac{n^2 m}{3^n (m + n \cdot 3^{n-m})}\) are indeed
          equal when the indices \(m\) and \(n\) are swapped.


          Consider the term \(\frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot 3^{m-n})}\):

          - When \(m\) and \(n\) are swapped, it becomes \(\frac{n^2 m}{3^n (m + n
          \cdot 3^{n-m})}\).


          Both expressions are structurally identical, with the roles of \(m\) and
          \(n\) reversed. This confirms the symmetry.


          The step then combines these two sums:

          \[

          2 \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot 3^{m-n})}

          This is a valid manipulation because the two sums are equal due to symmetry,
          and adding them together and dividing by 2 is a standard technique to exploit
          such symmetry.

          The combination and factorization appear to be algebraically correct. The

          rewrites the sum in a different but equivalent form. There is no obvious

          However, it is important to verify that the factorization and combination

          The key part of this step is the simplification:

          \[

          This simplification is valid if and only if:

          \[

          n + m \cdot 3^{m-n} = m + n

          \]


          However, this is not generally true. For example, if \(m = 1\) and \(n =
          1\):

          \[

          1 + 1 \cdot 3^{1-1} = 1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 1 + 1 = 2

          \]

          \[

          1 + 1 = 2

          \]

          This is true, but let''s consider another example, \(m = 2\) and \(n = 1\):

          \[

          1 + 2 \cdot 3^{2-1} = 1 + 2 \cdot 3^1 = 1 + 6 = 7

          \]

          \[

          2 + 1 = 3

          \]

          Clearly, \(7 \neq 3\). Therefore, the simplification is not valid in general.


          Thus, the step-to-evaluate makes an invalid deduction.

          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot 3^{m-n})} = \frac{9}{16}\).
          This equation comes from the previous steps, where the series was simplified

          In Step 7, the right-hand side was evaluated as:

          \[

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step-to-evaluate involves a substitution \( x = \tan(\theta) \) in the
          integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(x+1)}{x^2+1} \, dx\). The substitution is
          valid because:

          1. The function \( x = \tan(\theta) \) is a valid substitution for \( x
          \) in the interval \([0, 1]\), which corresponds to \(\theta \in [0, \frac{\pi}{4}]\).

          2. The differential \( dx = \sec^2(\theta) \, d\theta \) is correctly derived.

          3. The limits of integration are correctly transformed from \( x = 0 \)
          to \( \theta = 0 \) and from \( x = 1 \) to \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \).

          4. The integrand \(\frac{\ln(x+1)}{x^2+1}\) is correctly transformed to
          \(\frac{\ln(\tan(\theta) + 1)}{\sec^2(\theta)} \sec^2(\theta) = \ln(\tan(\theta)
          + 1)\).


          The step-to-evaluate does not make any obviously invalid deductions. The
          substitution and the transformation of the integral are mathematically sound.

          Let''s use the substitution \( x = \tan(\theta) \). Then, \( dx = \sec^2(\theta)

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step involves a substitution \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4} - u\) in the integral
          \(\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \ln(\tan(\theta) + 1) \, d\theta\). The limits
          of integration are correctly transformed:

          - When \(\theta = 0\), \(u = \frac{\pi}{4}\).

          - When \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\), \(u = 0\).


          The integral then becomes:

          \[

          \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \ln(\tan(\theta) + 1) \, d\theta = \int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^0
          \ln(\tan(\frac{\pi}{4} - u) + 1) (-du)

          \]


          The negative sign from the differential \(d\theta\) is correctly handled
          by reversing the limits of integration, which is a standard technique in
          calculus.


          Next, the expression \(\tan(\frac{\pi}{4} - u)\) is simplified using the
          tangent subtraction formula:

          \[

          \tan(\frac{\pi}{4} - u) = \frac{1 - \tan(u)}{1 + \tan(u)}

          \]


          Substituting this into the logarithm:

          \[

          \ln\left(\frac{1 - \tan(u)}{1 + \tan(u)} + 1\right) = \ln\left(\frac{1 -
          \tan(u) + 1 + \tan(u)}{1 + \tan(u)}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{2}{1 + \tan(u)}\right)

          \]


          This simplification is correct and follows from basic algebraic manipulation.


          Finally, the integral is rewritten as:

          \[

          \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \ln\left(\frac{2}{1 + \tan(u)}\right) \, du = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}
          \left(\ln(2) - \ln(1 + \tan(u))\right) \, du

          This step is also valid, as it uses the property of logarithms \(\ln\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)
          = \ln(a) - \ln(b)\).


          Given these observations, the step-to-evaluate does not contain any obviously

          \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4} - u\).

          1. **Step 1**: The substitution \( x = \tan(\theta) \) is valid and correctly
          transforms the integral.

          2. **Step 2**: The symmetry property is correctly applied, and the integral

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          The step claims that for \(k = 1\), \(\pi(1)\) is a local maximum if \(\pi(1)
          > \pi(2)\). This is correct according to the definition provided in the
          problem statement. The step then states that the probability of \(\pi(1)
          > \pi(2)\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\) because \(\pi(1)\) and \(\pi(2)\) are equally
          likely to be in any order.


          This reasoning is valid. In a random permutation of two elements, there
          are exactly two possible orders: \(\pi(1) < \pi(2)\) and \(\pi(1) > \pi(2)\).
          Each of these orders is equally likely, so the probability of \(\pi(1) >
          \pi(2)\) is indeed \(\frac{1}{2}\).


          There are no obvious logical errors or invalid deductions in this step.
          It correctly applies the definition of a local maximum and basic probability
          principles.

          in any order, and only one out of the six possible orderings satisfies \(\pi(k-1)
          < \pi(k) > \pi(k+1)\).


          To verify this, let''s consider the six possible orderings of \(\pi(k-1)\),
          \(\pi(k)\), and \(\pi(k+1)\):

          1. \(\pi(k-1) < \pi(k) < \pi(k+1)\)

          2. \(\pi(k-1) < \pi(k+1) < \pi(k)\)

          6. \(\pi(k+1) < \pi(k) < \pi(k-1)\)

          \(\pi(k-1) < \pi(k) > \pi(k+1)\). Therefore, the probability is indeed \(\frac{1}{6}\)

          which states that the average number of local maxima of a permutation of
          \(S\) is \(\frac{n+1}{3}\).


          To verify this, I will review the reasoning provided in the previous steps:


          1. **Step 1**: Defines what a local maximum is in a permutation.

          2. **Step 2**: Calculates the probability that \(k = 1\) is a local maximum,

          3. **Step 3**: Calculates the probability that \(1 < k < n\) is a local
          maximum, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

          4. **Step 4**: Calculates the probability that \(k = n\) is a local maximum,
          which is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

          5. **Step 5**: Uses linearity of expectation to sum the expected values
          of the indicator variables \(X_k\) for each position \(k\).


          The calculation in Step 5 is:

          \[

          \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{k=1}^n X_k\right] = \mathbb{E}[X_1] + \sum_{k=2}^{n-1}
          \mathbb{E}[X_k] + \mathbb{E}[X_n]

          \]

          \[

          = \frac{1}{2} + (n-2) \cdot \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}

          \]

          \[

          = 1 + \frac{n-2}{3}

          \]

          \[

          = \frac{3}{3} + \frac{n-2}{3}

          \]

          \[

          = \frac{n+1}{3}

          \]


          This calculation appears to be correct and follows logically from the probabilities
          derived in the earlier steps. There is no obvious invalid deduction in the
          final step, as it correctly sums the expected values and simplifies the

          We solve the differential equation:

          \[ a''(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt[k]{a(t)}}. \]

          Let \(u = a(t)\). Then \(u'' = a''(t)\), and the equation becomes:

          \[ u'' = \frac{1}{u^{1/k}}. \]

          This is a separable differential equation. We separate the variables:

          \[ u^{1/k} \, du = dt. \]

          Integrate both sides:

          The right-hand side is:

          Equating the two integrals, we get:

          \[ \frac{k}{k+1} u^{(k+1)/k} = t + C. \]

          Solving for \(u\), we have:

          Let \(C = 0\) for simplicity (since we are interested in the asymptotic

          1. **Step 1**: The sequence \(a_n\) is defined and shown to be increasing.

          2. **Step 2**: The growth of \(a_n\) is approximated using a continuous

          is derived from the continuous approximation. This is a reasonable step.

          5. **Step 5**: The limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n^{k+1}}{n^k}\) is

          \[ b_n = b_{n-1} a_n - 2 \]

          If \( b_n \) is bounded, then \( b_{n-1} a_n \) must also be bounded. Since

          The reasoning in this step is based on the boundedness of \( b_n \) and

          1. \( b_n \) is bounded.

          3. Therefore, \( b_{n-1} a_n \) must be bounded.

          4. This implies \( a_n \) must grow sufficiently fast to keep \( b_n \)

          The step does not make an obviously invalid deduction. It correctly follows

          However, the step does not specify exactly what "sufficiently fast" means,

          \[ S = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n} = \frac{1}{1} + \sum_{n=2}^\infty

          1. **Step 1**: The problem setup and the recurrence relation are clearly
          stated.

          2. **Step 2**: The recurrence relation is rewritten to express \( b_{n-1}
          \) in terms of \( b_n \), which is a valid algebraic manipulation.

          3. **Step 3**: The boundedness of \( (b_n) \) is correctly stated.

          4. **Step 4**: The behavior of \( a_n \) is discussed, and it is correctly
          noted that \( a_n \) must grow sufficiently fast to keep \( b_n \) bounded.

          5. **Step 5**: The series \( S \) is introduced, and the goal is to evaluate
          it.

          6. **Step 6**: The first few terms of \( b_n \) and \( a_n \) are computed,
          and a pattern is observed. The assumption \( a_n = 3 \) for \( n \geq 2
          \) is made based on the boundedness of \( b_n \). This step is reasonable
          given the boundedness condition.

          7. **Step 7**: The series \( S \) is evaluated using the pattern \( a_n
          = 3 \) for \( n \geq 2 \). The geometric series is correctly identified
          and summed.

          8. **Step 8**: The final answer \( S = \frac{3}{2} \) is derived from the
          sum of the series.


          Each step logically follows from the previous one, and the final answer
          is derived correctly from the series evaluation. There are no obvious invalid
          deductions in the reasoning.

          \( f(x) = (1-x^2)^k \) for some constant \( k \). We need to check if this
          form satisfies the functional equation and the limit condition."


          1. **Assumption Validity**: The assumption \( f(x) = (1-x^2)^k \) is a reasonable
          guess based on the form of the functional equation and the limit condition.
          It is a common technique in solving functional equations to assume a specific
          form and then verify if it works.


          2. **Checking the Functional Equation**: The next step (Step 6) involves
          substituting \( f(x) = (1-x^2)^k \) into the functional equation to see
          if it holds. This is a standard method to validate the assumption.


          3. **Checking the Limit Condition**: The subsequent step (Step 8) checks
          if the assumed form satisfies the limit condition. This is also a necessary
          part of verifying the assumption.


          4. **Logical Flow**: The assumption is followed by a verification process,
          which is logically sound. There is no immediate indication that assuming
          \( f(x) = (1-x^2)^k \) is invalid or that it leads to an incorrect conclusion
          without further verification.


          5. **Potential Issues**: The only potential issue could be if the assumption
          \( f(x) = (1-x^2)^k \) is too restrictive and misses other possible forms
          of \( f(x) \). However, the problem does not suggest that there are multiple
          forms to consider, and the assumption is a natural starting point given
          the conditions.


          Given these considerations, the step does not make an obviously invalid
          deduction. It is a valid assumption that needs to be verified, which is
          done in the following steps.

          The substitution is performed correctly:

          \[ f \left( \frac{x^2}{2-x^2} \right) = \left( 1 - \left( \frac{x^2}{2-x^2}
          \right)^2 \right)^k = \left( \frac{(2-x^2)^2 - x^4}{(2-x^2)^2} \right)^k
          = \left( \frac{4 - 4x^2 + x^4 - x^4}{(2-x^2)^2} \right)^k = \left( \frac{4
          - 4x^2}{(2-x^2)^2} \right)^k = \left( \frac{4(1-x^2)}{(2-x^2)^2} \right)^k
          \]


          Then, the expression is substituted back into the functional equation:

          \[ (1-x^2)^k = \frac{2-x^2}{2} \left( \frac{4(1-x^2)}{(2-x^2)^2} \right)^k

          This simplifies to:

          \]


          The algebraic manipulation is correct, and the step does not make any invalid
          deductions. The repeated lines in the step-to-evaluate are redundant but
          do not affect the validity of the reasoning. Therefore, the step is logically

          The step-to-evaluate is a repetition of the same equation multiple times.
          This does not add any new information or reasoning to the problem. The equation
          itself is correct, but the repeated listing of it does not contribute to
          the simplification or solving for \( k \). The actual simplification and
          solving for \( k \) should involve algebraic manipulation to isolate \(
          k \) and verify that the form \( f(x) = (1-x^2)^k \) is consistent with
          the functional equation. However, the step does not show any such manipulation,
          which is necessary to proceed to the next step where \( k \) is determined.
          Therefore, the step is misleading because it suggests that the equation
          has been simplified and solved, when in fact, it has not.

          The step-to-evaluate involves verifying the limit condition for the function
          \( f(x) = (1-x^2)^k \). The step simplifies the limit expression and concludes
          that for the limit to be finite, \( k - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \), which implies
          \( k = \frac{1}{2} \).


          To determine if this step is valid, we need to check if the reasoning is
          sound and if all necessary conditions are considered. The step involves
          the following:


          1. Expressing the limit in terms of \( (1-x)^{k-1/2} (1+x)^k \).

          2. Concluding that for the limit to be finite, the exponent of \( (1-x)
          \) must be zero, i.e., \( k - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \).


          This reasoning is correct because:

          - As \( x \to 1^- \), \( 1-x \) approaches 0, and the term \( (1-x)^{k-1/2}
          \) will dominate the behavior of the limit.

          - For the limit to be finite, the exponent \( k - \frac{1}{2} \) must be
          zero, ensuring that \( (1-x)^{k-1/2} \) does not approach infinity or zero.


          Therefore, the step is logically sound and does not make an obviously invalid
          deduction.

          I need to carefully evaluate whether the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously
          invalid deduction. The step-to-evaluate is the final conclusion of the function
          \( f(x) \) being \( \sqrt{1-x^2} \). To determine if this is valid, I should
          review the previous steps to ensure that the reasoning leading to this conclusion
          is sound.


          - **Step 1** introduces the functional equation.

          - **Step 2** checks the consistency of the functional equation at \( x =
          0 \), which is correct.

          - **Step 3** states the limit condition, which is given and must be satisfied.

          - **Step 4** transforms the functional equation by substituting \( y = \frac{x^2}{2-x^2}
          \), which is a valid algebraic manipulation.

          - **Step 5** assumes a form for \( f(x) \) as \( (1-x^2)^k \), which is
          a reasonable assumption to test.

          - **Step 6** substitutes \( f(x) = (1-x^2)^k \) into the functional equation
          and simplifies it, which is done correctly.

          - **Step 7** simplifies the equation further, and the steps are consistent.

          - **Step 8** verifies the limit condition and correctly concludes that \(
          k = \frac{1}{2} \) to satisfy the limit condition.


          Given that all the previous steps are logically consistent and lead to the
          conclusion that \( k = \frac{1}{2} \), the final step of concluding \( f(x)

          ### Step 1: Understanding the Set \( C \)

          The set \( C \) consists of functions \( f(x) \) of the form:

          \[

          f(x) = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \cos(2 \pi n x)

          Since \( \cos(0) = 1 \), the substitution is correct. The step simply evaluates
          the function at \( x = 0 \) and uses the fact that \( \cos(0) = 1 \) to
          simplify the expression. This is a straightforward and valid algebraic manipulation.
          There is no obvious invalid deduction or logical error in this step. It

          This statement is a valid deduction. The non-negativity condition is a fundamental

          1. \(q + 2r = 1 - p\)

          2. \(q + 4r = 2 - p\)


          By subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

          \[

          2r = 1 \implies r = \frac{1}{2}

          Substituting \(r = \frac{1}{2}\) back into the first equation:

          that eventually shows the assumption was invalid.


          However, the specific deduction within Step 5 itself is not invalid; it
          correctly follows from the equations derived under the assumption that \(X\)
          can only take values \(0, 1, 2\). The invalidity lies in the assumption,
          not in the algebraic manipulation.

          The step-to-evaluate is the first step in the reasoning process, where the
          constraints of the problem are clearly stated. The constraints are:

          1. \( f \) is defined on the interval \([1, 3]\).

          2. \( -1 \leq f(x) \leq 1 \) for all \( x \in [1, 3] \).

          3. \(\int_{1}^{3} f(x) \, dx = 0\).


          These constraints are directly derived from the problem statement and are
          essential for understanding the problem. The step does not make any deductions
          or conclusions beyond stating these constraints. Therefore, it does not
          make an obviously invalid deduction.

          2. \( -1 \leq f(x) \leq 1 \) for all \( x \in [1, 3] \).

          We need to maximize \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{f(x)}{x} \, dx\). To do this, we

          intent to analyze the integral based on the properties of \( f \).


          Given the context and the constraints provided in Step 1, this step is logically
          sound and does not introduce any invalid deductions. The step is setting
          up the framework for the subsequent analysis, which is a common and valid

          Since \(\int_{1}^{3} f(x) \, dx = 0\), the function \( f \) must have both
          positive and negative values over the interval \([1, 3]\) to balance out
          to zero. We can think of \( f \) as a function that is positive in some
          parts and negative in others.


          This step is logically sound. The integral of \( f(x) \) over \([1, 3]\)
          being zero implies that the areas under the curve where \( f(x) \) is positive
          and negative must cancel each other out. Therefore, \( f(x) \) must indeed
          have both positive and negative values over the interval to satisfy this
          condition. There is no obvious invalid deduction here.


          The step correctly uses the given constraint to infer the nature of the

          The step-to-evaluate suggests a strategy to maximize the integral \(\int_{1}^{3}
          \frac{f(x)}{x} \, dx\) by making \( f(x) \) positive where \( \frac{1}{x}
          \) is large (i.e., near \( x = 1 \)) and negative where \( \frac{1}{x} \)
          is small (i.e., near \( x = 3 \)). This strategy is based on the observation
          that \(\frac{1}{x}\) is a decreasing function on the interval \([1, 3]\).


          To determine if this step is valid, we need to consider whether this strategy
          aligns with the given constraints and whether it logically follows from
          the previous steps.


          1. **Constraints**: The function \( f \) must satisfy \(-1 \leq f(x) \leq
          1\) and \(\int_{1}^{3} f(x) \, dx = 0\). The strategy does not violate these
          constraints because it suggests making \( f(x) \) positive and negative
          in such a way that the integral over the interval is zero.


          2. **Logical Consistency**: The strategy is consistent with the goal of
          maximizing the integral \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{f(x)}{x} \, dx\). By making
          \( f(x) \) positive where \(\frac{1}{x}\) is large and negative where \(\frac{1}{x}\)
          is small, we are effectively maximizing the contribution of the positive
          parts and minimizing the contribution of the negative parts.


          3. **Feasibility**: The strategy is feasible because it is possible to construct
          a function \( f(x) \) that satisfies the constraints and follows this strategy.
          For example, the candidate function \( f(x) \) defined in Step 6 is a valid
          function that satisfies the constraints and follows the strategy.


          Given these considerations, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously
          invalid deduction. It is a reasonable and logical strategy to maximize the
          integral given the constraints.

          The step-to-evaluate is the initial definition of squarish numbers. It states
          that a positive integer \( n \) is squarish if:

          1. \( n \) is a perfect square.

          2. The distance from \( n \) to the nearest perfect square is a perfect
          square.


          This definition is clear and aligns with the problem statement. It does
          not make any invalid deductions or assumptions. The definition is straightforward

          that \( k^2 \leq N \). This means \( k \approx \sqrt{N} \), and thus the
          number of perfect squares is indeed approximately \( \sqrt{N} \).

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          ### Step 3: Counting Numbers with Perfect Square Distance

          For a number \( n \) to be squarish due to the second condition, the distance
          from \( n \) to the nearest perfect square must be a perfect square. Let''s
          denote the nearest perfect square to \( n \) as \( k^2 \). The distance
          \( d \) from \( n \) to \( k^2 \) can be \( 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots \).


          This step is stating that for a number \( n \) to be squarish due to the
          second condition, the distance \( d \) from \( n \) to the nearest perfect
          square \( k^2 \) must itself be a perfect square. The list of possible distances
          \( 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots \) is correct because these are indeed the perfect
          squares.


          However, the step does not explicitly state that \( d \) can be both positive
          and negative. For instance, if \( n \) is closer to \( (k+1)^2 \) than to
          \( k^2 \), the distance \( d \) could be \( (k+1)^2 - n \), which is also
          a perfect square. This is important because it affects the count of squarish
          numbers in each interval.


          Despite this, the step is not making an obviously invalid deduction. It
          correctly identifies the condition and lists the possible distances. The
          omission of considering both positive and negative distances is a detail
          that might be addressed in later steps, but it does not invalidate the current
          step.


          Therefore, the step is logically sound and does not contain an obviously
          invalid deduction.

          ### Step 4: Analyzing the Intervals

          Consider the interval between two consecutive perfect squares \( k^2 \)
          and \( (k+1)^2 \). The length of this interval is:

          \[

          (k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1

          \]

          Within this interval, the numbers that are squarish due to the second condition
          are those whose distance to \( k^2 \) or \( (k+1)^2 \) is a perfect square.
          The possible distances are \( 0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots \) up to the largest perfect
          square less than or equal to \( k \).


          ### Analysis:

          1. **Interval Length Calculation**: The calculation of the interval length
          \( (k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1 \) is correct.

          2. **Squarish Numbers in the Interval**: The step correctly identifies that
          the numbers squarish due to the second condition are those whose distance
          to \( k^2 \) or \( (k+1)^2 \) is a perfect square.

          3. **Possible Distances**: The possible distances are indeed \( 0, 1, 4,
          9, \ldots \) up to the largest perfect square less than or equal to \( k
          \).


          The step does not make any obviously invalid deductions. It correctly identifies
          the relevant distances and the structure of the interval. The reasoning
          is sound and follows logically from the definitions and previous steps.

          ### Step 5: Counting Squarish Numbers in Each Interval

          The step claims:

          - There is 1 perfect square in the interval \( [k^2, (k+1)^2 - 1] \), which
          is \( k^2 \).

          - For each perfect square distance \( 1, 4, 9, \ldots \) up to the largest
          perfect square less than or equal to \( k \), there are 2 squarish numbers
          (one on each side of \( k^2 \)).


          The number of such perfect squares is approximately \( \sqrt{k} \). Therefore,
          the total number of squarish numbers in the interval is:

          \[

          1 + 2 \times \sqrt{k}

          \]


          ### Analysis:

          1. **Perfect Square \( k^2 \)**: This is correct. There is exactly one perfect
          square in the interval \( [k^2, (k+1)^2 - 1] \), which is \( k^2 \).


          2. **Perfect Square Distances**: The distances from \( k^2 \) to the nearest
          squarish numbers are \( 1, 4, 9, \ldots \) up to the largest perfect square
          less than or equal to \( k \). This is also correct.


          3. **Counting Squarish Numbers**: For each perfect square distance \( d
          \), there are 2 squarish numbers (one on each side of \( k^2 \)). This is
          correct because if \( d \) is a perfect square, then \( k^2 + d \) and \(
          k^2 - d \) are squarish.


          4. **Approximation of the Number of Perfect Squares**: The number of such
          perfect squares is approximately \( \sqrt{k} \). This is a reasonable approximation
          because the largest perfect square less than or equal to \( k \) is \( \lfloor
          \sqrt{k} \rfloor \), and for large \( k \), \( \lfloor \sqrt{k} \rfloor
          \approx \sqrt{k} \).


          5. **Total Number of Squarish Numbers**: The total number of squarish numbers
          in the interval is:

          \[

          1 + 2 \times \sqrt{k}

          \]

          This is a correct deduction based on the previous points.

          \]


          ### Context from Previous Steps

          - **Step 5** provides the number of squarish numbers in each interval \([k^2,
          (k+1)^2 - 1]\) as \(1 + 2 \sqrt{k}\).

          - **Step 4** explains that the length of each interval is \(2k + 1\).

          - **Step 3** and **Step 2** establish the basic definitions and the number
          of perfect squares up to \(N\).


          ### Analysis

          - The step-to-evaluate sums the number of squarish numbers over all intervals
          up to \(N\).

          - The expression \(1 + 2 \sqrt{k}\) is derived from the number of squarish
          numbers in each interval, which is consistent with the reasoning in Step
          5.

          - The summation \(\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor \sqrt{N} \rfloor}\) is appropriate

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step claims that the dominant term in the expression \( S(N) \approx
          \sqrt{N} + \frac{4}{3} N^{3/4} \) is \( \frac{4}{3} N^{3/4} \). This is
          correct because as \( N \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{4}{3} N^{3/4} \)
          grows much faster than \( \sqrt{N} \).


          Next, the step sets \( \alpha = \frac{3}{4} \) and \( \beta = \frac{4}{3}
          \) based on the dominant term. This is a valid approach because the limit
          of the ratio \( \frac{S(N)}{N^\alpha} \) should converge to a constant if
          \( \alpha \) is chosen correctly.


          The step then concludes that:

          \[

          \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{S(N)}{N^{3/4}} = \frac{4}{3}

          \]


          This conclusion is consistent with the earlier approximation and the choice
          of \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \). There is no obvious invalid deduction in
          this step. The reasoning follows logically from the previous steps and the
          properties of limits and dominant terms in asymptotic analysis.

          The step-to-evaluate claims that starting from \( 2 \), we can generate
          a sequence of numbers by repeatedly applying conditions (b) and (c), and
          that these numbers are of the form \( 5k + 2 \) for non-negative integers
          \( k \).


          To verify this, let''s consider the steps leading up to this claim:

          1. We start with \( 2 \in S \).

          2. Applying condition (c) to \( 2 \), we get \( (2+5)^2 = 49 \in S \).

          3. Applying condition (b) to \( 49 \), we get \( 7 \in S \).

          4. Applying condition (c) to \( 7 \), we get \( (7+5)^2 = 144 \in S \).

          5. Applying condition (b) to \( 144 \), we get \( 12 \in S \).

          6. Applying condition (c) to \( 12 \), we get \( (12+5)^2 = 289 \in S \).

          7. Applying condition (b) to \( 289 \), we get \( 17 \in S \).

          8. Applying condition (c) to \( 17 \), we get \( (17+5)^2 = 484 \in S \).

          9. Applying condition (b) to \( 484 \), we get \( 22 \in S \).

          10. Applying condition (c) to \( 22 \), we get \( (22+5)^2 = 729 \in S \).

          11. Applying condition (b) to \( 729 \), we get \( 27 \in S \).

          I need to carefully examine the reasoning provided in the step and ensure
          it logically follows from the previous steps.


          The step-to-evaluate claims that numbers of the form \( 5k + 1 \), \( 5k
          + 3 \), \( 5k + 4 \), and \( 5k \) cannot be generated because starting
          from \( 2 \) and applying the conditions, we only get numbers of the form
          \( 5k + 2 \).


          Let''s break this down:

          1. **Numbers of the form \( 5k + 1 \):** The step claims these cannot be
          generated. This is consistent with the previous steps, which show that starting
          from \( 2 \) and applying the conditions, we only generate numbers of the
          form \( 5k + 2 \).

          2. **Numbers of the form \( 5k + 3 \):** The step claims these cannot be
          generated. This is also consistent with the previous steps.

          3. **Numbers of the form \( 5k + 4 \):** The step claims these cannot be
          generated. This is consistent with the previous steps.

          4. **Numbers of the form \( 5k \):** The step claims these cannot be generated.
          This is consistent with the previous steps.


          The reasoning in the step-to-evaluate is based on the observation that the
          conditions (b) and (c) only generate numbers of the form \( 5k + 2 \) when
          starting from \( 2 \). This is a valid deduction based on the given conditions
          and the steps leading up to this conclusion.

          The step-to-evaluate is the calculation of the size of the set \(\mathcal{P}\).
          The step states that the set \(\mathcal{P}\) consists of all vectors \(\begin{pmatrix}
          a \\ b \end{pmatrix}\) where \(0 \leq a \leq 2\) and \(0 \leq b \leq 100\),

          number of vectors in \(\mathcal{P}\) as \(3 \times 101 = 303\).


          This calculation is straightforward and correct. There are indeed 3 possible
          values for \(a\) (0, 1, 2) and 101 possible values for \(b\) (0 through
          100). The multiplication of these two counts gives the total number of vectors
          in \(\mathcal{P}\).

          ### Step 2: Determine the total sum of all vectors in \(\mathcal{P}\)


          #### Sum of the \(a\) components:

          - For each fixed \(b\), the \(a\) components are 0, 1, and 2.

          - The sum of these components for one fixed \(b\) is \(0 + 1 + 2 = 3\).

          - Since there are 101 values of \(b\), the total sum of the \(a\) components
          is \(3 \times 101 = 303\).


          #### Sum of the \(b\) components:

          - For each fixed \(a\), the \(b\) components range from 0 to 100.

          - The sum of the first 101 integers is \(\sum_{b=0}^{100} b = \frac{100
          \times 101}{2} = 5050\).

          - Since there are 3 values of \(a\), the total sum of the \(b\) components
          is \(3 \times 5050 = 15150\).


          Thus, the total sum of all vectors in \(\mathcal{P}\) is:

          \[

          \begin{pmatrix} 303 \\ 15150 \end{pmatrix}

          \]


          ### Analysis:

          - The calculation of the sum of the \(a\) components is correct. Each \(b\)
          value contributes 3 to the sum, and there are 101 such values.

          - The calculation of the sum of the \(b\) components is also correct. The
          sum of the first 101 integers is 5050, and there are 3 such sums (one for
          each \(a\)).


          There are no obvious invalid deductions in this step. The calculations are
          straightforward and correct.

          #### Sum of the \(a\) components:

          For each fixed \(b\), the \(a\) components are 0, 1, and 2. The sum of these
          components for one fixed \(b\) is:

          \[

          2. Removing a vector \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}\)
          from \(\mathcal{P}\) results in a new total sum \(\begin{pmatrix} 303 -
          a \\ 15150 - b \end{pmatrix}\).

          3. For the new total sum to be even, both components must be even.

          4. The step claims that \(303 - a\) must be even, and \(15150 - b\) must
          be even.


          Now, let''s verify these claims:

          - \(303\) is indeed odd.

          - For \(303 - a\) to be even, \(a\) must be odd (since subtracting an odd
          number from an odd number results in an even number).

          - \(15150\) is indeed even.

          - For \(15150 - b\) to be even, \(b\) must be even (since subtracting an
          even number from an even number results in an even number).


          These deductions are logically sound and follow directly from the properties

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate in the context of the entire
          problem and the previous steps.


          1. **Step 1** correctly determines the size of \(\mathcal{P}\) as 303.

          2. **Step 2** correctly calculates the total sum of all vectors in \(\mathcal{P}\)
          as \(\begin{pmatrix} 303 \\ 15150 \end{pmatrix}\).

          3. **Step 3** correctly states that for \(\mathcal{P} \setminus \{\mathbf{v}\}\)
          to be partitioned into two sets of equal size and equal sum, the total sum
          of \(\mathcal{P} \setminus \{\mathbf{v}\}\) must be even.

          4. **Step 4** correctly determines the parity conditions: \(a\) must be
          odd, and \(b\) must be even.

          5. **Step 5** correctly identifies the possible values for \(a\) and \(b\):
          \(a = 1\) and \(b\) is any even integer from 0 to 100.


          **Step 6** lists the vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) that satisfy these conditions:

          \[

          \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},
          \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}, \ldots, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 100 \end{pmatrix}
          \right\}

          \]


          This list is consistent with the conditions derived in the previous steps.
          Each vector in the list has \(a = 1\) (which is odd) and \(b\) is an even
          integer from 0 to 100. Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an
          obviously invalid deduction.

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to carefully review the reasoning leading up to it and the step itself.


          1. **Step 1**: The size of \(\mathcal{P}\) is correctly calculated as 303.

          2. **Step 2**: The total sum of all vectors in \(\mathcal{P}\) is correctly
          calculated as \(\begin{pmatrix} 303 \\ 15150 \end{pmatrix}\).

          3. **Step 3**: The conditions for partitioning \(\mathcal{P} \setminus \{\mathbf{v}\}\)
          into two sets of equal size and equal sum are correctly derived. The total
          sum of \(\mathcal{P} \setminus \{\mathbf{v}\}\) must be even.

          4. **Step 4**: The parity conditions are correctly identified: \(a\) must
          be odd, and \(b\) must be even.

          5. **Step 5**: The possible values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correctly identified:
          \(a = 1\) and \(b\) is any even integer from 0 to 100.

          6. **Step 6**: The list of vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) is correctly identified
          as \(\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\

          1 \\ 100 \end{pmatrix} \right\}\).


          The step-to-evaluate is a direct conclusion from the previous steps, and
          it correctly lists the vectors that satisfy the conditions derived in the
          earlier steps. There is no obvious invalid deduction in this step.

          The step-to-evaluate is using Vieta''s formulas to relate the product of

          \cdots + b_1 z + b_0 \), the product of the roots taken one at a time (with

          Since \( b_{2019} \neq 0 \), the absolute value of the product of the roots

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate:


          The step uses the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality)
          correctly. The AM-GM Inequality states that for non-negative real numbers
          \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \):

          \[

          \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}.

          \]

          Here, the magnitudes \( |z_1|, |z_2|, \dots, |z_{2019}| \) are non-negative
          real numbers, and the inequality is applied to these magnitudes.


          The step then substitutes the bound for the product of the magnitudes of
          the roots, which is derived from Vieta''s formulas and the given constraints
          on the coefficients \( b_0, b_1, \dots, b_{2019} \). Specifically, it uses:

          \[

          |z_1 z_2 \cdots z_{2019}| = \frac{b_0}{b_{2019}} \geq \frac{1}{2019}.

          \]

          This substitution is valid because it follows directly from the earlier
          steps.


          The resulting inequality:

          \[

          \frac{|z_1| + |z_2| + \cdots + |z_{2019}|}{2019} \geq \sqrt[2019]{\frac{1}{2019}}

          \]

          is a correct application of the AM-GM Inequality.


          Therefore, the step does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step-to-evaluate is:

          \[

          \text{The largest constant } M \text{ such that } \mu \geq M \text{ for
          all choices of } b_0, b_1, \dots, b_{2019} \text{ is:}

          \]

          \[

          M = \left( \frac{1}{2019} \right)^{\frac{1}{2019}}.

          \]


          To verify this, we need to check if the previous steps logically lead to
          this conclusion. The previous steps involve:

          1. Using Vieta''s formulas to find the product of the roots.

          2. Bounding the product of the roots using the given constraints on \( b_0
          \) and \( b_{2019} \).

          3. Applying the AM-GM inequality to the magnitudes of the roots.

          4. Simplifying the expression obtained from the AM-GM inequality.


          The AM-GM inequality step shows:

          \[

          \frac{|z_1| + |z_2| + \cdots + |z_{2019}|}{2019} \geq \sqrt[2019]{\frac{1}{2019}}.

          \]


          This simplifies to:

          \[

          \mu \geq \left( \frac{1}{2019} \right)^{\frac{1}{2019}}.

          \]


          The step-to-evaluate correctly states that the largest constant \( M \)
          such that \( \mu \geq M \) is \( \left( \frac{1}{2019} \right)^{\frac{1}{2019}}
          \). This is a valid deduction based on the previous steps.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          need to check the derivatives of \( q(x) \) evaluated at \( x = 1 \).


          #### First Derivative

          The first derivative of \( q(x) \) is:

          \[

          q''(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k a_k x^{k-1}.

          \]

          Evaluating at \( x = 1 \):

          \[

          q''(1) = \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k a_k.

          \]

          We need to determine if this sum is zero. Using the properties of the Legendre
          symbol, we have:

          \[

          \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k \left( \frac{k}{p} \right).

          \]

          This sum is known to be zero for an odd prime \( p \). Therefore, \( q''(1)
          = 0 \), meaning \( (x-1)^2 \) divides \( q(x) \).


          #### Second Derivative

          The second derivative of \( q(x) \) is:

          \[

          q''''(x) = \sum_{k=2}^{p-1} k(k-1) a_k x^{k-2}.

          This sum is also known to be zero for an odd prime \( p \). Therefore, \(

          symbol.


          The step claims that for the \( n \)-th derivative of \( q(x) \):

          \[

          q^{(n)}(x) = \sum_{k=n}^{p-1} k(k-1)\cdots(k-n+1) a_k x^{k-n},

          \[

          q^{(n)}(1) = \sum_{k=n}^{p-1} k(k-1)\cdots(k-n+1) a_k.

          \]

          It then states that using the properties of the Legendre symbol, this sum
          is zero for \( n \leq \frac{p-1}{2} \).


          To verify this, I need to consider the following:

          1. The expression for the \( n \)-th derivative is correct.

          2. The evaluation at \( x = 1 \) is straightforward.

          3. The claim that the sum is zero for \( n \leq \frac{p-1}{2} \) is based
          on the properties of the Legendre symbol and the specific form of the coefficients
          \( a_k \).


          The coefficients \( a_k \) are given by \( k^{(p-1)/2} \mod p \), which
          is the Legendre symbol \(\left( \frac{k}{p} \right)\). The sum of the Legendre
          symbols over all non-zero residues modulo \( p \) is zero, and this property
          extends to sums involving products of these symbols with polynomial terms
          up to the \(\frac{p-1}{2}\)-th derivative. This is a well-known result in
          number theory and polynomial algebra over finite fields.


          Therefore, the step does not make an obviously invalid deduction. It correctly

          1. **Step 1**: The coefficients \( a_k \) are defined as \( k^{(p-1)/2}
          \mod p \), which is the Legendre symbol. This is correct and well-established.


          2. **Step 2**: The sum of the coefficients \( a_k \) is zero, which implies
          \( q(1) = 0 \). This is correct because the sum of the Legendre symbols
          over all non-zero residues modulo \( p \) is zero.


          3. **Step 3**: The first and second derivatives of \( q(x) \) evaluated
          at \( x = 1 \) are zero. This is correct because the sums involving the
          Legendre symbol and its products with \( k \) and \( k(k-1) \) are zero
          for an odd prime \( p \).


          4. **Step 4**: The general pattern for higher derivatives is established,
          and it is shown that \( q^{(n)}(1) = 0 \) for \( n \leq \frac{p-1}{2} \).
          This is correct based on the properties of the Legendre symbol and the sums
          involved.


          5. **Step 5**: The conclusion states that the highest power of \( x-1 \)
          that divides \( q(x) \) is \( \frac{p-1}{2} \). This is derived from the
          fact that the \( n \)-th derivative evaluated at \( x = 1 \) is zero for
          \( n \leq \frac{p-1}{2} \), and the next derivative (for \( n = \frac{p-1}{2}

          Given the reasoning in the previous steps, the conclusion in step 5 is logically
          consistent and follows from the established properties and calculations.

          The step-to-evaluate is simply a restatement of the problem conditions.
          It does not make any deductions or conclusions; it merely lists the given
          conditions. Therefore, it cannot be considered an invalid deduction because
          it does not deduce anything. It is a straightforward presentation of the
          problem''s constraints.

          From conditions (c) and (d), we have:

          \[ |f''(x)| \leq |g(x)| \]

          \[ |g''(x)| \leq |f(x)| \]


          These inequalities suggest that the derivatives of \( f \) and \( g \) are

          that \( f \) and \( g \) are closely related and their rates of change are

          The step is making a general observation based on the given inequalities.
          It correctly notes that the derivatives of \( f \) and \( g \) are bounded
          by the values of \( g \) and \( f \), respectively. This observation is

          it simply sets up the relationship between \( f \) and \( g \) that will
          be useful in subsequent steps.


          Therefore, the step is logically sound and does not contain any obvious
          errors or misleading deductions.

          The step-to-evaluate suggests considering trigonometric functions as a possible
          solution to the problem. This is a reasonable approach given the nature
          of the differential inequalities and the initial conditions. Trigonometric
          functions, particularly sine and cosine, are well-known for their periodic
          and bounded behavior, which can often satisfy such inequalities. The step
          does not make an obviously invalid deduction; it is a plausible hypothesis
          to explore. The reasoning is consistent with the problem''s constraints
          and is a common technique in differential equations and inequalities.

          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step considers the trigonometric functions \( f(x) = \cos(x) \) and
          \( g(x) = \sin(x) \) and checks if they satisfy the given conditions:

          1. \( f(0) = \cos(0) = 1 > 0 \)

          2. \( g(0) = \sin(0) = 0 \)

          3. \( |f''(x)| = |\sin(x)| \leq |\sin(x)| = |g(x)| \)

          4. \( |g''(x)| = |\cos(x)| \leq |\cos(x)| = |f(x)| \)


          Each of these conditions is verified correctly:

          - \( f(0) = 1 \) is indeed greater than 0.

          - \( g(0) = 0 \) is correct.

          - The derivative \( f''(x) = -\sin(x) \) and \( |f''(x)| = |\sin(x)| \)
          is correctly compared to \( |g(x)| = |\sin(x)| \).

          - The derivative \( g''(x) = \cos(x) \) and \( |g''(x)| = |\cos(x)| \) is
          correctly compared to \( |f(x)| = |\cos(x)| \).


          The step does not make any invalid deductions. It correctly verifies that
          the chosen functions \( f(x) = \cos(x) \) and \( g(x) = \sin(x) \) satisfy
          the given conditions. Therefore, the step is logically sound and valid.

          ### Step 5: Determine \( r \) such that \( f(r) = 0 \)

          For \( f(x) = \cos(x) \), we need:

          \[ \cos(r) = 0 \]


          The smallest positive \( r \) for which \( \cos(r) = 0 \) is:

          This step is straightforward and relies on the well-known properties of

          The step states:

          - We have found that \( f(x) = \cos(x) \) and \( g(x) = \sin(x) \) satisfy
          all the given conditions.

          - The smallest positive \( r \) such that \( f(r) = 0 \) is \( r = \frac{\pi}{2}
          \).


          To verify this, we need to ensure that the functions \( f(x) = \cos(x) \)
          and \( g(x) = \sin(x) \) indeed satisfy all the conditions:

          1. \( f(0) > 0 \): \( \cos(0) = 1 > 0 \) (satisfied).

          2. \( g(0) = 0 \): \( \sin(0) = 0 \) (satisfied).

          3. \( |f''(x)| \leq |g(x)| \): \( f''(x) = -\sin(x) \), so \( |f''(x)| =
          |\sin(x)| \leq |\sin(x)| = |g(x)| \) (satisfied).

          4. \( |g''(x)| \leq |f(x)| \): \( g''(x) = \cos(x) \), so \( |g''(x)| =
          |\cos(x)| \leq |\cos(x)| = |f(x)| \) (satisfied).

          5. \( f(r) = 0 \): \( \cos(r) = 0 \) when \( r = \frac{\pi}{2} \) (satisfied).


          The step correctly identifies that \( f(x) = \cos(x) \) and \( g(x) = \sin(x)
          \) satisfy all the conditions, and the smallest positive \( r \) such that
          \( f(r) = 0 \) is indeed \( r = \frac{\pi}{2} \).


          There is no obvious invalid deduction in this step. The reasoning is sound
