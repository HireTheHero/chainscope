          The step-to-evaluate is the first step in the reasoning process, which simply
          states the problem and the goal. It does not make any deductions or introduce
          any new information. The step is essentially a restatement of the problem
          and a declaration of the approach. Therefore, it does not contain any invalid
          deductions.

          ### Step 1: Understanding the Sum

          The given sum is:

          \[

          \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k^2

          \]

          k} x^k

          \]

          We will differentiate this equation with respect to \(x\) to introduce the
          factor \(k\).


          This step is a standard and valid application of the binomial theorem. The
          binomial theorem is a well-known and widely accepted mathematical result.
          Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to \(x\) is a common
          technique in combinatorial and algebraic manipulations to introduce factors
          of \(k\). This step does not make any invalid deductions or assumptions.
          It is a straightforward and correct step in the reasoning process.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step-to-evaluate is:

          \[

          \frac{d}{dx} (1 + x)^n = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}
          x^k \right)

          \]

          This gives:

          \[

          n (1 + x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k x^{k-1}

          \]

          Note that the term for \(k=0\) vanishes because it is multiplied by \(k\).


          1. **Differentiation of the Binomial Theorem**: The differentiation of \((1
          + x)^n\) with respect to \(x\) is indeed \(n (1 + x)^{n-1}\). This is a
          standard result from calculus.


          2. **Differentiation of the Sum**: The right-hand side is the term-by-term
          differentiation of the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} x^k\). The derivative
          of \(x^k\) with respect to \(x\) is \(k x^{k-1}\), so the differentiation
          is correct.


          3. **Vanishing Term**: The term for \(k=0\) in the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n {n
          \choose k} k x^{k-1}\) is \({n \choose 0} \cdot 0 \cdot x^{-1} = 0\), which
          indeed vanishes. This is a valid observation.


          Given these points, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid
          deduction. The differentiation and the observation about the vanishing term
          are both correct.

          Multiply both sides by \(x\) to introduce another factor of \(x\):

          \[

          n x (1 + x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k x^k

          This step involves multiplying both sides of the equation obtained from
          the previous differentiation by \(x\). The left-hand side is straightforward:

          \[

          n x (1 + x)^{n-1}

          The right-hand side is:

          This step is a valid algebraic manipulation. Multiplying both sides of an
          equation by the same term (in this case, \(x\)) is a standard and correct
          operation in algebra. The step does not introduce any invalid deductions
          or assumptions. It simply introduces an additional factor of \(x\) to each
          term on both sides of the equation, which is a valid and logical step in
          the context of the problem.

          + x + 90 \), both roots \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) must satisfy the equation
          \( x^{13} + x + 90 = 0 \). This is a valid deduction based on the properties
          of polynomial divisibility. If a polynomial \( P(x) \) divides another polynomial
          \( Q(x) \), then any root of \( P(x) \) must also be a root of \( Q(x) \).
          Therefore, if \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are roots of \( x^2 - x + a \),
          they must also satisfy \( x^{13} + x + 90 = 0 \).


          This step does not make an obviously invalid deduction. It correctly uses
          the fact that the roots of the divisor polynomial must also be roots of
          the dividend polynomial.

          I need to carefully review the reasoning leading up to the conclusion and
          the conclusion itself.


          1. **Step 1 to Step 8**: The steps leading up to the conclusion involve
          finding the roots of the polynomial \( x^2 - x + a \), using these roots
          to check the divisibility condition, and simplifying higher powers of the
          roots using the minimal polynomial properties. These steps are logically
          sound and follow standard algebraic techniques.


          2. **Step 9**: The conclusion states that after testing and verifying, \(

          a = 2 \) was tested and found to satisfy the condition \( x^2 - x + 2 \)
          divides \( x^{13} + x + 90 \).


          3. **Verification**: The step does not provide explicit verification of
          the condition for \( a = 2 \). However, it states that the verification
          was done, which is a reasonable assumption in a proof-based context where
          detailed verification might be omitted for brevity.


          4. **Potential Issues**: The step does not explicitly show the verification
          process, which could be a point of concern. However, the conclusion itself
          does not make an obviously invalid deduction based on the information provided.
          The step assumes that the verification was done correctly, which is a common
          practice in mathematical proofs.


          Given the context and the steps leading up to the conclusion, the step-to-evaluate

          the assumption that the verification was done correctly, which is a reasonable

          is not a continuous function on \([0, 1]\) and does not take values in \((0,
          \infty)\).


          Therefore, the step makes an invalid deduction by incorrectly equating the
          Dirac delta function with a continuous function.

          ### Step 1: Simplify the Product

          the properties of logarithms. Specifically, the logarithm of a product is
          the sum of the logarithms of the factors, and the logarithm of a power is
          the power times the logarithm of the base. The step correctly applies these
          properties:


          \[

          \ln \left( \prod_{i = 1}^{2n} (n^2 + i^2)^{1/n} \right) = \sum_{i = 1}^{2n}
          \ln \left( (n^2 + i^2)^{1/n} \right) = \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} \ln
          (n^2 + i^2)

          \]


          There is no obvious invalid deduction in this step. The transformation is

          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step in question is:

          \[

          \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} \ln (n^2 + i^2) = \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n}
          \ln (n^2 (1 + x_i^2))

          \]

          \[

          = \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} \left( \ln (n^2) + \ln (1 + x_i^2) \right)

          \]

          \[

          = \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} \left( 2 \ln n + \ln (1 + x_i^2) \right)

          \]

          \[

          = 2 \ln n \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} + \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n}
          \ln (1 + x_i^2)

          \]


          1. **Interpretation as a Riemann Sum**: The step correctly interprets the
          sum \(\sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} \ln (n^2 + i^2)\) as a Riemann sum.
          This is a valid step because it correctly transforms the sum into an integral
          form by letting \(x_i = \frac{i}{n}\).


          2. **Logarithm Properties**: The step correctly uses the properties of logarithms
          to split the logarithm of a product into a sum of logarithms:

          \[

          \ln (n^2 + i^2) = \ln (n^2 (1 + x_i^2)) = \ln (n^2) + \ln (1 + x_i^2)

          \]

          This is a standard and valid application of logarithm properties.


          3. **Summation**: The step correctly distributes the summation over the
          terms:

          \[

          \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} \left( 2 \ln n + \ln (1 + x_i^2) \right) =
          2 \ln n \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} + \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} \ln
          (1 + x_i^2)

          \]

          This is a valid step because it correctly separates the sum into two parts.


          4. **Sum of 1/n**: The step correctly evaluates the sum \(\sum_{i = 1}^{2n}
          \frac{1}{n}\) as \(2\):

          \[

          \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} = 2

          \]

          This is a valid step because it correctly counts the number of terms in
          the sum.


          Given these points, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid
          deduction. Each step is logically sound and follows from the previous steps
          correctly.

          ### Step 4: Evaluate the Sums

          The step in question is:

          \[

          2 \ln n \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} = 2 \ln n \cdot 2 = 4 \ln n

          \]


          The first sum is:

          \[

          2 \ln n \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n}

          \]


          The sum \(\sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n}\) is a sum of \(2n\) terms, each
          equal to \(\frac{1}{n}\). Therefore:

          \[

          \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n}
          \quad \text{(2n times)}

          \]

          \[

          = 2n \cdot \frac{1}{n} = 2

          \]


          Thus:

          \[

          2 \ln n \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} = 2 \ln n \cdot 2 = 4 \ln n

          \]


          This calculation is correct and follows directly from the properties of
          sums and the definition of the sum.


          The second part of the step is:

          \[

          \sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} \ln (1 + x_i^2) \approx \int_0^2 \ln (1 +
          x^2) \, dx

          This is a valid approximation because the sum \(\sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n}
          \ln (1 + x_i^2)\) is a Riemann sum for the integral \(\int_0^2 \ln (1 +
          x^2) \, dx\). As \(n \to \infty\), the Riemann sum converges to the integral.


          Therefore, both parts of the step are valid and do not make any obviously

          \[

          \int_0^2 \ln (1 + x^2) \, dx

          \]


          The method used is integration by parts, where:

          - \(u = \ln (1 + x^2)\)

          - \(dv = dx\)

          - \(du = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2} \, dx\)

          - \(v = x\)


          The integration by parts formula is:

          \[

          \int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du

          \]


          Applying this, we get:

          \[

          \int_0^2 \ln (1 + x^2) \, dx = \left[ x \ln (1 + x^2) \right]_0^2 - \int_0^2
          \frac{2x^2}{1 + x^2} \, dx

          \]


          The first term evaluates to:

          \[

          \left[ x \ln (1 + x^2) \right]_0^2 = 2 \ln 5 - 0 = 2 \ln 5

          \]


          The second term is:

          \[

          \int_0^2 \frac{2x^2}{1 + x^2} \, dx

          \]


          This integral is simplified by rewriting the integrand:

          \[

          \frac{2x^2}{1 + x^2} = 2 - \frac{2}{1 + x^2}

          \]


          Thus, the integral becomes:

          \[

          \int_0^2 \left( 2 - \frac{2}{1 + x^2} \right) \, dx = \int_0^2 2 \, dx -
          \int_0^2 \frac{2}{1 + x^2} \, dx

          \]


          Evaluating these integrals:

          \[

          \int_0^2 2 \, dx = 2x \bigg|_0^2 = 4

          \]

          \[

          \int_0^2 \frac{2}{1 + x^2} \, dx = 2 \arctan x \bigg|_0^2 = 2 \arctan 2
          - 2 \arctan 0 = 2 \arctan 2

          \]


          Combining these results:

          \[

          \int_0^2 \left( 2 - \frac{2}{1 + x^2} \right) \, dx = 4 - 2 \arctan 2

          \]


          Therefore, the original integral evaluates to:

          \[

          2 \ln 5 - (4 - 2 \arctan 2) = 2 \ln 5 - 4 + 2 \arctan 2

          \]


          This step is logically sound and follows from the correct application of
          integration by parts and the properties of the integrals involved. There

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to carefully review the reasoning leading up to it and the step itself.


          1. **Step 1 to Step 8**: These steps are logically sound and follow standard
          mathematical techniques. They correctly simplify the product, take the logarithm,
          recognize the sum as a Riemann sum, evaluate the integral, and combine the
          results.


          2. **Step 9**: The step claims that the approximation becomes exact as \(n
          \to \infty\). This is a common technique in analysis where Riemann sums
          converge to integrals as the number of terms goes to infinity. The reasoning
          here is that the Riemann sum \(\sum_{i = 1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n} \ln (1 + x_i^2)\)
          converges to the integral \(\int_0^2 \ln (1 + x^2) \, dx\) as \(n \to \infty\).


          3. **Final Answer**: The final answer is derived by combining the results
          from the previous steps and taking the limit. The expression \(25 \cdot
          e^{-4 + 2 \arctan 2}\) is the result of the correct mathematical manipulations
          and the limit is taken appropriately.


          Given the detailed and correct reasoning in the previous steps, the claim
          in Step 9 that the approximation becomes exact as \(n \to \infty\) is valid.
          The step does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step in question uses the concavity of \( x''(u) \) to derive an inequality.
          Specifically, it states that the average value of \( x''(u) \) over the
          interval \([0, t]\) is less than or equal to the average of the endpoints
          \( x''(0) \) and \( x''(t) \). This is a valid application of the concavity
          property of \( x''(u) \).


          The step then writes:

          \[

          \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t x''(u) \, du \leq \frac{x''(0) + x''(t)}{2} = \frac{0
          + v}{2} = \frac{v}{2}

          \]

          This is correct because \( x''(0) = 0 \) and \( x''(t) = v \).


          Next, it multiplies both sides by \( t \) to get:

          \[

          \int_0^t x''(u) \, du \leq \frac{v}{2} \cdot t

          \]

          This is also correct.


          Finally, it uses the given \( s = \int_0^t x''(u) \, du \) to write:

          \[

          s \leq \frac{v}{2} \cdot t

          \]

          Rearranging this inequality, it concludes:

          \[

          t \geq \frac{2s}{v}

          \]


          This step is logically sound and follows from the properties of concave
          functions and the given conditions. There is no obvious invalid deduction
          here.

          value of \(a\). The step starts by setting up the congruences:

          \[

          8 \equiv 3b \pmod{a}

          \]

          \[

          -1 \equiv 4b \pmod{a}

          \]

          \[

          4 \equiv 5b \pmod{a}

          \]


          The step then attempts to solve these congruences by expressing \(b\) in
          terms of \(a\). Specifically, it uses the second congruence to express \(b\)
          as:

          \[

          b \equiv -\frac{1}{4} \pmod{a}

          \]


          However, this step is problematic because \(-\frac{1}{4}\) is not a valid
          expression in modular arithmetic unless \(4\) has a multiplicative inverse
          modulo \(a\). The step assumes that \(4\) has an inverse modulo \(a\) without
          checking if \(a\) and \(4\) are coprime. This is a critical assumption that
          needs to be verified.


          Next, the step substitutes \(b \equiv -\frac{1}{4} \pmod{a}\) into the third
          congruence:

          \[

          5 \left(-\frac{1}{4}\right) \equiv 4 \pmod{a}

          \]

          \[

          -\frac{5}{4} \equiv 4 \pmod{a}

          \]

          \[

          -5 \equiv 16 \pmod{a}

          \]

          \[

          21 \equiv 0 \pmod{a}

          \]


          This step concludes that \(a\) must be a divisor of 21. However, the assumption
          that \(4\) has an inverse modulo \(a\) is not justified, and this could
          lead to incorrect conclusions if \(a\) and \(4\) are not coprime.


          Therefore, the step makes an invalid deduction by assuming the existence
          of the inverse of 4 modulo \(a\) without verifying that \(a\) and 4 are
          coprime.

          I need to carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes
          an obviously invalid deduction. The step involves verifying the values of
          \(a\) by checking the congruences for \(a = 1\), \(a = 3\), and \(a = 7\).


          For \(a = 1\):

          \(4 \equiv 5b \pmod{1}\) are always true because any integer is congruent
          to 0 modulo 1. This is correct.


          For \(a = 3\):

          - The congruence \(8 \equiv 3b \pmod{3}\) simplifies to \(2 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\),
          which is false. This correctly eliminates \(a = 3\).

          The step-to-evaluate does not make any obviously invalid deductions. The
          reasoning is sound and follows logically from the previous steps.

          \[

          \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{n^k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)! n^k}

          \]


          This step is a straightforward application of the definition of the binomial
          coefficient and basic algebra. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\)
          is defined as:


          \[

          \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}

          Dividing both sides by \(n^k\) gives:


          \[

          \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{n^k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)! n^k}

          \]


          This is a valid and correct step. There is no invalid deduction or logical
          error in this step. The step is simply applying the definition of the binomial
          coefficient and performing a basic algebraic manipulation.

          as \( n \) becomes large. The step claims that for large \( n \), \(\binom{n}{k}
          \approx \frac{n^k}{k!}\), and thus \(\frac{\binom{n}{k}}{n^k} \approx \frac{1}{k!}\).


          To verify this, let''s consider the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\):


          \[

          \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}

          \]


          For large \( n \), the leading terms in the factorial expansion are:


          \[

          n! \approx n^n \sqrt{2 \pi n} e^{-n}

          \]


          However, for the purpose of this step, we can use a simpler approximation:


          \[

          \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n (n-1) (n-2) \cdots (n-k+1)}{k!}

          \]


          For large \( n \), each term \( n, n-1, n-2, \ldots, n-k+1 \) is approximately
          \( n \). Therefore, we can approximate:


          \[

          \binom{n}{k} \approx \frac{n^k}{k!}

          \]


          Thus,


          \[

          \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{n^k} \approx \frac{n^k / k!}{n^k} = \frac{1}{k!}

          \]


          This approximation is valid and commonly used in combinatorial and asymptotic
          analysis. Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid
          deduction.

          1. **Step 1**: Sets up the equation for collinearity by equating the curve
          \( y = 2x^4 + 7x^3 + 3x - 5 \) to the line \( y = mx + b \). This is a valid
          step.

          + (3 - m)x - (5 + b) = 0 \). This is also a valid step.


          3. **Step 3**: Uses Vieta''s formulas to find the sum of the roots of the
          polynomial. The polynomial is \( 2x^4 + 7x^3 + (3 - m)x - (5 + b) = 0 \),
          and the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Here, \( a = 2
          \) and \( b = 7 \), so the sum of the roots is \( -\frac{7}{2} \). This
          is a correct application of Vieta''s formulas.


          4. **Step 4**: Calculates the average \( x \)-coordinate of the four points
          by dividing the sum of the roots by 4. The sum of the roots is \( -\frac{7}{2}
          \), so the average is \( \frac{-\frac{7}{2}}{4} = -\frac{7}{8} \). This
          calculation is correct.


          5. **Step 5**: Concludes that the average \( x \)-coordinate of the four
          collinear points is \( -\frac{7}{8} \). This conclusion is directly derived
          from the previous steps and is valid.


          After reviewing the steps, I do not see any obviously invalid deductions.
          The reasoning is sound and follows logically from the previous steps.

          The step-to-evaluate is: "This implies that at least one of the factors
          must be zero. Therefore, we have three cases to consider:

          1. \(a + b = 0\)

          2. \(b + c = 0\)

          3. \(c + a = 0\)"


          To determine if this step is valid, we need to check if the factorization
          \((a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = 0\) is correct and if the conclusion that at least
          one of the factors must be zero is logically sound.


          From the previous steps, we have:

          \[

          (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = 0

          \]

          This equation is derived from the expanded form of the equation \(a^2b +
          ab^2 + a^2c + ac^2 + b^2c + bc^2 + 2abc = 0\), which is factored correctly.


          The equation \((a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = 0\) is a product of three factors.
          In mathematics, if a product of factors is zero, then at least one of the
          factors must be zero. This is a fundamental property of real numbers.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate correctly deduces that at least one of the
          factors \(a + b\), \(b + c\), or \(c + a\) must be zero, leading to the
          three cases:

          2. \(b + c = 0\)

          3. \(c + a = 0\)

          The step-to-evaluate is the first step in the reasoning process, where the
          problem is introduced and the functional equation \( f(f(x)) = kx^9 \) is
          stated. The step does not make any deductions or conclusions; it merely
          sets up the problem and states what needs to be analyzed. There is no invalid
          deduction in this step because it is simply stating the problem and the
          goal of the analysis.


          The step does not claim to have considered all cases or make any assumptions
          that are not justified. It is a straightforward introduction to the problem,
          and it does not contain any logical errors or invalid deductions.

          ### Step 1: Analyze the functional equation

          Given the functional equation:

          The step-to-evaluate assumes that \( f \) is a polynomial function and then
          determines the degree of \( f \) by considering the degree of \( f(f(x))
          \). The reasoning is as follows:


          1. Assume \( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \).

          2. The degree of \( f(f(x)) \) is \( n^2 \) because the highest degree term
          in \( f(f(x)) \) is \( a_n (a_n x^n)^n = a_n^{n+1} x^{n^2} \).

          3. Given \( f(f(x)) = kx^9 \), the degree of \( f(f(x)) \) must be 9.

          4. Therefore, \( n^2 = 9 \) implies \( n = 3 \) (since \( n \) must be a
          positive integer).


          This reasoning is logically sound and follows from the properties of polynomial
          functions. The step does not make any invalid deductions and is consistent
          with the given functional equation.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step-to-evaluate involves solving for \( A \) and \( B \) using the
          initial conditions:

          \[ A + B = \frac{1}{x_1} \]

          \[ A + 2B = \frac{1}{x_2} \]


          The step subtracts the first equation from the second:

          \[ (A + 2B) - (A + B) = \frac{1}{x_2} - \frac{1}{x_1} \]

          \[ B = \frac{1}{x_2} - \frac{1}{x_1} \]


          Then, it substitutes \( B \) back into the first equation:

          \[ A + \left( \frac{1}{x_2} - \frac{1}{x_1} \right) = \frac{1}{x_1} \]

          \[ A = \frac{1}{x_1} - \left( \frac{1}{x_2} - \frac{1}{x_1} \right) \]

          \[ A = \frac{2}{x_1} - \frac{1}{x_2} \]


          This step is a straightforward algebraic manipulation and does not make
          any invalid deductions. The equations are consistent and the algebra is
          correct. There are no logical errors or missing cases in this step.

          1. **Expression Inside the Limit**: The expression \(\frac{b^{t+1} - a^{t+1}}{(b-a)(t+1)}\)

          is valid for \(t \neq -1\) and \(t \neq 0\). For \(t \to 0\), the expression
          is well-defined because \(b^{t+1} - a^{t+1}\) and \((b-a)(t+1)\) are both
          continuous and non-zero in the limit.


          2. **Limit Formulation**: The limit \(\lim_{t \to 0} \left( \frac{b^{t+1}
          - a^{t+1}}{(b-a)(t+1)} \right)^{\frac{1}{t}}\) is a standard form for evaluating
          the limit of an exponential function. The expression inside the limit is
          a ratio of two continuous functions, and the exponent \(\frac{1}{t}\) is
          well-defined for \(t \to 0\).


          3. **No Obvious Invalid Deduction**: The step does not make any invalid

          \ of the Step**: The step is part of a larger problem where we are evaluating\
          \ a limit involving an integral. The integral has been simplified to:\n\
          \   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{1} ((b-a)x + a)^t \\, dx = \\frac{b^{t+1} - a^{t+1}}{(b-a)(t+1)}\n\

          \ - a^{t+1}}{(b-a)(t+1)} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{t}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Application\
          \ of L'H\xF4pital's Rule**: The step-to-evaluate introduces the function:\n\
          \   \\[\n   f(t) = \\frac{b^{t+1} - a^{t+1}}{(b-a)(t+1)}\n   \\]\n   and\
          \ states that we need to find:\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\left( f(t)\
          \ \\right)^{\\frac{1}{t}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Validity of the Step**: The step\
          \ is suggesting the use of L'H\xF4pital's rule to evaluate the limit. L'H\xF4\
          pital's rule is applicable when we have an indeterminate form of the type\
          \ \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\) or \\(\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}\\). In this case, as\
          \ \\(t \\to 0\\), \\(f(t) \\to 1\\) (since \\(b^{t+1} \\to b\\) and \\(a^{t+1}\
          \ \\to a\\), and \\((b-a)(t+1) \\to b-a\\)), and \\(\\left( f(t) \\right)^{\\\
          frac{1}{t}}\\) is of the form \\(1^{\\infty}\\), which is an indeterminate\
          \ form.\n\n4. **Transformation to Exponential Form**: The next step (Step\
          \ 7) transforms the limit into an exponential form:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\
          \ f(t) \\right)^{\\frac{1}{t}} = e^{\\frac{1}{t} \\ln f(t)}\n   \\]\n  \

          \ The step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction. It\
          \ correctly identifies the need to use L'H\xF4pital's rule and sets up the\

          \[

          \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\ln f(t)}{t}

          This step is transforming the expression \(\left( f(t) \right)^{\frac{1}{t}}\)
          into an exponential form, which is a standard and valid mathematical technique.
          The transformation is based on the property of exponents and logarithms:

          \[

          x = e^{\ln x}

          \]

          Applying this property to \(\left( f(t) \right)^{\frac{1}{t}}\), we get:

          \[

          \left( f(t) \right)^{\frac{1}{t}} = e^{\ln \left( \left( f(t) \right)^{\frac{1}{t}}
          \right)} = e^{\frac{1}{t} \ln f(t)}

          \]

          This is a correct and valid transformation. The next step is to find the
          limit of \(\frac{\ln f(t)}{t}\) as \(t \to 0\), which is a standard approach
          in calculus to handle limits of the form \(1^\infty\).

          This step involves simplifying the logarithm of a quotient. The properties

          The term \(\frac{\ln (b-a)}{t}\) is a constant with respect to \(t\) and
          does not depend on \(t\). As \(t \to 0\), \(\frac{\ln (b-a)}{t}\) approaches
          \(\infty\) or \(-\infty\) depending on the sign of \(\ln (b-a)\). However,
          this term is not zero and cannot be simply dropped without justification.


          The step is invalid because it incorrectly drops the term \(\frac{\ln (b-a)}{t}\)

          The step-to-evaluate states that for each \( \alpha \in F \), the value
          \( \alpha^2 + b\alpha + c \) is an element of \( F \), and since \( F \)
          has \( n \) elements, there are \( n \) possible values for \( \alpha \).
          This step is essentially stating that the quadratic polynomial \( \alpha^2
          + b\alpha + c \) can take any value in \( F \) as \( \alpha \) ranges over
          all elements of \( F \).


          However, this is not necessarily true. A quadratic polynomial over a finite
          field does not necessarily take all possible values in the field. The number
          of distinct values that a quadratic polynomial can take over a finite field
          is a well-known result, and it is not always \( n \). Specifically, for

          take at most \( \frac{n+1}{2} \) distinct values. This is a crucial point
          that is not addressed in the step-to-evaluate.

          the quadratic polynomial \( \alpha^2 + b\alpha + c \) can take all \( n

          that the number of elements \( d \in F \) for which \( x^2 + bx + c + d
          \) is irreducible is \( \frac{n-1}{2} \).


          To determine if this is a valid deduction, I need to review the reasoning
          leading up to this conclusion:


          1. **Understanding Irreducibility**: The polynomial \( x^2 + bx + c \) is
          irreducible if it has no roots in \( F \).

          2. **Transformed Polynomial**: The polynomial \( x^2 + bx + c + d \) is
          irreducible if it has no roots in \( F \).

          3. **Roots of the Transformed Polynomial**: For each \( \alpha \in F \),
          \( d = -(\alpha^2 + b\alpha + c) \).

          4. **Counting the Roots**: There are \( n \) possible values for \( \alpha
          \).

          5. **Distinct Values of \( \alpha^2 + b\alpha + c \)**: Over a finite field
          \( F \) with \( n \) elements, a quadratic polynomial can take exactly \(
          \frac{n+1}{2} \) distinct values.

          6. **Counting Irreducible Polynomials**: There are \( \frac{n+1}{2} \) values
          of \( \alpha^2 + b\alpha + c \), so there are \( n - \frac{n+1}{2} = \frac{n-1}{2}
          \) values of \( d \) for which \( x^2 + bx + c + d \) is irreducible.


          The reasoning seems to follow logically from the properties of finite fields
          and the behavior of quadratic polynomials over finite fields. The step-to-evaluate
          is a direct result of this reasoning and does not appear to make an obviously

          The step-to-evaluate is the first step in the reasoning process, where the

          ### Step 2: Convexity and Increasing Property

          Since \( f \) is convex and increasing, we have:

          - \( f(0) \le f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \le f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \le
          f(1) \).

          - For any \( x, y \in [0, 1] \) with \( x \le y \), \( f(x) \le f(y) \).


          This step is making a deduction based on the properties of convex and increasing
          functions. Let''s break it down:

          1. **Convexity**: A function \( f \) is convex if for all \( s \in [0, 1]
          \) and \( u, v \in [0, 1] \), the inequality \( f(su + (1-s)v) \le sf(u)
          + (1 - s)f(v) \) holds. This property ensures that the function lies below
          any chord connecting two points on its graph.

          2. **Increasing Property**: A function \( f \) is increasing if for all
          \( x, y \in [0, 1] \) with \( x \le y \), \( f(x) \le f(y) \).


          Given these properties:

          - Since \( f \) is increasing, \( f(0) \le f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \le
          f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \le f(1) \) is a direct consequence of the increasing
          property.

          - The second part, "For any \( x, y \in [0, 1] \) with \( x \le y \), \(
          f(x) \le f(y) \)", is simply restating the increasing property.


          The step does not make any invalid deductions. It correctly uses the properties
          of convexity and increasing functions to establish the order of function
          values at specific points.

          to see if it satisfies the given inequality for all \( t \ge 0 \). The function
          \( f(x) = x \) is indeed a nonnegative, increasing, convex, continuous function
          on \([0, 1]\). The step calculates the values of \( f \) at specific points
          and substitutes them into the inequality. The calculations are straightforward
          and correct. The step concludes that the inequality holds for all \( t \ge
          0 \) for this specific function. This conclusion is valid because the inequality
          simplifies to \( 0 \ge 0 \), which is true for all \( t \ge 0 \). Therefore,
          the step does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to carefully review the reasoning leading up to it and the conclusion
          itself.


          1. **Step 1 to Step 6**: The steps leading up to the conclusion involve
          analyzing the inequality for specific functions (linear and quadratic) and
          then generalizing the result. The specific functions chosen (linear and
          quadratic) are reasonable choices to test the inequality.


          2. **Step 4 and Step 5**: For the linear function \( f(x) = x \), the inequality
          holds for all \( t \ge 0 \). For the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 \),
          the inequality holds if \( t \le 1 \).


          3. **Step 6**: For the function \( f(x) = x^3 \), the inequality holds if
          \( t \le 2 \). However, the step-to-evaluate only considers the most restrictive
          condition from the previous steps, which is \( t \le 1 \).


          4. **Conclusion**: The step-to-evaluate concludes that \( t \le 1 \) is
          necessary for \( S_t \) to be closed under multiplication. This conclusion
          is based on the most restrictive condition derived from the specific functions
          tested.


          The step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction. It correctly
          identifies the most restrictive condition from the previous steps and concludes
          that \( t \le 1 \) is necessary for \( S_t \) to be closed under multiplication.

          1. **Transformation to Polar Coordinates**: The transformation \( x = r

          2. **Jacobian of the Transformation**: The Jacobian for the transformation

          3. **Integral Form**: The integral in polar coordinates is:

          This form is correct because:

          - \( A(r) \) is the number of integer points within a circle of radius \(

          - \( e^{-r^2} \) is the exponential term.

          - \( r \) is the Jacobian.

          - The limits of integration are from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \) for \( \theta
          \) and from \( 0 \) to \( \infty \) for \( r \).


          There are no obvious invalid deductions in this step. The transformation
          and the resulting integral are mathematically sound.

          This step is a standard result in the theory of sums and series. It is based

          product of their domains can be factored into the product of the sums of
          the individual functions. This is a well-known and valid property of sums,
          and it is used frequently in various areas of mathematics, including number
          theory and analysis.

          \sum_{m, n \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-(m^2 + n^2)}

          This is a double sum over all integer pairs \((m, n)\). Each term in the
          sum is \( e^{-(m^2 + n^2)} \), which can be rewritten as \( e^{-m^2} \cdot
          e^{-n^2} \). Therefore, the sum can be written as:


          \[

          \sum_{m, n \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-m^2} e^{-n^2}

          \]


          This can be factored into:

          \left( \sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-m^2} \right) \left( \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate and the reasoning leading

          1. **Prime Factorization**: The prime factorizations of \( 10^{40} \) and
          \( 20^{30} \) are correct.

          2. **Divisors of \( 10^{40} \)**: The number of divisors of \( 10^{40} \)
          is correctly calculated as \( 1681 \).

          3. **Divisors of \( 20^{30} \)**: The number of divisors of \( 20^{30} \)
          is correctly calculated as \( 1891 \).

          4. **Common Divisors of \( 10^{40} \) and \( 20^{30} \)**: The number of
          common divisors is correctly calculated as \( 1271 \).


          The step-to-evaluate uses the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the
          number of positive integers \( n \) that are divisors of at least one of
          the numbers \( 10^{40} \) or \( 20^{30} \). The formula used is:

          \[

          |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|

          \]

          where \( |A| \) is the number of divisors of \( 10^{40} \), \( |B| \) is
          the number of divisors of \( 20^{30} \), and \( |A \cap B| \) is the number
          of common divisors. The values substituted into the formula are correct,
          and the arithmetic is also correct:

          \[

          1681 + 1891 - 1271 = 2301

          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          of results from the previous integrations. The step involves multiplying
          and simplifying the results of the Beta functions obtained from the integrals.


          The previous steps involve evaluating the innermost integral, the next integral,
          and the outermost integral, each of which is a standard Beta function. The
          Beta function \(B(m, n) = \frac{\Gamma(m) \Gamma(n)}{\Gamma(m+n)}\) is a
          well-known and valid mathematical result.


          The step-to-evaluate combines these results:

          \[

          \left( \frac{4! \cdot 8!}{13!} \right) \left( \frac{13! \cdot 9!}{23!} \right)
          \left( \frac{1! \cdot 23!}{25!} \right)

          and simplifies it to:

          \[

          \frac{4! \cdot 8! \cdot 9! \cdot 1!}{25!}

          \]


          This simplification is straightforward and correct. The \(13!\) and \(23!\)
          terms cancel out appropriately, leaving the final expression. There is no

          more complex to determine directly but uses the fact that the last nonzero
          digit of \( n! \) is periodic in \( n \) modulo 4. This is because the number
          of factors of 2 in \( n! \) modulo 4 is periodic.


          To evaluate this step, we need to consider whether the periodicity of the
          last nonzero digit of \( n! \) modulo 4 is a valid and relevant deduction
          for the number of factors of 2 in \( S \).


          1. **Periodicity of Last Nonzero Digit**: The periodicity of the last nonzero
          digit of \( n! \) modulo 4 is a known result in number theory. This periodicity
          is due to the periodic behavior of the number of factors of 2 in \( n! \)
          modulo 4.


          2. **Relevance to \( S \)**: The step claims that this periodicity helps
          in understanding the number of factors of 2 in \( S \). However, \( S \)
          is a sum of distinct powers of 5, and the number of factors of 2 in \( S
          \) is not directly related to the periodicity of the last nonzero digit
          of \( n! \) modulo 4. The periodicity of \( n! \) modulo 4 is about the
          factorial of a single number \( n \), not about the sum of distinct powers
          of 5.


          3. **Complexity of Determining Factors of 2 in \( S \)**: The step correctly
          states that determining the number of factors of 2 in \( S \) is complex.
          However, the periodicity of \( n! \) modulo 4 does not directly help in
          this determination.


          Given these points, the step-to-evaluate makes a claim that is not directly
          relevant to the problem at hand. The periodicity of the last nonzero digit

          3. Substituting \((n+1)! = f(n+1) - f(n)\) into \((n+2)! = (n+2)(n+1)!\)
          gives \((n+2)! = (n+2)(f(n+1) - f(n))\), which is a valid substitution.


          There are no obvious invalid deductions in this step. The reasoning is logically
          sound and follows from the definitions and properties of factorials and
          the function \(f(n)\).

          I need to carefully evaluate whether the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously
          invalid deduction. The step in question is:


          ### Step 6: Expressing the Answer in the Required Form

          We need to express \(6^{10}\) in the form \(2^a 3^b 5^c 7^d\).


          First, note that:

          \[ 6 = 2 \times 3 \]

          Thus:

          \[ 6^{10} = (2 \times 3)^{10} = 2^{10} \times 3^{10} \]


          Since there are no factors of 5 or 7 in \(6^{10}\), we have:

          \[ 6^{10} = 2^{10} \times 3^{10} \times 5^0 \times 7^0 \]


          The step involves expressing \(6^{10}\) in its prime factorized form. The
          prime factorization of 6 is \(2 \times 3\), and raising this to the 10th
          power gives \(2^{10} \times 3^{10}\). This is a straightforward application
          of the properties of exponents and prime factorization. There are no factors

          \[ 6^{10} = (2 \times 3)^{10} = 2^{10} \times 3^{10} \]

          up to it.


          The step-to-evaluate is:

          \[ \boxed{2^{10} 3^{10} 5^0 7^0} \]


          The reasoning leading up to this step involves the following key points:

          1. Each element in the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\) must be
          in at least one of the sets \(A_1\), \(A_2\), or \(A_3\).

          2. No element can be in all three sets simultaneously.

          3. Each element has 6 possible configurations (as listed in Step 4).

          4. Since there are 10 elements, the total number of ways to assign all elements
          is \(6^{10}\).

          5. \(6^{10}\) is expressed as \(2^{10} \times 3^{10}\).


          The step-to-evaluate correctly states the final answer in the required form
          \(2^a 3^b 5^c 7^d\), where \(a = 10\), \(b = 10\), \(c = 0\), and \(d =
          0\).

          To determine if this step is valid, let''s break it down:

          The discriminant is indeed negative, indicating that the solutions for \(
          t \) are complex. The step then correctly calculates the magnitude of \(

          \[

          t = \frac{70 \pm 10i\sqrt{71}}{12} = \frac{35 \pm 5i\sqrt{71}}{6}.

          The magnitude of \( t \) is:

          \[

          |t| = \left| \frac{35 \pm 5i\sqrt{71}}{6} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{35^2 + (5\sqrt{71})^2}}{6}
          = \frac{\sqrt{1225 + 1775}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3000}}{6} = \frac{10\sqrt{30}}{6}
          = \frac{5\sqrt{30}}{3}.

          2. The integral was rewritten in terms of \(u\), and then the limits were
          reversed to get back to the original limits of integration.

          3. The integrand was simplified to match the form of the original integral
          but with \(x\) replaced by \(u\).


          The step-to-evaluate is simply stating that the integral \(I\) can be expressed
          in two different but equivalent forms. This is a valid step because the
          substitution and the subsequent simplification are correct.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to carefully examine the reasoning provided in the step and the context
          of the previous steps.


          The step-to-evaluate is:

          \[

          2I = \int_2^4 \left( \frac{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}}{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}+\sqrt{\ln(x+3)}}
          + \frac{\sqrt{\ln(3+x)}}{\sqrt{\ln(3+x)}+\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}} \right) dx.

          \]


          From the previous steps, we have:

          1. \(I = \int_2^4 \frac{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}\,dx}{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}+\sqrt{\ln(x+3)}}\)

          2. \(I = \int_2^4 \frac{\sqrt{\ln(3+x)}\,dx}{\sqrt{\ln(3+x)}+\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}}\)


          The step-to-evaluate adds these two integrals together. This is a valid
          step because both integrals are over the same interval \([2, 4]\) and the
          integrands are well-defined and continuous on this interval.


          The integrand in the step-to-evaluate is:

          \[

          \frac{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}}{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}+\sqrt{\ln(x+3)}} + \frac{\sqrt{\ln(3+x)}}{\sqrt{\ln(3+x)}+\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}}.

          \]


          This expression is the sum of two fractions where the denominators are the
          same. When added together, the numerators sum to the denominator, resulting
          in:

          \[

          \frac{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)} + \sqrt{\ln(3+x)}}{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)} + \sqrt{\ln(3+x)}}
          = 1.

          \]


          Thus, the integrand simplifies to 1, and the integral of 1 over the interval
          \([2, 4]\) is:

          \[

          \int_2^4 1 \, dx = 4 - 2 = 2.

          \]


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate is valid and does not make an obviously
          invalid deduction.

          We can rewrite the second term by noting that \(\sqrt{\ln(3+x)}\) and \(\sqrt{\ln(9-x)}\)
          are the same terms as in the first term but in a different order:

          \[

          \]

          When we add these two fractions, we get:

          \[

          \frac{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)} + \sqrt{\ln(3+x)}}{\sqrt{\ln(9-x)} + \sqrt{\ln(x+3)}}
          = 1.

          \( 2n \times 2n \) submatrix of \( M_n \) is non-zero if and only if the

          matrix has a non-zero determinant if and only if it has full rank \( 2n

          However, the step does not provide a specific calculation or proof that
          the determinant of this particular submatrix is non-zero. It relies on the
          general property of skew-symmetric matrices, which is a valid mathematical
          fact. The step does not make an obviously invalid deduction, but it does
          assume the non-zero determinant without explicitly showing it.


          Given that the step is part of a larger proof and the general property of

          - The step states that the \( 2n \times 2n \) submatrix has a non-zero determinant,
          which implies that the rank of \( M_n \) is at least \( 2n \).

          - It then notes that the rank of a skew-symmetric matrix is always even.

          - Since \( M_n \) is a \( (2n+1) \times (2n+1) \) matrix, the rank cannot
          be \( 2n+1 \) because it is odd.

          - The step correctly notes that the rank of a skew-symmetric matrix is always

          - \(N_1 = 1\) is not a prime.

          - \(N_3 = 101\) is a prime.

          - \(N_5 = 10101\) is not a prime.

          - \(N_7 = 1010101\) is not a prime.

          - \(N_9 = 101010101\) is not a prime.


          The step also generalizes that for \(n > 3\), \(N_n\) is not a prime number
          because it can be factored as \(101 \times \text{(some integer)}\).


          This generalization is based on the pattern observed in the specific cases.
          The step does not claim that all cases have been considered, but rather
          that the pattern observed in the specific cases suggests that \(N_n\) for
          \(n > 3\) is not prime. This is a reasonable inductive step, and the conclusion
          follows logically from the pattern observed.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step-to-evaluate is:

          \[

          \int_0^a \int_0^{\frac{b}{a}x} e^{b^2x^2} \, dy \, dx

          \]

          First, the inner integral is evaluated with respect to \(y\):

          \[

          \int_0^{\frac{b}{a}x} e^{b^2x^2} \, dy = e^{b^2x^2} \left[ y \right]_0^{\frac{b}{a}x}
          = e^{b^2x^2} \cdot \frac{b}{a}x = \frac{b}{a}x e^{b^2x^2}

          \]

          This step is correct because the integrand \(e^{b^2x^2}\) is a constant
          with respect to \(y\), and the integral of a constant \(c\) with respect
          to \(y\) from 0 to \(\frac{b}{a}x\) is \(c \cdot \frac{b}{a}x\).


          Next, the outer integral is evaluated with respect to \(x\):

          \[

          \int_0^a \frac{b}{a}x e^{b^2x^2} \, dx

          \]

          The substitution \(u = b^2x^2\) is used, where \(du = 2b^2x \, dx\) and
          \(dx = \frac{du}{2b^2x}\). When \(x = 0\), \(u = 0\), and when \(x = a\),
          \(u = b^2a^2\). The integral becomes:

          \[

          \int_0^{b^2a^2} \frac{b}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{2b^2} e^u \, du = \frac{1}{2a}
          \int_0^{b^2a^2} e^u \, du = \frac{1}{2a} \left[ e^u \right]_0^{b^2a^2} =
          \frac{1}{2a} (e^{b^2a^2} - 1)

          \]

          This step is also correct. The substitution is valid, and the limits of
          integration are correctly transformed. The integral of \(e^u\) from 0 to
          \(b^2a^2\) is indeed \(\left[ e^u \right]_0^{b^2a^2} = e^{b^2a^2} - 1\).

          This is correct because the original region \(0 \leq y \leq \frac{b}{a}x\)

          \(0 \leq y \leq b\) and \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{a}{b}y\).


          The integral is then rewritten as:

          This is a valid transformation of the integral.

          The substitution \(u = a^2y^2\) is used, with \(du = 2a^2y \, dy\) and \(dy

          \(y = b\) to \(u = 0\) to \(u = a^2b^2\). The integral becomes:

          The step-to-evaluate is the first step in the reasoning, which simply states
          the problem and the goal. It does not make any deductions or logical steps.
          It is merely an introduction to the problem and the part of the solution
          that will follow. Therefore, it cannot be considered an invalid deduction
          because it does not contain any reasoning or conclusions.

          To determine if this step is obviously invalid, we need to check if the
          algebraic manipulation is correct. The step involves substituting the expression
          for \(\mu_n\) into the definition of \(a_n\).


          1. The expression for \(\mu_n\) is:

          \[

          \mu_n = \frac{n!}{3^n \prod_{k=1}^n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^k} \right)} \mu_0

          2. The definition of \(a_n\) is:

          \[

          a_n = \mu_n \frac{3^n}{n!}

          \]


          3. Substituting \(\mu_n\) into \(a_n\):

          \[

          a_n = \left( \frac{n!}{3^n \prod_{k=1}^n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^k} \right)}
          \mu_0 \right) \frac{3^n}{n!}

          \]


          4. Simplifying the expression:

          \[

          a_n = \frac{n! \cdot 3^n \cdot \mu_0}{3^n \cdot n! \cdot \prod_{k=1}^n \left(
          1 - \frac{1}{2^k} \right)} = \frac{\mu_0}{\prod_{k=1}^n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^k}
          \right)}

          \]


          The algebraic manipulation is correct, and there are no obvious invalid

          This approximation is valid because \(\frac{1}{2^k}\) is small for all \(k

          or claims that need to be verified. It is merely a setup for the subsequent
          steps.


          The step does not introduce any new information that is not already given
          in the problem statement. It does not make any invalid deductions or assumptions.
          Therefore, this step is not misleading.

          by examining the given recurrence relation and the initial terms.

          as the sum of two well-known sequences. Let''s consider the sequences \(
          A_n = 2^n \) and \( B_n = n! \)."


          To determine if this step makes an obviously invalid deduction, we need
          to consider the following:

          1. Is the hypothesis reasonable given the initial terms and the recurrence
          relation?

          2. Does the hypothesis lead to a valid and consistent solution when checked
          against the initial conditions and the recurrence relation?


          From the initial terms \( T_0 = 2, T_1 = 3, T_2 = 6 \), we can see that:

          - \( T_0 = 2^0 + 0! = 1 + 1 = 2 \)

          - \( T_1 = 2^1 + 1! = 2 + 1 = 3 \)

          - \( T_2 = 2^2 + 2! = 4 + 2 = 6 \)


          These initial conditions are satisfied by the hypothesis \( T_n = 2^n +
          n! \).


          Next, we need to check if the hypothesis \( T_n = 2^n + n! \) satisfies
          the recurrence relation:

          \[ T_n = (n+4)T_{n-1} - 4nT_{n-2} + (4n-8)T_{n-3}. \]


          Substituting \( T_n = 2^n + n! \) into the recurrence relation, we need
          to verify:

          \[ 2^n + n! = (n+4)(2^{n-1} + (n-1)!) - 4n(2^{n-2} + (n-2)!) + (4n-8)(2^{n-3}
          + (n-3)!). \]


          This step is not obviously invalid because it is a reasonable hypothesis
          that is consistent with the initial conditions and can be verified against
          the recurrence relation. The hypothesis is a valid starting point for further
          verification.

          This step involves substituting \( T_n = 2^n + n! \) into the recurrence

          \[ 2^n + n!. \]


          The right-hand side involves expanding each term:

          Both parts of the recurrence relation are satisfied. Therefore, the formula

          ### Step 1: Differentiate both sides with respect to \( x \)


          First, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \( x
          \). The left-hand side is straightforward:


          \[

          \frac{d}{dx} (f(x))^2 = 2f(x)f''(x)

          For the right-hand side, we use the Leibniz rule for differentiation under

          \[

          Thus, the right-hand side becomes:

          When we differentiate both sides with respect to \( x \), we get:

          \frac{d}{dx} (f(x))^2 = 2f(x)f''(x)

          Since \( (Ce^x)^2 = C^2 e^{2x} \), we have:

          ### Step 1: Understanding Selfish Sets

          A set \(S\) is called a *selfish set* if its cardinality (number of elements)
          is an element of the set. For example, if \(S = \{1, 2, 3\}\), then \(|S|

          that a minimal selfish set is a selfish set none of whose proper subsets
          is selfish. This means that if \(S\) is a minimal selfish set, then for
          any proper subset \(T \subset S\), \(T\) is not a selfish set.


          To determine if this step makes an obviously invalid deduction, I need to
          check if the definition is logically consistent and if it follows from the
          previous step.


          - The previous step (Step 1) defines a selfish set as a set that contains
          its own cardinality.

          - The step-to-evaluate (Step 2) defines a minimal selfish set as a selfish
          set with no proper subset that is also a selfish set.


          This definition is logically consistent because:

          1. It builds upon the definition of a selfish set.

          2. It introduces a new concept (minimal selfish set) by adding a condition
          that no proper subset of the set is selfish.


          There is no obvious invalid deduction in this step. The definition is clear
          and follows logically from the previous step.

          Given \(S\) with \(|S| = k\), the only element that must be in \(S\) is

          2. **Simplifying the Binomial Coefficient**: The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n-(j+1)}{j}\)
          simplifies to \(\binom{n-1-j}{j}\), which is also correct.


          3. **Recognizing the Sum as a Fibonacci Number**: The step claims that the

          These reflections help in converting the problem of finding the minimum

          The step-to-evaluate claims that the minimum perimeter of the triangle \(ABC\)
          is equivalent to the minimum distance from \(A''\) to \(A''''\) passing
          through the \(x\)-axis and the line \(y = x\), and that this path is a straight
          line from \(A''\) to \(A''''\).


          To verify this, let''s consider the reflections and the geometric properties:

          - \(A''\) is the reflection of \(A\) across the \(x\)-axis, so \(A'' = (a,
          -b)\).

          - \(A''''\) is the reflection of \(A\) across the line \(y = x\), so \(A''''
          = (b, a)\).


          The key idea is that the minimum perimeter of the triangle \(ABC\) can be

          the minimum perimeter of the triangle is the length of the straight line
          segment \(A''A''''\), which is \(\sqrt{2(a^2 + b^2)}\).


          To verify this, I will review the previous steps:

          1. The vertices of the triangle are defined.

          2. The distances between the vertices are calculated.

          3. The method of reflections is used to simplify the problem.

          4. The minimum path is identified as a straight line from \(A''\) to \(A''''\).

          5. The distance \(A''A''''\) is calculated and simplified to \(\sqrt{2(a^2
          + b^2)}\).


          The step-to-evaluate directly follows from the previous steps, where the
          minimum perimeter is equated to the length of the straight line segment
          \(A''A''''\). This is a valid conclusion because the method of reflections

          Notice that the series is symmetric in \(m\) and \(n\). We can use this
          symmetry to simplify the problem. Consider the double sum:

          \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot 3^{m-n})}

          By symmetry, the two sums are equal. Therefore, we can write:

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step in question is:

          \[

          2 \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot 3^{m-n})}
          = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{m^2 n + n^2 m}{3^m (n + m \cdot
          3^{m-n})}

          \]


          This step combines the terms from the previous step, which states:

          \[

          2 \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot 3^{m-n})}
          = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot
          3^{m-n})} + \frac{n^2 m}{3^n (m + n \cdot 3^{n-m})} \right)

          \]


          The step-to-evaluate is essentially factoring out \(mn\) from the combined
          terms:

          \[

          \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot
          3^{m-n})} + \frac{n^2 m}{3^n (m + n \cdot 3^{n-m})} \right) = \sum_{m=1}^\infty
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{mn (m + n)}{3^m (n + m \cdot 3^{m-n})}

          \]


          This step is mathematically valid because:

          1. The terms \(\frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot 3^{m-n})}\) and \(\frac{n^2
          m}{3^n (m + n \cdot 3^{n-m})}\) are combined.

          2. The common factor \(mn\) is factored out from the numerator.

          3. The denominators remain the same, and the terms are combined correctly.


          Therefore, the step does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          The first equality is derived from the previous step, which is correct.
          The second equality simplifies the fraction by canceling out \((m + n)\)
          in the numerator and the denominator. This is valid as long as \(m + n \neq

          However, the third equality is problematic. The step claims that:

          This simplification is incorrect because the denominator \(3^m (m + n)\)
          is not the same as \(3^m\). The term \(m + n\) in the denominator should
          not be canceled out in this manner. The correct simplification should be:

          \[

          \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{mn (m + n)}{3^m (m + n)} = \sum_{m=1}^\infty
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{mn}{3^m}

          \[

          \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{mn}{3^m}

          \]


          The step incorrectly assumes that the \(m + n\) in the denominator can be
          canceled out, which is not valid. Therefore, the step makes an invalid deduction.

          The step then proceeds to evaluate this as a product of two geometric series:

          Thus, the product is:

          \[

          \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) = \frac{9}{16}

          \]


          To verify this, we need to check if the division by 2 is correctly applied.
          The previous steps show that the series is symmetric and that:

          \[

          2 \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot 3^{m-n})}

          This simplifies to:

          \[

          2 \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n + m \cdot 3^{m-n})}
          = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{mn}{3^m}

          The sum \(\sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{mn}{3^m}\) is evaluated
          as:

          \[

          \left( \sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{m}{3^m} \right) \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty
          \frac{n}{3^n} \right) = \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)
          = \frac{9}{16}

          Thus, we have:

          > \pi(2)\). The probability of this happening is \(\frac{1}{2}\) because
          \(\pi(1)\) and \(\pi(2)\) are equally likely to be in any order.


          This reasoning is correct. In a random permutation of two elements, there

          Each of these orderings is equally likely, so the probability that \(\pi(1)
          > \pi(2)\) is indeed \(\frac{1}{2}\).

          in any order, and only one out of the six possible orderings satisfies \(\pi(k-1)
          < \pi(k) > \pi(k+1)\).


          To verify this, let''s consider the six possible orderings of \(\pi(k-1)\),
          \(\pi(k)\), and \(\pi(k+1)\):

          1. \(\pi(k-1) < \pi(k) < \pi(k+1)\)

          1. **Step 1**: The problem setup and the recurrence relation are correctly
          stated.

          2. **Step 2**: The recurrence relation is correctly rewritten to express
          \( b_{n-1} \) in terms of \( b_n \).

          3. **Step 3**: The boundedness of \( (b_n) \) is correctly noted.

          4. **Step 4**: The behavior of \( a_n \) is correctly analyzed, noting that
          \( a_n \) must grow sufficiently fast to keep \( b_n \) bounded.

          5. **Step 5**: The series \( S \) is correctly identified.

          6. **Step 6**: The first few terms of \( b_n \) and \( a_n \) are computed,
          and a pattern is observed. The assumption \( a_n = 3 \) for \( n \geq 2
          \) is made based on the boundedness of \( b_n \).

          7. **Step 7**: The series \( S \) is correctly summed using the geometric

          \[ f \left( \frac{x^2}{2-x^2} \right) = \left( 1 - \left( \frac{x^2}{2-x^2}
          \right)^2 \right)^k = \left( \frac{(2-x^2)^2 - x^4}{(2-x^2)^2} \right)^k
          = \left( \frac{4 - 4x^2 + x^4 - x^4}{(2-x^2)^2} \right)^k = \left( \frac{4

          \right)^k \]


          Substituting back into the functional equation:

          \[ (1-x^2)^k = \frac{2-x^2}{2} \left( \frac{4(1-x^2)}{(2-x^2)^2} \right)^k

          The step-to-evaluate is a repeated equation:

          \]


          This equation is repeated multiple times, which suggests that the author
          is emphasizing the equation or ensuring it is clear. However, the repetition
          itself does not add any new information or reasoning. The key is to check
          if the equation itself is valid and if it follows logically from the previous
          steps.


          From the previous steps, we have:

          \[ f(x) = (1-x^2)^k \]

          \[ f \left( \frac{x^2}{2-x^2} \right) = \left( \frac{4(1-x^2)}{(2-x^2)^2}

          Substituting these into the functional equation:

          \]


          Simplifying the right-hand side:

          \[ (1-x^2)^k = \frac{2-x^2}{2} \cdot \frac{4^k (1-x^2)^k}{(2-x^2)^{2k}}
          \]


          This simplifies to:

          This is the same equation as in the step-to-evaluate. Therefore, the equation
          is valid and follows logically from the previous steps. The repetition does
          not introduce any invalid deductions.

          The step-to-evaluate involves verifying the limit condition for the function
          \( f(x) = (1-x^2)^k \). The step simplifies the limit expression and concludes
          that for the limit to be finite, \( k - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \), which implies
          \( k = \frac{1}{2} \).


          To determine if this step is valid, we need to check if the simplification
          and the conclusion are logically sound. The step involves the following
          transformations:

          1. Expressing \( (1-x^2)^k \) as \( (1-x)^k (1+x)^k \).

          2. Combining this with \( (1-x)^{-1/2} \) to get \( (1-x)^{k-1/2} (1+x)^k
          \).

          3. Concluding that for the limit to be finite, \( k - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \).


          The transformations are mathematically correct, and the conclusion that
          \( k = \frac{1}{2} \) is valid because the limit \( \lim_{x \to 1^-} (1-x)^{k-1/2}
          (1+x)^k \) will be finite if and only if \( k - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \). This
          is because \( (1-x)^{k-1/2} \) will approach zero as \( x \to 1^- \) unless
          \( k - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \), which ensures the exponent is zero, making the
          term finite.

          The step-to-evaluate is the first step in the reasoning process, where the
          constraints of the problem are clearly stated. The constraints are:

          1. \( f \) is defined on the interval \([1, 3]\).

          2. \( -1 \leq f(x) \leq 1 \) for all \( x \in [1, 3] \).

          3. \(\int_{1}^{3} f(x) \, dx = 0\).


          These constraints are directly derived from the problem statement and are
          essential for understanding the problem. The step does not make any deductions
          or conclusions beyond restating the given information. Therefore, it does

          The step-to-evaluate suggests a strategy to maximize the integral \(\int_{1}^{3}

          is large (near \( x = 1 \)) and negative where \(\frac{1}{x}\) is small
          (near \( x = 3 \)). This strategy is based on the observation that \(\frac{1}{x}\)
          is a decreasing function on the interval \([1, 3]\).


          To determine if this step is valid, we need to check if it logically follows
          from the previous steps and if it is consistent with the constraints given
          in the problem. The previous steps have established the constraints on \(

          The strategy proposed in step 5 is a reasonable approach to maximize the

          align the positive and negative contributions of \( f(x) \) in a way that

          The step-to-evaluate is the initial definition of squarish numbers. It states
          that a positive integer \( n \) is squarish if:

          1. \( n \) is a perfect square.

          2. The distance from \( n \) to the nearest perfect square is a perfect
          square.


          This definition is clear and aligns with the problem statement. It does
          not make any invalid deductions or assumptions. The step is simply restating
          the problem''s definition of squarish numbers, which is necessary to proceed

          Consider the interval between two consecutive perfect squares \( k^2 \)
          and \( (k+1)^2 \). The length of this interval is:

          \[

          (k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1

          \]

          Within this interval, the numbers that are squarish due to the second condition
          are those whose distance to \( k^2 \) or \( (k+1)^2 \) is a perfect square.
          The possible distances are \( 0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots \) up to the largest perfect
          square less than or equal to \( k \).


          ### Analysis:

          1. **Interval Length Calculation**: The calculation of the interval length
          \( (k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1 \) is correct and straightforward.

          2. **Squarish Numbers in the Interval**: The step correctly identifies that

          distance to \( k^2 \) or \( (k+1)^2 \) is a perfect square.

          \[

          \[

          1 \text{ (the perfect square } k^2 \text{)}

          \]

          \[

          2 \text{ for each perfect square distance } 1, 4, 9, \ldots \text{ up to
          the largest perfect square less than or equal to } k.

          \]

          \[

          \text{The number of such perfect squares is approximately } \sqrt{k}. \text{

          \]

          \[

          1 + 2 \times \sqrt{k}

          \]


          1. **Perfect Square \( k^2 \)**: This is correct. There is exactly one perfect
          square in the interval \( [k^2, (k+1)^2 - 1] \), which is \( k^2 \).


          2. **Perfect Square Distances**: The step claims that for each perfect square
          distance \( 1, 4, 9, \ldots \) up to the largest perfect square less than
          or equal to \( k \), there are 2 squarish numbers. This is because for each
          perfect square distance \( d \), there are two numbers \( k^2 + d \) and
          \( (k+1)^2 - d \) that are squarish.


          3. **Number of Perfect Squares**: The step approximates the number of such
          perfect squares as \( \sqrt{k} \). This is a reasonable approximation because
          the largest perfect square less than or equal to \( k \) is \( \lfloor \sqrt{k}
          \rfloor \), and the number of perfect squares up to \( \lfloor \sqrt{k}
          \rfloor \) is indeed \( \lfloor \sqrt{k} \rfloor \), which is approximately
          \( \sqrt{k} \).


          4. **Total Number of Squarish Numbers**: The step concludes that the total
          number of squarish numbers in the interval is \( 1 + 2 \times \sqrt{k} \).
          This is a valid deduction based on the previous points.


          After careful consideration, the step does not make an obviously invalid
          deduction. The reasoning is sound and follows logically from the previous
          steps.

          The step approximates the sum using integrals:

          \[

          \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor \sqrt{N} \rfloor} 1 \approx \sqrt{N}

          This is correct because the sum of 1 from \( k = 1 \) to \( \lfloor \sqrt{N}
          \rfloor \) is simply the number of terms, which is \( \lfloor \sqrt{N} \rfloor
          \). For large \( N \), \( \lfloor \sqrt{N} \rfloor \approx \sqrt{N} \).


          Next, the step approximates:

          \[

          \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor \sqrt{N} \rfloor} 2 \sqrt{k} \approx 2 \int_1^{\sqrt{N}}
          \sqrt{x} \, dx

          \]

          This is a standard technique in asymptotic analysis where sums are approximated
          by integrals. The integral of \( \sqrt{x} \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{N} \) is:

          \[

          \int_1^{\sqrt{N}} \sqrt{x} \, dx = \int_1^{\sqrt{N}} x^{1/2} \, dx = \left[
          \frac{2}{3} x^{3/2} \right]_1^{\sqrt{N}} = \frac{2}{3} (\sqrt{N})^{3/2}
          - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} N^{3/4} - \frac{2}{3}

          \]

          Multiplying by 2 gives:

          To determine if the step-to-evaluate makes an obviously invalid deduction,
          I need to carefully examine the reasoning and the mathematical steps leading
          up to it.


          1. **Step 8**: The expression for \( S(N) \) is derived as \( S(N) \approx
          \sqrt{N} + \frac{4}{3} N^{3/4} \). This is based on the sum of the number
          of squarish numbers in each interval, which is approximated using integrals.


          2. **Step 9**: The step-to-evaluate claims that the dominant term as \(
          N \to \infty \) is \( \frac{4}{3} N^{3/4} \). This is because \( \sqrt{N}
          \) grows slower than \( N^{3/4} \) as \( N \) becomes large.


          3. **Finding the Limit**: The step then sets \( \alpha = \frac{3}{4} \)
          and \( \beta = \frac{4}{3} \) based on the dominant term.


          To check for an invalid deduction:

          - The dominant term \( \frac{4}{3} N^{3/4} \) is indeed correct because
          \( N^{3/4} \) grows faster than \( \sqrt{N} \) as \( N \to \infty \).

          - The limit \( \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{S(N)}{N^\alpha} = \beta \) is correctly
          set with \( \alpha = \frac{3}{4} \) and \( \beta = \frac{4}{3} \).


          There are no obvious logical errors or invalid deductions in this step.
          The reasoning is sound and follows from the previous steps.

          that these numbers are of the form \( 5k + 2 \) for non-negative integers

          To verify this, let''s consider the steps leading up to this claim:

          1. We start with \( 2 \in S \).

          2. Applying condition (c) to \( 2 \) gives \( (2+5)^2 = 49 \in S \).

          3. Applying condition (b) to \( 49 \) gives \( 7 \in S \).

          4. Applying condition (c) to \( 7 \) gives \( (7+5)^2 = 144 \in S \).

          10. Applying condition (c) to \( 22 \) gives \( (22+5)^2 = 729 \in S \).

          from \(\mathcal{P}\) results in a new total sum:

          \[

          \begin{pmatrix} 303 - a \\ 15150 - b \end{pmatrix}

          \]

          For this new total sum to be even, both components must be even. This is
          also a correct statement because the sum of the components must be even
          for the partition to be possible.


          The step then concludes that \(303 - a\) must be even, and \(15150 - b\)
          must be even. This is a valid deduction because:

          - \(303\) is odd, so \(303 - a\) is even if and only if \(a\) is odd.

          - \(15150\) is even, so \(15150 - b\) is even if and only if \(b\) is even.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.

          Let''s carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes an
          obviously invalid deduction.


          The step in question is:

          \[

          \frac{|z_1| + |z_2| + \cdots + |z_{2019}|}{2019} \geq \sqrt[2019]{|z_1 z_2
          \cdots z_{2019}|}.

          \]

          This is a direct application of the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality
          (AM-GM Inequality), which states that for non-negative real numbers \( a_1,
          a_2, \dots, a_n \):

          \[

          \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}.

          \]

          In this case, the magnitudes \( |z_1|, |z_2|, \dots, |z_{2019}| \) are non-negative
          real numbers, and the inequality is applied correctly.


          The next part of the step is:

          \[

          \frac{|z_1| + |z_2| + \cdots + |z_{2019}|}{2019} \geq \sqrt[2019]{\frac{1}{2019}}.

          \]

          This follows from the previous step by substituting the bound for the product
          of the magnitudes of the roots:

          \[

          |z_1 z_2 \cdots z_{2019}| = \frac{b_0}{b_{2019}} \geq \frac{1}{2019}.

          \]

          This substitution is valid because it is derived from the constraints given
          in the problem.


          Therefore, the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction.
          The application of the AM-GM Inequality and the substitution of the bound
          for the product of the magnitudes are both correct and logically sound.

          3. **Step 3**: The first and second derivatives of \( q(x) \) evaluated
          at \( x = 1 \) are zero, which implies \( (x-1)^2 \) and \( (x-1)^3 \) divide

          symbol and the sums of the derivatives.

          showing that \( q^{(n)}(1) = 0 \) for \( n \leq \frac{p-1}{2} \). This is
          correct and follows from the properties of the Legendre symbol and the sums

          5. **Step 5**: The conclusion states that the highest power of \( x-1 \)

          on the pattern established in the previous steps and is consistent with

          The step-to-evaluate is simply a restatement of the problem conditions.
          It does not make any deductions or conclusions; it merely lists the given
          conditions. Therefore, it cannot be considered an invalid deduction because
          it does not deduce anything new or incorrect from the previous steps. The
          step is purely expository and sets the stage for the subsequent reasoning.

          We are given:

          \[ |f''(x)| \leq |g(x)| \]

          \[ |g''(x)| \leq |f(x)| \]


          These inequalities suggest that the derivatives of \( f \) and \( g \) are
          bounded by the values of \( g \) and \( f \), respectively. This implies
          that \( f \) and \( g \) are closely related and their rates of change are
          interdependent.


          To determine if this step is obviously invalid, we need to check if the
          deductions made are logically sound and consistent with the given conditions.
          The step states that the inequalities imply a close relationship and interdependence
          between \( f \) and \( g \). This is a reasonable deduction because the
          inequalities directly relate the derivatives of \( f \) and \( g \) to the
          values of \( g \) and \( f \), respectively.


          There is no obvious logical error or invalid deduction in this step. The

          obviously invalid deduction.


          ### Step 4: Test trigonometric functions

          The step considers \( f(x) = \cos(x) \) and \( g(x) = \sin(x) \) and checks
          if they satisfy the given conditions:

          1. \( f(0) = \cos(0) = 1 > 0 \)

          3. \( |f''(x)| = |\sin(x)| \leq |\sin(x)| = |g(x)| \)

          4. \( |g''(x)| = |\cos(x)| \leq |\cos(x)| = |f(x)| \)


          The step verifies that:

          - \( f(0) > 0 \) is true.

          - \( g(0) = 0 \) is true.

          - \( |f''(x)| = |\sin(x)| \leq |\sin(x)| = |g(x)| \) holds for all \( x
          \).

          - \( |g''(x)| = |\cos(x)| \leq |\cos(x)| = |f(x)| \) holds for all \( x
          \).


          The step does not make any obviously invalid deductions. It correctly checks
          the conditions for the chosen functions and confirms that they satisfy all
          the given conditions.
