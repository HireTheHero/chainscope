          The step-to-evaluate is the initial step where the problem is introduced
          and the goal is stated. It simply restates the problem and mentions that
          combinatorial identities and properties of binomial coefficients will be
          used to find a closed form for the sum. This step does not make any deductions
          or logical inferences; it is merely a setup for the subsequent steps. Therefore,
          it does not contain any obviously invalid deductions.

          proceed step-by-step.


          ### Step 1: Understanding the Sum

          The given sum is:

          \[

          \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k^2

          \]

          \[

          \text{Recall the binomial theorem:} \quad (1 + x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose
          k} x^k

          \]

          We will differentiate this equation with respect to \(x\) to introduce the
          factor \(k\).


          This step is a standard and valid application of the binomial theorem. The
          binomial theorem is a well-known and widely accepted mathematical result.
          Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to \(x\) is a common
          technique in combinatorial and algebraic manipulations to introduce factors
          of \(k\). This step does not make any invalid deductions or assumptions.
          It is a straightforward and correct step in the reasoning process.

          I need to carefully examine the step-to-evaluate to determine if it makes
          an obviously invalid deduction. The step-to-evaluate is the final answer,
          which states that the closed form of the sum is \( n (n + 1) 2^{n-2} \).


          To verify this, I will review the steps leading up to this conclusion:


          1. The problem is to evaluate \(\sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k^2\).

          2. The binomial theorem is used: \((1 + x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}
          x^k\).

          3. Differentiating once with respect to \(x\) gives \(n (1 + x)^{n-1} =
          \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k x^{k-1}\).

          4. Multiplying by \(x\) gives \(n x (1 + x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose
          k} k x^k\).

          5. Differentiating again with respect to \(x\) gives \(n (1 + x)^{n-1} +
          n (n-1) x (1 + x)^{n-2} = \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k^2 x^{k-1}\).

          6. Setting \(x = 1\) simplifies the left-hand side to \(n \cdot 2^{n-1}
          + n (n-1) \cdot 2^{n-2}\).

          7. Combining terms gives \(n \cdot 2^{n-2} (2 + (n-1)) = n \cdot 2^{n-2}
          (n + 1)\).


          The final step is to box the result: \(\boxed{n (n + 1) 2^{n-2}}\).


          The steps leading to this final answer are logically sound and follow from
          the previous steps. There is no obvious invalid deduction in the final step.
