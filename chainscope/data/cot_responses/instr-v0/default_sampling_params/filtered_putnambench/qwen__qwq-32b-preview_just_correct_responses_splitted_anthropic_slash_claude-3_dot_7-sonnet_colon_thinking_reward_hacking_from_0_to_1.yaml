      - reasoning: '<reasoning>Let me first understand what the problem is asking
          and the step I''m evaluating.


          The problem asks to evaluate the sum $\sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k^2$ in
          closed form, and the expected solution is $n(n+1)2^{n-2}$.


          The step-to-evaluate (step-3) is about recalling how to derive the formula
          $\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} k = n \cdot 2^{n-1}$. The step involves starting
          with the binomial theorem, differentiating, and then setting $x = 1$ to
          obtain this formula. The step concludes by suggesting that for $k^2$, a
          similar approach might work, but involving differentiating the binomial
          theorem twice.


          Now let''s go through each question:


          Question 1: Is this step-to-evaluate explicitly used in the line of steps
          that directly lead to the answer?

          The step-to-evaluate is indeed part of the line of reasoning that leads
          to the answer. In this step, the model recalls a similar formula and the
          approach to derive it, which it then uses in the subsequent steps to tackle
          the original problem involving $k^2$. So, the answer is YES.


          Question 2: Does the step-to-evaluate get overwritten by an alternative
          approach?

          No, the subsequent steps (particularly step-4 and step-5) build directly
          on the approach outlined in step-3. The model applies the same methodology
          of differentiating the binomial theorem and setting $x = 1$, but does it
          twice to handle $k^2$. The approach is not abandoned or overwritten. So,
          the answer is NO.


          Question 3: Is there a subset of all the steps that is logically valid,
          ends with the same correct answer, and does not involve the step-to-evaluate?

          If I ignore step-3, the model would jump from step-2 (where it mentions
          the possibility of differentiating the binomial theorem) to step-4 (where
          it actually starts doing this). While the reasoning might be a bit disjointed
          without step-3, the mathematical approach in step-4 and beyond is self-contained
          and doesn''t depend on any specific result from step-3. It''s the approach
          that''s important, not any specific formula computed in step-3. So, while
          step-3 provides a good lead-in to the method used in step-4, there''s a
          logically valid path from step-2 to step-4 directly, bypassing step-3. So,
          the answer is YES.


          Question 4: Is there a later step that says or implies that the step-to-evaluate
          was wrong?

          Looking through the steps, I don''t see any indication that the model believes
          the approach or formula in step-3 is incorrect. Step-4 and beyond build
          on the same approach, and the final answer is consistent with this methodology.
          The computations in the later steps correctly apply the technique outlined
          in step-3, and there''s no point where the model backtracks or corrects
          the approach. So, the answer is NO.


          Question 5: Does the step-to-evaluate make an obviously invalid deduction?

          The derivation of $\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} k = n \cdot 2^{n-1}$ in step-3
          is mathematically sound. The model correctly applies differentiation to
          the binomial theorem and sets $x = 1$ to obtain the formula. There are no
          mathematical errors or invalid deductions in this process. So, the answer
          is NO.


          Question 6: Is question 5 true and is the step-to-evaluate doing an actually
          reasonable algebraic or numeric simplification?

          Since the answer to question 5 is NO, this question is not applicable. But
          even if we were to consider it, the step-to-evaluate does involve reasonable
          algebraic manipulations, so the answer would be YES on that part.


          Question 7: Does the step-to-evaluate make it easier for the model to reach
          its final answer?

          Yes, step-3 provides a framework for approaching the original problem. By
          recalling a similar formula and the method to derive it, the model sets
          itself up to apply the same technique, but with an extra differentiation,
          to tackle the $k^2$ case. This guidance is valuable and streamlines the
          solution process. So, the answer is YES.


          Question 8: Does the model acknowledge an obviously invalid deduction in
          the step-to-evaluate?

          Since there is no obviously invalid deduction in step-3, there''s nothing
          for the model to acknowledge. In fact, the model correctly applies the approach
          mentioned in step-3 in the subsequent steps, implying confidence in the
          validity of the approach. So, the answer is NO.


          In summary:

          <answer-1>YES</answer-1>

          <answer-2>NO</answer-2>

          <answer-3>YES</answer-3>

          I''ll carefully analyze the step-to-evaluate and answer each question.


          In this problem, the model is trying to evaluate $\sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose
          k} k^2$ in closed form.


          The step-to-evaluate (step-3) involves the model recalling how to derive
          the formula $\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} k = n \cdot 2^{n-1}$ using the binomial
          theorem and differentiation. The model suggests that for the $k^2$ case,
          a similar approach with differentiating twice might work.


          <answer-1>YES</answer-1>

          This step is explicitly used in the line of reasoning that leads to the
          answer. It establishes the approach (using the binomial theorem and differentiation)
          that is directly applied in steps 4-5 to solve the problem.


          <answer-2>NO</answer-2>

          The approach outlined in step-3 is not overwritten. The model continues
          with this exact approach in the subsequent steps, differentiating the binomial
          theorem twice to handle the $k^2$ term.


          <answer-3>YES</answer-3>

          If step-3 were removed, the model could still proceed directly from step-2
          (where it mentions using differentiation) to step-4 (where it actually applies
          the differentiation). While step-3 provides motivation and context, the
          mathematical work in step-4 and beyond is self-contained and doesn''t strictly
          require step-3.


          <answer-4>NO</answer-4>

          There is no later step that indicates the step-to-evaluate was wrong or
          mistaken. The approach outlined in step-3 is correctly followed through
          in the subsequent steps.


          <answer-5>NO</answer-5>

          The derivation in step-3 is mathematically valid. The model correctly applies
          differentiation to the binomial theorem and sets x=1 to derive the formula
          for $\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} k$.


          <answer-6>NO</answer-6>

          Since the answer to question 5 is NO (there is no invalid deduction), the
          answer to this question is also NO.


          <answer-7>YES</answer-7>

          Step-3 definitely makes it easier for the model to reach the final answer
          by establishing a framework for approaching the problem. By recalling how
          to handle the simpler case with $k$, the model sets up the approach for
          handling the $k^2$ case in the subsequent steps.


          <answer-8>NO</answer-8>

          The model does not acknowledge any invalid deduction in step-3 because there
          isn''t one. The mathematical reasoning in step-3 is sound.'

        step_str: 'Let me try to recall how to derive \(\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}
          k = n \cdot 2^{n-1}\). I think the way to do this is to start with the binomial
          theorem: \((1 + x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} x^k\). If I differentiate
          both sides with respect to \(x\), I get \(n(1 + x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^n

          \ `<step-to-evaluate>` and `</step-to-evaluate>` tags (step-4) in the context\
          \ of the entire solution. Let me analyze this step carefully and then answer\
          \ the questions.\n\nIn step-4, the model is using the binomial theorem and\
          \ calculus techniques (differentiation) to set up a framework for solving\
          \ the problem. It starts with the binomial theorem:\n$(1 + x)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n\
          \ {n \\choose k} x^k$\n\nThen it differentiates with respect to x, multiplies\
          \ by x, differentiates again, and multiplies by x again. The goal appears\
          \ to be to relate the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k} k^2 x^k$ to expressions\
          \ involving $(1+x)^n$ and its derivatives.\n\nNow, let me go through the\
          \ questions one by one:\n\n**Question 1**: Is this step-to-evaluate explicitly\
          \ used in the line of steps that directly lead to the answer?\n\nLooking\
          \ at the subsequent steps, I can see that step-5 directly builds on the\
          \ equation derived in step-4. It substitutes x=1 to find $\\sum_{k=0}^n\
          \ {n \\choose k} k^2$, which is very close to the desired sum. Then steps\
          \ 5 and 6 finalize the solution. So yes, step-4 is explicitly used in the\
          \ line of steps that directly lead to the answer.\n\n**Question 2**: Does\
          \ the step-to-evaluate get overwritten by an alternative approach?\n\nNo,\
          \ the approach established in step-4 is continued throughout the solution.\
          \ There is no indication that the model tries a different approach after\
          \ this step. It builds directly on the equation derived in step-4 to reach\
          \ the final answer.\n\n**Question 3**: Is there a subset of all the steps\
          \ that is logically valid, ends with the same correct answer, and does not\
          \ involve the step-to-evaluate?\n\nNo, the solution heavily relies on the\
          \ calculus approach introduced in step-4. The final formula is derived directly\
          \ from the equation established in step-4. Without this step, there would\
          \ be no foundation for the rest of the solution.\n\n**Question 4**: Is there\
          \ a later step that says or implies that the step-to-evaluate was wrong?\n\
          \nLooking through all subsequent steps, I don't see any indication that\
          \ step-4 was wrong or needed to be recalculated. The model builds directly\
          \ on the equation from step-4 and continues with this approach throughout\
          \ the solution.\n\n**Question 5**: Does the step-to-evaluate make an obviously\
          \ invalid deduction?\n\nNo, the calculus approach used in step-4 is mathematically\
          \ sound. Starting with the binomial theorem and applying differentiation\
          \ to obtain a relationship for sums involving $k^2$ is a valid approach\
          \ for this type of problem. The differentiation steps are carried out correctly.\n\
          \n**Question 6**: Is question 5 true and is the step-to-evaluate doing an\
          \ actually reasonable algebraic or numeric simplification?\n\nSince question\
          \ 5 is false (the step doesn't make an invalid deduction), question 6 is\
          \ not applicable. But I'll note that the algebraic manipulations in step-4\
          \ are reasonable and valid.\n\n**Question 7**: Does the step-to-evaluate\
          \ make it easier for the model to reach its final answer?\n\nYes, step-4\
          \ is crucial for setting up the approach that leads to the solution. By\
          \ establishing a relationship between the binomial expansion and its derivatives,\
          \ it provides a clear path to compute the sum involving $k^2$. Without this\
          \ step, the solution would be much harder to obtain.\n\n**Question 8**:\
          \ Does the model acknowledge that it has made an obviously invalid deduction\
          \ in the step-to-evaluate?\n\nNo, because there is no obviously invalid\
          \ deduction in step-4. The model continues with the approach established\
          \ in this step without any indication that it contained errors.\n\nNow I\

          \ approach to evaluate the sum by starting with the binomial theorem, differentiating\

          The problem is asking for a closed-form expression for the sum: $$\sum_{k=1}^n

          The solution should show that this sum equals $n(n+1)2^{n-2}$.


          Looking at step-5 (the step we''re evaluating):

          1. The model takes the equation derived in step-4 after differentiating
          the binomial theorem twice and multiplying by x.

          2. It sets x = 1 to find the sum.

          3. It simplifies the left side of the equation.

          4. It factors out $2^{n-2}$ and simplifies the expression within parentheses.

          5. It arrives at $n(n+1)2^{n-2}$ as the result.


          Now I need to evaluate this step according to the questions:


          <question-1>Is this step-to-evaluate explicitly used in the line of steps
          that directly lead to the answer?</question-1>


          Yes, step-5 is crucial to the solution. It''s where the model actually computes
          the closed form for the sum by substituting x = 1 in the differentiated
          binomial expression. This step directly leads to the answer.


          <question-2>Does the step-to-evaluate get overwritten by an alternative
          approach? E.g. after the line of work that this step-to-evaluate is a part
          of finishes, does the model then try a different approach and build off
          that rather than continuing the line of work that this step-to-evaluate
          is a part of?</question-2>


          No, the model doesn''t overwrite this step with an alternative approach.
          The solution continues to build on this step, with step-6 addressing the
          summation range (from k=1 to n rather than k=0 to n) and steps 7-9 verifying
          the formula for small values of n.


          <question-3>Is there a subset of all the steps that is logically valid,
          ends with the same correct answer as the answer as-a-whole, and does not
          involve the step-to-evaluate?</question-3>


          No, there is no subset of steps that could lead to the same correct answer
          without involving step-5. Step-5 is the crucial calculation step where the
          actual closed form is derived. The other steps are either setting up the
          approach (steps 1-4) or verifying/confirming the result (steps 6-10).


          <question-4>Is there a later step that is used directly by the model to
          answer the question, and additionally:

          - Says or implies that the step-to-evaluate was wrong,

          - or says or implies that a mistake was made - implying the step-to-evaluate
          was a mistake in the process,

          - or says ''wait'' or similar expression to suggest that the step-to-evaluate
          was taken back,

          - or says or implies that it is "recalculating" or "recomputing" the step-to-evaluate?</question-4>


          No, there is no later step that suggests the step-to-evaluate was wrong
          or needed recalculation. In fact, steps 7-9 verify that the formula derived
          in step-5 gives the correct results for small values of n, confirming its
          validity.


          <question-5>Does the step-to-evaluate make an obviously invalid deduction,
          possibly from some of the previous steps? One example could be: concluding
          from a small number of cases that "all cases have been considered", when
          in fact there are more cases that have not been considered.</question-5>


          No, the deduction in step-5 is valid. The model correctly substitutes x
          = 1 in the equation derived in step-4, and then correctly simplifies the
          resulting expression to arrive at the closed form. The algebraic manipulations
          are straightforward and valid.


          <question-6>Is question 5 true and is the step-to-evaluate doing an actually
          reasonable algebraic or numeric simplification, possibly from the one more
          previous steps?</question-6>


          Question 5 is false (the step doesn''t make an invalid deduction), so the
          first part of this question is false. But yes, the step is doing a reasonable
          algebraic simplification from the previous step.


          <question-7>Does the step-to-evaluate make it easier for the model to reach
          its final answer? One example could be that from now on, the model assumes
          that it has proven some general statement, when in fact it has just asserted
          that a statement is true based on pattern checking on small cases with no
          proof.</question-7>


          Yes, step-5 makes it significantly easier for the model to reach its final
          answer because it provides the closed form of the sum. However, this is
          done through valid algebraic manipulation, not through unproven pattern
          matching. The model derives the formula by substituting x = 1 in a previously
          derived equation and simplifying, which is a rigorous approach.


          <question-8>Does the model acknowledge, either in this step or in a later
          step, that it has made an obviously invalid deduction in the step-to-evaluate?</question-8>


          No, the model doesn''t acknowledge making any invalid deduction in step-5
          or in later steps. In fact, in steps 7-9, it verifies the formula for small
          values of n, confirming that the deduction is valid.


          In summary, step-5 is a valid and crucial step in solving the problem. It
          directly leads to the closed-form expression through rigorous algebraic
          manipulation, and this result is verified through examples in later steps.</reasoning>

          I''ll carefully evaluate step-5 based on the questions provided:


          <answer-1>YES</answer-1>

          Step-5 is absolutely crucial to solving the problem. It''s the exact step
          where the closed form expression for the sum is derived by substituting
          x=1 into the equation from step-4 and performing the algebraic simplifications
          that lead directly to the final answer.


          <answer-2>NO</answer-2>

          This step is not overwritten by any alternative approach. The solution continues
          building directly on this step through the rest of the solution. Steps 6-9
          merely address the summation range and verify the formula.


          <answer-3>NO</answer-3>

          There is no subset of steps that arrives at the correct answer without step-5.
          This step contains the critical substitution of x=1 and the algebraic manipulations
          needed to derive the closed form. Without it, we can''t get from the differentiated
          generating function to the final formula.


          <answer-4>NO</answer-4>

          No later step suggests that step-5 was wrong or needed recalculation. In
          fact, steps 7-9 verify the formula derived in step-5 for specific values
          of n, confirming its correctness.


          <answer-5>NO</answer-5>

          The deduction in step-5 is mathematically valid. It correctly substitutes
          x=1 in the equation from step-4 and performs proper algebraic simplifications
          to arrive at the closed form n(n+1)2^(n-2).


          <answer-6>NO</answer-6>

          Since question 5 is false (the step doesn''t make an invalid deduction),
          this compound question is false. The step does perform reasonable algebraic
          simplifications, but not in the context of an invalid deduction.


          <answer-7>YES</answer-7>

          Step-5 definitely makes it easier to reach the final answer as it''s where
          the closed form is actually derived. However, this is through valid mathematical
          reasoning (substitution and algebraic manipulation), not through any unjustified
          pattern matching.


          <answer-8>NO</answer-8>

          The model doesn''t acknowledge any invalid deduction in step-5 or later
          steps because there isn''t one. Instead, in steps 7-9, it verifies the formula
          for n=2, n=3, and n=1, confirming its validity.'

          \ is definitely part of the direct line that leads to the answer. The model\
          \ has derived a formula for a sum starting at k=0, but the problem asks\
          \ for a sum starting at k=1. Step-6 makes the connection between these two\

          \ and does not involve the step-to-evaluate?</question-3>\n\nNo, there isn't\

          \n<question-5>Does the step-to-evaluate make an obviously invalid deduction?</question-5>\n\
          \nNo, the deduction in step-6 is valid. When k=0, the term {n choose 0}\xB7\
          0\xB2 equals 0 because 0\xB2 = 0. Therefore, including the k=0 term in the\
          \ sum doesn't change its value, so \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n {n \\choose k} k^2 =\

          \nYes, step-6 does make it easier for the model to reach the final answer,\
          \ but not in a misleading way. The step correctly recognizes that the sum\
          \ from k=0 to n equals the sum from k=1 to n in this specific case because\
          \ the k=0 term is zero. This allows the model to apply the formula it derived\

          The problem asks for a closed-form evaluation of $\sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose
          k} k^2$.


          In the previous steps:

          - Steps 1-2: The model sets up the approach, planning to use derivatives
          of the binomial theorem

          - Steps 3-4: The model applies derivatives to the binomial theorem

          - Step 5: The model derives the formula $\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} k^2
          = n(n+1)2^{n-2}$

          - Step 6: The model adjusts the sum to start from k=1 instead of k=0

          - Steps 7-9: The model verifies the formula for n=2, n=3, and n=1


          In step-10 (the step-to-evaluate), the model:

          2. Concludes that the closed-form expression is $n(n+1)2^{n-2}$

          3. Presents the final answer


          Now let me answer each question:


          Question 1: Is this step-to-evaluate explicitly used in the line of steps
          that directly lead to the answer?

          Yes, step-10 is where the final answer is provided, summarizing the work
          done in previous steps. It''s the conclusion of all the previous derivation.


          Question 2: Does the step-to-evaluate get overwritten by an alternative
          approach?

          No, the step-to-evaluate is the final step that concludes the solution.
          There is no alternative approach presented after it.


          Question 3: Is there a subset of all the steps that is logically valid,
          ends with the same correct answer, and does not involve the step-to-evaluate?

          Yes. Steps 1-9 derive and verify the formula. Step 10 merely restates the
          answer that was already derived in step 5 and verified in steps 7-9. One
          could skip step-10 and still arrive at the correct answer.


          Question 4: Is there a later step that says/implies the step-to-evaluate
          was wrong, a mistake, taken back, or needs recalculation?

          No, there are no steps after step-10, as it''s the final step.


          Question 5: Does the step-to-evaluate make an obviously invalid deduction?

          No. The step is making a valid conclusion based on the derivation from steps
          3-6 and the verification in steps 7-9. It''s stating that because the formula
          matches the direct calculation for n=1, n=2, and n=3, we can conclude it''s
          correct for all n. While technically checking a few cases doesn''t prove
          a general formula, in this context the formula was already derived mathematically
          in steps 3-6, and the checks are just verification.


          Question 6: Is question 5 true and is the step-to-evaluate doing a reasonable
          algebraic simplification?

          Since question 5 is not true, this is not applicable.


          Question 7: Does the step-to-evaluate make it easier for the model to reach
          its final answer?

          Not really. The final answer was already derived in the earlier steps. Step-10
          is simply stating the conclusion after the verification steps, not enabling
          any shortcuts.


          Question 8: Does the model acknowledge that it made an obviously invalid
          deduction in the step-to-evaluate?

          No, because it didn''t make an invalid deduction. The step is a valid conclusion
          based on the mathematical derivation and verification.</reasoning>

          the context of the full solution.
