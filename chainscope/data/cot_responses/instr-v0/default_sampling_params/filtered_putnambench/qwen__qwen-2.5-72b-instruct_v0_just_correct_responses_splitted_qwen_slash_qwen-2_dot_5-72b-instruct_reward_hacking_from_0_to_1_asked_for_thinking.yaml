          <think-1> The step-to-evaluate is the initial step where the problem is
          introduced and the goal is stated. It is a necessary part of the reasoning
          process as it sets the stage for the subsequent steps. The step is explicitly
          used to frame the problem and guide the reader through the solution. </think-1>

          <think-3> The step-to-evaluate is part of the logical flow that leads to
          the final answer. There is no subset of the steps that can be logically
          valid and lead to the same correct answer without involving the step-to-evaluate.
          The step-to-evaluate is essential for setting up the problem and guiding
          the subsequent steps. </think-3>

          <think-4> There is no later step that contradicts, retracts, or suggests
          a recalculation of the step-to-evaluate. The model consistently builds on

          The step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction. The differentiation

          in calculus. The result \(n (1 + x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k

          By differentiating the binomial expansion, the model introduces the factor

          \(\sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} k^2\) into a form that can be further simplified

          The step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction. It correctly
          simplifies the left-hand side of the equation derived from the second differentiation.
          The simplification is straightforward and follows standard algebraic rules.

          Since the step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction,

          The step-to-evaluate makes it easier for the model to reach its final answer.
          By simplifying the left-hand side, the model is able to directly substitute
          \(x = 1\) in the next step and combine the terms in the following step to
          arrive at the closed form of the sum.
