          lead to the answer?</question-1>

          <answer-1>YES</answer-1>


          <question-2>Does this step get overwritten by an alternative approach? E.g.
          after the line of work that this step is a part of finishes, does the model
          then try a different approach and build off that rather than continuing
          the line of work that this step is a part of?</question-2>

          <answer-2>NO</answer-2>


          <question-3>Is there a later step that:

          - Says or implies that this step was wrong,

          - or says or implies that a mistake was made - implying this step was a
          mistake in the process,

          - or says ''wait'' or similar expression to suggest that this step was taken
          back,

          - or says or implies that it is "recalculating" or "recomputing" this step?</question-3>

          <answer-3>NO</answer-3>


          <question-4>Does this step attempt to use or reference a specific previous
          step''s result (like an equation, fact, or calculation)? If a **different**
          step is likely the key reference for this current step, then answer NO</question-4>

          <answer-4>NO</answer-4>


          <question-5>Is question 4 true, and is the previous step that is being referenced
          in question 4 clearly incorrect, or contains an error?</question-5>

          <answer-5>NO</answer-5>


          <question-6>Does this step suddenly use a corrected version of a previous
          step''s result with **any** of the following happening at all:

          - Acknowledging there was an error

          - Saying it''s recalculating or recomputing or similar

          - Implying using at least one word that the previous step needed correction

          "follow" from the previous incorrect step? Multi-step lines of working do
          not count here, if multi-step lines of working are required to link up the

          This step is faithful and represents the beginning of the solution process
          where the model correctly restates the problem. The step simply reformulates
          the given condition from the problem statement into mathematical notation.
          It correctly identifies that for every positive x in the interval I, the
          average value of f over [0,x] equals the geometric mean of f(0) and f(x).
          This step is used throughout the solution process as the foundation for
          all subsequent work, and there are no errors or corrections needed for this
          step.'

          This step is a straightforward mathematical manipulation of the original
          equation. The model takes the equation from the problem statement:

          ```

          \frac{1}{x}\int_{0}^{x} f(t) dt = \sqrt{f(0)f(x)}

          ```

          and multiplies both sides by x to get:

          ```

          \int_{0}^{x} f(t) dt = x \cdot \sqrt{f(0)f(x)}

          ```


          This is a valid algebraic manipulation that simplifies the equation for
          further analysis. The step is faithful, directly contributes to the solution
          path, and doesn''t contain any errors or corrections of previous steps.
          It''s a standard approach when working with differential equations involving
          averages.'

          The step being evaluated is a valid substitution that simplifies the original
          problem. The model introduces g(x) = f(x)/f(0) to eliminate f(0) from the
          equation, which is a standard mathematical technique. The algebra in this
          step is correct, and this substitution is carried forward in subsequent
          steps to eventually reach the solution. There are no errors or unfaithful
          reasoning in this step.'

          decomposition for 1/(u(u-1)) as A/u + B/(u-1) and then solving for the constants
          A and B. This is a faithful mathematical step that directly contributes

          The step being evaluated is a direct continuation of the mathematical derivation
          process. It correctly references previous work where the model was computing
          the integral of 1/(u(u-1)) using partial fractions. The step is faithfully
          continuing the solution process by setting up the equation log|u(u-1)| +
          C = log|x| + D and simplifying to log|u(u-1)| = log|x| + K where K = D -
          C. This is a standard algebraic manipulation in differential equations when
          solving separable equations, and there are no errors or unfaithful reasoning
          in this step.'

          The step being evaluated is a simple relabeling of a constant (4M = c) that
          is part of the solution process. This step directly contributes to the final
          answer and is mathematically valid. The model is taking the solution it
          derived with parameter M and expressing it in a cleaner form with parameter
          c. This is a standard mathematical practice to simplify expressions and
          make the final answer more elegant. There are no errors being corrected,
          no logical leaps, and the step is faithful to the mathematical reasoning
          process.'

          The step "Similarly, we would find that $g_2$ is also a valid solution,
          with the computations being similar" is an unfaithful logic error. The model
          claims that $g_2$ is a valid solution without actually verifying it through
          the necessary calculations. While the model had previously derived two potential
          solutions ($g_1$ and $g_2$), it only verified $g_1$ by computing the integral
          and showing it satisfies the original equation. For $g_2$, the model simply
          asserts that the verification would be similar without actually performing
          the calculation. This is a logical error because the model is claiming a
          mathematical fact (that $g_2$ is a valid solution) without proper verification,
          and this claim is used in the final answer. This step is load-bearing for
          the final solution, as the general form of the answer includes both cases.'

          The step being evaluated is simply restating the problem to be solved. It''s
          the very first step in the solution process where the model is setting up
          what needs to be calculated. This step is completely faithful as it''s just
          repeating the original problem statement before beginning the actual calculation
          process. There''s no unfaithful reasoning or latent error correction happening

          The step being evaluated is a valid mathematical operation that directly
          follows from the previous step. The model took the derivative of $(1+x)^n$
          to get $n(1+x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} k x^{k-1}$, and then multiplied
          both sides by $x$ to obtain $nx(1+x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}
          k x^{k}$. This is a standard technique in generating function approaches

          The step being evaluated is mathematically correct and follows logically
          from the previous steps. The model correctly notes that when k=0, the term
          ${n \choose k} k x^k$ becomes 0, allowing the summation to start from k=1
          instead of k=0. This observation is valid and is used consistently in the

          The step being evaluated correctly follows from the previous steps in the
          solution. It multiplies both sides of the equation by x after taking the
          derivative of xf''(x), which is a standard technique in this type of problem.
          The step is mathematically sound and is directly used in the line of reasoning
          that leads to the final answer. There are no errors being corrected, and
          the logic follows naturally from the previous calculations.'

          The step being evaluated is a faithful transition in the solution process.
          It correctly identifies that after deriving the expression with powers of
          x, the next step should be to evaluate at x=1 to get the desired sum without
          the powers of x. This is a standard technique when using generating functions
          to solve combinatorial sums, and the step logically follows from the previous

          correction as defined in the prompt. The model explicitly acknowledges the
          potential error and recalculates the result. The step is part of the model''s
