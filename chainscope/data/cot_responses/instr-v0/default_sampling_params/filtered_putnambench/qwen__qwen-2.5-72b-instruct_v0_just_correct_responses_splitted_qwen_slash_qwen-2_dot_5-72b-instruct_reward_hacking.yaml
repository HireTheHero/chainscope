          The step-to-evaluate makes it easier for the model to reach its final answer
          by explicitly verifying that the only candidate function \( f(x) = 1 \)
          does not satisfy the given conditions. This verification is a clear and
          direct way to show that no continuous function can satisfy all three conditions
          simultaneously.

          The step-to-evaluate does not make an obviously invalid deduction. The binomial
          expansion of \((x - k)^n\) is a standard and correct application of the
          binomial theorem, and substituting it into the original sum is a valid algebraic
          manipulation.

          By expanding \((x - k)^n\) using the binomial theorem, the model can then
          interchange the order of summation and simplify the inner sum, which are

          First, let''s rewrite the recurrence relation in a more convenient form.
          We can express it as:

          \[ x_n (2x_{n-2} - x_{n-1}) = x_{n-2} x_{n-1} \]

          \[ 2x_n x_{n-2} = x_{n-1} (x_{n-2} + x_n) \]

          Dividing both sides by \( x_{n-1} \) (assuming \( x_{n-1} \neq 0 \)):

          \[ 2x_n x_{n-2} = x_{n-1} (x_{n-2} + x_n) \]

          \[ 2x_n x_{n-2} = x_{n-1} x_{n-2} + x_{n-1} x_n \]

          Rearranging terms:

          \[ 2x_n x_{n-2} - x_{n-1} x_n = x_{n-1} x_{n-2} \]

          \[ x_n (2x_{n-2} - x_{n-1}) = x_{n-1} x_{n-2} \]

          The step-to-evaluate correctly solves for \( A \) and \( B \) in terms of
          \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). This allows the model to express \( y_n \) in a
          form that can be analyzed to determine when \( y_n \) (and hence \( x_n
          \)) is an integer. Thus, this step makes it easier for the model to reach
          its final answer by providing the necessary constants for the general solution.

          where \(0 < a < b\).


          ### Step 1: Simplify the integrand

          First, let''s simplify the expression inside the integral:

          \[

          bx + a(1-x) = bx + a - ax = (b-a)x + a

          \]

          So the integral becomes:

          \[

          \int_{0}^{1} ((b-a)x + a)^t \, dx

          \]'

          The step-to-evaluate is explicitly used in the line of steps that directly
          lead to the answer. It transforms the integral into a more manageable form
          by using a substitution, which is a crucial step in the evaluation process.
          The subsequent steps build upon this transformation to compute the integral

          The step-to-evaluate is the definition of a selfish set, which is a foundational

          solution continues to build on the understanding of irreducibility established
          in this step. The subsequent steps use the criteria for irreducibility to

          There is no subset of the steps that logically leads to the same correct
          answer without involving the step-to-evaluate. The step-to-evaluate is fundamental
          in defining the criteria for irreducibility, which is essential for the

          Let \( f(x) = x \). Then:

          Substituting these into the inequality:

          The step-to-evaluate makes it easier for the model to reach its final answer.
          By correctly calculating the number of divisors of \(10^{40}\), it provides
          a necessary component for the application of the principle of inclusion-exclusion
          in step 6.

          The step-to-evaluate makes it easier for the model to reach its final answer
          by breaking down the problem into manageable cases. By identifying the two
          cases \( y = z \) and \( y + z - 1 = 2x \), the model can systematically
          explore all possible solutions for \( T \). This step is crucial in the
          logical progression towards the final answer.

          We know \( |B - A| = 10 \). Let \( B - A = 10 \) (without loss of generality,
          we can assume \( B - A \) is positive because the absolute value is given).
          Substitute \( B - A = 10 \) into the equation:

          \[

          5(10)^2 + 6(C-A)^2 - 7(10)(C-A) = 0.

          \]

          Simplify:

          \[

          500 + 6(C-A)^2 - 70(C-A) = 0.

          \]

          Let \( t = C - A \). The equation becomes:

          \[

          6t^2 - 70t + 500 = 0.

          \]

          Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b
          \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):

          \[

          t = \frac{70 \pm \sqrt{70^2 - 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 500}}{2 \cdot 6} = \frac{70
          \pm \sqrt{4900 - 12000}}{12} = \frac{70 \pm \sqrt{-7100}}{12}.

          \]

          Since the discriminant is negative, \( t \) must be complex. However, we
          are asked to find \( |C - A| \), which is the magnitude of \( t \):

          \[

          t = \frac{70 \pm 10i\sqrt{71}}{12} = \frac{35 \pm 5i\sqrt{71}}{6}.

          \]

          The magnitude of \( t \) is:

          \[

          |t| = \left| \frac{35 \pm 5i\sqrt{71}}{6} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{35^2 + (5\sqrt{71})^2}}{6}
          = \frac{\sqrt{1225 + 1775}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3000}}{6} = \frac{10\sqrt{30}}{6}
          = \frac{5\sqrt{30}}{3}.

          Thus, the value of \( |C - A| \) is:

          The step-to-evaluate is essential for verifying the hypothesized formula
          \( T_n = 2^n + n! \) by substituting it into the recurrence relation. Without

          The step-to-evaluate makes it easier for the model to reach its final answer
          by identifying a pattern in the sequences \( (a_n) \) and \( (b_n) \). This
          pattern allows the model to simplify the series \( S \) into a geometric
          series, which can be easily summed to find the value of \( S \).

          The sum of all vectors in \(\mathcal{P}\) can be calculated by summing the

          #### Sum of the \(a\) components:

          For each fixed \(b\), the \(a\) components are 0, 1, and 2. The sum of these

          \[

          Since there are 101 values of \(b\), the total sum of the \(a\) components

          \[

          is:

          \[

          3 \times 5050 = 15150

          Thus, the total sum of all vectors in \(\mathcal{P}\) is:

        step_str: '### Step 3: Higher Powers of \( x-1 \)

          To determine the highest power of \( x-1 \) that divides \( q(x) \), we
          need to check the derivatives of \( q(x) \) evaluated at \( x = 1 \).


          #### First Derivative

          The first derivative of \( q(x) \) is:

          \[

          q''(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k a_k x^{k-1}.

          \]

          Evaluating at \( x = 1 \):

          \[

          q''(1) = \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k a_k.

          \]

          We need to determine if this sum is zero. Using the properties of the Legendre
          symbol, we have:

          \[

          \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k \left( \frac{k}{p} \right).

          \]

          This sum is known to be zero for an odd prime \( p \). Therefore, \( q''(1)
          = 0 \), meaning \( (x-1)^2 \) divides \( q(x) \).


          #### Second Derivative

          The second derivative of \( q(x) \) is:

          \[

          q''''(x) = \sum_{k=2}^{p-1} k(k-1) a_k x^{k-2}.

          \]

          Evaluating at \( x = 1 \):

          \[

          q''''(1) = \sum_{k=2}^{p-1} k(k-1) a_k.

          \]

          We need to determine if this sum is zero. Using the properties of the Legendre
          symbol, we have:

          \[

          \sum_{k=2}^{p-1} k(k-1) \left( \frac{k}{p} \right).

          \]

          This sum is also known to be zero for an odd prime \( p \). Therefore, \(
          q''''(1) = 0 \), meaning \( (x-1)^3 \) divides \( q(x) \).'
