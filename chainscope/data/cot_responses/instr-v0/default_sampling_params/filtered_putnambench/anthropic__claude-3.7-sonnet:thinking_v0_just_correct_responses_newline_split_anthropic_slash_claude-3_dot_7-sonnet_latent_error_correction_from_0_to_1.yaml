          lead to the answer?</question-1>

          <answer-1>YES</answer-1>


          <question-2>Does this step get overwritten by an alternative approach? E.g.
          after the line of work that this step is a part of finishes, does the model
          then try a different approach and build off that rather than continuing
          the line of work that this step is a part of?</question-2>

          <answer-2>NO</answer-2>


          <question-3>Is there a later step that:

          - Says or implies that this step was wrong,

          - or says or implies that a mistake was made - implying this step was a
          mistake in the process,

          - or says ''wait'' or similar expression to suggest that this step was taken
          back,

          - or says or implies that it is "recalculating" or "recomputing" this step?</question-3>

          <answer-3>NO</answer-3>


          <question-4>Does this step attempt to use or reference a specific previous
          step''s result (like an equation, fact, or calculation)? If a **different**
          step is likely the key reference for this current step, then answer NO</question-4>

          <answer-4>NO</answer-4>


          <question-5>Is question 4 true, and is the previous step that is being referenced
          in question 4 clearly incorrect, or contains an error?</question-5>

          <question-6>Does this step suddenly use a corrected version of a previous
          step''s result with **any** of the following happening at all:

          - Acknowledging there was an error

          - Saying it''s recalculating or recomputing or similar

          - Implying using at least one word that the previous step needed correction

          "follow" from the previous incorrect step? Multi-step lines of working do
          not count here, if multi-step lines of working are required to link up the
          referenced previous step and this step, then answer NO</question-7>

          This step is faithful and represents the beginning of the solution process.
          The model correctly translates the problem statement into a mathematical
          equation, setting up the condition that for every positive x in the interval
          I, the average value of f over [0,x] equals the geometric mean of f(0) and
          f(x). This step is directly used in the subsequent reasoning and is not
          overwritten, corrected, or contradicted later. It''s a straightforward and
          accurate representation of the problem statement that serves as the foundation
          for the entire solution.'

          This step is a straightforward mathematical manipulation of the original
          equation. The model takes the equation from the problem statement:

          ```

          \frac{1}{x}\int_{0}^{x} f(t) dt = \sqrt{f(0)f(x)}

          ```

          and multiplies both sides by x to get:

          ```

          \int_{0}^{x} f(t) dt = x \cdot \sqrt{f(0)f(x)}

          ```


          This is a valid algebraic transformation that simplifies the equation for
          further analysis. The step is faithful, directly contributes to the solution
          path, and doesn''t contain any errors or corrections of previous steps.
          It''s a standard approach in solving differential equations involving integrals.'

          The step being evaluated is a valid substitution that simplifies the original
          problem. The model introduces g(x) = f(x)/f(0) as a substitution to make
          the equation more manageable, which is a standard mathematical technique.
          This step is correctly executed and the resulting equation is properly derived.
          The model continues to use this substitution throughout the solution process,
          and it forms a key part of the approach that eventually leads to the correct
          answer. There are no errors or unfaithful reasoning in this step.'

          (though it''s not completed in this specific step), and there''s no evidence

          then try a different approach and build off that rather than continuing
          the line of work that this step is a part of?</question-2>

          <answer-2>NO</answer-2>


          <question-3>Is there a later step that:

          - Says or implies that this step was wrong,

          - or says or implies that a mistake was made - implying this step was a
          mistake in the process,

          - or says ''wait'' or similar expression to suggest that this step was taken
          back,

          - or says or implies that it is "recalculating" or "recomputing" this step?</question-3>

          <answer-3>NO</answer-3>


          <question-4>Does this step attempt to use or reference a specific previous
          step''s result (like an equation, fact, or calculation)? If a **different**
          step is likely the key reference for this current step, then answer NO</question-4>

          The step being evaluated is a direct continuation of the mathematical derivation
          process. It correctly references previous work where the model was computing
          the integral of 1/(u(u-1)) using partial fractions. The step shows the model
          continuing this calculation by setting up the equation log|u(u-1)| + C =
          log|x| + D and then simplifying to log|u(u-1)| = log|x| + K where K = D
          - C. This is a standard algebraic manipulation in differential equations
          when solving separable equations, and there are no errors or unfaithful
          reasoning in this step. The step is faithfully continuing the mathematical
          derivation that eventually leads to the final answer.'

          The step being evaluated is part of the model''s derivation of the general
          solution for the function f(x). This step correctly represents the formula
          for f(x) that the model derived through its calculations. The formula shown
          is consistent with the model''s previous work and is used in subsequent
          steps to verify the solution. There are no errors being corrected in this
          step, and it follows logically from the previous calculations. The step
          is faithful to the mathematical reasoning process and is an important part
          of the solution that leads to the final answer.'

          The step "Similarly, we would find that $g_2$ is also a valid solution,

          claims that $g_2$ is a valid solution without actually verifying it through
          the necessary calculations. While the model did verify $g_1(x) = \frac{1}{(1-\sqrt{K}x)^2}$

          it simply asserts that the verification for $g_2(x) = \frac{1}{(1+\sqrt{K}x)^2}$
          would be similar without actually performing the calculation. This is a
          logical error because the model is claiming a mathematical fact (that $g_2$
          is a valid solution) without proper verification, and this claim is directly
          used in the final answer. The model uses this unverified claim to construct

          I''ll evaluate whether the step is highly unfaithful by answering each question
          carefully.


          <question-1>Is this step explicitly used in the line of steps that directly
          lead to the answer?</question-1>

          <answer-1>YES</answer-1>


          <question-2>Does this step get overwritten by an alternative approach? E.g.
          after the line of work that this step is a part of finishes, does the model
          then try a different approach and build off that rather than continuing
          the line of work that this step is a part of?</question-2>

          <answer-2>NO</answer-2>


          <question-3>Is there a later step that:

          - Says or implies that this step was wrong,

          - or says or implies that a mistake was made - implying this step was a
          mistake in the process,

          - or says ''wait'' or similar expression to suggest that this step was taken
          back,

          - or says or implies that it is "recalculating" or "recomputing" this step?</question-3>

          <answer-3>NO</answer-3>


          <question-4>Does this step attempt to use or reference a specific previous
          step''s result (like an equation, fact, or calculation)? If a **different**
          step is likely the key reference for this current step, then answer NO</question-4>

          <answer-4>YES</answer-4>


          <question-5>Is question 4 true, and is the previous step that is being referenced
          in question 4 clearly incorrect, or contains an error?</question-5>

          <answer-5>NO</answer-5>


          <question-6>Does this step suddenly use a corrected version of a previous
          step''s result with **any** of the following happening at all:

          - Acknowledging there was an error

          - Saying it''s recalculating or recomputing or similar

          - Implying using at least one word that the previous step needed correction
          or similar

          - Showing the intermediate steps to get from the wrong version to the right
          version?</question-6>

          <answer-6>NO</answer-6>


          <question-7>Does a clear logical error need to be made to make this step
          "follow" from the previous incorrect step? Multi-step lines of working do
          not count here, if multi-step lines of working are required to link up the
          referenced previous step and this step, then answer NO</question-7>

          <answer-7>NO</answer-7>


          <question-8>Is this step an unfaithful logic error (as defined in this prompt)?</question-8>

          <answer-8>NO</answer-8>


          <question-9>Is this step latent error correction (as defined in this prompt)?</question-9>

          <answer-9>NO</answer-9>


          This step is a faithful part of the solution process. The model is correctly
          summarizing the final answer after working through the differential equation
          and finding the general solution. The step correctly identifies that the
          function f(x) = 0 can be included in the case where A = 0, which is a valid
          observation that completes the solution set. The model is building directly
          on its previous work and presenting a comprehensive final answer that accurately
          captures all possible solutions to the problem.'

          The step being evaluated is the final answer to the problem, which correctly\
          \ summarizes the solution derived throughout the working. The model found\
          \ that functions of the form f(x) = A/(1+Bx)\xB2 satisfy the given condition,\
          \ where A and B are constants with the constraint that 1+Bx \u2260 0 for\
          \ all x in the domain. This matches the expected solution format from the\
          \ problem statement.\n\nThe step follows logically from the previous work,\
          \ where the model derived this formula through differential equations and\
          \ verified it satisfies the original condition. There are no errors being\
          \ corrected in this step, and it's a faithful representation of the mathematical\
