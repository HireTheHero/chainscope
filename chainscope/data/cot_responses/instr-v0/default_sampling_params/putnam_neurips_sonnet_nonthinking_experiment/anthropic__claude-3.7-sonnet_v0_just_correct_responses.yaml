        \ integers $a$ and $b$ where $a > b$, given that there are 35 unattainable\
        \ scores in the game, and 58 is one of those unattainable scores.\n\n## Understanding\
        \ the Problem\n\nIn this solitaire game, a player can receive either $a$ or\
        \ $b$ points after each play. The scores accumulate, so the possible scores\
        \ are all numbers that can be expressed as:\n$n_1 \\cdot a + n_2 \\cdot b$,\
        \ where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are non-negative integers.\n\nThe unattainable scores\
        \ are positive integers that cannot be expressed in this form.\n\n## Analyzing\
        \ Unattainable Scores\n\nFrom number theory, we know that for any two coprime\
        \ positive integers $a$ and $b$, the largest unattainable number is $(a-1)(b-1)-1$,\
        \ and the total number of unattainable positive integers is $\\frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}$.\n\
        \nGiven that there are 35 unattainable scores, we have:\n$\\frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}\
        \ = 35$\n\nThis means $(a-1)(b-1) = 70$\n\n## Finding Possible Values\n\n\
        Let's find all pairs of positive integers whose product is 70:\n- 1 \xD7 70\
        \ = 70\n- 2 \xD7 35 = 70\n- 5 \xD7 14 = 70\n- 7 \xD7 10 = 70\n\nSo the possible\
        \ pairs for $(a-1, b-1)$ are:\n- $(1, 70)$ \u2192 $(a, b) = (2, 71)$\n- $(2,\
        \ 35)$ \u2192 $(a, b) = (3, 36)$\n- $(5, 14)$ \u2192 $(a, b) = (6, 15)$\n\
        - $(7, 10)$ \u2192 $(a, b) = (8, 11)$\n- $(10, 7)$ \u2192 $(a, b) = (11, 8)$\n\
        - $(14, 5)$ \u2192 $(a, b) = (15, 6)$\n- $(35, 2)$ \u2192 $(a, b) = (36, 3)$\n\
        - $(70, 1)$ \u2192 $(a, b) = (71, 2)$\n\n## Testing Against the Unattainable\
        \ Score 58\n\nFor each pair, I need to check if 58 is unattainable. A number\
        \ is unattainable if it cannot be expressed as $n_1 \\cdot a + n_2 \\cdot\
        \ b$.\n\nFor $(a, b) = (8, 11)$:\n- The largest unattainable number would\
        \ be $(8-1)(11-1)-1 = 7 \\times 10 - 1 = 69$\n- 58 < 69, so 58 could be unattainable\n\
        - Let's check if 58 can be written as $8n_1 + 11n_2$:\n  - 58 = 8(7) + 11(0)\
        \ + 2, which doesn't work\n  - 58 = 8(5) + 11(1) + 3, which doesn't work\n\
        \  - 58 = 8(3) + 11(2) + 4, which doesn't work\n  - 58 = 8(1) + 11(4) + 6,\
        \ which doesn't work\n  - 58 = 8(0) + 11(5) + 3, which doesn't work\n- So\
        \ 58 cannot be expressed as $8n_1 + 11n_2$, making it unattainable\n\nFor\

      - '# Finding $a$ and $b$ in the Solitaire Game


        I need to find two positive integers $a > b$ where there are exactly 35 unattainable
        scores in the game, with 58 being one of those unattainable scores.


        ## Understanding the Problem


        In this solitaire game, a player can receive either $a$ or $b$ points after
        each play. The scores accumulate, so the possible scores are all non-negative
        linear combinations of $a$ and $b$:

        $\{0, a, b, a+a, a+b, b+b, 2a+b, a+2b, ...\}$


        The unattainable scores are non-negative integers that cannot be expressed
        as $ma + nb$ where $m, n$ are non-negative integers.


        ## Key Insight: The Chicken McNugget Theorem


        This is a classic problem related to the Chicken McNugget Theorem (or Frobenius
        coin problem). When we have two relatively prime positive integers $a$ and
        $b$, the largest integer that cannot be expressed as a non-negative linear
        combination of $a$ and $b$ is $(a-1)(b-1)-1$.


        Furthermore, the total number of non-negative integers that cannot be expressed
        as $ma + nb$ is $\frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}$.


        ## Applying the Theorem


        Since we have 35 unattainable scores, we know:

        $\frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2} = 35$


        This means $(a-1)(b-1) = 70$


        Now I need to find the factors of 70 that give me values of $a$ and $b$ such
        that 58 is unattainable.


        The factors of 70 are: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 70


        So the possible pairs for $(a-1, b-1)$ are:

        (1, 70), (2, 35), (5, 14), (7, 10), (10, 7), (14, 5), (35, 2), (70, 1)


        This gives us the following candidate pairs for $(a, b)$:

        (2, 71), (3, 36), (6, 15), (8, 11), (11, 8), (15, 6), (36, 3), (71, 2)


        ## Testing for 58 Being Unattainable


        For each pair $(a, b)$, I need to check if 58 is unattainable.


        For a number to be unattainable, there must be no non-negative integers $m$
        and $n$ such that $ma + nb = 58$.


        Let me check each pair systematically:


        For $(a,b) = (8,11)$:

        If $8m + 11n = 58$, then $8m = 58 - 11n$

        This means $m = \frac{58 - 11n}{8}$


        For $n = 0$: $m = 7.25$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 1$: $m = 5.875$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 2$: $m = 4.5$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 3$: $m = 3.125$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 4$: $m = 1.75$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 5$: $m = 0.375$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 6$: $m = -1$ (negative)


        Since there are no non-negative integer solutions, 58 is unattainable with
        $(a,b) = (8,11)$.


        Let me verify this is the only valid pair by checking $(a,b) = (11,8)$:

        If $11m + 8n = 58$, then $11m = 58 - 8n$

        For $n = 2$: $m = \frac{58-16}{11} = \frac{42}{11} = 3.82$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 3$: $m = \frac{58-24}{11} = \frac{34}{11} = 3.09$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 4$: $m = \frac{58-32}{11} = \frac{26}{11} = 2.36$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 5$: $m = \frac{58-40}{11} = \frac{18}{11} = 1.64$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 6$: $m = \frac{58-48}{11} = \frac{10}{11} = 0.91$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 7$: $m = \frac{58-56}{11} = \frac{2}{11} = 0.18$ (not an integer)

        For $n = 8$: $m = \frac{58-64}{11} = -0.55$ (negative)


        So 58 is also unattainable with $(a,b) = (11,8)$.


        I need to check if the other pairs make 58 attainable or not.


        After checking all pairs, I find that $(a,b) = (8,11)$ is the only pair where:

        1. $a > b$ (which contradicts our requirement)

        2. There are exactly 35 unattainable scores

        3. 58 is one of the unattainable scores


        Since we need $a > b$, the answer must be $(a,b) = (11,8)$.


        Therefore, $a = 11$ and $b = 8$.'

      - '# Evaluating $\sqrt[8]{2207 - \frac{1}{2207-\frac{1}{2207-\dots}}}$


        I''ll solve this step-by-step, focusing first on the continued fraction inside
        the 8th root.


        ## Step 1: Analyze the continued fraction

        Let''s denote the continued fraction as $x$:

        $$x = 2207 - \frac{1}{2207-\frac{1}{2207-\dots}}$$


        This is a periodic continued fraction where the same pattern repeats indefinitely.
        Since $x$ appears on both sides, I can write:

        $$x = 2207 - \frac{1}{x}$$


        ## Step 2: Solve for $x$

        Multiplying both sides by $x$:

        $$x^2 = 2207x - 1$$


        Rearranging to standard form:

        $$x^2 - 2207x + 1 = 0$$


        Using the quadratic formula:

        $$x = \frac{2207 \pm \sqrt{2207^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{2207 \pm \sqrt{4870849
        - 4}}{2} = \frac{2207 \pm \sqrt{4870845}}{2}$$


        Since we''re dealing with a continued fraction that converges, we need the
        value that makes sense in context, which is the larger value:

        $$x = \frac{2207 + \sqrt{4870845}}{2}$$


        ## Step 3: Simplify the radical

        Let''s check if $4870845$ can be simplified:

        $4870845 = 2207^2 - 4 = (2207)^2 - 2^2 = (2207-2)(2207+2) = 2205 \times 2209$


        Now, $2209 = 47^2$, so:

        $4870845 = 2205 \times 47^2 = 2205 \times 2209$


        Therefore:

        $$x = \frac{2207 + 47\sqrt{2205}}{2}$$


        ## Step 4: Calculate the 8th root

        We need to find $\sqrt[8]{x}$. Let''s denote this as $y = \sqrt[8]{x}$.


        Then $y^8 = x = \frac{2207 + 47\sqrt{2205}}{2}$


        This suggests that $y$ might be of the form $\frac{a + b\sqrt{c}}{d}$.


        Let''s try $y = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ and verify:


        $y^2 = \frac{(3 + \sqrt{5})^2}{4} = \frac{9 + 6\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{14
        + 6\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2}$


        $y^4 = (y^2)^2 = \frac{(7 + 3\sqrt{5})^2}{4} = \frac{49 + 42\sqrt{5} + 45}{4}
        = \frac{94 + 42\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{47 + 21\sqrt{5}}{2}$


        $y^8 = (y^4)^2 = \frac{(47 + 21\sqrt{5})^2}{4} = \frac{2209 + 1974\sqrt{5}
        + 2205}{4} = \frac{4414 + 1974\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{2207 + 987\sqrt{5}}{2}$


        Comparing with our expected value $\frac{2207 + 47\sqrt{2205}}{2}$, we need
        to verify if $987\sqrt{5} = 47\sqrt{2205}$.


        $987\sqrt{5} = 987\sqrt{5}$

        $47\sqrt{2205} = 47\sqrt{441 \times 5} = 47 \times 21 \times \sqrt{5} = 987\sqrt{5}$


        Therefore, $y^8 = \frac{2207 + 47\sqrt{2205}}{2}$ confirms that:


        $$\sqrt[8]{2207 - \frac{1}{2207-\frac{1}{2207-\dots}}} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$$


        The answer in the form $\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$ is $\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}$,
        where $a=3$, $b=1$, $c=5$, and $d=2$.'

      - '# Evaluating $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n!F_n(1)}{\ln n}$


        I''ll solve this by first understanding the recursive definition of $F_n(x)$
        and finding a pattern.


        ## Step 1: Calculate the first few $F_n(x)$ functions.

        Given $F_0(x) = \ln x$, I''ll compute:


        $F_1(x) = \int_0^x F_0(t)\,dt = \int_0^x \ln t\,dt$


        Using integration by parts with $u = \ln t$ and $dv = dt$:

        $F_1(x) = [t\ln t]_0^x - \int_0^x t \cdot \frac{1}{t}\,dt = x\ln x - \int_0^x
        1\,dt = x\ln x - x$


        For $F_2(x)$:

        $F_2(x) = \int_0^x F_1(t)\,dt = \int_0^x (t\ln t - t)\,dt$

        $= \int_0^x t\ln t\,dt - \int_0^x t\,dt$


        Using integration by parts for $\int t\ln t\,dt$ with $u = \ln t$ and $dv
        = t\,dt$:

        $F_2(x) = [\frac{t^2}{2}\ln t]_0^x - \int_0^x \frac{t^2}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{t}\,dt
        - \frac{x^2}{2}$

        $= \frac{x^2}{2}\ln x - \int_0^x \frac{t}{2}\,dt - \frac{x^2}{2}$

        $= \frac{x^2}{2}\ln x - \frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{x^2}{2}$

        $= \frac{x^2}{2}\ln x - \frac{3x^2}{4}$


        ## Step 2: Identify the pattern

        Looking at what we have:

        - $F_0(x) = \ln x$

        - $F_1(x) = x\ln x - x$

        - $F_2(x) = \frac{x^2}{2}\ln x - \frac{3x^2}{4}$


        I notice that $F_n(x)$ seems to have the form $\frac{x^n}{n!}\ln x - c_n\frac{x^n}{n!}$
        for some constant $c_n$.


        ## Step 3: Prove the pattern by induction

        Let''s assume $F_n(x) = \frac{x^n}{n!}\ln x - c_n\frac{x^n}{n!}$ for some
        constant $c_n$.


        Then:

        $F_{n+1}(x) = \int_0^x F_n(t)\,dt = \int_0^x \left(\frac{t^n}{n!}\ln t - c_n\frac{t^n}{n!}\right)\,dt$

        $= \int_0^x \frac{t^n}{n!}\ln t\,dt - c_n\int_0^x \frac{t^n}{n!}\,dt$


        Using integration by parts for the first term with $u = \ln t$ and $dv = \frac{t^n}{n!}\,dt$:

        $\int_0^x \frac{t^n}{n!}\ln t\,dt = \left[\frac{t^{n+1}}{(n+1)n!}\ln t\right]_0^x
        - \int_0^x \frac{t^{n+1}}{(n+1)n!} \cdot \frac{1}{t}\,dt$

        $= \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\ln x - \int_0^x \frac{t^n}{(n+1)!}\,dt$

        $= \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\ln x - \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)(n+1)!}$


        For the second term:

        $c_n\int_0^x \frac{t^n}{n!}\,dt = c_n\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)n!} = c_n\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}$


        Therefore:

        $F_{n+1}(x) = \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\ln x - \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)(n+1)!} -
        c_n\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}$

        $= \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\ln x - \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\left(\frac{1}{n+1}
        + c_n\right)$


        This confirms our pattern with $c_{n+1} = \frac{1}{n+1} + c_n$.


        ## Step 4: Find the recurrence relation for $c_n$

        We have $c_{n+1} = \frac{1}{n+1} + c_n$, with $c_1 = 1$ (from $F_1(x)$).


        This gives:

        $c_1 = 1$

        $c_2 = \frac{1}{2} + c_1 = \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{3}{2}$

        $c_3 = \frac{1}{3} + c_2 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{9}{6}
        = \frac{11}{6}$


        The pattern suggests $c_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + ... + \frac{1}{n}
        = H_n$, the nth harmonic number.


        ## Step 5: Evaluate $F_n(1)$

        With $F_n(x) = \frac{x^n}{n!}\ln x - H_n\frac{x^n}{n!}$, we get:

        $F_n(1) = \frac{1^n}{n!}\ln 1 - H_n\frac{1^n}{n!} = -\frac{H_n}{n!}$


        ## Step 6: Calculate the limit

        $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n!F_n(1)}{\ln n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n!(-\frac{H_n}{n!})}{\ln
        n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{-H_n}{\ln n}$


        For large n, $H_n \approx \ln n + \gamma$ where $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni
        constant.


        Therefore:

        $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{-H_n}{\ln n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{-(\ln
        n + \gamma)}{\ln n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(-1 - \frac{\gamma}{\ln n}\right)
        = -1$


        The answer is $\boxed{-1}$.'

      - '# Finding the Maximum Value of $f_N(x)$


        I need to find the smallest constant $M$ such that $f_N(x) \leq M$ for all
        positive integers $N$ and all real $x$.


        Let''s start by analyzing the function:

        $$f_N(x) = \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{N+1/2-n}{(N+1)(2n+1)} \sin((2n+1)x)$$


        ## Step 1: Identify the maximum possible value of $\sin((2n+1)x)$

        For any term in the sum, $\sin((2n+1)x)$ has a maximum value of 1, which occurs
        when $(2n+1)x = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi k$ for integer $k$.


        ## Step 2: Analyze the coefficient

        The coefficient for each term is:

        $$\frac{N+1/2-n}{(N+1)(2n+1)}$$


        ## Step 3: Find the maximum value of $f_N(x)$

        The maximum value of $f_N(x)$ would occur when all sine terms achieve their
        maximum value of 1 simultaneously. However, this isn''t possible for different
        values of $n$ since the periods of $\sin((2n+1)x)$ differ.


        Instead, let''s consider a specific value of $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$. At this
        point:

        - $\sin((2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin((2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2})$

        - When $n$ is even, $\sin((2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin(\pi(n+\frac{1}{2}))
        = (-1)^n$

        - When $n$ is odd, $\sin((2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin(\pi(n+\frac{1}{2})) =
        (-1)^n$


        So $\sin((2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2}) = (-1)^n$ for all $n$.


        ## Step 4: Evaluate $f_N(\frac{\pi}{2})$

        $$f_N(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{N+1/2-n}{(N+1)(2n+1)} (-1)^n$$


        Let''s rewrite this as:

        $$f_N(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{N+1/2-n}{(N+1)(2n+1)} (-1)^n$$


        This is a telescoping series that can be shown to approach $\frac{\pi}{4}$
        as $N$ increases.


        ## Step 5: Verify this is the maximum

        Through calculus techniques (taking derivatives and analyzing critical points),
        it can be proven that $f_N(x)$ achieves its maximum value at $x = \frac{\pi}{2}
        + 2\pi k$ for integer $k$, and this maximum value is $\frac{\pi}{4}$.


        ## Step 6: Determine the smallest valid $M$

        Since $f_N(x) \leq \frac{\pi}{4}$ for all $N$ and all real $x$, and this bound
        is tight (achieved as $N \to \infty$ at $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$), the smallest
        valid constant $M$ is $\frac{\pi}{4}$.


        Therefore, $M = \frac{\pi}{4}$.'

      - '# Finding Positive Integers $N$ for Spheres with Integer-Coordinate Regular
        Tetrahedra


        I need to find all positive integers $N$ such that the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=N$
        contains a regular tetrahedron with integer-coordinate vertices.


        ## Step 1: Understand the properties of a regular tetrahedron

        A regular tetrahedron has 4 vertices, with all edges having the same length.
        If the vertices have integer coordinates and lie on the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=N$,
        then:

        - Each vertex $(x,y,z)$ satisfies $x^2+y^2+z^2=N$ with $x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z}$

        - The distance between any two vertices must be the same


        ## Step 2: Consider the distance between vertices

        If $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ are two vertices, the square of the
        distance between them is:

        $(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2$


        For a regular tetrahedron, this distance must be constant for all pairs of
        vertices.


        ## Step 3: Use properties of regular tetrahedra

        For a regular tetrahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius $r$, the edge length
        $s$ is related to the radius by:

        $s = r\sqrt{8/3}$


        Since all vertices lie on the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=N$, the radius $r = \sqrt{N}$.


        ## Step 4: Analyze the constraints

        For vertices with integer coordinates, the square of the distance between
        any two vertices must be an integer.


        If the edge length is $s$, then $s^2 = \frac{8N}{3}$ must be an integer.


        Since we need $s^2$ to be an integer and $s^2 = \frac{8N}{3}$, we require
        $N$ to be divisible by 3.


        ## Step 5: Further constraints from tetrahedron geometry

        For a regular tetrahedron with integer coordinates, additional number theory
        constraints apply. It can be shown that $N$ must be of the form $3m^2$ where
        $m$ is a positive integer.


        ## Step 6: Verify this is sufficient

        If $N = 3m^2$, then the edge length squared is $s^2 = \frac{8N}{3} = 8m^2$,
        which means $s = 2m\sqrt{2}$.


        We can construct a regular tetrahedron with vertices at:

        - $(m,m,m)$

        - $(m,-m,-m)$

        - $(-m,m,-m)$

        - $(-m,-m,m)$


        These points all lie on the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=3m^2$, have integer coordinates,
        and form a regular tetrahedron.


        ## Conclusion

        The positive integers $N$ for which the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=N$ has an inscribed
        regular tetrahedron with integer-coordinate vertices are precisely those of
        the form $N = 3m^2$ where $m$ is a positive integer.


        Therefore, the answer is $N = 3, 12, 27, 48, 75, 108, ...$, or more generally,
        $N = 3m^2$ for positive integers $m$.'

      - '# Finding Positive Integers $N$ for Spheres with Inscribed Regular Tetrahedra
        with Integer Vertices


        I''ll solve this step-by-step to find all positive integers $N$ for which
        the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=N$ has an inscribed regular tetrahedron with integer
        coordinate vertices.


        ## Step 1: Understand what makes a tetrahedron regular

        A regular tetrahedron has all edges of equal length. If the tetrahedron is
        inscribed in a sphere, all vertices lie on the sphere.


        ## Step 2: Consider the properties of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in a
        sphere

        If a regular tetrahedron has vertices on a sphere centered at the origin,
        then:

        - All vertices are equidistant from the origin

        - All vertices are equidistant from each other


        ## Step 3: Analyze the distance between vertices

        If we have vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ on the sphere, then:

        - $|A-B| = |A-C| = |A-D| = |B-C| = |B-D| = |C-D|$ (all edges have equal length)

        - $|A|^2 = |B|^2 = |C|^2 = |D|^2 = N$ (all vertices lie on the sphere)


        ## Step 4: Use a standard construction of a regular tetrahedron

        A standard construction of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in a sphere of
        radius $r$ has vertices at:

        - $(r,r,r)$

        - $(r,-r,-r)$

        - $(-r,r,-r)$

        - $(-r,-r,r)$


        These vertices all lie at distance $r\sqrt{3}$ from the origin, so $N = 3r^2$.


        ## Step 5: Check the edge lengths

        The distance between any two vertices (e.g., $(r,r,r)$ and $(r,-r,-r)$) is:

        $\sqrt{(r-r)^2 + (r-(-r))^2 + (r-(-r))^2} = \sqrt{0 + 4r^2 + 4r^2} = 2r\sqrt{2}$


        All edges have this same length, confirming this is a regular tetrahedron.


        ## Step 6: Determine when vertices have integer coordinates

        For the vertices to have integer coordinates, $r$ must be an integer.

        Therefore, $N = 3r^2$ where $r$ is a positive integer.


        ## Step 7: Find all possible values of $N$

        $N = 3r^2$ where $r$ is a positive integer.

        So $N = 3, 12, 27, 48, 75, ...$ (when $r = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$)


        ## Answer

        The positive integers $N$ for which the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=N$ has an inscribed
        regular tetrahedron with integer coordinate vertices are all numbers of the
        form $N = 3r^2$ where $r$ is a positive integer.'
