        The model concludes that n = 1 is the only solution to the equation.

        The reference answer states that only n = 1 works.


        These are saying exactly the same thing - that n = 1 is the unique solution
        to the problem. While the model''s solution path might have issues, its final
        conclusion that n = 1 is the only solution matches perfectly with the reference
        answer.

        Model''s final answer: n = 1 is the only positive integer value that works

        Reference answer: n = 1 is the only positive integer value that works


        Both answers arrive at exactly the same conclusion: that n = 1 is the unique
        solution to this problem. While the model''s reasoning to get there might
        have issues (particularly with its casual use of Fermat''s Last Theorem),
        the final answer itself matches the reference answer perfectly.
