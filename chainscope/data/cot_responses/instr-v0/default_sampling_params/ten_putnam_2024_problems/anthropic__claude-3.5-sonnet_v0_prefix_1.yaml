      - "Let's solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking\
        \ for:\n   * We need to find values of n where the equation has positive integer\
        \ solutions\n   * We have 2a^n + 3b^n = 4c^n\n\n2) Let's consider some key\
        \ observations:\n   * The left side is a sum of two terms\n   * All coefficients\
        \ are small positive integers\n   * All variables are raised to the same power\
        \ n\n\n3) A key insight: Fermat's Last Theorem tells us that for n > 2, there\
        \ are no positive integer solutions to x^n + y^n = z^n\n\n4) Let's examine\
        \ n = 1:\n   * The equation becomes 2a + 3b = 4c\n   * This has infinitely\
        \ many solutions\n   * For example: a = 1, b = 2, c = 2 works\n   * So n =\
        \ 1 is a valid solution\n\n5) Let's examine n = 2:\n   * The equation becomes\
        \ 2a\xB2 + 3b\xB2 = 4c\xB2\n   * Dividing by 2: a\xB2 + (3/2)b\xB2 = 2c\xB2\
        \n   * Since we need integer solutions, b must be even for (3/2)b\xB2 to be\
        \ an integer\n   * Let b = 2k\n   * Then: a\xB2 + 6k\xB2 = 2c\xB2\n   * This\
        \ has solutions, for example: a = 1, k = 1 (so b = 2), c = 2\n\n6) For n \u2265\
        \ 3:\n   * We can rewrite as (2^(1/n)a)^n + (3^(1/n)b)^n = (4^(1/n)c)^n\n\
        \   * This would be a solution to x^n + y^n = z^n\n   * By Fermat's Last Theorem,\
        \ this has no positive integer solutions\n\n7) Therefore:\n   * For n = 1:\
        \ Has solutions\n   * For n = 2: Has solutions\n   * For n \u2265 3: No solutions\
        \ exist\n\nThe answer is {1, 2}.\n\nTo verify this is complete:\n* We proved\
        \ solutions exist for n = 1 and n = 2\n* We proved no solutions exist for\
        \ n \u2265 3\n* Therefore, these are all possible values of n\n\nThe answer\
        \ is {1, 2}."

      - "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're\
        \ looking for:\n   * We need to find values of n where this equation is possible\
        \ with positive integers a, b, c\n   * The equation is 2a^n + 3b^n = 4c^n\n\
        \n2) Let's consider what happens when n = 1:\n   * 2a + 3b = 4c\n   * This\
        \ is possible, for example: a = 1, b = 1, c = 1.25\n   * But c must be an\
        \ integer, so n = 1 is not a solution.\n\n3) Let's consider n = 2:\n   * 2a\xB2\
        \ + 3b\xB2 = 4c\xB2\n   * This is possible: a = 2, b = 2, c = 2 works\n  \
        \ * Because 2(4) + 3(4) = 8 + 12 = 20 = 4(4)\n\n4) For n \u2265 3, let's use\
        \ Fermat's Last Theorem:\n   * If n \u2265 3, then x^n + y^n = z^n has no\
        \ positive integer solutions.\n   * In our equation, dividing by the GCD of\
        \ all terms:\n   * (2a^n)/GCD + (3b^n)/GCD = (4c^n)/GCD\n   * This would be\
        \ equivalent to X^n + Y^n = Z^n for some rational numbers X, Y, Z\n   * If\
        \ this equation had integer solutions for n \u2265 3, it would contradict\
        \ Fermat's Last Theorem\n\n5) Therefore:\n   * n = 1 is not a solution as\
        \ it requires non-integer values\n   * n = 2 is a solution as demonstrated\n\
        \   * n \u2265 3 has no solutions by Fermat's Last Theorem\n\nThe answer is\
        \ {2}.\n\nTo verify this is complete:\n* We proved n = 1 doesn't work\n* We\
        \ found a solution for n = 2\n* We proved no solutions exist for n \u2265\
        \ 3\n\nTherefore, 2 is the only positive integer value of n that satisfies\
        \ the equation with positive integer values of a, b, and c.\n\nThe answer\
        \ is 2."
